1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
So something interesting happened today.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,560
A little piece of me dies every time I hear

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,680
someone pronounce gif as jif.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,720
And so Jif Peanut Butter has actually teamed up with Giphy

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,120
to help settle the debate once and for all

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,120
and has created a Jif can or container

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,480
for their peanut butter.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,600
And you can actually order that on Amazon now.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,880
This is an attack on me.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,760
This is absolutely an attack on me.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,120
Oh, hey friends, you did it.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,120
You got the right show.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,640
Welcome into the Unplugged program.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,480
My name is Chris.

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,400
My name is Wes.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,280
Wes 342, it's gonna blow the doors off.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,320
Might be our best yet.

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,560
You know what I love?

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,400
SSH.

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,240
Me too.

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,080
Who doesn't?

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,900
Right?

23
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,080
And our guest, Jeremy, will join us in a little bit

24
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,840
to show us some things you never knew SSH could do.

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,040
At a scale which blows my mind,

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,840
there's things in there that are just gonna maybe change

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,040
the way you think about SSH,

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,320
but potentially change the way you log into your systems

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,400
in the future.

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,000
It's a real cool, really, really cool chat we had.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,480
So he'll join us in a little bit,

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,480
but we also have our standard affair of community news,

33
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,960
some pics, some followup, and a lot more,

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,080
like our virtual lug.

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,640
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,480
Hello.

37
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,320
Hello.

38
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,140
Hello.

39
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,980
Happy Thanksgiving.

40
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,820
Woo!

41
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,640
Listen to that.

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,840
That is a lot of people.

43
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,720
That is a great turnout.

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,960
Wimpy, it's great to see you again.

45
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,440
Welcome back to the Unplugged Show.

46
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,280
Hello again.

47
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,320
Hello to everybody.

48
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,080
Normally, when we have a great turnout like this,

49
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,560
I'd read the names out, but there's so many in there.

50
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,480
It's just not possible.

51
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,920
So great to see so many of you.

52
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,880
I really, today is one of those days

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,400
where it's great to have friends,

54
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,320
and there is an aspect of lugs

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,480
that we don't talk about a lot,

56
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,080
and sometimes it can be a bit of a support group

57
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,480
where it's where everybody knows your name,

58
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,020
and it's just what you need,

59
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,440
and today is one of those days for me.

60
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,680
We'll get into that in a little bit.

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,440
I have something I need to update everybody on,

62
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,780
but in the meantime,

63
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,400
you guys are making all the difference for me today.

64
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,220
I really appreciate that you're here.

65
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,960
So if you'd like to participate in our virtual lug,

66
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,520
please do, because it's just getting better

67
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
and better all the time.

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,640
We do have the new time,

69
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,960
which will throw some people off,

70
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,220
but I think it's worth it.

71
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,060
What do you say, Wes?

72
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,400
Should we start with some great community news?

73
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,720
Yeah, we've got a lot to get into.

74
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,720
Super excited to get the announcement out

75
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,400
for the old Manjaro project.

76
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,080
Version 19 of Manjaro is out,

77
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,120
and of course, in there is tasty updates

78
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,540
to the different desktop environments,

79
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,040
as well as, I haven't tried this yet.

80
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,120
I was thinking about trying to get the old upgrade in

81
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,440
before we started.

82
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,580
Of course you were.

83
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,120
Still loving it on the ThinkPad,

84
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,720
but I just thought, you know what?

85
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,120
I got a lot going on today.

86
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,520
Today is not that day,

87
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,360
but I believe in there now,

88
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,200
and maybe actually Wim, but you may know,

89
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,080
I believe in there now,

90
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,320
they have really smooth integration

91
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,360
for snaps and flat packs,

92
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,440
like just the old double click,

93
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,720
and it launches right up and gets installed.

94
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Yeah, this is, I can't speak to the flat packs.

95
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,920
I don't know what the extent of the work is there,

96
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,600
but knowing the attention to detail,

97
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,160
Phil and team have shown snaps,

98
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,320
I expect that both enjoy first-class support there now.

99
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,720
I've had a chat with Phil.

100
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,960
He's been showing me some of the development

101
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,120
as it's been going along,

102
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,320
and yeah, they've got all of the packages available

103
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,120
side-by-side, so you can take your pick

104
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,600
where you need to take a pick.

105
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,760
You know what I noticed, Wes?

106
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,400
They're using the LTS kernel.

107
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,240
Hmm.

108
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,060
That's a good idea.

109
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,900
Huh.

110
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,740
Wonder why we didn't think of that.

111
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,920
There's a good reason for that.

112
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,340
I wonder, you know, we actually,

113
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,040
Wes and I don't have the LTS kernel installed

114
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,800
on our Archbox right now,

115
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,360
and we, for the life of us, can't quite remember why,

116
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,000
other than we just felt like being dumb.

117
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,960
Like, I think we had the conversation,

118
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
and I think it went something like,

119
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,800
ah, screw it, let's see how far we can push this thing.

120
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,240
And it's been great for the show.

121
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,120
Why do they use the LTS kernel?

122
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,340
It must be for drivers or something, right?

123
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,200
Yeah, well, I know one of the reasons

124
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,320
is the fact that the Nvidia 390 kernel

125
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,640
is not compatible with anything newer than the 54 kernel,

126
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,760
so I think it's there so that people

127
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,920
that have got older generations Nvidia cards

128
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,240
have still got a support root there on an LTS kernel.

129
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,100
I think an LTS kernel is a pretty solid idea

130
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,480
on a rolling distro.

131
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,760
I'm a big fan after last week.

132
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,720
All right, well, there was a story

133
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,880
that I think we've all been,

134
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,880
I'm wondering if you can guess what it is, Wes.

135
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,560
There's a story out there that we have been led to believe

136
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,160
we'd have an update that caused inconvenience

137
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,840
for a bunch of enthusiastic purchasers,

138
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,800
and we now have a resolution and an update.

139
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,720
I'm trying to make it cryptic

140
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,340
because I don't want to give it away,

141
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,840
but Wes Payne, one guess.

142
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,520
The Raspberry Pi 4 finally got its USB-C act together.

143
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,360
That's right.

144
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,180
Woo!

145
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,020
That's right.

146
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,860
That means I can finally buy one.

147
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,600
I've been waiting for them to fix this.

148
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,940
Yeah, yep, you got it.

149
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,960
So I guess, what was it?

150
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,640
There was anything that was marked with a E cable

151
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,560
for USB-Cs, and that was like one of the smarter

152
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,440
USB-C type cables.

153
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,040
It wouldn't work with the Raspberry Pi 4.

154
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,840
Yeah, they had some non-standard wiring,

155
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,960
so it thought it was actually an audio device

156
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,480
and wouldn't give it all the juice.

157
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,400
I mean, USB-C's got lots of fancy things,

158
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,440
but you got to get those negotiations right

159
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,800
if you want all the power that you have.

160
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,040
So it meant that some adapters worked and some didn't.

161
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,800
Obviously, the one they supplied did,

162
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,360
but one of the nice advantages in theory of USB-C

163
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,200
is we've all got all of these things laying around.

164
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,460
With those first generation, they might not work.

165
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,120
Yeah, I want to power my Raspberry Pi

166
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
with my laptop adapter.

167
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,240
Come on.

168
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,060
So the register reached out to Eben Upton, right?

169
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,080
Eben, Eben?

170
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,900
Sorry, Eben.

171
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,000
It's not you, it's me.

172
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
Mr. Upton?

173
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,240
That's the way to go.

174
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,960
Mr. Upton, and they asked him about this

175
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,480
and like, what the hell, where's this at?

176
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,560
And he said, yes, indeed, they had rolled a fix

177
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,220
into their PCB design for manufacturing,

178
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,080
and he would expect that it has begun to reach end users

179
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,280
by about now.

180
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,240
Ooh.

181
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,160
So if you're buying a Raspberry Pi now

182
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,040
or in the near term future, it will likely have the fix.

183
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,240
So if you would do me a big solid,

184
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,320
if you get one of these and it does seem to be fixed,

185
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,200
please let me know.

186
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,120
I'd love to update folks and say, yes,

187
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,200
they are actually out in the marketplace now.

188
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,920
There was another interesting little tidbit

189
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,080
to this story, though, when they were talking to Upton,

190
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,640
he confirmed that the four gig version

191
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,100
was really the one flying off the shelves,

192
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,460
but I guess before the four launched,

193
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,480
they thought it would be the two gig version.

194
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,520
I think that's probably because of price.

195
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,480
They thought the price was too high on the four gig version.

196
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,960
Meanwhile, I was over here being,

197
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,480
could you make an eight gig version?

198
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,240
All right, I'll take all the RAM I can get.

199
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,360
That's what I want.

200
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,120
Yeah.

201
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,560
And I mean, they were kind of getting the data back

202
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,000
in September showing the four gig was performing better.

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,100
So I guess what this really is confirming actually

204
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,600
is that that is still the case.

205
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,160
The four gig is still the top performing seller,

206
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,320
which could mean maybe that eight gig version will show up.

207
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,240
That would be great.

208
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,840
Fingers crossed.

209
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,360
I'm running three.

210
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,800
I wanted to say four, but the fourth one

211
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,840
is just for playing with.

212
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,320
I'm running three in production at my home.

213
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,680
One does all of the things, probably too many things.

214
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,000
And then the other is just doing pie hole and one network

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,600
monitoring tool, Smokeping.

216
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,480
And then another is doing all of my security cameras using,

217
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,440
what's that project called that I can't remember?

218
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,400
Shinobi?

219
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,920
Shinobi, thank you.

220
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,560
And I mean, I've been using them for months now.

221
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,600
It really has felt like the first sort of like,

222
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,240
all right, I'll just deploy this, and it'll work,

223
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,760
and it's powerful enough for all of my needs.

224
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,300
You don't have to compromise too much.

225
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,440
I'm pretty happy.

226
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,200
And I'm actually kind of feeling like I

227
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
reaffirmed that decision to go.

228
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,080
The Raspberry Pi for me has always been a toy.

229
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,720
And as an old sys admin, the idea

230
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,800
of putting a toy in production for my server

231
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
seems like a bad idea.

232
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,920
And I still think I'll regret not

233
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,100
getting more frequent DDs of my SD cards,

234
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,640
because I know one of those suckers

235
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,520
is going to die on me soon.

236
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,760
Hey, that's on you, buddy.

237
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,200
I know, and there are ways you could get around it.

238
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,760
You don't have to use an SD card,

239
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,880
but I actually kind of like the floppy disk-like nature

240
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,120
where I can just copy them.

241
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,600
And anyways, where it has actually been pretty great

242
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,360
is how freaking low power they are.

243
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,800
Even the Raspberry Pi 4 is way less power than an x86,

244
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,040
even a low-end x86.

245
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,560
The whole load for my entire Lady Joops RV

246
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,400
with all of my smart lights on and all of my Raspberry

247
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,360
Pis running, my Wi-Fi, my network switch, my router,

248
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,960
all of that, and all my LED lights, all of it

249
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,300
together is less than 200 watts, everything.

250
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:58,960
That's fantastic.

251
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,120
Even on a cloudy day, I get that in solar power.

252
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,240
So I run my Raspberry Pis off of solar all day long.

253
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,120
That's pretty cool.

254
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,920
And I don't think I could do it with an x86

255
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,680
PC in the Pacific Northwest.

256
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,960
You can really just optimize.

257
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,240
It's just enough compute, just enough resources,

258
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,640
and you don't have to compromise.

259
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,480
And silent.

260
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,600
That's the other thing.

261
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,520
Maybe they'll die a year or two sooner

262
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,040
than if I was not using them in production.

263
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,320
But at that price point, realistically, I

264
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,080
could replace all of them every year.

265
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,880
And the form factor is so easy.

266
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,200
You kind of grab it, you just slot in your new SD card,

267
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,120
plug in, and you're done.

268
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,560
Well, and realistically, you're going

269
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,800
to replace them when the 8-gig version comes out.

270
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,400
Yeah, especially the one that I have that's running Plex

271
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,880
and it's running a bunch of other containers,

272
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,520
like a document wiki and a bunch of network tools

273
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,920
and all these other services that really push the Pi to.

274
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,000
I was really kind of seeing how far I could push it.

275
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,320
And then I was like, OK, well, now it's invaluable.

276
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,440
I pushed it really far and made it invaluable.

277
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,140
You do have backups, right?

278
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,220
Every night.

279
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,720
Every night.

280
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,880
But it's still not the same thing.

281
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,720
I have all the data backed up, and all the applications

282
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,920
are in containers.

283
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,440
But I'd still have to burn a day getting the OS all reconfigured

284
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,120
and all of that.

285
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,600
So I just don't want that.

286
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,720
I've insulated as much as I can, but I

287
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,280
Sounds like you need to teach Dylan how

288
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,880
to make copies of SD cards.

289
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,520
I like that you and Cheese keep coming up with jobs for my son.

290
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:32,880
This is good.

291
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,240
I'll get a list from you guys, and then I'll start getting them.

292
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,200
These are great chores.

293
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,800
Sorry, Dylan.

294
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,640
Son, today I'm going to learn you how to DD an SD card, son.

295
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,080
I think I might DD rescue it.

296
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,360
I don't know.

297
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
Does anybody in the Mumble Room have tips

298
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,560
for how to duplicate an SD card in Raspberry Pi?

299
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,160
Don't use DD or DD rescue.

300
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
What should I reuse?

301
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,280
This is good.

302
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,720
Well, you know, gnome disks can restore disk images,

303
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,160
like SD card images onto SD cards.

304
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,320
That works really nicely.

305
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,120
It's not just using DD in the back end?

306
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,080
No, of course not.

307
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,520
It's for animals.

308
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,000
We've evolved since then, Chris.

309
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,480
That was like 30 years ago.

310
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,400
OK, all right.

311
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,360
I'm totally down for giving that a go.

312
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,440
And it's so low impact to test it, right?

313
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,400
Here's what I was thinking my process would be.

314
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,200
Shut down the Raspberry Pi, pop it out of the Pi,

315
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,600
pop the current production SD card in my ThinkPad,

316
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,240
image it right off the built-in SD card reader,

317
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,880
and then pop a new one in and restore the image to that,

318
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,960
put that in the Raspberry Pi, see if it boots.

319
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,840
Yeah, sounds good.

320
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,280
And gnome disks has create a disk image

321
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,400
and restore a disk image.

322
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,840
So you can do it all with a UI and not

323
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,120
run the risk of DDing over something critical.

324
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,880
Yeah, but what if he's on plasma?

325
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,920
I'll install gnome disk, it sounds like.

326
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,040
Hey, I will say gnome disk is actually really great.

327
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,320
I'm running it on everything, even on plasma.

328
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,280
I've definitely taken a look at gnome disk.

329
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,320
Is there like a certain point where it's like,

330
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,940
you've got to have at least this version?

331
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,980
Or has it just been good enough for a long time now?

332
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,640
It's been there for as long as I can remember.

333
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,000
I mean, I was certainly doing lightning talks about this

334
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
four or five years ago.

335
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,720
I thought someone was going to say Clonezilla to me.

336
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,080
That's what I thought I would get suggested was Clonezilla.

337
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,760
But I like this.

338
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,240
This is much simpler.

339
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
Chris, would not a good alternative

340
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
to avoid the manual intervention here

341
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,960
be to simply run some rsync over the network to your backups?

342
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
I mean, it's not as complete a solution,

343
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,520
but it won't take you a day to restore.

344
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,760
Yeah, and just rsync the file systems around.

345
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Yeah, I wonder, taking the whole theory of the Raspberry Pis

346
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,440
are not so expensive that maybe it

347
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,200
wouldn't be impossible to buy another $45 Raspberry Pi

348
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,720
and have it running as sort of a cold backup that's

349
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,760
syncing every day.

350
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,920
And then if one dies, I just pull the plug out,

351
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,060
plug in the other one.

352
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,360
Why do you need to restore data and move data around?

353
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,840
Aren't you running everything in containers?

354
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,400
Have a docker compose file stored somewhere

355
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,680
off site, GitHub maybe, and then spin up your containers,

356
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,120
plug in your persistent storage, and you're good to go,

357
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,880
aren't you?

358
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,280
Yes, mostly the data is solved for.

359
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,280
It's really trying to avoid the hassle of spending

360
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,920
the afternoon installing Raspbian, getting it updated,

361
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,520
getting the Docker repo added, getting Docker installed,

362
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,540
getting that data reinstalled, avoiding all of that stuff that

363
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,960
takes a guy like me an afternoon because I'm

364
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,920
doing three other things and it's a Saturday.

365
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,680
I want something that's nearly like plug a new SD card

366
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,980
in, power it back on, and it's pretty much good to go.

367
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,480
Because in theory, the data would be safe.

368
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,360
Because the data is stored on a separate disk.

369
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,720
Have you heard of my friend Bash Script?

370
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,160
He can do a lot of that for you.

371
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,040
Yeah, well, that's what Brett was saying,

372
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,680
is maybe just automate so that it's always synced up.

373
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,760
Yeah, I kind of like it.

374
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,800
Or Ansible, or there's a lot of ways

375
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,080
to solve this particular turkey.

376
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,080
That is actually part of my problem.

377
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,200
I got so many options.

378
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,400
I can think of a half a dozen ways to do it.

379
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,540
And then the internet could probably think

380
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,960
of 100 ways I could do it.

381
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,920
You should probably pick the one that

382
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,760
will be the best content for the future.

383
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,000
That's what I want to say.

384
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,280
Yeah, so I should say I should wipe all of them

385
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,720
and put Arch on there.

386
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,280
Well, I mean, I think the latest Manjaro release will be fine.

387
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,160
We'll see about that.

388
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,940
I actually think if I were to reload them,

389
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,720
I'd probably still for today.

390
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,680
I'm not sure.

391
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,240
Stick with Raspbian.

392
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,520
With the Raspberry Pi 4, it's been semi-necessary,

393
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,840
although I think that's changing.

394
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,520
So I may just relook at this in a few months

395
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,200
and then redo it then.

396
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,400
You know, probably one of these will just fail on you.

397
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,040
And then you'll have to figure out how to restore it.

398
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,000
And you'll figure it out then.

399
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,640
Undoubtedly.

400
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,160
Undoubtedly.

401
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,560
That's totally how that's going to go.

402
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,160
No problem.

403
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,320
Well then, let's do a little housekeeping.

404
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,560
There's a few things I'd like to tell you about.

405
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,960
Number one, you have to go check out Brent's recent brunch.

406
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,680
He sat down with Heather Ellsworth from Canonical.

407
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,240
She's a software engineer on Canonical's Ubuntu desktop

408
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,920
team.

409
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,160
She's also a Gnome Foundation member.

410
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,360
And she has quite a story, including a background

411
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,440
in physics at CERN and just a great conversation overall.

412
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,680
It gives you kind of an insight, too, at daily life

413
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,300
at Canonical as well.

414
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,480
That's one of my favorite brunches so far.

415
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,920
Yeah, Heather's awesome.

416
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,840
Her chat, we could have chatted for probably two hours.

417
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,760
But maybe that'll come sometime in the future.

418
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,200
But anyway, she's fascinating.

419
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,040
She's super awesome.

420
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,600
I encourage everybody to check it out.

421
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,440
Absolutely.

422
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,120
Also, well, OK.

423
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,760
So I have a little bad news.

424
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,360
We have been trying to get this sorted out for a little while.

425
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,120
I was hoping I wouldn't have to come on air and say this.

426
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,760
But we will not be attending scale this year.

427
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,840
It's a little last minute.

428
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,260
And the reason why that bothers me

429
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,000
is because I know there's already

430
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,200
some folks who have made travel plans to come out and see us.

431
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,160
You guys are awesome.

432
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,280
But the reality is just didn't work out this year.

433
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:11,040
The merger happened just right around the time of Fest season.

434
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,500
And budgets are getting finalized.

435
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,800
And it just didn't iron out.

436
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,360
So we decided to put our efforts and resources into LinuxFest

437
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,200
Northwest, which is going forward.

438
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,600
It's a shame.

439
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,960
We love coming out and seeing you guys.

440
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,040
You've heard me talk about how important the in-real-life

441
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,640
connection is a million times on this show.

442
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,800
And these are always our chance to actually practice

443
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,880
what we preach.

444
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,080
So it is unfortunate.

445
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,840
Elle will be there.

446
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,960
She'll be doing her talk Confessions of a SysAdmin

447
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,360
in Ballroom H on Saturday.

448
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,640
Definitely don't want to miss that.

449
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,520
So she will be there.

450
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,680
You can go say hi to her.

451
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,280
But your buddies, Chris and Wes, won't be making it this year.

452
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,240
And it kills me, actually, to be honest with you.

453
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,640
But we will try to make a great LinuxFest happen.

454
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,040
And hopefully, next year, we'll make it work.

455
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,840
I apologize that we weren't able to get the news out sooner.

456
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,540
We were just trying to make it all work.

457
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,240
But it just wasn't really in the cards.

458
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Wrong timing this time.

459
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,480
Yeah, yeah.

460
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,000
But it's going to be a great scale.

461
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,080
Oh, yeah, we'll be looking on.

462
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,120
And we'll be jealous and watching conference talks

463
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,880
when they're available.

464
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,280
And I hope everyone has a great time.

465
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,720
Jill, tell people where they can come find you,

466
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,880
because I know you're going to be at scale.

467
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,680
And you've always got so much going on.

468
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,200
Yeah.

469
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,440
So I will be at the Linux Chicks of Los Angeles booth

470
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,800
and running that booth.

471
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,400
And I'll also be doing interviews

472
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,760
on the floor for Linux Gamecast.

473
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,440
And we're also going to go live from Linux Gamecast

474
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,360
and at the Lutris booth.

475
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,860
Dang.

476
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,840
Wow.

477
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,240
I'm going to be everywhere.

478
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,640
Jill, you are working it this year.

479
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,400
That's awesome.

480
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,480
Yes.

481
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
Scale is such a great event.

482
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,520
LinuxFest Northwest is our hometown event.

483
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,600
But scale, I think, is one of the best events in the West.

484
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,480
Yeah, and I'm going to miss my Jupiter broadcasting family.

485
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,160
Yeah, well, we'll miss you, too.

486
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,760
Yeah, it's always a good chance to catch up with everybody.

487
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,640
That's one of the things we love about it.

488
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
But perhaps next year.

489
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,200
All right.

490
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,040
Well, then, the housekeeping goes on.

491
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,400
One other thing I'll mention, go check out Headlines,

492
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,840
linuxheadlines.show.

493
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,600
We're doing something kind of neat here.

494
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,880
We're trying out a new format, a three-minute podcast.

495
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,640
That sounds crazy.

496
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,680
How could that work?

497
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,000
I like it.

498
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,720
I just put it on as I'm getting down the road,

499
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,760
and then my podcast player just plays the next thing.

500
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,360
It's just sort of the way I start off.

501
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,280
linuxheadlines.show, three minutes or less,

502
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,520
everything going on.

503
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,800
And here's what we try to do here.

504
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,420
We try to do something that's not

505
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,680
hypey, that's not just taking PR releases,

506
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,920
remassaging them, and then putting the headline on it

507
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,400
that makes you want to click it.

508
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,520
We've got a team of people that are dedicated to trying

509
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,320
to get that accurate coverage in there,

510
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,740
trying to get it just right.

511
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,240
And then, sometimes to our dissatisfaction,

512
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,860
we all argue over the details for a while

513
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,560
before we publish it to make sure everything's really

514
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,880
massaged just right.

515
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,960
And it gets reviewed by a team of us

516
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,520
before it's published every day.

517
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,820
You'd be amazed the amount of work

518
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,360
we're putting into a three-minute show.

519
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,320
But I think it's kind of important, especially

520
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,940
if you're in the industry.

521
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,720
You want to keep aware of what's going on.

522
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,400
You want to be current, sort of like due diligence in a sense.

523
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,880
But you don't need to commit to two hours or an hour long.

524
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,740
Just get the headlines every weekday at linuxheadlines.show.

525
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,240
And then the stuff that really needs

526
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
a deeper analysis, further discussion,

527
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,800
we'll either do it here or we'll put it

528
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,240
on Linux Action News on Sunday.

529
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,580
And of course, we've got links to everything,

530
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,760
so you can find out more.

531
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,200
Bob is indeed your uncle on that one, I say.

532
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,080
So check that out, linuxheadlines.show.

533
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,840
And last but not least, a plug for the old Telegram group,

534
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,200
just rocking it out.

535
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,080
People are awesome over there, some super good conversations.

536
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,400
I thought for sure it would fall apart as it got huge,

537
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,200
and it's gotten better.

538
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,600
It boggles the mind.

539
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

540
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,600
Go get in a 1,500 and stronger group over there

541
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,440
that are talking about these shows, Linux,

542
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,040
and everything in between.

543
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,400
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

544
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, we actually just crossed 1,600.

545
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,320
That's amazing.

546
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,700
And it's just a nice place to be.

547
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,840
Great conversations basically all the time.

548
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,520
That is so cool.

549
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,120
All the time.

550
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,800
Now we have a little bit of a public service announcement

551
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,620
that I want to get into on the program.

552
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,280
This is something that's going to impact

553
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,760
those that are in the maker space

554
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,200
or love to see technology, cutting edge technology,

555
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,040
and see where it can go and tinker with it.

556
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,840
We cut now live to our reporter on the scene.

557
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,960
Alex, I'm hearing that people are getting very upset

558
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,080
about new drone changes that are coming to the states.

559
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,200
Well, not strictly Linux.

560
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,800
Actually, a lot of these drones do run Linux.

561
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,100
And I was kind of hoping maybe you could update me,

562
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,500
because I have not properly educated myself.

563
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,720
So the thing that I'd like to bring to the audience's

564
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,600
attention is something called remote ID.

565
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,120
And remote ID is effectively an electronic license plate

566
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,720
for all model aircraft.

567
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,040
It's not just drones.

568
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,120
So we're talking about helicopters, planes,

569
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,600
anything that flies, essentially,

570
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,680
that's an unmanned vehicle, UAV.

571
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,640
So on December the 31st of 2019, the FAA

572
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,560
published a proposal for what remote ID is going to look like.

573
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,880
And you have 60 days to comment.

574
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,080
And that period ends on March the 2nd.

575
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,680
Now, what happens after those comments are reviewed

576
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,040
is the FAA will publish a final report.

577
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,680
And the new rules would take effect 60 days after that.

578
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,280
So why is it such a big deal?

579
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,360
Well, for me, there's several things

580
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,680
that are an overreach here.

581
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,660
So let me just break a couple of the key things

582
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,560
down that kind of rubbed me up the wrong way.

583
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,760
Firstly, I build all my own drones,

584
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,600
like racing drones and that kind of stuff.

585
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,640
And as it stands, you will not be able to do that anymore.

586
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,680
Because you will need to buy 100% FAA-approved components,

587
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,800
else you will be restricted to FAA-recognized flying sites,

588
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,000
otherwise known as FRIAs.

589
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,640
Now, most of those are AMA, American Model Association

590
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
fields.

591
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,920
So I don't know if you're into FPV or drones,

592
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,800
and you've ever tried to go to a plane field,

593
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,000
you get the stink eye.

594
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,440
And you're not really very welcome there.

595
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,360
So you'll only be able to fly self-built models

596
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,400
three years after these new rules go into effect

597
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,280
at these FRIA sites.

598
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,840
Now, a further kicker is that they're not approving

599
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,120
any new FRIA sites ever.

600
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,280
Because as they assume in their rules,

601
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,720
all craft will be remote ID capable.

602
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,440
So there'll be no need for new FRIAs to be approved.

603
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,820
Well, that's just not true.

604
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,400
So in terms of where you can and cannot fly,

605
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,400
you will not be able to fly in your own backyard

606
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,000
on your own property.

607
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,360
You will not be able to fly in parks, anywhere that

608
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,880
is basically currently legal.

609
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,080
I mean, obviously, national parks and stuff like that

610
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,880
are still out of range.

611
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,660
But I think it's just a huge overreach

612
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,000
to try and regulate the model aircraft's base,

613
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,880
that sort of sub 400 feet altitude space.

614
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,200
So that people like Amazon, and FedEx, and UPS

615
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,960
can start flying commercial delivery drones.

616
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,220
So if your aircraft is not remote ID capable,

617
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,800
you will only be able to fly at a pre-approved FRIA site.

618
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,460
If your aircraft can share a location via the internet,

619
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,240
so this addresses most DJI type products,

620
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,880
you will need to subscribe to a subscription service, which

621
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,640
hasn't yet been decided.

622
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,560
So let's assume a minimum of $5 a month.

623
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,760
And at that point, you can only fly in a 400 foot sphere

624
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,800
around you.

625
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,720
So that includes up, but also sideways.

626
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,520
So 400 feet, that's it.

627
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,860
You have this drone that can go 5 kilometers,

628
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,480
and you can do 400 feet.

629
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,880
So I think it's pretty egregious.

630
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,800
I think it's a horrible overreach.

631
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,560
Now, what can you do about it?

632
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,760
You can leave a comment on the FAA website

633
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,720
before March the 2nd.

634
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,800
Please try not to make it an emotional type, reaction type

635
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,880
comment that FAA sucks.

636
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,480
That kind of thing is not very helpful.

637
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,920
But instead, focus on the specific areas of remote ID

638
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,480
that you think are unworkable or an overreach.

639
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,080
And propose alternate solutions, such as app-based systems.

640
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,840
Lance is something that already exists for part 107

641
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,160
commercial pilots to essentially say, hey,

642
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,720
I'm going to fly here through an app,

643
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,360
get pre-approval to fly in that airspace.

644
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,600
And just remember that as this proposal stands,

645
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,800
it's going to pretty much kill the remote control

646
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,120
hobby as we know it.

647
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,580
Yeah, it's a shame, because it seems like that community's

648
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,560
been really blossoming.

649
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,160
It's a makerspace thing now, like building these little

650
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,480
drones as a maker thing.

651
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,200
It's a huge part of the reason I'm into electronics

652
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,820
and self-hosting and all that kind of stuff.

653
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,580
I mean, I got into building my own quadcopters

654
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,240
and learned electronics through that.

655
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,160
And that's led to a whole bunch of other stuff

656
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,080
that anybody who listens to self-hosted

657
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,760
will be familiar with.

658
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,120
So many prominent YouTubers have released really excellent

659
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,520
content on this topic, including Flight Test,

660
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,840
Joshua Bardwell, Rotor Riot, Mr. Steel, et cetera, et cetera.

661
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,500
So please leave a comment for the FAA.

662
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,040
Even if you don't live in America,

663
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,280
just leave a comment anyway.

664
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,080
Let's try and get the numbers up.

665
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,360
If you want to help make a difference,

666
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,560
you can also join me and thousands of other people,

667
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,140
remote control pilots, who are going to be in Washington DC

668
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,720
this Saturday, the 29th of February,

669
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,520
for a protest outside the FAA headquarters,

670
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,760
just off the National Mall.

671
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,640
So thanks for letting me raise the awareness of this issue,

672
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,200
Chris.

673
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,620
Yeah, we want to talk about it now,

674
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,240
since the timing is critical.

675
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,000
There you have it.

676
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,640
Do-do-do-do-do.

677
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,000
There's Alex with our drone update.

678
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,880
Do-do-do-do-do-do.

679
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,160
He didn't mention it, but he's actually being

680
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,320
carried by a drone right now.

681
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,520
Thank you, Alex, for that very important public announcement.

682
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,320
Yeah, go speak on it if you can.

683
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,760
Make some comments, make some noise,

684
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,360
and hopefully there'll be some reconsidering done.

685
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,640
So now I want to talk about Zero Trust SSH.

686
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,800
This is something that is so cool.

687
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,240
Jeremy's going to join us and talk

688
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,600
about things I never knew were possible for SSH

689
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,520
authentication.

690
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,660
It truly is the magical, magical fruit in open source.

691
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,880
And he's got some problems to solve that I'd never

692
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,120
really contemplated before.

693
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,080
All right, well, we all use SSH.

694
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,600
And I mean, I daresay love it, right?

695
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,120
Love it.

696
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,000
From port forwarding to proxying to just

697
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,800
getting to a server securely, it's super handy.

698
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,080
But we don't all use it in the best way.

699
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,880
I mean, I'm looking at you, Chris.

700
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,140
You're one who uses password-based authentication.

701
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,520
A lot of times, unless it's like just a few

702
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,880
of the regular machines, I just stick to passwords.

703
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,680
But you at least know you have other options,

704
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,800
things like public-private key pairs

705
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,560
that you can use to get onto servers.

706
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,960
Well, there's another way to do it, and it has some advantages.

707
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,520
And Jeremy had a great presentation

708
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,400
all about how you might actually use it.

709
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,960
SSH has certificates, and Jeremy, thanks

710
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,520
for joining us to tell us more.

711
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,480
Oh, thank you very much.

712
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,520
Yes, password-based auth, it is sort of maybe

713
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,000
the first introduction you get to SSH.

714
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,560
You know, you sort of start it up,

715
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,240
and then try an SSH straightaway,

716
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,740
and you're prompted for your password.

717
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,240
And you think, oh, well, this is pretty familiar,

718
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,160
and it works no problem.

719
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,840
But then as you pointed out, there's

720
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,680
that public-private key authentication.

721
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,340
And maybe if you're like me, you sort of try to try it out,

722
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,560
because it was a bit of a more exciting way to connect.

723
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,440
Or you've just gotten tired of typing in your password

724
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,560
all the time.

725
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,440
Or maybe even if you're at a company,

726
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,120
you might be required to use private-public-key

727
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,320
authentication.

728
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,820
So there's some distinct advantages

729
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,640
with private-public-key versus password-based.

730
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,880
You're kind of authenticating your laptop to the server

731
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,720
instead of your password.

732
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,280
So there's some advantages that you can't accidentally

733
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,760
mistype your password into the wrong prompt, for example.

734
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,000
There's some other neat advantages of public-private-key.

735
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,480
But like you said, the third way that I discovered

736
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,240
is already in Open SSH since 7 point something,

737
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,200
I can't remember, is certificate-based authentication.

738
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,080
It's not an X.509 certificate.

739
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,480
It's kind of a lightweight certificate.

740
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,600
Really, all it is is your public key

741
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,560
that's been signed by another private key,

742
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,280
a little bit of metadata like expiry and username,

743
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,960
things like that.

744
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,080
But that's all it is, really.

745
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,360
So instead of having your public key and private key,

746
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,000
you have your public key plus that signature

747
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,760
and your private key.

748
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,680
And you can't have a chain of trust

749
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,080
like in a normal X.509 certificate,

750
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,360
like a TLS certificate.

751
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,240
So you can't have a root authority

752
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,240
and then an intermediate and then things like that.

753
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,400
It's just one.

754
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,760
You just have one level of delegated trust.

755
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,320
That's right.

756
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,400
That's right.

757
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,720
But when you go in SSH to a server,

758
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,800
so with public-private-key, what you need to do

759
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,600
is put your public key on the server.

760
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:55,800
Right.

761
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,760
I think we've all been through that,

762
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,360
having to share your private key with someone

763
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,400
or copy the public key over so that it's there.

764
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,840
And maybe you've got a little script to help you with it.

765
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,720
Exactly.

766
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,160
And maybe you're giving that to your IT team.

767
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,880
It's like, oh, here's my public key.

768
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,520
Except with the SSH certificate, the host

769
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,360
has never seen you before.

770
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,360
So you try an SSH to it.

771
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,840
And as long as your public key has

772
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,960
that signature of the trusted certificate authority,

773
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,920
then the host will go, oh, great, this is you.

774
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,040
This is Jeremy.

775
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,240
I'm going to let you connect.

776
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,780
So it kind of switches things up here.

777
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,520
If I'm getting this right, you can tell that host

778
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,400
to trust anything signed by your certificate authority.

779
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,880
And then it doesn't have to have any specific keys added.

780
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,040
Anything that's been signed, it'll automatically

781
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,160
grant access to.

782
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,200
Absolutely.

783
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,760
So for an individual, I mean, unless you

784
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,960
have hundreds of servers, it might not

785
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,880
be so much of an advantage over public private key itself.

786
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,680
Because I mean, it's not necessarily

787
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,960
any more secure cryptographically.

788
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,280
Right, it's using the same keys and the same infrastructure.

789
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,680
Exactly.

790
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,880
But when you start having more than one person

791
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,800
or a team to manage keys for, I don't

792
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,840
know if you've been through the pain of managing

793
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,160
a team of public keys.

794
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,600
I've definitely managed a Chef repository to push those.

795
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,720
Yeah, it's not a lot of fun.

796
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,880
Well, I mean, even just adding another one,

797
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,600
I mean, my previous company was Puppet.

798
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,920
And the flow for adding a new user

799
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:34,500
was quite literally get pull, get commit, add the public key,

800
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,000
make a pull request, get someone to review the pull request,

801
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,640
then merge the pull request, and then

802
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,640
watch the CI server deploy Puppet and wait for an hour.

803
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,960
It was a bit involved for just adding a user to the system.

804
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,800
It's some time that I just shouldn't

805
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,640
have been spending doing anything like that.

806
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,120
I should do something else.

807
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,160
So I really wanted to automate team management of SSH

808
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,980
on hosts.

809
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,680
And it doesn't matter where your hosts are.

810
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,280
They could be in Amazon, Google Cloud, or Azure kind of thing.

811
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,360
Or it could just be your own servers in your closet

812
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,040
somewhere.

813
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,160
But yeah, SSH certificates will really help

814
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,040
a team manage their access.

815
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,960
Because if you imagine your hosts suddenly

816
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,640
don't need to know in advance that your user is

817
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,080
going to connect to it, then you can bring up

818
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,280
new hosts all the time.

819
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,480
But as long as the users can go to that certificate authority,

820
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,360
get their SSH certificate signed,

821
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,000
and then connect to your host, it'll be smooth sailing.

822
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,160
That sounds really nice, honestly.

823
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,200
But how do you go about making sure all those certificates get

824
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,700
signed?

825
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,280
Is that another manual process?

826
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,560
Or can you automate?

827
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah, so that's a good point.

828
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,720
And so if I just swapped my problem

829
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,240
for now public key infrastructure

830
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,320
and managing public keys and certificates,

831
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,080
and you're kind of right, because it's maybe

832
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,360
a more difficult problem even than just public keys.

833
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,200
But one of the ways I was going about it

834
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,360
was to create the certificate authority in as light

835
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
as possible way.

836
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,960
And we happened to use Amazon, so AWS,

837
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,880
for most of our other things.

838
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,440
So I built a certificate authority

839
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,840
in the Lambda function.

840
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,480
So it's not a new concept, actually.

841
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,400
Netflix, I found it first with Netflix.

842
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,520
They have a project called BLESS, Bastian's Lambda

843
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,240
Ephemeral SSH Service.

844
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,120
Bit of a mouthful, but they were still

845
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,760
using this jump host idea.

846
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,720
And it was connecting users SSH to that first jump

847
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,040
host in the infrastructure.

848
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,480
And then it would go off to the Lambda function, which

849
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,560
is really just a bit of code running somewhere in Amazon.

850
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
Who knows where?

851
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,360
Could be on their vacuum cleaner, I don't know.

852
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,720
So you run your Lambda function, and then it

853
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,720
will sign your certificate for you, sign your public key.

854
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,600
Sure, so you send a public key, it'll sign it and send you back

855
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,320
the sign key.

856
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,960
That's correct.

857
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,120
So what Lyft did, which was quite interesting,

858
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,480
is they decided, well, we don't really want this Bastian host,

859
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,440
because it's just complicating things.

860
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,440
And now infrastructure's maybe not set up for it.

861
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,440
So they decided to make a Python client that

862
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,040
worked on developers' laptops.

863
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,640
So every developer's laptop itself

864
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,800
could go and sign its public key.

865
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,720
And it would invoke that Lambda function itself.

866
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,080
And they had a really clever KMS auth thing

867
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,320
to prove your identity to the Lambda,

868
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,880
to say, yes, I need my certificate signed.

869
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,680
And remember, all the Lambda's doing is just

870
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,640
takes your public key, it's got a private key pair,

871
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,240
private key, public key pair, and it just

872
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,960
signs your public key.

873
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,560
It needs to know what username to put into that certificate.

874
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,440
So it needs to know your identity,

875
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,640
a good sense of your identity.

876
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,160
Because if I could get my certificate signed

877
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,760
with someone else's username, then I'd

878
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,400
be able to connect as them.

879
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,080
Right, you've still got this trust layer

880
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,200
you need to take care of.

881
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,240
Exactly.

882
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,000
And actually, it's funny, in a zero trust model,

883
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,920
the idea being that you don't trust anything inside your

884
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,000
network or outside your network.

885
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,880
So each piece should be on its own.

886
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,800
You don't have this firewall, and everything

887
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,400
beyond this firewall is this wonderful garden.

888
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,600
The funny thing is zero trust is almost like more trust,

889
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,960
because you're adding all these extra layers of.

890
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,120
Right, now you're authenticating everywhere.

891
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,040
Exactly.

892
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,360
So one thing I tried to do with the Lambda that I wrote

893
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,040
was to use OpenID Connect to authenticate to the Lambda.

894
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,840
So you sign in with Google to get yourself that certificate.

895
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,640
It just creates that identity token,

896
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,760
which is this bit of signed JSON JWT by Google.

897
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,440
And you can pass it over to your Lambda

898
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,760
and it can verify, yes, your email address is correct.

899
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,160
And it can put your email as your username, for example.

900
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,320
So then in this mode, onboarding, I'm thinking,

901
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,080
I mean, here at Jupiter Broadcasting,

902
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,640
we've got some G Suite going on.

903
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,920
So I could configure a new user there, which I probably

904
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,400
have to do anyway.

905
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,680
And then if it was all set up correctly,

906
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,520
they could just have access to servers.

907
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,440
That's the dream, that a new engineer starts

908
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,360
and they have their laptop, and they already

909
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,520
have the access that they need without you having

910
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,120
to do anything, other than put them

911
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,440
in the correct groups in your directory, right?

912
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,120
Right.

913
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,880
I mean, this is kind of a solved problem

914
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,880
if you think Active Directory, LDAP.

915
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,880
There's all these, that's all existing.

916
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,360
But what I'm seeing is a lot of companies moving away

917
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,520
from having those traditional directories

918
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,680
and going just cloud native services.

919
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,040
So you might just have G Suite, for example.

920
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,320
And if you don't have Active Directory,

921
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,880
how do you now leverage some of those tools

922
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,120
that are all set up for it?

923
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,200
If you're not running LDAP, what's

924
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,680
the alternative kind of thing?

925
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,400
And I think this is a good alternative.

926
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,440
When you say that there's companies out there that

927
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,040
don't have directory services, too, I

928
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,760
think to our audience that is using Active Directory or LDAP,

929
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,720
that sounds ridiculous.

930
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,000
But Wes and I have, and may currently

931
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,880
have worked for companies that have no LDAP, no Active

932
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,240
Directory.

933
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,040
It's a G Suite authentication system.

934
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,120
Maybe you're running Slack.

935
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,240
None of these things necessarily need that back end

936
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,040
infrastructure.

937
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,560
Right.

938
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Absolutely.

939
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,840
So for the company I was at, it seemed

940
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,800
a bit silly to provision LDAP just for managing this.

941
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,320
Right.

942
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,720
And you can also need people to manage LDAP, right?

943
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,160
That's its own arcane art.

944
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,400
So help me understand how shrimp plays into this.

945
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,440
Because I loved that you got a name

946
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,120
for a component of shrimp during the talk, too.

947
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,160
That was a great moment of your talk.

948
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,920
Oh, yes.

949
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,280
Well, I was going through why I named it Shrimp.

950
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,560
And so shrimp has shells, right?

951
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,720
Shrimp have shells.

952
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,960
Got a bit of a groan from the audience for that one.

953
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,400
Lightweight, right?

954
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,480
So I guess you could have a really massive shrimp.

955
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,560
I don't know.

956
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,320
All the shrimp's pretty lightweight.

957
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,240
And then someone yelled out, shrimp's on the barbie.

958
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,920
Right.

959
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,560
Like a classic Australian expression.

960
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,760
It comes from an advertisement ages ago, I think.

961
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,400
Yeah.

962
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,480
So I had to integrate that somehow.

963
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,120
I was looking for a name for the back end components.

964
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,440
So maybe that was the barbecue.

965
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,240
So like shrimp's on the barbie kind of thing.

966
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,720
Yeah.

967
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,680
I don't know.

968
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,840
So shrimp is the name that ties all of this together.

969
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,320
It's the different components that

970
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,360
enable you to use Lambda for this aspect.

971
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:40,840
Right.

972
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,360
Yeah.

973
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,920
So shrimp is the two parts.

974
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,480
There's the Lambda, and then there's

975
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,360
the client on your laptop.

976
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,080
So you need something to go and automate

977
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,480
the process of giving your public key to the Lambda

978
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,840
and then receiving back the signed certificate

979
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,160
and using it in your connection.

980
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,080
I mean, you can use just SSH key gen.

981
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,760
There's nothing special about what these tools are using.

982
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,760
It's just sort of automating it in a way that really makes

983
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,600
it easy for developers to get going.

984
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,280
I think the idea is, well, my idea was,

985
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,400
if you make it easier but also a little bit more secure,

986
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,480
people will jump on it really, really quickly

987
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,960
and really want to use it.

988
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,440
But if it's just slightly more inconvenient,

989
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,240
even though it's more secure, people

990
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,720
will try and find a way around it.

991
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,600
So true, right?

992
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,640
If you can give them an easy and secure option that's

993
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,160
right at their fingertips, there's

994
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,880
no reason to choose the wrong path.

995
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,400
Exactly.

996
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,160
So I want a method that they don't even

997
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,360
need to put your public key anywhere.

998
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,320
You don't need to copy and paste anything.

999
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,160
You're just up and running already.

1000
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,040
So part of that was the client actually runs an SSH agent.

1001
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,200
So normally, your SSH agent manages your private keys

1002
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,440
for you.

1003
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,160
So it's a program running on your laptop.

1004
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,640
Maybe it's even partially on a smart card or a YubiKey.

1005
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,800
Your SSH agent kind of manages that.

1006
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,440
Where is your private key?

1007
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,120
So I wrote an SSH agent.

1008
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,640
Well, actually, the Golang crypto SSH module's

1009
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,600
really great.

1010
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,800
They have an agent implementation there.

1011
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,400
So it's almost like just a plug into it.

1012
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,320
Exactly.

1013
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,560
So I used the SSH agent to provide

1014
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,640
this Lambda-based certificate signing feature.

1015
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,680
So when your SSH client says, hey,

1016
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,920
I need the list of public keys, I'm

1017
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,200
trying to connect to your server,

1018
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,680
it will ask the agent to say, what have you got for me?

1019
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,680
And at that point, the agent can say,

1020
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,960
oh, just hang on one second.

1021
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,440
I've just got to go and just check

1022
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,600
what's in my Lambda closet over here.

1023
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,160
Just give me a few minutes.

1024
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,600
And it goes off and signs your.

1025
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,760
So it actually generates a new private public key

1026
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,200
and then goes and signs the public key.

1027
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,280
And then it returns to the SSH client and says, oh, yes.

1028
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,080
Everything's normal.

1029
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,040
Don't worry about it.

1030
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,640
Here's the public key and private key.

1031
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,080
So for the SSH client itself, none of that matters.

1032
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,760
It just gets back the key that it needs

1033
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,280
and it ships it off to the server.

1034
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,120
Exactly.

1035
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,200
The advantage of that is other tools that use SSH

1036
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:23,360
work just great, like rsync or scopy or maybe even Ansible

1037
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,240
or something like that.

1038
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,000
Those kind of tools, they just will be none the wiser.

1039
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,480
Some other ways of doing this rely

1040
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,480
on wrapping the SSH command.

1041
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,200
So if you wrap it in another command,

1042
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,400
but that almost breaks that flow.

1043
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,200
So you can't really use those other downstream tools that

1044
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,560
are using SSH underneath.

1045
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,800
Well, Jeremy, thank you for joining us.

1046
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,520
What time is it where you're at right now?

1047
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,520
I've just hit 730 in the morning.

1048
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,800
Thank you for getting up early to chat with us.

1049
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,080
We really appreciate it.

1050
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,720
And we will link to the talk.

1051
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,880
Anything else you think we ought to link to?

1052
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,440
Obviously, we'll link to shrimp.

1053
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,640
Any other suggestions?

1054
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,920
So that's shrimp repository.

1055
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,160
I've got the Git repo for that.

1056
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,000
One thing I didn't mention, which I found in the last week,

1057
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,200
and it's not actually in that talk, is Keybase.

1058
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,120
Have you guys heard of Keybase?

1059
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,280
Oh, yeah.

1060
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,160
Yeah, absolutely.

1061
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,360
Keybase.io slash Chris Lass.

1062
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:14,860
OK.

1063
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,840
Well, you're going to have a new follower very soon.

1064
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,120
Well, Keybase is a blog post where

1065
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,560
they've implemented their own SSH certificate

1066
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,680
authority on top of Keybase.

1067
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,720
Oh, neat.

1068
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,600
And it's the most bizarre chat ops use case I've seen,

1069
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,920
where essentially, because there's

1070
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,520
no secrets being exchanged when you sign these certificates.

1071
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,480
You just give your public key.

1072
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,800
And then the server, your certificate authority's

1073
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,040
signing it.

1074
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,760
That bit's done in private.

1075
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,600
But then it gives you back your certificate,

1076
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,120
which is also a public thing.

1077
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,500
Right, there's no secret exchange between the machines.

1078
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,240
Exactly.

1079
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,520
And it can do it over the Keybase chat.

1080
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,000
And it uses the Keybase API to do it for you.

1081
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,200
So it runs on your computer.

1082
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,000
It uses your Keybase if you're signed in the Keybase.

1083
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,560
And then you have a chat bot on the other end,

1084
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,620
also listening on that same channel.

1085
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,120
And when it says, hey, I want to sign my public key, it goes,

1086
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,560
OK, what's your username?

1087
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,120
And because Keybase has such a strong sense of identity,

1088
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,180
it knows, oh, yes, it's the right Chris.

1089
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,880
I mean, I haven't reviewed their source code.

1090
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,400
But if it's true that they claim end-to-end encrypted

1091
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,840
and the way they've implemented it,

1092
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,560
it will be very, very difficult to impersonate your chat

1093
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,280
message.

1094
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,560
So it really is coming from your laptop

1095
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,380
that it should be your request for a public key.

1096
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,760
And then the chat bot just signs it, and then here you go.

1097
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,680
Here's your public key, which is kind of cool

1098
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,720
because the SSH certificate authority doesn't

1099
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,760
need to be publicly listening on the internet.

1100
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,680
It doesn't have to be a Lambda function that

1101
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,080
can be invoked somehow or a server running on EC2 that

1102
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,140
is listening on some port.

1103
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,840
You just need to be able to connect to Keybase.

1104
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,360
Exactly.

1105
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,780
It's kind of like an outbound connection.

1106
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:59,400
It could be a Raspberry Pi in your office, for example,

1107
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,360
or wherever you're, you know.

1108
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,320
I've tried it out.

1109
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,440
It's actually really neat.

1110
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,280
That does sound really neat.

1111
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,760
It's worth including.

1112
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:15,240
I gave this talk at Auckland OWASP Day, our security

1113
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,400
conference here in Auckland.

1114
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,600
And I included that part as well.

1115
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,840
It's just awesome.

1116
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:26,040
You know, I love all of the ways you can use SSH.

1117
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,440
It's just been proven such a flexible tool to build on,

1118
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:28,680
I guess.

1119
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,280
No kidding.

1120
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,560
Couldn't set it better myself.

1121
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,560
Jeremy, thank you so much for joining us

1122
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,880
and going through some of this.

1123
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,000
I really enjoyed it.

1124
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,480
My pleasure.

1125
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:35,760
Thanks.

1126
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,040
Thanks for having me.

1127
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,280
It was great that Jeremy was able to join us and talk

1128
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:39,880
about that.

1129
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,800
But it's really still worth watching his whole talk

1130
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,100
because we've only scratched the surface.

1131
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,520
One thing we didn't get into but is really neat

1132
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,520
about these certificate-based solutions

1133
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,920
is you can set the expiry time really low.

1134
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,560
So for Netflix, as an example, they just

1135
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,280
sign their certs for two minutes,

1136
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,480
just long enough to let you SSH to whatever box

1137
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,000
you're actually trying to get to.

1138
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,400
But then you can never use it again.

1139
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:01,920
Whoa.

1140
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,080
A two-minute SSH cert.

1141
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,240
That's it.

1142
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,880
So when they issue the certificate,

1143
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,200
they just can set a tiny expiration window?

1144
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:09,400
Yeah.

1145
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,440
And you can do other things like limit

1146
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,120
where that's coming from to a particular host or IP ranges,

1147
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,200
say.

1148
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,760
All of these just go so much in the other, more secure

1149
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,120
direction from adding a key to a server.

1150
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,440
And then never touching it again.

1151
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,080
But you'll want to check out other stuff.

1152
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,280
There's lots of neat ways to actually make this work.

1153
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:25,820
It's scale.

1154
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,120
We'll have links to all the tools, including Jeremy's

1155
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,240
excellent shrimp tool.

1156
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,800
Such a great name.

1157
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,040
It was nice for Jeremy to join us because he was in New

1158
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,720
Zealand, right?

1159
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,360
Yeah.

1160
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,640
You know, one other thing I loved about his talk

1161
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,120
is it was actually contained inside of an SSH certificate.

1162
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,840
He wrote up Python script to display the talk.

1163
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,960
And then you can actually, with the certificates,

1164
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,360
you can use the force command option

1165
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,120
to basically when you SSH to the server, it runs that command.

1166
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,960
And then the command ran his Python script,

1167
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,080
which then started up and displayed his presentation

1168
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,880
in the terminal.

1169
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,880
It's fantastic.

1170
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,360
I am both intrigued and a little perplexed

1171
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,440
by the idea of using Keybase chat.

1172
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,680
But I could see some advantages, especially

1173
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,800
in certain networking conditions.

1174
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,760
Keybase is something we should probably talk more about.

1175
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,200
Remember how SSH can do all these crazy things?

1176
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,080
I mean, I just kind of use it the most basic way possible.

1177
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,200
I feel fancy when I do x11 forwarding or copy a file.

1178
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,080
Oh, look at me.

1179
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,040
I'm fancy.

1180
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,520
That's pretty great.

1181
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
We will have links to all of that, as always.

1182
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,360
But before we go into the picks, I

1183
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,880
thought maybe we could do a little follow up

1184
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,600
on the old Arch upgrade we did last week, which did not

1185
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,320
go so well during the show.

1186
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,040
No, it did not.

1187
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,440
We got a new kernel, which wasn't yet

1188
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,200
supported by the ZFS on Linux project.

1189
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,640
So that didn't work.

1190
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,800
Pause there.

1191
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,280
Here's a great example of when you are kind of rolling

1192
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,080
the dice with Arch on a server, because there

1193
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,840
is no central control making sure

1194
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,600
that you don't release a kernel that

1195
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,160
is incompatible with the version of ZFS you're shipping.

1196
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,520
In a traditional distribution targeted specifically

1197
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,640
at the enterprise, those are the very kinds of things

1198
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,640
that they work out and prevent hitting you in an update.

1199
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,680
Now, we know that going in.

1200
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,600
We were just kind of playing fast and loose.

1201
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,000
And there is a side repo, like the Arch CFS repository,

1202
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,240
which has kernels and those things a little more in sync.

1203
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,120
We're not using that.

1204
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,280
This is just the stock kernel at the moment.

1205
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,400
At the moment?

1206
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,240
You did try the LTS kernel for a bit, but it had issues as well.

1207
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,960
Yeah, there was some bug going on.

1208
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,300
It looked like that was going to be resolved more quickly

1209
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,680
than the GPL symbol issues that seemed

1210
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,800
to be lurking for kernel 5.5.

1211
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,540
So the old snapshot and rollback system worked mostly smoothly,

1212
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,200
except for you had to go remove a particular folder or file

1213
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,080
somewhere, right?

1214
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,600
Yes.

1215
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,780
So when we didn't have support for ZFS, that didn't get mounted.

1216
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,560
We are integrating Docker on that host with ZFS.

1217
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,540
So it wants to go talk to ZFS.

1218
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,200
Doesn't find it, but does end up making a folder

1219
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,560
under VARlib Docker that when you restore ZFS support,

1220
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,400
means ZFS won't mount cleanly.

1221
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,320
Right, because now all of a sudden,

1222
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,200
something exists there.

1223
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,840
Just had to go clear that out, reboot, everything came back.

1224
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,440
So to be clear, we were using essentially

1225
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,560
butterfs snapshots to restore the system back.

1226
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,360
Yep.

1227
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,000
And then we have ZFS snapshots for the data.

1228
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,600
Exactly.

1229
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,120
But our particular issue was that the ZFS array would not

1230
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,120
mount after the kernel upgrade.

1231
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,160
And then even after we rolled back,

1232
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,200
it still failed to mount because it had created that directory.

1233
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,880
But nice fixing.

1234
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,680
I mean, you had it all fixed within a few minutes.

1235
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,960
Yeah, it wasn't a big deal.

1236
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,040
And you know, there's a lot of options that we could do.

1237
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,480
I'm sure that the latest kernel will get support before too

1238
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,800
long, so you can also do upgrades where you just leave

1239
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,200
the kernel out of upgrading, right?

1240
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,280
I mean, that's a fine kernel.

1241
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,680
Or install it with the LTS kernel.

1242
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,000
Or get an LTS kernel.

1243
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,840
That is probably the better idea.

1244
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,040
Yeah, this is legitimately why we're doing this,

1245
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,040
is so you don't have to.

1246
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,580
If you ever wondered what it's like,

1247
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,200
our philosophy here is arch with belts and suspenders

1248
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,320
and everything backed up, containerized or VM'd.

1249
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,480
Nothing actually running, for the most part,

1250
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,600
on the arch host box.

1251
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,680
That's the theory.

1252
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,720
And I think we kind of proved it out with these rollbacks.

1253
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,360
This issue here, with that directory getting created,

1254
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,640
only happened because we tried to bring the system all

1255
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,840
the way back up without the right CFS module.

1256
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,600
If we had not done that, that issue would not have happened.

1257
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,900
The rollbacks work, for the most part,

1258
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,200
with that one exception.

1259
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,240
And if I just remembered to delete that file

1260
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,600
before rebooting, it would have been.

1261
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,640
So potentially, if this ever were to happen again,

1262
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,160
that rollback process you went through

1263
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,840
would be 100% effective.

1264
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,480
So how long, in total, would you say,

1265
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,900
now that you've done it, if you ever had to do it again,

1266
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,680
would it take you?

1267
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,520
Five minutes.

1268
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,240
That's not bad.

1269
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,640
And a reboot in there as well, right?

1270
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,680
And a reboot, yeah.

1271
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,600
That varies depending on your slow server, like ours.

1272
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,760
We could have also just downgraded the kernel

1273
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,760
from the package cache as well.

1274
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,040
But it was more fun to use Snapper.

1275
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,320
Cubicle Nate wants me to just switch it over to SUSE.

1276
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,840
Yeah, one day we might try that.

1277
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,480
You never know.

1278
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,920
Yeah, that might be next in the old server reboot queue.

1279
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,280
See, what I'm concerned about is we'll be all like, hey,

1280
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,960
let's try out 2004 Ubuntu LTS.

1281
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,320
We'll put it on there.

1282
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,480
And then we'll have no reason to remove it.

1283
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,160
So we'll never try anything else again.

1284
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,440
Well, I was just thinking that with Arch.

1285
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,280
And OK, yeah, so we did have to futz around a little bit.

1286
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,160
That did take a little time to go investigate.

1287
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,120
And here I am on the ZFS on Linux GitHub looking at issues.

1288
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,760
But it also means I don't have to reinstall.

1289
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,080
There's no next Fedora that's coming out, or even

1290
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,080
a next LTS release.

1291
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,440
Like, that's just work I'm never going to do.

1292
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,320
Right, right.

1293
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,520
Probably not because, you know.

1294
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,960
Maybe you diffuse that work throughout the lifetime

1295
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,960
of the box instead of sort of bundling it all up at once.

1296
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,760
That's the theory.

1297
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,040
Although, you still have updates on all systems.

1298
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,040
They're not all just as crazy and wild.

1299
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,600
That's right.

1300
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,320
We've got not one, but two app picks this week.

1301
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,800
And one is a collaborative ASCII canvas.

1302
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,040
What?

1303
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,700
Yeah, I mean, haven't you ever just wanted

1304
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,640
to hang out with your buddies and do some collaborative ASCII?

1305
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,040
Because that's what it's all about.

1306
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,760
Yes, most days.

1307
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,880
Yeah, I mean, that's what?

1308
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,000
Like, every Thursday?

1309
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,800
Yeah, I mean, it's not collaborative antsy.

1310
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,560
But you know, ASCII will work for a time being.

1311
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,640
Or say you're SSH-ing around with your two-minute Netflix

1312
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,180
keys, and you want to get with your buds at Netflix for two

1313
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:18,000
minutes and jump onto the server and collaborate on some ASCII.

1314
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,760
SSH-ing around is one do.

1315
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,040
Yeah, SSH-ing around.

1316
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,840
That's what we do.

1317
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,560
I think we could do show notes in here.

1318
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,080
We'll just have to change our format a little bit.

1319
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,200
Go to two columns.

1320
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,560
So Kolaski, I guess that's how you pronounce it,

1321
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,000
is a pretty neat little app that'll

1322
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,960
allow you to collaboratively draw on an ASCII canvas

1323
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,880
together.

1324
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,360
Because why not?

1325
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,080
It's great.

1326
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,080
It's great fun.

1327
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,600
That's pretty good.

1328
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,040
But I'm trying to live the end curses lifestyle, Cheez.

1329
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,440
So what do you got for me if I just want

1330
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,520
to go end curses all the time?

1331
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,760
So yeah, I mean, if you want to end curse your way

1332
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,480
into a display manager, you can check out

1333
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:04,120
Lye, which is a terminal display manager, which essentially

1334
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,240
will allow you to log into all of your favorite desktop

1335
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,320
environments, Budgie, Cinnamon, Deepin, Enlightenment, Gnome.

1336
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:11,920
Wow.

1337
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,320
OK, I never knew I needed this, but I'm kind of in love.

1338
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,200
Finally.

1339
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,240
I mean, how long have we all been waiting?

1340
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,520
Well, doesn't it feel silly to have this whole display manager

1341
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,080
thing anyway?

1342
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,200
It just gets in the way.

1343
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:22,920
No kidding.

1344
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,560
And good news works on Dev1 too, so no system D required.

1345
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,240
And there's also a feature so that you

1346
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,400
can enable the PlayStation Doom fire effect.

1347
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:33,960
Oh, good.

1348
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,640
If you don't know what that is, I'll

1349
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,040
drop a link there into the channel.

1350
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,520
But it's just a beautiful ASCII fire effect.

1351
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,400
See how these things kind of tie together?

1352
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,880
You see, and people say Linux is just for geeks.

1353
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,480
Look at this, right?

1354
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,280
Come on.

1355
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,120
Super nerd fun.

1356
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,920
Big point made.

1357
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,960
Yeah, those are great.

1358
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,740
Thank you, Cheezzy.

1359
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,720
Those are really great.

1360
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,760
Even if you're not going to install these,

1361
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,880
I encourage you to check out the links because they

1362
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,280
have screenshots and videos.

1363
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,480
And they're just fun.

1364
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,240
Super fun.

1365
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,600
Speaking of fun, I hear they're about to have some fun over

1366
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,880
there at the Ubuntu podcast.

1367
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,160
Things are in the works again, Wimpy, for a brand new season.

1368
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,240
They most certainly are.

1369
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,200
Yes, season 13 confirmed.

1370
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,960
And we're in pre-season preparation stages

1371
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,280
at the moment.

1372
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,200
Should start recording in March.

1373
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,720
Was there any discussion to go right to 14,

1374
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,920
just for avoiding bad luck?

1375
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,200
No, we've decided to fully embrace the 13.

1376
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,880
Oh, I like it.

1377
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,800
Good for you, UbuntuPodcast.org.

1378
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,080
I'm going to give a mention for my website, ChrisLass.com.

1379
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,360
Not only do I have my Chris Lass cast there,

1380
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,080
but that's where I'll be keeping links to what I'm up to

1381
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,120
and some of my social profiles, like my Keybase,

1382
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,920
I think is on there, as well as future things.

1383
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,160
So check out ChrisLass.com for that.

1384
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,520
I think you have some awesome pictures of your RV up there,

1385
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,120
too, don't you?

1386
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,000
The new solar setup?

1387
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,240
That's on worklifeandrv.com, Cheesy.

1388
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,000
Which you can get to from Chris Lass.

1389
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,480
That's true.

1390
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,080
It is linked on chrislass.com.

1391
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,360
Hey-o, ba-dump-bump, shh.

1392
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,120
You know, we should mention, we haven't

1393
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:09,680
plugged for a little while.

1394
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,520
Speaking of pictures, there's the gallery.

1395
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,440
Oh, yeah.

1396
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,880
Jupiter.gallery.

1397
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,600
Go check out some of Cheesy's work there.

1398
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,920
That's going to be updated here at LinuxFest Northwest.

1399
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,160
And so if you are there and you do take pictures

1400
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,040
and you want to share them, just email me,

1401
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,600
and we'll get those up on the gallery.

1402
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,240
LinuxFest.

1403
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,920
Now, that's what I'm putting everything into now,

1404
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,520
putting everything into LinuxFest now.

1405
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,520
That's all I got.

1406
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,040
That's all I got.

1407
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,520
Go get more Wes Payne over at TechSnap.Systems.

1408
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,360
And he's on the Twitter.

1409
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,360
Where are you over there?

1410
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,160
At Wes Payne.

1411
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,680
How?

1412
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:38,960
Guess what?

1413
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,960
I'm at Chris Lass.

1414
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,480
Aw.

1415
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,480
Did you know?

1416
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,120
You did know.

1417
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:42,840
You can admit it.

1418
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,560
Yeah, I knew.

1419
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,200
At this point, if you didn't know,

1420
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,320
there'd be something seriously wrong, dude.

1421
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,320
I think even the network has one.

1422
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,040
I think it might.

1423
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,080
At Jupiter Signal.

1424
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,000
What?

1425
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,400
But does the podcast have one?

1426
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,720
At Linux Unplugged.

1427
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,120
Oh my gosh.

1428
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,040
We're all over Twitter.

1429
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,640
They're like tribbles.

1430
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,600
They're like tribbles.

1431
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,640
Of course, we're live.

1432
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:02,760
We'd love to have you here.

1433
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,880
It makes all the difference.

1434
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,560
Please join.

1435
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,280
jblive.tv on a Tuesday starts at noon Pacific.

1436
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,480
We usually actually get rolling a little earlier, 1130.

1437
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,240
Yeah, come in early for the excellent pre-show.

1438
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:12,520
Yeah.

1439
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,900
And of course, there's post-show.

1440
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,400
You hear a little tiny bit of it in the release version,

1441
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,640
but there's a lot more every Tuesday, jblive.tv.

1442
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,560
We'll see you then.

1443
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:50,240
We'll see you then.

1444
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:57,960
Tuesday Unplugged Program Oh!

1445
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,520
I think J-Bot had a little too much to drink at lunch, I think.

1446
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,700
You know, we shouldn't have given him access to the tab.

1447
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,840
I don't understand why J-Bot gets lunch on Tuesdays and we don't.

1448
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,480
How did that work out?

1449
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,580
How did he get that arrangement?

1450
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,960
We don't get lunch and J-Bot does?

1451
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,960
Come on.

1452
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,960
I don't like any of this.

1453
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,080
This is not a fair arrangement.

1454
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,320
So we will have to rerun the title votes here in a moment after Wes...

1455
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,320
Sometimes it saves it.

1456
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,320
Sometimes.

1457
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,880
I guess we'll go and try to rescue our other Arch server in production, which has been

1458
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,560
in production for a bajillion years, actually.

1459
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,200
Yeah, I'd like to point out this one was not my idea.

1460
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,960
It has been running forever, though.

1461
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,320
So when we get that going...

1462
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,320
Forever ever?

1463
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,080
Forever ever.

1464
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,640
In a very special way.

1465
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,680
So not one that we would recommend.

1466
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,240
So Brian, I thought you weren't going to be here.

1467
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,280
Did you just get all your work done super quick?

1468
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,960
Were you a super efficient photographer?

1469
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,600
Yeah, you know, the great thing about being a professional is you can get things done

1470
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,600
faster.

1471
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,600
So everybody's happy.

1472
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,600
Client's happy.

1473
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,600
Photographer's happy.

1474
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,120
I got lunch right in before heading here.

1475
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,120
It's all great.

1476
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,480
Brian, I don't believe for a moment you did something quickly.

1477
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,480
Nuh-uh.

1478
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,480
No way.

1479
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,480
No.

1480
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,280
Actually, though, when you see him bust out that camera, man, he'll just boom.

1481
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,760
The next thing you know, he's taking pictures.

1482
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,640
Like it just goes from zero to taking pictures.

1483
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,720
The camera, yes, but editing or anything.

1484
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,720
Oh, well, yeah.

1485
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,720
No.

1486
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,720
I just don't believe it.

1487
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,720
He's not done with the editing.

1488
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,720
He's not done with the camera.

1489
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,000
He just took the pictures today.

1490
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,600
How's the life on the farm been, Brent?

1491
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,600
Aren't you farm sitting?

1492
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,600
Oh, man, yeah.

1493
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,260
I got to farm sit the last few days for good, good friends of mine who have a farm about

1494
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,240
maybe like 45 minutes from here, and I've worked on their farm a few times.

1495
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,240
What?

1496
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,240
What?

1497
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,240
Well, hold on.

1498
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,240
We got a Chris Lastcast about this.

1499
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,120
This sounds castable, my friend.

1500
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,360
Did you take care of the animals?

1501
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,360
Yeah.

1502
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,400
So it's still the deep of winter here.

1503
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:48,160
So they only have like laying hens and their two dogs.

1504
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,160
How big's the farm?

1505
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,760
Oh, so they do mostly vegetables.

1506
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:57,800
So I think they're farming like two acres of like basically a huge collection of vegetables.

1507
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
Oh, I'd love to.

1508
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,800
Okay.

1509
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,800
All right.

1510
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,800
Don't tell me too much.

1511
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,800
Don't tell me too much.

1512
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,800
Keep it for the Chris Lastcast.

1513
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,800
I think this is castable.

1514
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,920
You know, I have a family farm on my mom's side up in Canada.

1515
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,920
What?

1516
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,920
How do I not know this?

1517
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,400
We got something to cast about, my friend.

1518
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,400
I mean, secret farms.

1519
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,360
I get like a mental image that Brent's just like out in the field picking carrots and

1520
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,460
stuff like just having a snack.

1521
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,960
That's what I did last time I was there.

1522
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,240
There's a version of me that just nopes out of the internet and I'm just like, I'm out

1523
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,720
and I just go to the farm and I spend the rest of my life on the farm.

1524
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,080
And I think it sounds wonderful.

1525
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,440
You know, Chris, I was actually, while I was there, I was trying to disconnect a little

1526
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:43,120
bit to use it as a means of just having a bit of a quieter, you know, 24 hours.

1527
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,600
And I was thinking back to the Linux unplugged episodes where we were talking about some

1528
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,760
strategies to kind of deal with burnout and stuff like that.

1529
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:57,240
I was thinking, hmm, something I try to do often is have these little like 24 48 hour

1530
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,640
little retreats and you don't have to go very far.

1531
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,640
You just have to go.

1532
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,640
All right, hold on.

1533
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,640
I got, I got a response.

1534
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,640
We can't talk about this.

1535
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,640
We can't, we gotta save it.

1536
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,640
Write that down.

1537
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,640
You're getting too deep, boys.

1538
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,640
I got it.

1539
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:08,640
I have the notebook.

1540
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,640
You write it.

1541
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,640
I didn't bring it in here with me today.

1542
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,640
That's something we should.

1543
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,640
I know.

1544
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,000
I do have a whole podcast about keeping notes in the book.

1545
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I got a backup notebook.

1546
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,320
It's just not my notebook, so I'm not as inclined to want to write in it.

1547
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,320
You know what I mean?

1548
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Like I've got an attachment to my notebook.

1549
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:26,040
I'll also point out the six computers that are around.

1550
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,080
I'm no longer writing on computers anymore, Wes.

1551
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,080
So actually I have specific note insights I'd like to share too.

1552
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,520
Are you also hanging your clothes up on the clothesline?

1553
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,960
Just sort of becoming Brent?

1554
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,960
I wish.

1555
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,960
I wish.

1556
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,440
I tell you what, I'd consider it if I could make this mate jacket last another few years,

1557
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,440
I think I'd do it.

1558
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,440
I'm still wimpy.

1559
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,240
Oh my God, what are the chances the day you show up I'm wearing the mate jacket?

1560
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,240
I think you might have summoned it.

1561
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,240
I think I did.

1562
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,240
Well, there you go.

1563
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,120
Yeah, I think that's how it works.

1564
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,120
That is so funny.

1565
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,120
Yeah.

1566
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,880
I just started wearing it and oh wow, that's a weird way.

1567
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,160
You're going to have to start wearing it every Tuesday.

1568
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:04,120
I got mine the same time I sent yours over and it's still in regular use.

1569
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,120
Yep.

1570
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,640
It's just the perfect temperature this time of year right now for it.

1571
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,640
It's not too much.

1572
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,640
It's not too little.

1573
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:15,000
And it accommodates my ever expanding sizes because they cut my... I seem to just fluctuate

1574
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,760
in size all the time now and it sticks with me.

1575
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:40,760
I appreciate that too.
