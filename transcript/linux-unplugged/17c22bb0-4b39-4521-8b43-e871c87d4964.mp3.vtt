WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.720
I went on a distro desktop excursion that landed me on an open seuss over the last week really tell me about this

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
okay, so a a

00:10.000 --> 00:15.960
Sort of like a bend like a like a like a bender if you will on like you binged you you went on a ram

00:15.960 --> 00:20.960
Just row bender. Oh, yeah, it was it was a heck of a bender. That's for sure. I

00:21.800 --> 00:25.700
Like the rampage. I think that's also okay. Tell me about it. Tell me about this journey and

00:25.700 --> 00:29.740
Sir, what were you striving for and did you find it?

00:30.580 --> 00:33.900
Well, I thought I was going to try out Katie eat so I

00:34.820 --> 00:36.060
Okay, okay

00:36.060 --> 00:39.900
Katie e kubun to make sense. Sure. No, let's do it. It's in way

00:39.900 --> 00:43.040
Have you heard of the neon have you heard of their neon the neon project stuff for you?

00:43.040 --> 00:46.920
I didn't want to do that because of it pulling in the jet

00:47.540 --> 00:53.180
Repos and everything. It's just a little bit too hard to hardcore. Yeah, sure. Yeah, so I

00:53.180 --> 00:59.180
I installed it. I had some problems and I thought okay. Well install the back ports. Maybe they'll fix it

00:59.180 --> 01:03.060
Well fix about half of the problems. It gave me more problems

01:04.580 --> 01:09.180
That was not a solution for me so then I was like, well, I'm already on Ubuntu. Let's

01:10.440 --> 01:15.300
Remove everything but the base strip it down and let's try Ubuntu Ubuntu mate

01:15.900 --> 01:20.020
Okay, so you just so you're like, I'm not even gonna go Katie. I'm gonna go a totally different route

01:20.020 --> 01:24.000
Yeah, we're just like, yeah, let's go a different route. Yeah. Okay. All right, so

01:25.060 --> 01:26.980
Try that out

01:26.980 --> 01:32.380
Just wasn't for me. Now that being said a lot of what was on there

01:33.180 --> 01:35.180
really did impress me but

01:36.180 --> 01:40.760
There were just some things that were breaking like the sound card settings and whatnot

01:41.380 --> 01:43.940
suddenly, I'd find my sound cards were disabled if I

01:45.140 --> 01:47.700
Walk between settings too many times stuff like that

01:47.700 --> 01:53.300
So it was a no-go and I decided to go open Susie and try Katie again

01:53.300 --> 01:57.500
Cuz why not because the issue I was having was with k-mail and the PIM system

01:58.900 --> 02:01.500
It could went who has a bad SQL back-end

02:02.820 --> 02:03.820
Package

02:03.820 --> 02:10.500
well, I still couldn't get the PIM to work which is sucks because email is important to me and

02:11.140 --> 02:16.260
I wanted to use k-mail because I'd like that particular client. And if I'm on Katie, why not?

02:16.260 --> 02:17.780
Katie why not?

02:17.780 --> 02:23.740
So that wasn't a solution for me. So I'm back on gnome and open Susie

02:24.300 --> 02:28.740
Alright, so I got I mean the I think the elephant in the room. I mean just everybody's got to know

02:29.180 --> 02:33.780
Why not enter gross and Katie because then you would get a rolling version of Katie

02:35.740 --> 02:39.260
It never really crossed my mind have you used this in the past

02:40.700 --> 02:42.700
Susa yes

02:42.700 --> 02:45.540
I mean if it's seems like a good reason right there

02:46.460 --> 02:50.460
This is Linux unplugged episode 134 for March 1st

02:51.580 --> 02:53.580
2016

03:03.380 --> 03:09.500
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's been getting its nostalgia on this afternoon. My name is Chris

03:09.500 --> 03:15.420
My name is Wes. Hey there Wes. Yeah, I can't help it. We started talking about Mario. It's just too much fun

03:15.420 --> 03:19.340
Yeah, and then I have to I have to admit I got a little distracted with a soundboard

03:19.620 --> 03:21.740
Sometimes it's just too there's no judgment here

03:21.740 --> 03:27.500
I will give you $10 if you can sneak one of those in on the next text. Okay, good. Very nice. Haha. I'll try

03:27.500 --> 03:32.420
Well, here's what I'm gonna do to make it up for you. Great show today coming up on this week's episode of Linux unplugged

03:32.420 --> 03:38.700
We got some updates from some of our favorite distros out there wimpy's here to give us an update specifically about mate

03:38.700 --> 03:40.700
We're gonna talk a little bit Raspberry Pi

03:41.620 --> 03:46.740
Threesies yeah, yeah later on in the show, too. I did a pretty good job of putting my foot in my mouth

03:46.740 --> 03:52.540
Well, I I accidentally left out an important piece of information on Sunday show the audience noticed a little errata

03:52.620 --> 03:59.020
Wes a little errata in today's episode of the unplugged program and actually I'm hoping we get to a wider discussion about what the core

03:59.020 --> 04:04.300
Issue is and if maybe it's time we just get off our porches and let the kids play on our lawn

04:04.300 --> 04:06.300
I won't spoil it for you. Oh

04:06.300 --> 04:08.340
also

04:08.340 --> 04:14.820
Intel the Intel Atom x3. They got this great new idea. Let me let me tell you how it works

04:14.820 --> 04:18.300
Well, you hook it up. You took up your Android phone you hook it up Wes

04:19.340 --> 04:22.020
Desktop environment. Well, I'm the Android new

04:22.940 --> 04:25.980
Convergence is what the eye it's a new word. They're using it

04:25.980 --> 04:30.100
They're not gonna make sense. You got to check it out something from Intel running Debian

04:30.100 --> 04:33.180
We'll be talking about that on today's episode of the unplugged program

04:33.180 --> 04:38.900
We've also got a bunch of other goodies in there including some interesting follow-up from the mint team

04:39.140 --> 04:41.260
Which is actually gonna be the first thing when we cover

04:42.820 --> 04:44.560
Before we get there though

04:44.560 --> 04:46.560
Wes brought us a new beer

04:47.180 --> 04:49.660
Something that has been hitting me in the face

04:49.660 --> 04:53.860
So I'll bring in the mumble room to they can so we can chat about this and see it with them and see what they think

04:53.860 --> 04:56.020
About a time appropriate greetings their virtual log. Hello

04:56.020 --> 05:03.980
Hello, so I've had the I've had the privilege of Wes stopping by and

05:04.900 --> 05:06.900
You know bringing beers with him

05:07.060 --> 05:10.420
Stopping by the app and I'm like hey Wes if you got this beer you might as well sit in and do a show and then

05:10.420 --> 05:12.420
You know one thing leads to another so

05:13.780 --> 05:15.660
Every week we've been trying different stuff now

05:15.660 --> 05:23.340
This one's a local from just south of us down in Oregon and it's called the wanderlust Indian pale ale fresh hops

05:23.340 --> 05:26.660
Bold flavor from America's Northwest

05:27.900 --> 05:29.260
6.2%

05:29.260 --> 05:32.340
Alcohol by volume and I'm like geez this thing's really kicking me in the face West

05:32.340 --> 05:35.660
I'm like, I'm like this is really strong like this is where the Mario came from

05:35.660 --> 05:41.100
Yeah, it was a lot of taste. It has a 89 score on beer advocate, but here's what's going on with this thing

05:41.100 --> 05:43.460
They've put grapefruit in here. They got grapefruit

05:43.460 --> 05:48.220
So we're drinking a beer that's got grapefruit in so if you're sitting around having a having yourself a virtual log meeting

05:48.380 --> 05:52.060
Drink drink drink yourself a citrusy beer and you'll be right in step with us

05:52.060 --> 05:55.700
Anyways moving on from the beer of the day today

05:56.620 --> 05:59.300
big story from last week was Linux mint and

05:59.800 --> 06:05.620
The hack to the Linux mint website via WordPress which led to compromising ISO images. Yeah, no good

06:06.100 --> 06:10.860
Big discussion around that and since then we have an update from the mint project

06:11.620 --> 06:13.620
Clam has gone to the Linux mint blog and

06:14.300 --> 06:16.300
He's posted

06:16.300 --> 06:19.980
Part of the monthly news update that he does and in here he addresses the recent attack

06:19.980 --> 06:23.180
So I just thought maybe we'd go through some of this and gets you know, just get an update directly from him

06:23.180 --> 06:26.460
Yeah, it's a pretty big pretty big post. Yeah, and I've pulled out a few sections here

06:26.460 --> 06:29.900
He says I'd like to thank the PHP BB team and automatic the company behind

06:30.380 --> 06:33.540
WordPress.com for reaching out to see if they could help us in any way

06:34.220 --> 06:37.140
I'd also like to thank Avast for working with us on this

06:38.100 --> 06:41.420
They contacted us and offered to help analyze the fake ISO

06:41.420 --> 06:45.220
We gave them a copy of it and all the info we already had a day later

06:45.220 --> 06:47.420
They came back with a full malware analysis

06:47.420 --> 06:52.700
And they were able to issue an update to warn people who might still be affected by it. Avast also perched

06:53.300 --> 06:55.900
Pushed updates toward their own users who run Avast

06:56.540 --> 07:04.700
To block the servers finally the addresses of the malware connecting to the server were shut down or blacklisted by

07:04.700 --> 07:10.460
Kaspersky's DNS sinkholes. I've been really impressed by Avast and the awesome work they did it helped us react a lot quicker

07:11.660 --> 07:13.660
They also thank a few other people

07:13.660 --> 07:17.220
They also talk about a new partnership they have

07:18.220 --> 07:21.020
For security auditing, but I want to jump ahead a little bit in the article

07:22.340 --> 07:25.060
Aspects which could be used in future attacks. This was like

07:25.060 --> 07:29.980
What did you learn is what I'm thinking right so here's what he says to protect you and reduce the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks

07:31.220 --> 07:33.460
Almost all of our websites will be moved to HTTPS

07:34.180 --> 07:41.240
So you are guaranteed you were looking at the real Linux Mint server and the communication between you and us is encrypted so HTTPS

07:41.240 --> 07:43.240
going on on Mint sites

07:43.920 --> 07:46.400
To make ISO verification more accurate

07:46.880 --> 07:52.080
We will communicate SHA256 sums and GPG information more prominently going forward

07:52.880 --> 07:59.040
MD5 was displayed as a primary means of verification with SHA256 and GPG being available for people who really wanted them

08:00.080 --> 08:06.560
We will review the way this information is shown and try to make more people use SHA256 and hopefully also GPG by default now

08:06.560 --> 08:09.720
This seems like a direct response to yes. It does you impressed by that?

08:09.720 --> 08:10.960
Yeah

08:10.960 --> 08:16.840
Those are good things. I do note that the I'm looking at the blog right now. Mm-hmm not using HTTPS

08:16.840 --> 08:18.840
I didn't type that. I know I know

08:19.000 --> 08:23.720
Yeah, I noticed that too. I mean it says it's coming. Yeah, you're right though something else

08:25.280 --> 08:29.680
Aspects aspects would relate to the operating system. We'll be considering re-adding GFU

08:30.440 --> 08:33.220
FW GU FW which is the firewall config tool

08:33.880 --> 08:36.840
To the default software selection what happened was a very uncommon

08:36.840 --> 08:42.840
But as our project and Linux in general are getting more popular our operating system is going more and more of a target

08:43.620 --> 08:48.000
We cannot ignore the threat of malware and think that it only affects windows

08:48.000 --> 08:53.240
So maybe a firewall by default and he says thanks to all the people who donate to us and to all of our sponsors

08:53.240 --> 08:57.180
We feel built guilty this month a bit guilty this month because the attacks took all of our focus

08:57.180 --> 09:02.160
We didn't work on mint as much as we wanted there are some really cool things going on in development

09:02.920 --> 09:05.280
Like there's now four X apps projects

09:05.280 --> 09:12.720
XED X reader X player and X viewer most of the mint tools were migrated to Python 3 GTK 3 and g-settings and

09:12.840 --> 09:15.540
given better HD HDPI support

09:16.880 --> 09:22.700
And we're looking at improved out-of-the-box touchpad support, but he actually mentions a couple of times in this post here

09:23.300 --> 09:27.920
How it really sucks that this thing robbed development time away from the project mm-hmm?

09:28.040 --> 09:30.120
And he really seems to be kind of sore so overall

09:30.120 --> 09:36.160
A mumble room what are your thoughts on sort of mints answers and and improvements here good enough a?

09:36.920 --> 09:40.160
Good start anybody have a take yeah, why?

09:40.680 --> 09:42.680
Has it taken this to?

09:43.280 --> 09:45.280
GPG sign his

09:45.360 --> 09:48.920
ISO sums I've looked back over the ISOs and other distros

09:49.280 --> 09:53.600
We're doing this more than 10 years ago. Why is he only doing it now?

09:53.600 --> 10:00.400
I mean weren't they available before just not they were hard to find I think that was my take from it, but I'm not sure

10:01.280 --> 10:03.960
But it's a good point. I mean it should be it feels to me that

10:04.600 --> 10:07.920
Like like this is the keys focused on development and continuing operating system

10:07.920 --> 10:11.200
And I think the popularity of Linux mint shows that he's doing a good job

10:11.200 --> 10:13.240
Or at least there's people that really appreciate what they're doing

10:13.240 --> 10:17.400
But they really need someone in the community to step up and you know first

10:17.400 --> 10:22.880
Make it the first priority to do these kind of admin jobs that you can't half-ass when you're a big community

10:23.640 --> 10:25.640
Right you become a massive

10:25.640 --> 10:31.600
Attack service when you when you're that popular and there's no doubting that Linux mint is very popular

10:31.600 --> 10:38.480
And so you've got to take care of those things because if you don't stuff like this happens. It's it's you know 101

10:38.480 --> 10:41.480
Well, here's what here's what actually grabbed my attention in the blog post

10:42.680 --> 10:46.040
Because I think when we talk about mint there are a lot of things that

10:46.040 --> 10:51.360
When we talk about mint there everybody has everybody who's not like a big mint fan has a list of mint issues

10:51.360 --> 10:52.520
Oh, I don't like that

10:52.520 --> 10:57.560
They do X or I don't like that they don't do kernel updates or whatever right I don't like they don't do kernel updates

10:57.560 --> 10:59.760
It's a pretty common one and Clem

11:00.320 --> 11:02.320
address that in this blog post

11:02.560 --> 11:09.060
One of the key advantages of Linux mint is it stability versus security policy

11:09.680 --> 11:13.960
The level of information shown at the at the update management is configurable

11:13.960 --> 11:19.040
It puts the power in the hands of the user which is something that is lacking in many other operating systems

11:19.640 --> 11:23.160
For all that power to be an asset though users need to understand why?

11:23.720 --> 11:25.720
And what is at play?

11:25.940 --> 11:31.020
So he's kind of admitting that maybe they could do a better job of informing users about the decisions, but essentially saying

11:31.760 --> 11:33.540
We're keeping this we're gonna prove it

11:33.540 --> 11:34.640
We're gonna continue to improve it

11:34.640 --> 11:39.320
But we're keeping this policy of not necessarily doing kernel updates by default because it's stability versus security

11:39.320 --> 11:45.700
Now, why do I bring that up? I bring that up because I think stability versus security stability versus security security

11:45.700 --> 11:51.400
I think you can use that rationale in millions of ways when you're managing a project and I think what it was

11:51.840 --> 11:54.160
don't and to answer your question directly poppy is

11:55.480 --> 11:59.240
steps were taken that seemed sufficient for the job at hand and

12:00.680 --> 12:04.840
Looking at it practically this just didn't this extra work just didn't need to be done. It wasn't important

12:04.840 --> 12:11.120
And I think that's been readdressed and reevaluated now. That's my take

12:12.400 --> 12:14.400
They'll be interesting to see what comes of this, you know

12:14.840 --> 12:18.840
If there's any more incidents if things kind of just pick up if they take these things more seriously

12:19.120 --> 12:21.700
Yeah, it seems like and they've got they've got like I said here

12:21.700 --> 12:25.360
They've got to deal with that with the group that's gonna continue to audit and check in on their security

12:25.920 --> 12:29.760
So that seems like a good thing and it's nice to have a good update

12:30.640 --> 12:33.200
Yeah, transparency is key in these kinds of things. I

12:33.200 --> 12:36.560
Guess in the grand scheme of things it could have been a lot worse

12:37.080 --> 12:41.320
Right. And so this is you know, this is a good way to sort of relatively short. Yeah

12:42.080 --> 12:47.120
Didn't last very long been pretty clear on pretty pretty clear on communication. So alright cool

12:48.160 --> 12:50.920
Interesting just to get an update from the mint team. And so I wanted to follow up on that

12:50.920 --> 12:55.020
I also figure why don't we shine a little light on the fedora project?

12:55.160 --> 12:58.720
You know them fedora guys are working on a new release fedora guys and gals, of course

12:58.720 --> 13:05.880
And so Matthew Miller sat down with PC world and I did a little interview. I believe with Chris Hoffman

13:06.400 --> 13:11.200
talking about fedora and its growth and some of the directions fedora is going in and

13:12.480 --> 13:14.760
West this doesn't sound like your father's fedora

13:14.760 --> 13:19.720
No, it does not fedora wants to start converting people who aren't already Linux users over to the platform

13:19.720 --> 13:24.880
But they don't mean targeting the average desktop user fedora workstation is still focused on being developer target environment

13:24.880 --> 13:27.840
But as Miller says developers are people too

13:27.840 --> 13:35.600
Here's the part though that I thought was interesting ready for this fedora has never officially supported like drivers and codecs

13:36.240 --> 13:40.160
Because it has a focus on free software and has no plans to do so. However

13:41.160 --> 13:43.160
Now these aren't really plans

13:44.960 --> 13:49.000
Fedora project would like to make the process of installing them less painful and

13:49.480 --> 13:53.420
There will be a big conversation about that in the next year direct quote from Miller

13:53.420 --> 13:59.420
If you need to have those graphics drivers and you're a grown-up you can make that decision yourself. Hey

14:01.460 --> 14:04.060
Now this is the fedora that

14:04.540 --> 14:08.580
Really sparked the whole debate on mono not being included by default in Linux, right?

14:08.580 --> 14:10.960
This is the fedora that has made it

14:11.140 --> 14:17.920
So such that there are spin-offs like Aurora that make actually just using some of this stuff reasonable and there's a group RPM fusion

14:17.920 --> 14:21.440
It's been around forever to try to fill in some of the rough spots

14:21.440 --> 14:24.780
so this is a for this is a fedora that once was

14:26.460 --> 14:31.780
That's that's not free software we won't we won't accommodate that too well, you know if you want to be a grown-up and

14:33.420 --> 14:36.740
Install your own graphics driver. That's that choice. You want to be a grown-up?

14:36.740 --> 14:40.380
I thought that was pretty interesting wording mumble room. Am I reading too much into this?

14:42.380 --> 14:44.380
Anybody want to be a grown-up

14:44.660 --> 14:46.100
so

14:46.100 --> 14:48.100
It's kind of interesting

14:48.100 --> 14:53.540
It's it's kind of a different step from where they have been and more towards

14:53.700 --> 15:00.780
Kind of where a lot of other people have been for a while. I think it's I think it's acknowledging that you know

15:00.780 --> 15:07.020
Maybe we can continue to be a free software distro and then also, you know, give a better option

15:07.020 --> 15:13.140
I like kind of like the Debian room. I like producer q5 sis. This is the fedora. We need not the fedora

15:13.140 --> 15:19.780
We deserve it might be might be reverse of that but fedora 24 will also feature a layered image build service

15:20.100 --> 15:24.780
Which will be designed to make creating and providing containers as easy as creating a standard RPM package

15:25.100 --> 15:31.420
Fedora also includes a preview of XTG apps, which enables sandbox desktop and Wayland will make sandboxing possible as well

15:31.420 --> 15:32.720
Wayland is gonna be in there

15:32.720 --> 15:36.820
They said we wanted to have something that kind of brings fedora activities to the visible to the web

15:37.080 --> 15:40.620
So fedora hubs is going to be a new web-based social media portal

15:40.620 --> 15:46.460
Where information about fedora is going to be available and it should also foster interactions. For example, they say this is a new project

15:46.460 --> 15:50.900
They'll be working on people on the fedora design team could collaborate and share designs in that hub

15:51.140 --> 15:56.300
It's designed to make it easier jump in so you don't have to learn mailing list cultures or IRC etiquette get involved

15:56.420 --> 15:59.500
They're gonna have a new way to share with people online. I see here

15:59.500 --> 16:04.180
They've also got notifications when long-running terminal jobs and that's sweet. That's nice

16:04.180 --> 16:08.380
I think that's been there for a little bit. Yeah, but that is nice. I do like that. Yeah, I

16:08.380 --> 16:11.940
I like this a layered imaging approach for making containers

16:11.940 --> 16:16.660
But I tell you what this new tone, which I'm not necessarily disagreeing with but I think it's gonna upset some longtime hardcore

16:17.340 --> 16:20.340
Fedora. Yeah, I'm curious what that means make it less painful

16:21.180 --> 16:27.640
Yeah, see how far they go. I am the positioning is a strong one. Well if you want to be an adult, right?

16:27.640 --> 16:33.040
That's a strong loaded sentence. Yeah. Yeah, that is a loaded sentence. Mr. Wimpy. Are you present sir?

16:33.040 --> 16:39.240
Present. All right present and accounted for so wimpy after the break here. I want to chat with you about the the

16:39.800 --> 16:41.640
Ubuntu Mate update that you just posted

16:41.640 --> 16:47.680
We'll save the Raspberry Pi 3 stuff for a little bit if we can but I want to since we just did a fedora update and

16:48.240 --> 16:50.240
We just did a mint update

16:50.480 --> 16:55.440
Mm-hmm. We should do an Ubuntu Mate update. It's only fair. Yeah, it's only fair. Well, that's very kind. Right, right

16:55.440 --> 16:59.600
And you had a good post. It was very nice. So I want to talk about that. So first

16:59.600 --> 17:06.780
So first I'll mention our friends at DigitalOcean head over to DigitalOcean.com and support this show and get yourself an awesome Linux rig

17:06.880 --> 17:08.880
For like totes free for two months

17:09.200 --> 17:13.880
When you use our special promo code DO unplugged one word lowercase give you a $10 credit

17:14.400 --> 17:17.480
Boom you go over there spin up a $5 rig in less than 55 seconds

17:17.960 --> 17:23.760
For $5 you can get 500 megabytes around. Yeah, yeah a 20 gigabyte SSDs because they're all SSDs West

17:23.760 --> 17:28.760
No way they is one CPU that's blazing fast and a terabyte of transfer

17:28.760 --> 17:34.720
They got Ubuntu's up in there. They got the Debian's they got the fedoras the sent OS is they got the core OS

17:35.200 --> 17:40.320
Did I mention they even have free BSD? No, I have to admit it West it is true

17:40.320 --> 17:44.280
The rumors are true and it runs like a boss. That is also true

17:44.280 --> 17:48.640
They have a HTML 5 console so you can log on the website and get access right there

17:48.760 --> 17:53.400
From post all the way up to the login, which I can you know, I just can't do without that

17:53.400 --> 17:57.000
Sometimes you don't need it that much. But when you really need it, you're just like, yes, that's so easy

17:57.000 --> 18:00.760
That is totally the thing their interface is super intuitive. Very straightforward

18:00.760 --> 18:05.780
If you're managing one droplet many droplets, you want to deploy an entire application stack or a base Linux rig?

18:05.780 --> 18:10.400
It's nice and easy. They got data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Germany, Toronto

18:12.280 --> 18:14.280
Rumors of a new one opening up soon

18:15.040 --> 18:18.040
I won't say too much. I don't want to get in trouble, but there are rumors

18:19.000 --> 18:25.360
Rumors about a new data center very soon. So go check them out. They have a straightforward API, which means in all practical terms

18:25.360 --> 18:27.920
There's just a ton of really great open source code already written

18:27.920 --> 18:33.200
You can take advantage of including libraries if you do that Python thing you heard of that. Oh, I love that

18:33.200 --> 18:36.120
You heard of the Python? Yeah. Yeah, have you heard of the pearl?

18:37.040 --> 18:42.560
Yes, yeah the pearl. Yeah, I am familiar. They got libraries for those things and others West

18:42.560 --> 18:47.400
I it's all new to me something to do with computers, but you should check it out. Don't listen to Chris

18:47.400 --> 18:48.000
He doesn't know anything

18:48.000 --> 18:53.240
Nope, never heard of these things before but I do know you can use the promo code do unplugged over digital ocean.com get yourself

18:53.240 --> 18:55.520
a $10 credit and support this show and by the way

18:56.680 --> 19:02.040
Check this out how to use ansible and tink VPN to secure your server infrastructure now. You've talked about this

19:02.040 --> 19:05.840
That's exactly what I do. I will check that out. We'll have a report back on it

19:05.840 --> 19:09.760
This is a heck of a graph. Oh, man. This is look at these graphics

19:09.760 --> 19:15.080
Look at the look at the way they do all the commands there the config files nice and easy digital ocean is great tutorials

19:15.080 --> 19:20.760
Beautiful. Oh, man. That's just a great service digital ocean.com use the promo code do unplugged in a big. Thank you to digital ocean

19:20.760 --> 19:28.560
for sponsoring the unplugged program alright, mr. Wimpy, so I noticed over on the Ubuntu dashboard a org slash blog blog

19:29.960 --> 19:35.360
That there is a February 2016 supporters update, and I don't know Wes

19:35.360 --> 19:40.120
I I don't know if you saw this number here, and I maybe I'm reading something wrong here

19:41.280 --> 19:47.320
Is are you if I am I correct in it looking at there has been $1,500 sent up upstream now

19:47.320 --> 19:51.400
Is this is this right am I miss reading something? This is this is astounding

19:52.840 --> 19:59.200
Yeah, I don't I don't quite know what the currency conversion is so it's a touch over 1500 euros, and I think oh, it's around

19:59.880 --> 20:03.440
15 to 1600 yeah, something like that 1668 yeah

20:05.000 --> 20:09.440
That is that's great so wimpy just for those who maybe are not familiar

20:09.760 --> 20:14.400
There's various methods that your project is collecting funds. I know one of them is patreon

20:14.400 --> 20:18.880
That's how I do it, but there's other methods right mm-hmm. Yep. There's patreon and

20:19.720 --> 20:21.720
then people who

20:22.480 --> 20:27.720
Choose to so on the download page. We put a thing out saying you know if everyone

20:28.360 --> 20:33.480
tipped us two dollars fifty for a download there'd be enough to pay for the full-time development of

20:34.280 --> 20:41.240
Ubuntu mate and the mate desktop and a good number of people actually take us up on that invitation and

20:41.240 --> 20:45.360
pay some money when they download and

20:47.560 --> 20:55.760
Yeah, we've we've been able to plow a good deal of that money back into the upstream developers that have been helping with

20:56.240 --> 21:03.040
Either Ubuntu Marte or the Marte desktop. I really like wow I think that's such a cool model and so

21:03.440 --> 21:09.160
In February now not only as there been a a pretty good amount of fundraising

21:09.160 --> 21:13.320
Is this the is this your highest one reason? How is this going for you exactly is it continuing to trend upwards?

21:13.320 --> 21:17.680
Is it leveled off? What's that like this? This is the most we've done in a month

21:17.680 --> 21:21.840
I think up to this up to this point. We've done about

21:23.280 --> 21:28.080
$3,000 so with this on top it's about four and a half thousand dollars something like that. We've done

21:28.800 --> 21:32.240
Over the course of the project, but the last few months

21:32.960 --> 21:37.000
We're having some server restructuring and the bandwidth bills

21:37.000 --> 21:42.560
For the Raspberry Pi stuff. We're just massive. Oh, man. So that was that was

21:44.200 --> 21:49.680
I was wondering like what is the one of the most expensive aspects of running distro if it is bandwidth if it's what yeah

21:49.680 --> 21:57.200
Yeah, the the Raspberry Pi 2 downloads are almost equivalent to that donation figure that you're seeing there every month Wow

21:57.360 --> 22:00.860
Yeah, hmm. Yeah, and you'd hope people would use torrents

22:00.860 --> 22:05.080
But I suppose it's just not feasible for everybody a lot of people do use the torrents

22:05.080 --> 22:07.640
But we we maintain a couple of web seeds to keep

22:08.400 --> 22:09.920
Taking over

22:09.920 --> 22:11.920
That's that's where it goes. Yeah

22:13.520 --> 22:18.680
Because you want them to have it fast download so if the downloads not going fast the web seed is it's it's all part of

22:18.680 --> 22:25.440
The experience, you know a lot of people they click download and they expect it to come down as fast as their broadband will allow them

22:25.440 --> 22:33.160
and if your project is not doing that that's immediately a black mark, so we try to keep the

22:33.160 --> 22:36.280
The torrents well the well seeded

22:36.920 --> 22:38.920
but yeah, so we've

22:39.200 --> 22:41.640
the real the real thing for this here is that

22:42.600 --> 22:45.480
We had a lot of work that needed to be done in

22:46.640 --> 22:48.120
February

22:48.120 --> 22:53.840
Because I've started a new job not so long ago. I haven't had as much time to dedicate to the project

22:54.360 --> 22:57.840
But with the money coming in and some restructuring on the server side

22:57.840 --> 23:03.960
We've been able to reuse the money that we've we've had coming in on the development side

23:03.960 --> 23:06.160
So this month we've been able to approach

23:06.880 --> 23:08.720
eight developers

23:08.720 --> 23:10.720
and ask them to do

23:11.440 --> 23:17.760
Bodies of work for either Ubuntu Marte or the Marte desktop and they've all come through they've all delivered

23:18.920 --> 23:24.040
We're not paying them anywhere near you know, what what they're actually doing some cases

23:24.040 --> 23:28.560
They're getting close to market rate in a few cases. They've they've put in weeks worth of effort

23:29.480 --> 23:31.480
You know for not much money at all

23:34.480 --> 23:39.800
You're getting so you're hiring these developers to essentially massage things the way you want to deliver

23:40.280 --> 23:45.560
The desktop the way you are right not hire so much as sort of incentivize

23:46.120 --> 23:51.960
Yeah, not even that. I mean in most cases when I approach these guys and say look I'd really like this doing

23:51.960 --> 23:54.700
Would you be prepared to do it? We can offer you this

23:55.120 --> 23:59.300
By and large the first response is and I don't want any money. I

23:59.880 --> 24:01.400
Will just do it

24:01.400 --> 24:07.640
But and there are there are people on that are not on this list because we've approached them and they've simply said I don't

24:07.640 --> 24:11.760
I don't want any money. I'm just going to do it and all of these people was were saying

24:12.280 --> 24:14.280
that's not necessary, but I

24:14.280 --> 24:21.480
Want so for example, some of the guys on this list, they've used the money to buy equipment to help them

24:22.440 --> 24:26.200
Develop for Marte desktop or urban to Marte. That's great

24:26.200 --> 24:29.640
So that's where it sort of comes full circle

24:29.960 --> 24:34.600
Giving them something that they can use that they can then plow back in and one of the guys

24:34.840 --> 24:36.840
One of the one of the guys just said

24:38.040 --> 24:42.120
I'm gonna use the money to buy a comfortable chair, you know, it's very simple

24:42.120 --> 24:47.800
I like that, but he had an uncomfortable chair. He was never comfortable sat at his computer. He's a student

24:48.360 --> 24:52.840
I believe and he just said I'm going to go out and buy a new chair tomorrow

24:52.920 --> 24:57.880
And I thought that was lovely. It looks like a couple of folks were involved in porting the Mate desktop over to GTK 3

24:58.920 --> 25:02.120
Yeah, so Wolfgang and Vlad they're both core Marte

25:02.840 --> 25:08.600
Desktop developers and they're primarily working on that porting effort and they have been for months

25:09.720 --> 25:11.000
and I

25:11.000 --> 25:12.920
It's it's essential work

25:12.920 --> 25:18.920
It's a thankless task because there are all sorts of edge cases and weird bugs that that come up

25:19.480 --> 25:22.920
And that hundred dollars that they each got is like nothing

25:23.640 --> 25:29.180
Because for weeks and months of effort, but it's it's a thank you very much. You know, your efforts are well recognized

25:29.880 --> 25:34.920
Appreciate what you're doing. This is the future. Tell me about Mate integration into synapse. What's this about?

25:36.200 --> 25:38.200
uh, right, so

25:38.520 --> 25:40.520
the back end of last year

25:40.520 --> 25:47.240
I worked with uh, Rico the uh, the maintainer for synapse and we added some of the Mate

25:48.420 --> 25:50.360
integration to synapse

25:50.360 --> 25:51.560
and I

25:51.560 --> 25:56.040
Was supposed to come back and do that work finish it off, but I ran out of time

25:56.440 --> 26:00.680
So I went back to him and I basically said look this is the bits that we need adding

26:01.400 --> 26:08.360
Can you do it? Can you get the packages into Debian? Can you get them into Ubuntu and can you do it all before?

26:08.360 --> 26:11.020
1604 goes final. Oh, that's great

26:11.900 --> 26:13.900
And and if you do it

26:14.220 --> 26:15.900
You know if you're able to do it

26:15.900 --> 26:20.140
I've got I forget how much it was but I an amount of money that I will give you to say

26:20.220 --> 26:23.500
Thank you for your efforts and recognize your contribution to the project

26:23.980 --> 26:31.420
And I think I asked that question on Friday and it was all done yesterday. Nice. No way. That's wow

26:32.300 --> 26:35.980
then you know, I you know, I really uh, I I really have been

26:35.980 --> 26:39.900
using this Apollo as my main driver and

26:40.700 --> 26:43.820
The one thing I would like is a little bit snappier launcher. I want to fire it off

26:43.820 --> 26:47.000
So snaps it across my mind. So wouldn't be what strikes me about all of this is

26:48.260 --> 26:52.700
Well, all of this will make Ubuntu Mate a better project, but none of it is specific

26:52.860 --> 26:57.660
None of it's specific to Ubuntu Mate. It all goes upstream. You're actually improving in most cases

26:57.660 --> 27:01.420
you're just helping continue improvement of the Mate desktop in general or

27:01.420 --> 27:05.700
Or something like that. I guess maybe the Mate welcome screen might be

27:06.220 --> 27:12.180
Sort of specific to the distro. That is that is absolutely our sort of USP

27:12.180 --> 27:16.740
So yes, the the Ubuntu Mate welcome and Mate tweak

27:17.020 --> 27:23.580
Those are the things that are absolutely Ubuntu Mate. They're absolutely specific to us and the two guys that I've

27:25.180 --> 27:28.860
Donated some money to for working on Ubuntu Mate welcome are

27:28.860 --> 27:34.060
Ubuntu Mate developers. Hmm, but people are donating to Ubuntu Mate

27:34.060 --> 27:39.420
So I think it's fair to distribute, you know that across, you know multiple projects and

27:39.940 --> 27:46.300
When you look at some of the other stuff we've we've donated towards if you look at top menu GTK, for example

27:46.300 --> 27:51.340
right, which is now being maintained by the Mate team in Debian and

27:52.380 --> 27:55.740
Those packages have been introduced to Debian and Ubuntu

27:55.740 --> 28:02.460
But more importantly top menu GTK also includes plugins for LXDE and XFCE

28:02.460 --> 28:06.920
And we package and maintain those plugins as well

28:07.060 --> 28:14.380
Which are also now available in Debian and Ubuntu 16.04 for those desktops to take advantage of so we've not you know

28:14.380 --> 28:18.660
Just said oh, well, we'll just do the bit that's for Mate. We've done the whole thing. Hmm

28:19.180 --> 28:21.180
it's interesting because

28:21.340 --> 28:25.420
This work overall sort of helps improve the whole ecosystem. Yeah, it really does. I like that

28:25.420 --> 28:28.700
That's a great model of you know how to support the people that support you

28:28.700 --> 28:32.540
You know, I want to give Kitson a second to ask this question

28:32.540 --> 28:38.520
But then Wes help me remember to come back to the model point because I look at elementary OS and I look at other projects

28:38.520 --> 28:39.220
And I go, okay

28:39.220 --> 28:44.340
This seems really like there's a model here that Wimpy is working with they can be applied to a lot of distros

28:44.460 --> 28:48.260
That would I think help a lot of people up but let's hold that question and Kitson

28:48.260 --> 28:50.580
I want to give you a chance to jump in before we go too far. So go ahead

28:50.580 --> 28:57.220
Yeah, I want to ask Wimpy two questions. The first one being where does he see Mint Xapps?

28:58.540 --> 29:03.260
Becoming relevant with Mate because it seems like they have a lot of same goals

29:03.260 --> 29:07.840
And what's the status on getting a GUI package management system in?

29:09.660 --> 29:12.260
Right the first one about Xapps

29:12.260 --> 29:18.480
I don't know much about because I'm not really all that observant of what's going on with Mint

29:18.480 --> 29:23.800
But my understanding is is that some of those Xapps are actually forks of

29:24.600 --> 29:26.520
Mate applications

29:26.520 --> 29:28.160
so I

29:28.160 --> 29:30.840
Don't know. I guess Mint are

29:32.080 --> 29:38.200
Changing the dependency so they can stand alone more not have to pull in, you know session managers and things like that

29:38.200 --> 29:40.240
But a part of the desktop there. They're

29:40.920 --> 29:42.920
bundled with

29:42.920 --> 29:51.320
I don't see Xapps featuring in Mate or Ubuntu Mate. What if they ended up with you know

29:51.320 --> 29:56.320
Just universally considered one of the better file managers if they did that or one of the better text editors

29:56.320 --> 29:59.800
There wouldn't be like a policy against this just it have to be a compelling reason, right?

30:00.280 --> 30:02.280
Yeah, yeah, and at the moment

30:03.020 --> 30:10.560
We have a file manager and we have a text editor for example, and that integrates very tightly with the rest of the desktop environment

30:10.560 --> 30:14.200
So when you drag something from the file manager into the text editor

30:14.200 --> 30:18.800
The file just opens in the text editor and you know all sorts of you know

30:18.800 --> 30:23.840
drag-and-drop integrations and actually the drag-and-drop integration in Mate because of its

30:25.520 --> 30:29.000
Heritage from GNOME 2 is about the best

30:29.760 --> 30:34.720
Out there, you know, you can drag and drop anything from anywhere. I'll play with that more stands the contact

30:34.720 --> 30:38.840
Yeah, you really should it understand a powerful interaction to for a lot of users. Yeah, it's nice and quick. Yeah

30:38.840 --> 30:41.280
hmm, so okay, so

30:42.360 --> 30:44.360
Xapps, I don't know we shall see

30:44.800 --> 30:52.000
Certainly for 1604. We're now in feature freeze. So really it's bug fixing and refinement at this point

30:52.000 --> 30:57.100
So don't expect there to be any, you know big changes in in

30:58.220 --> 30:59.560
1604

30:59.560 --> 31:05.120
1610 is going to be the playground for the future. That's when it that's when we can start to mix it up again

31:05.120 --> 31:10.280
Okay. Now your next question was about package managers. Do you mean package managers or software centers?

31:12.040 --> 31:14.140
Software centers package managers, etc

31:15.080 --> 31:21.140
Okay, so in Ubuntu Mate 1604. We've talked about Ubuntu Mate welcome

31:21.880 --> 31:23.040
a

31:23.040 --> 31:25.720
spin-off in Ubuntu Mate welcome in 1510

31:25.800 --> 31:33.720
There is a section where you can install software that's still there. It's been expanded somewhat and also

31:33.720 --> 31:36.760
can be launched separately and

31:37.280 --> 31:43.120
You'll find that now in the menus and it's labeled as the software boutique. So that

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
place where you

31:46.120 --> 31:48.080
install software

31:48.080 --> 31:52.480
We have about a hundred and twenty applications listed in there

31:52.480 --> 31:59.480
Which is the best-in-class application that integrates well with the master a desktop to a particular task done

31:59.480 --> 32:06.600
Yeah, this is this is really something wimpy and I really like that. There's just a one-click high proprietary software if you want nice

32:07.240 --> 32:10.840
it's like the best bridging of my mom could figure it out and

32:11.360 --> 32:14.120
People who want free and open source software. It works for them, too

32:14.120 --> 32:17.840
it wouldn't be gave me a PPA so I could try to play with some of this and

32:18.960 --> 32:23.240
You know for setting up the new Apollo. It was just that's awesome. It's super slick. It really is

32:23.240 --> 32:28.560
So yeah, I like this approach actually wimpy. I like this a lot better than say the Ubuntu software center because

32:28.560 --> 32:29.800
you

32:29.800 --> 32:31.800
Know for a lot of users

32:31.880 --> 32:37.680
They get kind of a static config once they have it up and going and this really spotlights the best stuff here

32:37.680 --> 32:43.840
I mean this this is this is a better upfront and center than any app store attempt. I've seen on Linux yet. Definitely

32:43.840 --> 32:47.780
Yeah, so, you know usually app stores have a like

32:48.360 --> 32:54.460
Featured apps in different sections. The whole software boutique is the featured apps

32:54.460 --> 32:59.760
That's that's just what it is. It's not everything. It's just the best stuff. There's MB

33:00.180 --> 33:02.780
Look at that. Nice minecraft server

33:03.540 --> 33:07.240
It open SSH. Yeah X to go. Yeah, it's not a huge list, right?

33:07.240 --> 33:10.260
But it's a great list a Samba server right here. I mean, this is really cool

33:10.900 --> 33:12.900
This is really

33:13.220 --> 33:15.060
They also do some extra stuff

33:15.060 --> 33:15.980
so for example

33:15.980 --> 33:22.860
If you you're in the service section at the moment by the sound of it if you click the button to install SSH

33:22.860 --> 33:26.860
It also behind the scene sets up SSH guard for you

33:27.380 --> 33:28.820
Really nice

33:28.820 --> 33:33.580
So there you go. So that's sort of the answer in the question of the App Store is yes

33:33.580 --> 33:35.580
This is it's sort of a new take on it

33:36.140 --> 33:43.340
Okay, and and also you'll find in there that if you want to explore the full Ubuntu catalog then the options to install

33:43.340 --> 33:48.300
App grid the Ubuntu software center. I saw that an app ticker there. Yeah, I saw app grid is there too

33:48.300 --> 33:53.220
Which is which is pretty good. There's a winter software center and synaptic and of course gdebi is installed by default

33:53.220 --> 33:56.740
Which is yeah, what I like for installing Debian files that I download or deb files

33:57.580 --> 34:00.460
alright, so let's talk about the model for a second because

34:01.100 --> 34:05.220
Here's what we have is we have I think I think if you assume a couple of things

34:05.220 --> 34:10.660
You need to have a distribution that appeals to a wide enough base that there's enough people to draw from to donate, right?

34:10.660 --> 34:16.420
So that's gonna you can't you can't, you know, I mean some of your really small small distros

34:16.420 --> 34:20.160
They don't qualify, but I think your distros like Antigros elementary OS

34:20.860 --> 34:22.860
obviously Ubuntu Mate

34:23.380 --> 34:26.860
Kubuntu any of these around this size they'd all qualify. Yeah, they'd all fit

34:27.420 --> 34:31.340
the particular model that I'm sussing out wimpy and tell me if you think I've got it wrong is

34:31.780 --> 34:37.260
You kind of doing a few things. You're very up in front representing what people are getting for the money

34:37.260 --> 34:40.360
Essentially, you're saying this is where the money went. This is what some of the costs were

34:41.100 --> 34:45.100
And you're applying you're you're kind of being flexible and how you're bringing in the money

34:45.100 --> 34:50.860
So it can be through a direct funding method or it can be through patreon and you're kind of bringing all of the funds in

34:51.740 --> 34:57.940
And so that seems to be and then what you're doing is you're kind of being specific and targeting where that money goes out when you

34:57.940 --> 35:00.420
do spend it either for infrastructure costs or

35:01.020 --> 35:03.740
to incentivize a developer to work on something and

35:05.260 --> 35:07.060
Then when you do that you report on it now

35:07.060 --> 35:13.260
This is this the rough is this sort of the rough model that you could say you're applying to fund the Ubuntu Mate project

35:13.260 --> 35:18.260
Not to make you put all out there. But why I'm asking is it seems like in some sense that's kind of obvious yet

35:18.260 --> 35:20.260
Nobody's really quite done this

35:21.140 --> 35:26.860
So we originally started by if you look back through the monthly reports

35:27.060 --> 35:34.340
We picked a particular project that we would that that was either integrated into Ubuntu Mate or Ubuntu Mate was was

35:34.380 --> 35:40.080
Using for development or something and we would sponsor that project a say sponsor

35:40.080 --> 35:42.420
We would donate some money to that project right? I remember

35:42.420 --> 35:44.060
and

35:44.060 --> 35:47.100
What I found doing that is actually

35:48.100 --> 35:49.340
you

35:49.340 --> 35:53.500
start a relationship with the developer that you don't know by doing that and

35:54.300 --> 35:57.340
Then you get this. Oh, well, you know if there's anything I can ever do

35:58.420 --> 36:02.420
You know to help you out just ask, you know, and it's it's

36:03.780 --> 36:10.260
You've made a fairly modest contribution to their project in order to sort of get that offer for help and that actually paid off with

36:10.260 --> 36:18.020
Calculator which is the calculator utility that's used by default in Marte as a whole not just on Ubuntu

36:18.020 --> 36:20.020
Marte but Marte in general

36:20.180 --> 36:24.980
and there was there was a bug in that in the 1510 cycle and I went back to the

36:25.220 --> 36:30.340
Developer because I'd contributed to that, you know previously and he was like, oh short. No problem

36:30.340 --> 36:34.020
We'll get that fixed and I just thought hmm. This is this is better going to

36:34.860 --> 36:36.860
individuals rather than

36:36.860 --> 36:42.120
Projects because there are some projects we've donated to and I won't I won't name them and the money just sort of

36:42.340 --> 36:47.260
Goes into the project and there's no dialogue has been formed as a result, right?

36:49.260 --> 36:55.580
Yeah, yeah, you've just you've just deposited some money somewhere and that was the end of that right so I've

36:56.780 --> 37:03.860
In recent months. I'm starting to use this technique of well, I know that there are these people working on these things

37:03.860 --> 37:09.460
These are the things that I would like to see implemented for Marte or Ubuntu Marte

37:10.020 --> 37:16.540
I can go to these people and say will you do this one thing? And if if you can do it

37:17.300 --> 37:22.040
There is this amount of money that that we can donate to you for doing the work

37:23.620 --> 37:25.620
And if you

37:25.780 --> 37:27.340
expand this out

37:27.340 --> 37:32.460
if all of those other projects because I think distributions are able to pull in more

37:32.460 --> 37:35.540
Donations than say individual applications, right?

37:36.020 --> 37:40.940
so if those if all the distributions were pooling their money like this and

37:41.540 --> 37:46.300
Were handing out discrete tasks because some of these tasks actually took far longer

37:46.300 --> 37:51.580
My original idea is each task was you know, some hours of work not days of work

37:51.580 --> 37:54.260
Although I've I've not got that right in some cases

37:54.580 --> 37:59.300
The other is you give somebody a body of work that should take a few hours and you pay them

37:59.300 --> 38:03.700
Something close to market rate for doing that work, but it's a very

38:04.900 --> 38:07.160
Carefully defined has a known

38:08.700 --> 38:11.220
Scope of work right? Yeah. Yeah and

38:12.980 --> 38:16.020
And that's the idea and and and if other

38:16.660 --> 38:20.260
Distributions were able to do that then maybe there would be more of these

38:20.900 --> 38:27.820
Independent software developers working on open source that would be able to do these smaller piecemeal tasks

38:27.820 --> 38:31.020
And maybe not make a salary just yet, but maybe

38:32.740 --> 38:35.240
Yeah supplement their salary yeah, because

38:36.020 --> 38:40.080
Ideally the what the size of the work I'm giving out here is something you can do in the evening, right?

38:41.180 --> 38:43.580
It is an interesting model and I look at

38:44.340 --> 38:48.660
so I've been you know, I have been following elementary OS for a while and I

38:50.020 --> 38:54.780
Find what they do to be habits to have a unique I have it has a unique appeal that what they've been trying to do

38:54.780 --> 38:58.980
For a while, so I've always liked to watch it and they're really filming a company. They're forming a you know

38:58.980 --> 39:00.980
I full-on business. Mm-hmm

39:01.100 --> 39:06.080
and I guess there's a mix there to be had right when be of it being a company for certain legal reasons, but then also

39:07.620 --> 39:12.060
When I think of someone I guess what I'm trying to say is today when I think of the modern elementary OS team

39:12.900 --> 39:17.900
They when they introduce a new person coming on to their project, they introduce them as a new person joining their company

39:18.060 --> 39:19.860
It's not a new community member, right?

39:19.860 --> 39:24.820
And so that doesn't seem to be a line that the Matei project is crossed. I'm not making a judgment call there

39:24.820 --> 39:30.860
But I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on that and I mean Ubuntu Matei must there must be up. There is a company involved, right?

39:31.940 --> 39:33.940
No, there's no company involved here

39:33.980 --> 39:39.380
So he doesn't necessarily dictate them for the model to work that there has to be a business about it. Really. No, so

39:40.020 --> 39:41.940
Ubuntu Matei is

39:41.940 --> 39:43.940
what's called a

39:44.860 --> 39:47.380
CIC in the UK, okay, it's a

39:47.380 --> 39:49.380
I

39:49.900 --> 39:57.340
Forget the back corporate in corporate music interest company, that's the words community interest company and it's basically

39:59.500 --> 40:04.740
A way of setting up a charity like organization without actually having to go through the red tape of being a charity

40:04.740 --> 40:10.900
Oh, that's nice. Okay interesting and I know it's apples and oranges perhaps but I just I just thought that's there's a lot of different

40:10.900 --> 40:13.500
Takes we're seeing out there right now and I don't know

40:13.500 --> 40:17.940
It seems to me now that the landscape is actually more fascinating than it's been. Yeah, right ever

40:18.700 --> 40:23.740
So when be anyways that they'll have a link to the to the update in for February

40:23.740 --> 40:28.840
But if people wanted to support the project or what's your preferred way? Is it patreon is do you have a preferred way?

40:33.060 --> 40:38.220
It doesn't make much of a difference at the moment the thing I'm struggling with is it doesn't matter whether you're

40:38.220 --> 40:43.940
Contributing via PayPal or patreon. There is a slice of money being taken out

40:43.940 --> 40:50.900
Oh sure. Yeah, there's organizations there and I'd like to find a way where that is minimized in the future

40:50.900 --> 40:54.740
But I'm gonna take time to sort out. So I believe that is called any time being

40:55.260 --> 41:03.620
Yeah, I would I would prefer I would prefer patreon even if it's small amounts because that's predictable

41:03.620 --> 41:10.700
Amounts of money being in that we can depend on them, but that said the pay the one-off PayPal

41:11.260 --> 41:14.220
donations that people generously give to the project are

41:15.380 --> 41:18.120
Far in excess of what what patreon?

41:18.620 --> 41:24.540
Generates, you know, but patreon would be preferred because there's some predictability in in what was in there

41:24.540 --> 41:30.020
I just want to underscore that welcome screen is super cool for like for installing like Spotify

41:30.020 --> 41:33.580
Which is sometimes a bit of a pain in the ass on a book to be able to just have a button there

41:33.900 --> 41:39.700
All right. So before we move on chat room or mumble room any last questions for a book?

41:39.700 --> 41:42.300
Oh kits and go ahead. You've got our last question before we move on quite

41:42.980 --> 41:45.260
Actually, it's more of a statement. I just wish more

41:45.940 --> 41:51.020
Projects and distros had patreon like subscriptions because that would be something I'd totally do

41:51.660 --> 41:57.740
When I settled down on a distro and use it for a long time is I'd like to be able to contribute and I'm not

41:57.740 --> 42:01.460
A coder. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I would I I could see that too for like

42:01.460 --> 42:06.500
Maybe you get betas or things before you get like access to like this behind-the-scenes development

42:06.500 --> 42:07.260
If you're a super you know

42:07.260 --> 42:13.180
I if elementary OS did that I would do that and if I don't want to pay I would do dollar one time for the ISO

42:13.180 --> 42:15.820
I want to if you do the tiering rates, right?

42:15.820 --> 42:18.660
I would I would back I would keep my backing for all of them, right?

42:18.660 --> 42:19.860
You know if it's five bucks or whatever

42:19.860 --> 42:25.020
I mean I I bounced between all of them enough that they're all useful and if you look at like one cost so

42:25.020 --> 42:32.100
It my Linux desktop is infinitely more powerful than Windows 10 and Windows 10 costs $400 if you get the pro or 399 or 29

42:32.100 --> 42:34.100
Whatever 299 a pro. I

42:34.100 --> 42:38.740
Have no problem kicking in five bucks for ongoing continuing development of a kick-ass desktop

42:39.100 --> 42:42.100
So I think more people should get on there. So yeah, well cool wimpy

42:42.100 --> 42:47.940
Thank you for a give a stick around because wimpy has had a little time with the new Raspberry Pi special access

42:47.940 --> 42:49.940
Yeah, well a little early bird

42:49.940 --> 42:56.900
Preview so he's gonna give us his take on that and also I hope to get a little bit of inside info about kidding

42:56.900 --> 43:00.460
No, I'm gonna pay up for it right on the release day. I have people are impressed

43:00.460 --> 43:03.900
But first I wanted to mention a project called app image that we've talked about before

43:04.500 --> 43:06.700
But it's got some stink behind it now Wes

43:06.860 --> 43:11.340
It's got some real stink like you could get up and running right now on your distro. I'm doing it right now

43:11.340 --> 43:15.740
Are you yeah, so app image at Les allows you to run Linux apps

43:15.740 --> 43:17.740
Anywhere

43:18.180 --> 43:22.380
Yeah, it's an application that you just drop it on the file system and you can run it, right

43:22.380 --> 43:27.300
Yeah, you download the file you CH mod plus X and execute that and it runs

43:27.300 --> 43:30.700
it actually it has an ISO file system in it and it

43:31.140 --> 43:33.860
Fuse mounts that into slash temp and then runs the app from there

43:33.860 --> 43:37.660
So is it a shell script you're downloading that runs and no it's an it's an executable

43:37.780 --> 43:43.700
So I this is like they have they have all kinds of stuff available for array like they have app images

43:43.700 --> 43:47.620
You can just download here. I'm running Krita right now. Look at you or Krita Krita. Yes

43:47.620 --> 43:51.600
Yeah, let it look at you doing Linux. You've been drawn over there. Yeah, that's right in the show

43:52.380 --> 43:56.660
But it's I mean it's running great. It's like I you know, it was like an 80 meg download

43:56.660 --> 44:00.740
So they're bigger sizes, but that's really not a big deal it downloaded in a few seconds

44:00.740 --> 44:03.740
What's the update process? Do you know you just go download a new one? That's a good question

44:03.740 --> 44:10.580
I don't know cuz all the libraries must be contained in they are contained. Yeah. Yeah, so Linus Torvalds says he was it

44:11.500 --> 44:12.820
they

44:12.820 --> 44:18.580
They also they'd link to his Google Plus post where he talked about getting his subsurface in there a while ago

44:19.180 --> 44:23.580
And and then we also don't look at that. We also have a link to some of the app image containers

44:24.180 --> 44:27.500
Where you can go get them right now? So this is something I should try you think huh?

44:27.700 --> 44:31.460
You think I should actually play with you know, I I think it could be useful for some people I think

44:32.340 --> 44:36.140
Linus had some good points in that Google Plus thread when he was talking about it that you know

44:36.140 --> 44:42.100
You wouldn't it should never this is not the model to replace core system dependencies or you know core utils or anything like that

44:42.100 --> 44:46.580
But for the weird projects that maybe they have very like subsonic apparently needs very recent

44:47.180 --> 44:50.780
Like lots of things you need very recent libraries for that's what they develop against

44:50.780 --> 44:52.980
That's what makes sense and you can't get them in all your applications

44:52.980 --> 44:59.020
So yeah, if this helps you get like Spotify or one-off apps that they were probably gonna package themselves this way anyway

44:59.020 --> 45:01.320
Yeah, it's probably not a bad thing. Well, you know, I was

45:01.860 --> 45:04.300
I don't know if the lamenting is what I would call it

45:04.300 --> 45:06.940
but I was discussing with Noah on the last live stream like

45:06.940 --> 45:14.700
I kind of I kind of love the idea of just getting like the perfect desktop install like just doing an LTS desktop and then

45:15.060 --> 45:16.140
like

45:16.140 --> 45:18.140
Actually writing it for the whole two years

45:18.500 --> 45:25.780
like when sick what if sick and I don't think I can do this, but what if when 1604 comes out I

45:27.260 --> 45:29.260
Just ran a 1604 based OS

45:29.820 --> 45:33.820
For like two years, but I didn't the full experience just go for it

45:33.820 --> 45:37.900
And then because then I feel like I feel like it's like when you have a couch or a chair

45:37.900 --> 45:40.220
That's like it's like custom fit to your butt

45:40.220 --> 45:43.620
I feel like a two-year distro is like custom fit to your butt

45:43.620 --> 45:47.780
And so I want to just experience that but the problem is I like to run

45:47.980 --> 45:52.900
Applications and you want to install things for reviews for the show. Mm-hmm. Yeah

45:52.900 --> 45:54.900
I'd like to actually exist in the present

45:54.900 --> 45:59.340
And so if something like this could allow me to run a nice stable LTS desktop

45:59.340 --> 46:05.780
But yet have brand new absolute versions of my applications bang might have ourselves a winner Wes

46:06.460 --> 46:10.880
You think you think you could do that? Like when you look at the application selection, could I actually accomplish that?

46:11.820 --> 46:15.460
Is that not today right now? It looks like kind of the one guy is packaging all of these

46:15.460 --> 46:19.980
So it would really need a lot of third-party people, you know, obviously subsurface is doing it

46:19.980 --> 46:23.940
But some other big projects we're like, yeah, here's a here's the way we support. All right

46:23.940 --> 46:25.940
Well in the meantime, I'm just gonna use a rolling distro

46:25.940 --> 46:29.460
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, but yeah, it might work for like, oh, well

46:29.460 --> 46:32.740
I have this 1404 install my parents house and they've been using it forever

46:32.740 --> 46:37.140
But I really want them to try this new thing. Yeah, and one click it just runs. Yeah. Yeah

46:37.340 --> 46:44.540
Hey, have you heard about the Intel atom the x3? They're they're bringing something called convergence to oh, I'm sorry

46:44.940 --> 46:46.620
Continuum. No, I'm sorry

46:46.620 --> 46:53.920
Handoff between Android and Debian Linux. It looks legit to Wes. This was going on a mobile world Congress

46:53.920 --> 47:00.040
It's an Intel x86 chip phone. It runs like chromium like here. I'll play a little bit the video

47:00.240 --> 47:02.760
It's it's I think it's probably not in English

47:06.240 --> 47:08.760
Not English, but see he hooks it up there to the cord there

47:08.760 --> 47:13.080
He starts the mode and on the screen there it begins a desktop environment

47:13.080 --> 47:16.960
Yeah, and I don't know if you if y'all maybe I can do a little zoom and enhance your West bang

47:16.960 --> 47:19.420
Do you see how that kind of looks a lot like?

47:19.420 --> 47:24.620
Hmm something starts with a you looks like a lot like unity there doesn't it doesn't you see that sidebar?

47:25.220 --> 47:30.420
But what you might notice is that's actual legitimate Google chromium. This is an x86 phone and

47:31.380 --> 47:38.420
It's not it's a it's running all off the Android kernel. So the Linux environment is actually also used. So it's a shared kernel

47:38.420 --> 47:44.980
It's a shared file system. You get access to the Android file system from within your Linux applications. You also see he's got VLC play. Yeah

47:44.980 --> 47:48.720
and it's it's being demoed right now

47:51.220 --> 47:56.760
I'd like to toss it to poppy and see poppy. What do you think sir of something like this with Intel backing something like this is

47:58.660 --> 48:04.300
What do you think I mean this is like not really what canonical is going after but it seems to sort of be in the same

48:04.300 --> 48:07.100
Vain kind of validates the idea bit, doesn't it?

48:07.660 --> 48:09.660
It looks very

48:09.780 --> 48:12.260
Similar to Ubuntu for Android, right? Yeah

48:12.260 --> 48:16.180
Oh to MWC three years ago. It looks like it's exactly

48:18.020 --> 48:20.140
Yeah, it looks exactly like that's what it is but

48:21.340 --> 48:25.380
What's Intel's angle here? Cuz I mean are they is this a thing? They're actually selling like I

48:26.300 --> 48:33.260
Well MWC is showing stuff off to the rest of industry. And so they will have had lots of meetings with

48:34.380 --> 48:41.120
Potential hardware partners and ODMs and OEMs who may potentially ship this on a device in the future

48:41.120 --> 48:44.420
But okay that UI look at that UI

48:44.880 --> 48:45.680
Look at that

48:45.680 --> 48:47.160
Look at that side launcher

48:47.160 --> 48:52.280
With the with the search and the and the main search thing right up there in the top left hand corner

48:52.280 --> 48:57.800
Your clock and your settings in the right hand corner. I mean, is that not sort of the unity interface right there?

48:57.920 --> 49:00.560
This kind of looks it looks familiar. Yeah

49:01.200 --> 49:05.880
You know, it turns out that some people actually quite like having a launcher on the left hand side

49:05.880 --> 49:12.320
I do too. I did recently accessed applications in it and it indicate a panel in the top right with the status and the rest of

49:12.320 --> 49:13.080
the

49:13.080 --> 49:17.800
Screen to do whatever you want. I mean that that seems common. Yeah

49:17.960 --> 49:23.520
Yeah, you just makes you wonder if if they've if they've seen what canonical has been working on

49:24.080 --> 49:25.920
Yeah, it's like if they're aware

49:25.920 --> 49:30.200
Do they understand how open source works like and I just have all these questions after I saw this

49:30.280 --> 49:34.320
What do you think West is gonna actually make it to something? You could I don't know if we'll see this again

49:34.320 --> 49:38.200
I don't know. I guess it depends if they follow up with it. I'll continue to be mildly interested

49:38.200 --> 49:40.960
But okay, here's the takeaway though hundred dollars

49:41.840 --> 49:46.240
x86 based two gigs of RAM like I mean this thing's like I got I got the specs in the show notes

49:46.520 --> 49:51.560
It's a respectable piece of hardware. Would you hundred bucks? Well hundred bucks is a pretty good price point

49:51.760 --> 49:56.600
Would you try it? Yeah, I would definitely try it for I mean, especially I feel you get that end up with that as a gift

49:56.600 --> 49:58.520
or something

49:58.520 --> 50:00.520
What do you mean a hundred?

50:00.520 --> 50:07.600
Warhead, that's a great deal for an inch for an X and x86 fits in your pocket that has a Debian like cheroot

50:07.600 --> 50:10.380
Or whatever it is that it loads that has chrome

50:11.080 --> 50:14.680
And and all of your x86 I can put arch in that

50:15.200 --> 50:20.440
Root carried my pocket and then plug it into my monitor just you know, wherever I am. That's pretty sweet your face

50:20.440 --> 50:23.800
I could make do with Debian if I mean, you know, I'm gonna bring a laptop for the show

50:23.800 --> 50:26.480
We'll just put a monitor here. I'll plug that in. Isn't that the dream?

50:26.480 --> 50:30.360
Yeah, that is the dream and you know where you'd have that phone you'd have that phone over on the ting

50:30.360 --> 50:34.920
That's right. That's also the dream ting isn't a dream. It's actually reality. You can take advantage of it right now

50:34.920 --> 50:40.220
It's mobile that makes sense. No contract. No early termination fee and you only pay for what you use did I mention?

50:41.280 --> 50:45.240
You only pay for what you use I you know what I know it sounds impossible

50:45.240 --> 50:50.800
If you don't believe me, you could take it from somebody else maybe Kyra ting keeps rates simple

50:50.920 --> 50:53.000
We don't make you pick a plan instead

50:53.000 --> 50:57.760
You just use your phone as you normally would how much you use determines how much you pay each month

50:57.760 --> 51:00.600
You can have as many devices as you want on one account

51:00.760 --> 51:01.640
That's good

51:01.640 --> 51:05.760
Because when you use more you pay less per minute message or megabyte of data

51:06.000 --> 51:10.960
Your usage plus six dollars per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill

51:11.680 --> 51:13.940
Simple that's what we mean when we say

51:15.640 --> 51:17.640
Mobile that makes sense ting

51:17.680 --> 51:23.500
So you go to linux.com you get $25 off your first device or if you have a compatible device either CD me or GSM

51:23.500 --> 51:25.500
They'll have like a little checker

51:25.500 --> 51:31.140
Uh, you'll get $25 of service credit and you can also grab a ting sim on Amazon

51:31.140 --> 51:34.100
But then I don't know how you're gonna give us credit. So go to linux.ting.com. Just go there

51:34.620 --> 51:38.500
You know every time I hear that music I just I just feel good. I don't know if it's Kyra

51:38.500 --> 51:40.140
I don't know if it's the great deal, dude

51:40.140 --> 51:46.420
It is it is the trifecta of ting being badass and awesome and Kyra being super cool and that music just getting you right

51:46.420 --> 51:52.900
Yeah, good trifecta. They got radically awesome customer support. They have an incredibly good dashboard

51:52.900 --> 51:58.500
I mean, I really you know, I've tried all of them in the oh, what was the I got a new name

51:58.500 --> 52:02.900
I got a new name for the dynamic duo, but I like I have I have had an account as a

52:03.620 --> 52:09.900
Consumer and as a as a as a contractor with for my clients in business. I've had accounts with all of these

52:10.860 --> 52:16.140
duopoly and around Chris I tell you I have gotten around with I have been passed around from carrier to carrier and

52:16.140 --> 52:22.980
None of them none of them even come within a like a stone's toss of tings dashboard. Have you heard that same before?

52:22.980 --> 52:25.220
No, I don't know. Hmm. Yeah, it comes from the

52:25.780 --> 52:27.220
Comes from Hick town actually

52:27.220 --> 52:30.540
They have great phones all the way up from feature phones to the top Cadillac phones

52:30.780 --> 52:36.660
Linux dot ting comm go there and check them out and calm at 1 8 5 5 ting FTW. No contracts

52:37.260 --> 52:40.980
Nor the termination fees and you own your device outright. Yes

52:40.980 --> 52:48.620
Yes, what's up? Just like you would your computer Linux dot ting comm and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

52:49.060 --> 52:52.700
Okay, Wes moving right along sir. Oh and by the way, they're doing it

52:52.700 --> 52:56.540
I should mention really quick ting is doing a giveaway of the galaxy j7. Just oh

52:58.220 --> 53:06.700
Jay go get that stuff. Okay, so the raspberry pi 3 has landed

53:06.700 --> 53:13.580
Wait what oops, sorry, I think I just dropped it down the toilet. Hold on. It's so small

53:14.460 --> 53:20.380
It is gonna be 35 US don't bones has a 64-bit CPU is my understanding

53:20.380 --> 53:23.060
but it ships with a 32-bit version of the OS to

53:24.300 --> 53:26.300
USB ports on that thing

53:27.820 --> 53:31.980
Go ahead go ahead jump in any time Bluetooth by the way Wi-Fi like we've had before before

53:31.980 --> 53:36.060
And for USB ports of if I'm correct. Yeah

53:36.940 --> 53:40.020
So with me, can you say how long have you had this?

53:43.140 --> 53:45.140
Since Friday last week

53:46.580 --> 53:51.980
So you've obviously been working on this thing trying to get a buntum a tight desktop working on it

53:51.980 --> 53:54.820
What were your initial impressions of the hardware when you sat down to work with it?

53:54.820 --> 54:02.460
Ah, it's it looks well, it is the same form factor as the Raspberry Pi 2 and the Raspberry Pi B plus

54:02.940 --> 54:08.340
So, you know the number of ports and its size and its arrangement is almost identical

54:08.580 --> 54:12.980
There's there's one minor change and that's the location of the LED lights

54:13.540 --> 54:16.500
But other than that, it looks it looks like a Raspberry Pi

54:17.620 --> 54:19.340
I

54:19.340 --> 54:21.340
Hooked it up

54:21.340 --> 54:27.420
Tried to boot my existing image for Ubuntu Marte and got a very colorful rainbow screen, which basically meant

54:28.300 --> 54:30.300
Do not pass go

54:30.660 --> 54:35.140
So yeah, then started work on making it work. Once I got it working

54:36.260 --> 54:42.900
That it's obvious where the performance improvements come all really with this device

54:42.900 --> 54:47.400
Yeah, yeah across across the board and in some unexpected places as well

54:49.020 --> 54:50.740
So

54:50.740 --> 54:52.540
It's got a new

54:52.540 --> 54:58.540
Sock, so it's a Broadcom two eight three seven quite cool 1.2 gigahertz. It's an arm v8

54:59.820 --> 55:01.820
Cortex a 53

55:02.340 --> 55:09.060
It's clocked at 1.2 gigahertz, which is up from 900 megahertz as the stock clock on the Pi 2

55:10.260 --> 55:11.620
and

55:11.620 --> 55:13.380
by and large

55:13.380 --> 55:15.300
more or less

55:15.300 --> 55:21.460
Just about everything is about 50% quicker on the Pi 3 compared to the Pi 2

55:22.820 --> 55:27.620
So you see that in everything in terms of the responsiveness of the applications

55:27.620 --> 55:28.340
but

55:28.340 --> 55:34.660
Where you really notice it is it really starts to close the gap in terms of things like if you've got a web browser open

55:34.660 --> 55:36.660
And you're scrolling

55:37.100 --> 55:41.180
You know the web pages that's much more fluid now much more fluid

55:42.100 --> 55:43.820
and

55:43.820 --> 55:47.860
So you've mentioned that there's there's Bluetooth and there's Wi-Fi now

55:48.620 --> 55:51.220
So they're integrated on the sock

55:52.580 --> 55:55.540
They're using a Broadcom

55:56.860 --> 56:01.060
Four three four three something chip

56:02.060 --> 56:09.100
and the interesting thing here is that in the past one of the criticisms of the Raspberry Pi was that the

56:09.100 --> 56:15.740
The SD host controller and the Ethernet were on the same USB bus

56:15.740 --> 56:16.580
right

56:16.580 --> 56:23.700
So if you were doing a file copy over Ethernet, the performance could really take a dive

56:25.020 --> 56:27.020
the Wi-Fi

56:27.380 --> 56:35.300
Is implemented on the sock and on its own MMC controller and not on the USB bus now

56:35.300 --> 56:40.260
I haven't tested this yet. This is this is what I want to tell you but my but my

56:40.740 --> 56:42.740
working hypothesis is

56:43.060 --> 56:47.980
It should move data around quicker over Wi-Fi than it can over Ethernet

56:49.660 --> 56:54.740
Hmm it's good excuse not to bother trying to find an internet plug for that would be pretty cool

56:54.740 --> 56:59.180
That would be that would be pretty damn impressive. Okay, so the hardware impressions

56:59.180 --> 57:03.500
I mean a 50% improvement across the board that is damn form factor. That is damn impressive

57:03.500 --> 57:09.060
I like that a lot and I'm kind of curious to see how that might actually play out with multitasking and things like that

57:09.340 --> 57:15.220
How did that translate wimpy for you when getting whatever you need to do to make Ubuntu Mate work on?

57:15.780 --> 57:20.980
the Raspberry Pi 3 because two things jump out of me number one is you kind of had to go back and retrofit the

57:21.260 --> 57:25.860
Released version of Ubuntu Mate to make it work right because he couldn't just say well go if you want to make it work

57:25.860 --> 57:27.860
Go use 1604 or did you?

57:27.860 --> 57:34.620
No, I I because there wasn't much time to do this. I went with the build system

57:34.620 --> 57:42.140
I had for 1510 because aside from the new, you know feature enablement. I knew the rest of the thing worked

57:42.740 --> 57:44.660
So, you know

57:44.660 --> 57:51.060
Minimize things that said I still only got about six hours sleep between Friday and Sunday working on this

57:51.060 --> 57:57.700
You got it right out on release day. So that looked pretty good. That's impressive. Yeah. Yeah, it needs some work. So

57:58.580 --> 58:00.580
despite the

58:00.580 --> 58:06.660
Assistance I got from the Raspberry Pi Foundation over the weekend. So they they had some engineering assistance mostly from Phil

58:06.660 --> 58:11.780
Elwell who who's just been brilliant. I haven't got the Bluetooth working in

58:12.340 --> 58:14.900
On the Raspberry Pi 3 for Ubuntu Mate yet

58:14.900 --> 58:21.900
But I'm yet to hear and maybe over the next couple of days. We'll start to hear I haven't heard if anyone's got Bluetooth working

58:21.900 --> 58:23.620
At all yet that it's a bit

58:23.620 --> 58:30.380
It's a bit complicated to get going and I was sort of groping around in the dark a little bit because I was sort of being

58:30.380 --> 58:32.900
drip-fed oh you need this binary blob and

58:33.620 --> 58:39.300
And I'm nice this still doesn't go and then oh no you need this this blob as well, which patches that other

58:39.300 --> 58:44.180
No, you need these patches for this. So it was all good because I got all the information

58:44.180 --> 58:47.660
But I just couldn't quite get the thing to enable the Bluetooth

58:47.660 --> 58:51.700
So I've decided just to sit back for a few days and see

58:52.220 --> 58:57.620
See if nobody else cracks with the official with the official images. Yeah, so I'm gonna start taking a look at the new images. So today

58:59.140 --> 59:05.300
This evening I downloaded all of the new packages that have gone into the Raspberry Pi 3 and I'm going to be using them

59:05.300 --> 59:11.860
this evening I downloaded all of the new packages that have gone into the raspberry and archive to do with Bluetooth and firmware and

59:11.860 --> 59:16.540
I'm sort of picking through those to see if there's anything different that I may have missed or

59:17.180 --> 59:24.820
Overlooked so Bluetooth will come in in due course and it will be delivered via an update. I should think very good. Okay now

59:25.740 --> 59:28.900
There is another thing about the the Raspberry Pi. Hmm

59:28.900 --> 59:33.180
All right to share that the Raspberry Pi 3 that I think is probably more important

59:33.180 --> 59:38.620
I think the Raspberry Pi 3 itself is the hors d'oeuvre. This is not the main event. Oh

59:39.380 --> 59:42.020
so in in the Pi 3 the

59:42.660 --> 59:45.540
video core the graphics processor

59:46.700 --> 59:52.380
Has been up clocked. So the video core was running at 250 megahertz

59:52.380 --> 59:59.060
It now runs at 400 and the 3d graphics processor was running at 250 and now runs at 300

59:59.060 --> 01:00:02.180
Okay, one of the benefits of that is that you can now run

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:07.540
1080p video at 60 frames per second. Yes, which is good

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.660
and

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:14.540
The other thing is is that there's been an awful lot of work going on behind the scenes at the Raspberry Pi Foundation

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.680
to do all of the

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:24.180
graphics enablement in kernel mode setting and direct rendering manager and Mesa and gallium and

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.540
That's sort of experimental at the moment

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.180
But I have had it working

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.140
for brief periods of time and

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.340
when that works

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.540
It's a game-changer

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.660
because you can

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:45.700
turn on the open GL renderer in VLC and

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.460
get

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:52.700
Smooth video playback in VLC. Nice. Not the rather clunky

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:56.860
can't quite keep up software version and

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:59.940
It has been also you can also run

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.580
OpenGL

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.060
Accelerated software providing open jail versions match up

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:12.780
So if you've ever played never ball or never putt, I've had that running full screen 60 frames per second

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:19.980
No problem, and there are other examples of where that on the pi 3 on the pi 3. Yeah Wow

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.740
Yeah, that is a big deal

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.140
So when that lands?

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.140
Properly, it's GLES

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:35.980
Warheads GLES is the implementation for the pi 3 but when that lands later in the year as a fully finished thing

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:43.900
That takes an awful lot of burden off the CPU. And I think that is where this sort of

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.980
pseudo desktop use case

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:54.260
Really comes into its own and will start to grow because you know using things like composited desktops

01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:03.020
Becomes a reality and and alleviates burden from the CPU. This is it is yeah, but as it is it makes a very

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.780
usable desktop experience, I mean imagine if

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:11.740
For thirty five dollars you could buy a computer and plug in a USB

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.220
Microphone and join a mumble room and have a podcast just like we are now. Oh, yeah

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:19.620
Oh, yeah, this is this is all plugged into a Raspberry Pi 3. I'm talking

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:21.620
That is great

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.620
Drops the bomb

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.620
Well played sir, well played

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.620
You know, I was gonna ask you

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:33.540
If you think this is I mean Wow, I mean there you go podcasting is a is that's probably something you can barely even do from

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:37.780
A tablet. I mean you can but it's I just when I see this at $35 wimpy

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:44.580
Isn't that a big part of of the Raspberry Pi 3 is what the performance of the Raspberry Pi 3 is

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:49.100
What the performance for the price it's not fifty dollars. It's not it's not even forty five dollars

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:56.300
It's thirty five US greenbacks and that seems like that sort of is a game changer and your downloads must be bearing that out

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:04.980
Yeah, yeah that the I haven't looked since the the new images have gone up. I'll check in a week or so to see how things are going

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.300
but

01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:12.380
Yeah, so the Raspberry Pi is known to be something that you know retails for thirty five dollars

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:16.780
Well, or at least the the traditional ones is obviously the zero now for five dollars

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:24.780
And as I understand it, they're trying to keep that thirty five dollar price point. So they will introduce features

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:31.580
To that price rather than just introduce features because they can which I think is kind of neat because you know

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:34.980
You know, it's always going to be thirty five dollars. Yeah, it keeps the expectation. Yeah

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:41.820
Yeah, it's a it's a step change in performance. Definitely and I think that it's very

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:45.140
It's very early now, you know, we're in day two, right?

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:47.540
I think you know a few a few months from now

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.500
We'll be able to see the full hopefully the full potential

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:57.420
On their part to keep the the form factor right by keeping the form factor the same

01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.700
like

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.380
groups like

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:05.580
Groups like my craft though like my craft saying hey, we're now doing the testing and if everything works out

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:09.860
We're just going to include the Raspberry Pi 3 in with the my craft units because it just snaps right am upgrade

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.700
Isn't that don't you think that's the same price? Yes, I think that's I mean, I think that's a huge deal

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.900
I think that means that people that are building thing

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:23.680
I mean for predictability like that when you're building something right to have that kind of predictability that's important now for others

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.460
There might be other there might be other boards out there

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:28.340
But for some of us that is a huge component just right there

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.940
No, thirty five dollars about the same form factor

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:35.340
I can snap it in when you buy probably the same software you use before we'll just install to it

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:38.000
I think it's pretty neat any other thoughts wimpy

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:46.360
Well, the only other major change that sort of just juxtaposes what you've said is that it does require slightly more power now

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.560
so in the past

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:56.840
1.8 amp or 2 amp power was recommended. So that's a twist. Yeah now it's 2.4 amp. So

01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.760
if you've got

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.840
existing power supplies that were

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:07.000
Kind of on the edge of being acceptable chances are you're going to need a new

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.180
Power supply. Yeah, I I use an atrix laptop lack

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:19.120
Lap dock to connect right to to work on them and I'm pleased to say that that still powers the pi 3

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:22.720
Yeah, I mean 2.4 amps is not too uncommon. So yeah. Yeah

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:28.160
Also, I fit the mate or Raspbian isn't your flavor Windows 10

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:35.520
Look at this West Windows 10 Internet of Things core for Raspberry Pi 3 is out. I even there's even a video look at this right here

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:43.240
Well, it's Windows powering a wheel like a ham so Windows go just like the hamster. It's learning Chris

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.880
You got to be nice. So Windows 10 on the Raspberry Pi 3 controlling a closed loop wheel

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:53.080
You ready for this West Raspberry Pi 3 running Windows 10 IOT core

01:05:53.240 --> 01:06:00.280
The wheel represents a common situation in robotics when you need to know exactly how fast a robot's going or how far it's traveling

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:06.480
Here I have a display connected to the Raspberry Pi 3 you can see the speed of the wheel the speed I've chosen and the power

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:11.080
Output to the motor. I just can't ever imagine why you would want the overhead of Windows for such a simple task

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:16.400
It's just that's never gonna that that's never a value argument. You're gonna win. It's this crazy

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.480
Absolutely, but you know good on Microsoft for trying to be the people who already have all that. Yeah. What do you think?

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:29.600
Oh, that's cute and everything. But let's see them come on a podcast on we're using a Raspberry Pi 3. That's right. You know

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.660
Maybe they'd had maybe they better switch over to the old droid c2 the faster

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:38.520
Bigger version of a Raspberry Pi 3 you might heat sink five dollars more West

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:46.880
Okay, five dollars more you get two gigahertz ARM Cortex a 53 quad core processor with Mali 450 graphics two gigabytes of RAM and

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:51.320
a gigabit Ethernet port with 4k HDMI out

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:58.240
Also has the GPIO 40 pin and four USB ports and an IR receiver

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.520
That seems like a pretty nice device, too

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:04.120
So I'm just mentioning that because I know everybody's gonna give us feedback

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:09.760
Guys, the old droid is only five dollars more and it does X. Have you played with those at all wimpy? I

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.800
Have played with O droids. Yeah, I've got several but there's a keen difference between well

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.640
In fact any of most of the other SPC's and the Raspberry Pi

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.680
Raspberry Pi is a platform

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:29.000
It's not necessarily about the specifications and the capability of the device itself

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:33.400
The fact is is that if you bought a Raspberry Pi four years ago

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:41.160
You can run the same operating system on all of the iterations of the pie that have come out since and these other

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.240
manufacturers there

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:47.200
They don't have that longevity in the platform. They make a device

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.480
They want people to buy the device and then they're on working on the next

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:56.580
specification and the next iteration and the next new feature and the next new feature, so

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.440
You you sort of get obsoleted quite quickly

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:06.040
I've got I won't say who which manufacturers they are but I've got ones that you know now are a pain to maintain

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.320
because they're just not supported by the

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.840
Manufacturer anymore, you know, that's not that's an interesting case with the pie

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:18.600
I want to underscore your point about the pie being a platform because I think this is maybe the war the one thing

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:22.680
I haven't been able to articulate because when we talk about the Raspberry Pi a lot of people will write it and say

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.280
Why aren't you talking about this?

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:28.960
It has a better X and I have a it's sort of this is it

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.880
This is a this is just to make an equivalency

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.880
But in production we started using the GoPro from time to time

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:39.920
The GoPro is not the best camera in the world what the GoPro is is it's a camera platform and there are

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.880
Hundreds of different types of accessories

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.680
So if I'm driving down the road, there's a mount to mount the GoPro to the window

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:52.700
If I want to walk with a selfie stick in a crowd, there's a mount for that if I want to use a gyroscopic stabilizer

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.620
There's an accessory for that

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:59.880
There is all different tripods and different types of head mounts and body mounts and charging

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:06.960
Accessories and all this weird stuff for this one little teeny tiny camera. The camera isn't the important part

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:13.560
It's this entire platform of all this stuff that the camera can snap into and be used and then on top of that

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.400
It's an entire community

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:18.480
Around this camera that knows how to do all these different jobs

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:23.600
Like hey, I want to mount a camera to a bike as I'm going down a hill at 40 miles per hour

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:28.620
there's people out there that know how to do that and so the GoPro isn't necessarily the

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:34.740
X, you know, maybe it's not the best camera for 4k 120 frame-per-second video capture attached to a drone

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:40.140
But it right is a very good camera for a lot of reasons and just like the Raspberry Pi maybe isn't the fastest or whatever

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:43.220
It it is a platform where there's a lot of things around it

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.780
there's a lot of people that know how to support it and there's an ecosystem and

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:49.620
Third it's 35 bucks, right?

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:56.020
And it sounds like that the Raspberry Pi is really and I mean to Broadcram's credit even that they're they're doing a good a better

01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:58.660
Job of up streaming things into the kernel. Mm-hmm

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:00.780
Like when B was talking about, you know

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.740
So we'll hopefully see more better support and yeah

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:09.780
You won't you won't bought by this one-off system on a chip that runs this one distribution with these binaries that are compiled against that

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:12.060
Distributions of you know modules that'll just work

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:16.700
Yes producer q5 says points out if you take my argument to the logical extreme

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:22.140
That would be a argument to stay with iOS or Android is because of the apps in the walled garden the ecosystem

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:26.460
And I think with each thing there is sort of it's not black and white

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:32.060
There is a gray area like if you want something for example that requires gigabit Ethernet

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:34.700
Then maybe the old droid would just be the more obvious choice, right?

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:37.980
I'm not saying one is better than the other I'm saying I think one of the reasons why

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:42.660
Something can be popular like that is because of all of that and it's for some people that's what they need or like

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:46.940
You know the the mycroft folks, for example, they could ship anything in the mycroft

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:52.100
Yeah their own hardware whatever but the Raspberry Pi is attractive for some of the reasons we outlined in our discussion

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:58.060
I think it's fascinating and I loves it and I love the Microsoft's trying that's super adorable. It's all running Linux

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:03.100
Yeah, you could put Windows 10 Internet of Things core

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:07.940
Edition that just rolls right off the tongue Windows Windows 10

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:12.900
How about just I can't even just that even just that just drives me crazy about Microsoft, you know, we need to do

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:15.660
We need to punish Chris. I

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:21.500
I got some feedback this week from the next action show. I introduced an app pick

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:23.820
that

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:29.860
Has a pretty big disclaimer and I didn't make that disclaimer and for some of you who are very privacy focused

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:32.180
I sort of like committed like

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:38.460
Total crime here and I I need to I need to come out. I need to admit my faults

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:42.980
Yes, I got to admit that I did make a mistake and then I got to tell you what's going on

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:49.460
Give you a full disclaimer about it because otherwise, I'm gonna get in trouble and maybe I could blame Noah

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:53.140
You think I think you already have. Oh, did I just now?

01:11:56.700 --> 01:12:01.300
I like the way you think West, you know, what else I like Linux Academy go to Linux Academy comm slash

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:07.580
Unplugged and check them out. This is a great sponsor for our audience because they are perfect fit you guys

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:11.540
It's not just a feature like they don't just have always make sure we have Linux on our support page

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:14.460
And let's make sure we can do Red Hat because that's something people use

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:20.020
They are passionate about Linux the higher educators and developers and they bring them together and they created the Linux Academy platform

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:24.940
And now they're filling out the back end staff. So that way all of the content stays relevant. They can introduce new features

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:28.940
They they do have like the Red Hat certified engineer stuff

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:33.400
They're working on right now and those sort of those administration courses a bunch of AWS stuff over

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.940
2330 courses, I know

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:43.860
Scenario-based labs where you work in their advanced lab environment complete scenarios from the beginning to the end. How did you know?

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:50.940
Because I learned that when you learn the Linux Academy Linux Academy comm slash unplug you support the show take advantage of

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:56.660
The great discount we get they have instructor mentoring which I think is really great. They have graded server exercises

01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:00.420
Big one helps you if you got test a phobia like I do and you know

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:04.580
You're not just thinking that you've learned this stuff, you know, you didn't just read the articles like you've done it

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:09.020
And you've been tested on it and you know, one of the other things that's been really nice for me is being able to go

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:14.580
In there and conceptualize how long it would actually take to learn something like a topic like we'll say I want to learn how to write

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:16.580
Some PHP. What would that actually take? Oh

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:22.940
Here it all is outline step by step what I could expect and Linux Academy works in such a great way because you can say I

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:28.900
Have this much of time available this, you know a couple hours on Monday a couple hours on Tuesday. Does it work with the zero hours Chris?

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:34.180
Well in that case what you do is you want to use the Nuggets oh, yeah, right you would so you can if you got zero hours

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.540
Available what you do is when you're driving down the road Wes

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:41.700
And you're not driving but somebody else is driving when you're being driven down the road

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.460
They have a new iOS app now

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.300
I know you don't have the Nexus 5 there, but you just bring an internet paddle with you

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:51.500
Bring it up on the internet paddle device Linux Academy. They are working on an Android device though for your Nexus

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.980
They have a really the Nugget system is actually a really cool idea

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:59.300
So they've been working in some of their live video stream events so you can just you know if you don't have time to do a

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:04.700
Course you can just kind of benefit from watching some of their live events where educators speak or they talk about the platform

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:10.340
Cool. Yeah, they also have nuggets are like two minutes long. You got two minutes, right? You got two minutes Wes

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:13.780
I think so. Yeah, then you can do anything right now. Shoot. You could do it right now

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:19.140
I'm talking about Linux Academy every single Tuesday West Linux Academy calm slash unplugged right there practice exams

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:23.500
Check out their detailed notes comprehensive study guides. You can download them from the link in the description below

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.500
It's comprehensive study guides. You can download

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.020
Stuff you can listen to offline in the shower

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:33.780
Seven plus distros to pick from automatically adjust the courseware and the virtual machines which spin up on-demand

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.620
Right when you need them you get to SSHN because

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.240
You know, they know that's what you want to do

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.200
I know if you want you could tell that but I'm just saying you should probably know you can't tell it. No

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:51.180
Linux Academy calm slash unplugged and a big thank you Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplug program great fit

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:55.140
Go check him out. All right, Wes. So I'm a big idiot and

01:14:56.180 --> 01:15:01.940
You know, I'm not gonna blame Noah, but I'm just gonna say things were bumpy on Sunday's Linux action show behind the scenes

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:07.900
It was a rough ride as it were and tell everyone. No, I won't I'm not just saying zombies

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:12.940
Don't run Linux things were a little rough and a bit of feedback. We got on Sunday show

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:15.140
I'm gonna see if I can zoom in enhance your watch

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.940
It came in from Maroki

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:23.020
Marco Marcoli Chris. Are you aware that by using the n1 client?

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:29.360
All your mail is being routed through their third-party services by default n1 uses the analysis

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:34.100
API an open-source sync engine to handle mail sync operations on their own cloud

01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:37.060
Not their own cloud, but their own cloud infrastructure

01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:44.420
In effect, this means the emails you get from the app first pass through and are stored on their server. That's a big no-no in

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:48.340
My book and so my accidental

01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:52.460
Omission omission. Thank you omission of this fact

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:57.420
Led to a thread on our Linux because why not?

01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:59.900
That's what we do. That's what we do

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:03.820
Yeah, where they say n1 is a very nice open-source client with modern workflow

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:09.940
But it requires that all emails are synced on the nalaya servers and run and maintain a sync engine or run the engine locally

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:17.620
Would you trust a third-party service provider with your emails? However secure they claim to be so it's part one my bad

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:22.840
I'm sorry. I didn't mention that we ran a little short on time and I neglected to bring that part up

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:27.940
However, the reason why it didn't stand out to me as a big issue is because they do have a gpl3 server

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:31.500
You can run yourself. They do. Yeah, and we have a link in the show notes

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:35.240
So it's not like you have to use their server the one big disappoint if you are gonna use

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.360
Active sync the open source version does not support it. That was big. Yeah, that's not a bad thing for me

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:46.120
But yeah, but there is like the open source a DAV mail client will translate active sync to IMAP, etc

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.980
So mm-hmm. Well, and here's the other thing why and this is where I was going with this

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.420
Where do you draw the line because for me and one is connecting to a gmail account

01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.440
So do I stop using gmail like to me? Where do we do? Where do we take this?

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.840
And we seem to be now in this position where I was looking at this

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.480
There's like three or four email clients now for mobile devices and they all use server-side mail processing sure

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:15.600
It's becoming super common on mobile because you have lots of server-side processing power

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:19.380
You don't have battery constraints there. You can do all your kind of filtering push what you need

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:19.920
Yeah

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:24.960
You do push notifications and you open up the app and the app pulls down the latest stuff and this is becoming really common on

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:28.920
Mobile and now they're starting to do it on desktop and it's not gonna be just email. Yeah

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:34.280
Where do you draw the line? West? Do you do you do you draw a hard line and say I just won't use

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:41.320
Third-party hosted services. I don't care how trustworthy they are. I don't care how secure they claim to be. It's too risky

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.240
Do you walk a line somewhere? Is there a great?

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:49.400
You have like rings of trust, you know right on me brother. Well, whether they're like some some communications

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:53.400
You know, maybe your various things where there's a lot of mail that I don't really care if it goes through

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.840
I mean, I do not trust nihilists in the last however you say their name

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:02.480
I don't trust Gmail either, so most of my Gmail Google has more interest in getting out stuff out of my email

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.680
Right, but that said, you know if I was already running my own private mail server

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.160
I probably wouldn't want to introduce this third party into the system

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.120
And if it was not super easy to spin up my own sink engine

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.440
Then I might just keep using what I'm doing now

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.680
But I think you have to operate with regions of like this is my secure mail. This is where I do my most secure stuff

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:27.680
I know, you know, I know who has access and when and then you can go from there. I'll tell you I feel West like the

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:33.880
polar bear on a melting ice cap and I'm sitting here floating in the ocean and my and the little piece of ice that I'm

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:38.160
On is getting smaller and smaller and smaller and and like eventually

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.640
I'm just gonna have to go jump in the ocean and I'm just gonna have to swim

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:42.880
Man, it's either you do that

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:49.480
It feels like in some ways you either you either play by what the world is doing or you're just the weird Linux user

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:53.560
Who doesn't use any of the services everyone else does. Mm-hmm, which that's no fun either

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:58.680
No, because then you start to get left out of certain things. But also there is a bit of a stigma there

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.960
Oh, yeah. Well the Linux guy, of course, he's not gonna use that like you don't want to be that guy either or gal

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:10.320
So I I don't know where did I like I don't know at what point like Twitter also another example all the data is

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.320
You know on Twitter servers

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:17.560
So I find it's like it's fine when it's well fine I say but you know when it's one service you can kind of

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:22.360
Compartmentalize sure you deal with it, but when it becomes more normalized exactly when it's everything you use

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:28.560
Another example of this is IRC cloud IRC cloud is a server side IRC server that logs in for you

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:33.680
And then you go to the website and it downloads all the IRC. It's your little fancy private bouncer. Yeah, exactly

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:37.880
So I I this is I think you know, you could see this more and more with instant messaging

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.600
I could see this with all kinds of applications imagine like a like a server side terminal service

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:49.200
Right where you connect you open up your terminal and it connects to some cloud instance of a terminal where you maybe have like it's like

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.600
It's like hosted screen, right? It's like some sort of weird right really easy to use hosted screen

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.600
And I there could be all kinds of reasons for that

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.840
I'm wondering if I wonder if they're you know, if it's since it is GPL

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:04.080
I wonder if there'll be like private servers like would you if you signed an agreement someone?

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:09.600
Yeah, like would you use someone else's hosted sink engine if they had like a firmer agreement about I would want to just put it

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:14.000
On my own drop. Well, yeah, that's you does anyone in the number has anyone done that? I I haven't bothered you yet

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000
But no, I wonder I think it's too new kids and you had an idea you want to jump in here. Go ahead

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:23.000
Yeah, there's actually several third-party mail

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.200
Hosts and whatnot like it's quick slash start page. They're the same company

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:36.600
That you could actually pay them a subscription service and they'll give you access to an email

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:41.000
Server that they don't scan your email. They don't do anything with it's just all yours

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:46.200
So the overall theme on the our Linux thread is a hard no

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.800
No way no hell no way at all. Would I let anybody host my mail for me and I mostly agree

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.600
In concept, but in I guess in theory but in actual practice, it seems to be less and less

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I guess I have a hard time. I

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.600
Guess I have a hard time. I get it, but I don't know everything goes through Gmail for most people already. That's true

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:11.720
Yeah, and I wonder what for Linux users. Where do we go with something like this?

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:13.000
That's where it comes back

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.480
Like if you're already running your own mail server, then it's not really relevant

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:19.400
Like of course, it's a hard no, but for everyone else, it's just one more. I think the solution

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.600
I think there is a solution

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:23.520
I think when projects like n1 come out and they say yeah

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.040
And we also make the server-side open source if you want to run it

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:32.960
Run it. Yeah, use it contribute to that and make it a valuable thing for the project and make it something that other projects are

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:37.400
You're encouraged to do. I was really surprised to see like I couldn't even find a digital ocean

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:40.000
You know how to yet on how to set up a sink engine

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.400
So like there's a good opportunity for someone in the community as well

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.400
Yeah, it's it's it's very very new and I have a link to that s in the show notes

01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.880
If you guys are curious, you can go check that out

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:55.800
Mobile remaining closing thoughts on the whole having more and more services hosted and how it's sort of infringes on privacy

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:02.640
Open that up. Yeah, so it's it's just I guess I understand where you're coming from

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:08.080
I guess the the only thing I can really say to kind of give reflection on it is I

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:13.320
Guess the limit for a lot of people is going to be you know, they realize that they're using Gmail

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:18.120
They're using some service and they're sure that maybe Google does go over and just you'd go through

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:21.120
All their emails and you know, it's fairly privacy

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.120
I know it lacks a lot of privacy

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.520
Their big thing is they don't

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:34.520
Know at least for me anyway, I shouldn't speak for everyone

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:39.520
But a lot of people I guess are kind of upset and don't want another person reaching into the data

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:42.520
It's like too many hands in the cookie jar right now. That's true

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:47.520
And that cookie jar is only as strong as the weakest link. Isn't that true Wimpy?

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:53.520
It is and you know a lot of people do use Google and we can't know for sure

01:22:54.520 --> 01:23:00.520
How much Google are complying or not with government requests for access to data

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:06.520
But if you've got to proxy all of your mail through a smaller organization like Nihilus

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:14.520
They will absolutely roll over if they get pressured by government organizations

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:20.520
So don't double proxy your email through smaller clients do what you suggested

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.520
Which is if you want to use a platform like that host it yourself

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.520
Yeah, very much. So this has been my general take is have one that is

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:34.520
You know, it is honestly life is easier just to have a Google account

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.520
There's just certain things that make it easier

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:40.520
So that's where a lot of stuff will go to that I don't have a super high priority

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.520
And then if I don't have a private I have a private hosted email account

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.520
That's like for actual private communications, right?

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:49.520
And that's just been and and and it seems like to me that I

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.520
If I really cared that's where you have to draw the line

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:58.520
And I've always I've always kind of liked the idea of pushing that a little bit

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:02.520
And making myself a little uncomfortable and say well I could do a hosted version of this

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:07.520
But let's try building around and we go back and forth in that all the time different stuff

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.520
But it's always sort of the general where do you want to allocate your resources?

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:13.520
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's sort of the general direction we go in and I don't know

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:16.520
So anyways, I do apologize though for not mentioning the server side

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.520
This that was sort of a crazy moment in the show

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.520
And so I just sort of neglected to mention it and that was my bad

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.520
So that's my errata for this week's episode of the Unplugged Program

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:29.520
I'd like to say to you that a lot of the stuff I've seen I've never used it really

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:33.520
But just looking through their documentation and one yeah and looking at like the extensibility

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.520
It seems like a cool project and the fact that they're going open source at the start

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:41.520
I hope that community springs up that does run this stuff on yeah, you know

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.520
Yeah, and don't be turned off just because it looks like an OS 10 application

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.520
If you download it and you turn on the dark theme, it's not so bad

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.520
It is a Chromium application too

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.520
So I'm not saying it's the perfect thing

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.520
It's just with Thunderbird kind of being an unknown and Geary now being Pantheon Mail for elementary OS

01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:01.520
Evolution being something that makes me want to commit suicide and Kmail feeling like it's from the 90s

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:06.520
I'm just sort of looking for a nice desktop mail client that can handle a huge inbox

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.520
And so here's the thing is their server side processing

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.520
You know what that means?

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:14.520
The client doesn't crap itself when I open up an inbox with 50,000 unread messages

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:20.520
So that there's like not a lot of not a lot of email clients meet that standard

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:25.520
And Thunderbird is one of them although Thunderbird just choose and choose infinitely

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.520
Thunderbird never stops chewing on my inbox, but at least it's still responsive to

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:31.520
Creepy Uncle says I should try out Outlook

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.520
Are you in the Mamba Room, Creepy?

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:34.520
Creepy on mobile?

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.520
Creepy, are you drunk right now?

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:37.520
Outlook?

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:39.520
No, I'm in here

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:41.520
Outlook?

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.520
World class email, Chris

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.520
Get the heck out of here

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.520
Crossover, come on

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.520
No, no, you know what?

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.520
Get it out of here

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.520
No way, no way

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.520
All right, so that'll bring us to the end

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.520
Unless anybody else has anything else they want to contribute

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:58.520
Going once, going twice

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:01.520
All right, that'll bring us to the end of this week's Linux Unplugged

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.520
Did you know, Wes, we do this show live?

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.520
Every week

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.520

01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.520
That's right, JB in the PST

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.520
That's deep and so true

jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact for the emails

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.520
Thanks for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:59.520
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:16.520
Holy crap

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:19.520
It cannot be 350

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.520
Holy smokes

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:23.520
I have to start unfiltering in like 40 minutes

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:27.520
This is, oh my gosh, jbtitles.com, let's vote

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.520
You know what's weird about the windstorm?

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:31.520
So those people that are listening don't know this, hopefully

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.520
But we had to stop recording partway through the show

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.520
Because the lights started flickering here in the studio

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:40.520
And if the machine loses power, Wes, and the file isn't completed

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:41.520
We lose everything in the file

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.520
It has to be completed, right?

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.520
The file has to be closed

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:48.520
And so I stopped and started recording so that we wouldn't lose all of the show

01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:50.520
But you know what's weird about the wind right now?

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.520
It's freaking sunny out

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.520
Yeah, now it's like a beautiful day

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:55.520
It's still a gust of wind

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.520
But it's like, I don't know, it's strange out there

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.520
With gray on the horizon

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.520
Yeah, oh man

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:05.520
Don't even make me talk about Panda Express, Warhead

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.520
Don't even, don't even

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.520
All right, jbtitles.com

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:13.520
We've got to pick this thing fast because they've got these other jerks that are going to come here in the studio

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.520
This guy named Chris, he's got to get here and start another show

01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.520
Man, I hate that guy

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.520
I feel like I'm already losing my voice

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:19.520
A little bit

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.520
You have hours to go

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:21.520
Can you hear that? Yeah, yeah

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.520
It's going to be rough

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.520
Anyways Wimpy, thanks for all the great contributions today

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.520
That was excellent sir

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.520
My pleasure

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.520
And thank you to everybody in the mobile room for being here

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:33.520
Yeah, really

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:36.520
Thanks for joining us on this Super Tuesday

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.520
Every Tuesday is super with Linux unplugged

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:39.520
That's good

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:57.520
Let's go with that, that's our new slogan
