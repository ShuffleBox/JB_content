00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged, a very special holiday edition of the show for 2016.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, the show that promises to be the best of, but how could it actually deliver?

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My name is Chris on a very special edition of the show. We decided to give people the week off,

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and by people, I mean everybody but the beard and I, because this is our collection, our look back at 2016

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
for the Linux Unplugged program, and how could you encapsulate this show in one single best of?

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It can't be done. And let's be honest, I'm too busy thinking about the presents for my kids to think about this,

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
so we pawned it off onto a bunch of bots. They were powered by the Google Compute Cloud.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They just had to analyze our inboxes for like a year, and then they came up with the best of topics for us

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
into a spreadsheet, which I have right here, and now we're going to formulate that into a show for you.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What could go wrong? Some of that is actually true. Some of that is actually true.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, coming up on this week's episode, we'll go back over the year for Linux Unplugged,

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
pick out a few of the gems, and see if we can spot a few of the trends too.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You know, that virtual lug, you never know what you're going to get. It's a random mix.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The show really is fairly unstructured. When we launch into a Linux Unplugged episode,

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
we have a brief outline of what we want to cover, but the good stuff is always kind of spontaneous.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's the juicy stuff, so let's look at this list, see what the Google bots have come up with,

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and see what might be a little interesting. Now, I'm looking through. I see a couple of things.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's start out here with a server in your pocket. We can start talking about Mate,

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and then the classic debates of the traditional desktop versus Unity, versus Gnome,

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
begin marking the first of many debates for 2016.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So Wimpy, I'm interested to some degree to get your perception, because Ubuntu Mate is one of those distros

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
where I have not, to the best of my knowledge, found a single thing when using Ubuntu Mate,

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
where it makes me feel like I'm on an alternative desktop from standard Ubuntu.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Everything just works. I mean, literally everything just works.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
In fact, so much so that actually all of the production machines that I have here in Grand Forks,

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
with the exception of the one I'm on now, but all the rest of them are actually running Ubuntu Mate,

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
because it runs lighter than it does with Unity.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And I'm wondering, you know, what kind of considerations went into that,

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and how you guys feel about that, and how that plays out.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, Ubuntu Mate is just Ubuntu. In fact, it is Ubuntu.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
When you boil it down, you simply, I say simply, it's taken a year and a half to do.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You remove Unity and you put the Mate desktop on top,

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
but then you keep all of the Ubuntu tools and integrations that already exist underneath the hood,

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
which is what gives you all of that stability and just works goodness of Ubuntu on a traditional desktop environment.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So, and one of the reasons why Mate is lighter than Unity is that it's based on Gnome 2,

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
with all of the old compatibility stuff from Gnome 1 removed,

37
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and all of the underpinnings upgraded to the latest versions of all the recent technologies.

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And it's all written in C, so it's a very lightweight implementation by, you know,

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
in comparison to what it was when it was Gnome 2 in its sort of last versions.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So, it's kind of happenstance in some respects that Mate has now come out as a lightweight desktop alternative.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Outstanding. Anyone else have thoughts or opinions on desktop environments?

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Sorry, my audio is terrible. I'm in America for scale.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So, there's a few things. One, whenever anyone says I'm one of the few people who like Unity,

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I want to slap them because there are millions of people who use Unity.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Watch out at scale. Watch out at scale, Noah.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And, you know, saying I'm one of the few people.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What actually is the case is there are a few really negative people who don't like it and who are very vocal.

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And there's a vast number of people who use it and aren't vocal.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So, you know, saying you're one of the few people, you should actually say I'm one of the majority who like Unity, to be fair.

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So, the original question, you know, from the guideposts on Reddit was about, you know, why don't we just use Gnome?

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You could use that same argument about every single desktop.

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why don't you just all pack up and go home and use something else is effectively what you're saying.

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And every single desktop has their own niche that they want to fulfill or use cases that they address that others don't.

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Like, you know, for example, elementary have their niche.

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I would like to have a, you know, well-designed, pretty robust, you know, functional desktop.

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That sounds like a reasonable thing.

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And so, you know, I think it's unreasonable to suggest that the people who are working on those things should throw that away and use something else instead.

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You might just as well say why don't KDE give up and switch to Gnome?

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's a nonsensical argument from my point of view.

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's fair.

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So, basically, and I admit that this is a horrible, horrible thing to base a generalization on, but I'm admitting that up front.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But it was a couple months ago, maybe even a year ago, that we did a poll, a straw poll, to find out what desktop environment people were using.

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And I was shocked at how many people didn't vote for Unity and Gnome shot way to the top and Unity was down there.

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And I guess I've had that correct or incorrect or correct perception that Unity just wasn't preferred by a lot of the people that, you know, that are aware of other desktop environments that are out there.

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And I fully admit that, you know, working in the space that you work in, you're going to have a much, much, much more realistic perception.

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Or completely biased, and you should throw away my opinion completely, and you should only listen to people who are outside of this bubble, because their opinion won't be tarnished, you know, potentially is one side of it.

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But the flip side is, any of these polls are deeply flawed, the same way that using DistroWatch is your measure.

68
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Exactly the same.

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's ridiculous. And people who place any importance on something which is basically a poll, which can be shared amongst a subreddit, which massively skews the numbers for any one distro, plus or minus, when in fact, the actual people who use and like a particular desktop or user interface or application or whatever, are ultimately never going to see that poll.

70
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
My mum uses Ubuntu and has used Ubuntu for years. She will never see that poll and never click on anything in that poll.

71
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's exactly the point I was thinking is that...

72
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:02,000
However many millions of people in China use the Ubuntu desktop, they're never going to see this because of things written in English, for one. So it's just ludicrous.

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We in particular also are a community of Linux enthusiasts and people who like customization. I think some of Unity's strengths is that it can be widely deployed and it's pretty easy for people to just get it.

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The icons are right there on the left. You hit the super key, things just work. So it has a lot going for it. Like you said, your mum can use it. My mum uses it. It's great.

75
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, and we also have... Unity is actually the default desktop, not the default desktop, it's the only desktop, on all of our kiosk machines that we deploy. So basically, if you think about the target audience there, it's...

76
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We're taking people from all walks of the technical spectrum and saying that no matter who walks in, if they sit down and they want to check their email, print a boarding pass or check the weather, they're going to be able to accomplish those things quickly, easily and without complaining to the front desk.

77
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Because of course, if they complain, then we lose the contract. And what we found is that little bar on the side of Unity, which by the way requires no tweaking and requires no extensions, which means we don't have to update anything, is incredibly useful in a situation like that.

78
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So I agree that the average person walking around the street is going to sit down and have no trouble using Unity. And I think I even started out by saying, I phrased it poorly, but the gist of the message was, it's my personal belief that Unity is a more polished desktop than GNOME is.

79
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But for whatever reason, and maybe it is just that people are terribly vocal, I guess there is a perception from some people that the Unity desktop is inferior, correct or incorrect?

80
00:09:41,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, that's different. Any individual, any Reddit consumer is entitled to have their opinion and it's perfectly fine for someone to say Unity is inferior because of these X, Y, Z reasons, in the same way that someone might not like Enlightenment or someone might not like KDE because it doesn't work their workflow or the apps don't look right.

81
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:30,000
For whatever reason, it's perfectly fine for people to have their opinions and like buttholes, everyone's gone. The problem is when you try and extrapolate from a poll on a random website somewhere and make bold, assertive statements about whether something is right or wrong or whether something is good or bad based on a button clicked by a bunch of random people on the internet.

82
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It makes no sense whatsoever to me, but that's just me.

83
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No, I think that's completely fair.

84
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's talk about my Librem impressions. What's the point of a perfect desktop if you don't have great hardware?

85
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay, Wes, you had some time to, you know.

86
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes, I did. You know, it's a nice looking laptop.

87
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It is. It feels good.

88
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, it's not too heavy. It's reasonably well balanced. It's metal, so that's kind of cool. You don't see that every day on a Linux laptop.

89
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So what is missing, as far as I'm concerned, on the Librem 15?

90
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I will say there are some sharp edges on this thing.

91
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's true. That's true. That is true. There's something missing, though, that's a pretty big deal to me.

92
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Can you guess what it is?

93
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're looking in the right area right now. You're warm. You're real warm, Wes. You're real warm.

94
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, there's no CD drive, but I don't think that's what you want.

95
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're right. That's not it.

96
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's got SD card. It's got USB. It's got a TC in. That's important.

97
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That is important.

98
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's got some seemingly mysteriously unlabeled switches.

99
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes, it does. Unlabeled switches, hardware switches.

100
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
HDMI?

101
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah.

102
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't know.

103
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There's one port that's not there that's pretty important to me. Ethernet.

104
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah, there's no Ethernet, and the one I backed specifically did list Ethernet.

105
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's a bummer.

106
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It was one of those little RJ45 drop-down ports that is a half port that you have to pry open.

107
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Pry open before you can actually use it.

108
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But in the crowdfunding version, it did list Ethernet.

109
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't like being live on the air and relying on Wi-Fi, so that was a bit of a bummer.

110
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It was the version I got, the edition I got, no Ethernet.

111
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And I've tried to track down when the Ethernet kind of disappeared, if it was the switch to Rev2 or not,

112
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
but the initial report of Rev2, it would have Ethernet,

113
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and then there was another post where it doesn't.

114
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I have a few links in the show notes.

115
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So I was a little – I –

116
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You had to probably use like a USB 3.0 adapter or something.

117
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, and it's one of those things where the only reason why I kind of mention it is because I wouldn't have bought it

118
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
if it didn't have Ethernet, because Ethernet is actually a pretty big deal to me.

119
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I actually like gigabit speeds, not 802.11 speeds.

120
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And you want low latency for studio stuff anyway.

121
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah, exactly.

122
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So that was sort of my first impression.

123
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But outside of that, the metal coloring, like this is not a small thing.

124
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Like they nailed this.

125
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This looks – mine is not the dark metal.

126
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Mine is like an exact – looks like a MacBook.

127
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It really does.

128
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah, metal, which is pretty cool.

129
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, it's not a bad looking machine at all.

130
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
A couple other things, just first impressions that jumped out at me,

131
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
is the version I looked at online, they had –

132
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and let's see if I can pull it up here for you.

133
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Scrolling, scrolling.

134
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They show – there it is.

135
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There it is.

136
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
They show what they call the purism key, which is the super key,

137
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
which is where the Windows key –

138
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
To make sure everything is pure.

139
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm going to go ahead and open the laptop up, which will wake it up.

140
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You may start hearing it.

141
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Wes, if you could just take a look at the keyboard, what does that look like?

142
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What key?

143
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Does that super key to you look like a square to you,

144
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
or does that look like a Windows key to you?

145
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No, that looks like the Windows logo, Chris.

146
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes.

147
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So I was a little surprised that the keyboard –

148
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Are you running Windows on there?

149
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Did it come with Windows?

150
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No.

151
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No.

152
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I was a little surprised that the keyboard had a Windows key.

153
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Not a big deal, but I was expecting the hardware –

154
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's another – you're going to have to get one of those little penguin stickers.

155
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

156
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The other thing that's challenging about this is the specs that they list online

157
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
do not match the specs that I was shipped, because I got an older model.

158
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And the main thing that's really jumping out at me about this one –

159
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't know if you can hear it, Wes.

160
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Is it windy in the studio, Chris?

161
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No, Wes.

162
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I've woken the laptop up, and so that's the sound it makes.

163
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And it's loud enough, Wes, that –

164
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What the heck is that?

165
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's the laptop.

166
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That's the fan.

167
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That's the laptop.

168
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I got to tell you, you walk into a room and you can hear this thing.

169
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah, definitely.

170
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I heard it when I walked into the studio this morning.

171
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In fact, I'm going to put it to sleep again so the sound goes down.

172
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But it's very loud.

173
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Are you holding it up to the microphone and shaking it around?

174
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Close to it.

175
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No, no.

176
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's – no, my mouth is much closer than the fan.

177
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I now have it off.

178
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's very quiet when it's off, so that's an excellent way.

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It sounds like –

180
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Weird noise.

181
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It sounds like what other laptops make when they're like totally maxed out.

182
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, it might be a little weird because the gate is trying to specifically filter it out.

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Right.

184
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah.

185
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That sounds like you're rendering a video or something.

186
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So that sort of almost immediately eliminates it for production use.

187
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Wes, however, brought over a mini screwdriver kit, and I'm considering opening the bottom

188
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
of it and seeing if I can replace the fan.

189
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's not driver control.

190
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
At least take a look, you know.

191
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So here's what I tried to do.

192
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It ships with Purism OS, which is using Cinnamon for the desktop.

193
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And the nice thing about that is you can actually manage the trackpad.

194
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So I reloaded with Ubuntu 16.04 and did all the installation, set everything up.

195
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The only proprietary driver in use is the Intel microcode stuff.

196
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's got Broadwell Iris 6100 graphics.

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That sounds nice.

198
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, it's a three gigahertz processor.

199
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There is nothing you can do thermal management-wise about that fan.

200
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So I could not – there was no driver to load.

201
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There was no LM sensors command.

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There's nothing you can do.

203
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It is just hard set to full blast.

204
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's wired just on maximum.

205
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You probably won't have any overheating problems.

206
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah.

207
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So my hope is I'm going to pull off the bottom and see if I can replace that fan or whatever.

208
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I mean, with integrated graphics and whatnot, I just can't imagine it needs to be running like that.

209
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Especially when you're not actively really doing anything.

210
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Ah, thank you.

211
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So FreeBSDSA says the email from 4 – 2715 states that the RJ45 was removed from Rev2.

212
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah.

213
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah.

214
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Is there UFI settings for it?

215
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

216
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Go ahead, Wim.

217
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You had a question regarding the fan noise.

218
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
No, I've got a potential solution for fan noise.

219
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh, yeah.

220
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Mm-hmm.

221
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Though, Entroware ran into this fan noise problem when they were working on the same

222
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
line of machines.

223
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And it's a bug in the firmware from the ODM.

224
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And you may be able to work around this by holding the power down for like 10 seconds

225
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and hard powering off the machine.

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And that may reset the system and the fans may correct themselves.

227
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Okay.

228
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So I'm holding it down right now.

229
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Of course, it just went to sleep when I did that.

230
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But it actually just turned off instantly.

231
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Hmm.

232
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah.

233
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah.

234
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That I'm willing to play around with.

235
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah.

236
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That would be great.

237
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I did go through the BIOS and look for like thermal management settings and stuff like

238
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
that.

239
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I found nothing there.

240
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The trackpad.

241
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Let's talk about the trackpad.

242
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I've heard some interesting things about the trackpad online.

243
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It looks pretty big.

244
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
All right.

245
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So I'm holding it down for 10 seconds.

246
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The problem is it instantly turns off and then nothing happens.

247
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The trackpad is big.

248
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It works well.

249
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The problem is both GNOME and Ubuntu by default, they just only allow you to scroll on the

250
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
very small side here.

251
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yes, right.

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If you use Purism OS, it comes with Cinnamon.

253
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And Cinnamon's mouse control panel settings allow you to actually change it to two-finger

254
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
scrolling, which works better.

255
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Keyboard is pretty good.

256
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The escape key on mine is a little mushy.

257
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It doesn't always register.

258
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Mushy.

259
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah, my escape key doesn't always register.

260
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So I sometimes have to hit escape twice, which means sometimes I have to hit it four times.

261
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So it's not awesome that way.

262
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm holding it down for 10 seconds.

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
We'll see what happens.

264
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll keep it at grub so it doesn't boot.

265
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
All right.

266
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So I should be about five seconds in.

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
This thing's really loud.

268
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah, it is.

269
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

270
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This might be like a workplace hazard.

271
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Still running.

272
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It hasn't turned off yet.

273
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't know if it's going to turn off.

274
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I feel like I've been holding it for like 20 seconds.

275
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Feels like it's been like 10 minutes.

276
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Been a while.

277
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah, it's still going.

278
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I know Mike's listening.

279
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Mike, telegram me.

280
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There's something else we should be doing.

281
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Did it get quieter?

282
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Is it quieter now?

283
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't think so.

284
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No.

285
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:28,520
What I was expecting is the machine should go off, and it's once it's off, you can then

286
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,360
power it on again, and it may.

287
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
It's not guaranteed.

288
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
It may.

289
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
All right.

290
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
So I just let off and turn off the fans.

291
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
No.

292
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
Huh.

293
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Yeah.

294
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Yeah.

295
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Your GQ is loose.

296
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
So FreeBSD, you have yours.

297
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
What have been your initial impressions?

298
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,360
It's not a bad piece of hardware.

299
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:56,800
If I'd have seen it in the store before backing it, I probably wouldn't have bought it.

300
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,440
All in all, it is nice, except for, like I said, the loose GQ.

301
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,520
And of course, when I'm running something other than PROS, I have trackpad problems

302
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,080
that I'm going to work on.

303
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,880
Yeah, that's been my experience, too.

304
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,680
Performance, pretty darn good.

305
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,800
You thought it's been pretty performant on yours?

306
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,200
Yeah, it performs really well.

307
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,760
I've done some full-screen Flash movies on it with no problem.

308
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,420
Now Wimpy, I guess the trackpad has a bit of a rep.

309
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,040
You know a little bit about some of its tricks already.

310
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
Yeah.

311
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:38,560
There's no mainline Linux kernel support for the trackpad that's in the Librems.

312
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:45,600
So there's been a few of us working on a driver for the BYD trackpad.

313
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,760
And that's currently an out-of-tree patch.

314
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:55,080
And what Purism are doing is shipping a bespoke kernel with PureOS.

315
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:03,720
It has the full touch gesture support in PureOS, but if you install any other version of Linux,

316
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,320
then it will revert to a PS2 mouse.

317
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,880
Hence the weird scroll and stuff like that.

318
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,600
So I have a kernel patch I can send you.

319
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Wow.

320
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
Take it back like ten years here.

321
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,400
This is not why you buy a laptop dedicated for Linux though.

322
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,840
No, this is the point.

323
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:31,720
The other thing is, you know when in the past you've talked about System76 don't just take

324
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,600
the ODM equipment and stick their badge on it and ship it out the door.

325
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:43,280
They actually work on firmware and BIOS enhancements and all the rest of it and get bespoke changes.

326
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
Right.

327
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,220
This is the same sort of thing that Entroware have done, and they've overcome some of these

328
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,560
issues that you're discussing now, like the fan for example.

329
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,280
And that doesn't seem to have happened here.

330
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
So here's the rig I got.

331
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Eight gigabytes of RAM, 500 gigabyte SSD, which I paid a little extra for.

332
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,080
It's supposed to have a CD-ROM and DVD.

333
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,520
It does not, which I don't care about.

334
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
No big deal.

335
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,720
But I'm looking at the specs I bought on Indiegogo.

336
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,760
It is listed as having a CD and DVD ROM.

337
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,360
It also ships with like a 65 watt adapter, which I'm not sure is actually enough.

338
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
It takes a while to charge.

339
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,480
The nice thing is it's kind of small.

340
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:37,120
I paid for a core, this is a three gigahertz Broadwell CPU, Iris 6100 graphics, eight gigabytes

341
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,240
of RAM, I would have preferred 16, eight gigabytes of RAM, 1920 by 1080 display.

342
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,320
I paid $1,824 for this machine.

343
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,800
If I was going to spend $1,800 on a machine today, you could guarantee it's going to come

344
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,200
with Skylake.

345
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
You could guarantee-

346
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,800
Probably at least 16 gigs of RAM.

347
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,120
Maybe dedicated graphics at $1,800.

348
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,680
You might get that too.

349
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,520
Now is it going to be something that has hardware switches for a webcam?

350
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,240
Is it going to have something that has hardware switches for the mic and stuff like that?

351
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,640
I actually do really like that.

352
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

353
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,880
And I also like the idea of supporting a company who is pushing the conversation about privacy

354
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,680
and security forward, and it's their primary leading cause.

355
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,840
So those are things that my money went towards that I still like.

356
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,320
Basically where I'm at right now with this thing is it has a strange USB-C port that

357
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
I wasn't expecting.

358
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,400
Yes, I saw that.

359
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
That's interesting.

360
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
I don't know.

361
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,860
You see, it didn't come with any documentation.

362
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,860
It just came-

363
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,860
So there's no manual.

364
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,860
There's no-

365
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,860
Naked in the box.

366
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,920
It's a very generic box, in fact, when I got the box, I immediately started to feel like,

367
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
oh no.

368
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,720
I immediately started like this, it was starting to set my expectations low because the box

369
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
was used-

370
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,720
A finished kind of thing.

371
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:01,000
It had like five or 10 other FedEx stickers on it, and there was not even like a brochure

372
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
in the box, right?

373
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,280
It was no documentation, nothing.

374
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,400
No thank you for backing our project, sorry it took so long, nothing.

375
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,960
And so that sort of was like, eh, I'm a little worried about that.

376
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,080
That all aside though, one of the things I would have liked to have in the box is what

377
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,200
is this USB-C port?

378
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,320
Because the one I backed doesn't have this port.

379
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,080
The one I backed, where this port's at, was an ethernet port.

380
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
And is this USB-C?

381
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Can I charge the device with this?

382
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Because it hasn't-

383
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
Is it real USB-C?

384
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,080
It's USB-C with an electricity bolt.

385
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,540
Does that mean I can actually draw power from that port?

386
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,200
What does that do?

387
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
I got nothing.

388
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
I got no-

389
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,680
There's also questions if this is actually HDMI 2.0 or not, I'm not sure about that.

390
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Those are issues.

391
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,080
Have you tried the SD card slot?

392
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
No.

393
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,840
But I think the other thing I like is it looks like perhaps that's a physical switch for

394
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
the SD card slot.

395
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
Oh wow.

396
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,860
Perhaps physically turn it off, I'm not sure.

397
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,120
If I could get this fan replaced, this is a pretty-

398
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,920
The thing I do like about this is it is a damn unique one-off laptop.

399
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Yes it is.

400
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
And it is-

401
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,160
It looks pretty special, whatever you are with it.

402
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,120
It's a great showcase for a lot of really good stickers because it's completely unbranded

403
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
all over.

404
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
It really draws your eye.

405
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,920
There's no Big Mac logo or Dell logo.

406
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,280
No Intel sticker, no nothing.

407
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,560
In fact, the only sticker on the bottom is a UPC barcode, a small one.

408
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,040
And other than that, it is untouched.

409
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,220
It is a metal housing that is untouched.

410
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,560
It feels good in the hand.

411
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,920
It has that MacBook angular slope to it.

412
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,480
Yes it does.

413
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,600
It's got one, two, three, four USB 3.0 ports plus the USB-C port.

414
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,640
That's like four times as many on that MacBook.

415
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,280
HDMI out, and it has headphones out, and it has an SD card slot reader.

416
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,120
I like that.

417
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
This could-

418
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,460
My XPS 13 doesn't have an Ethernet port either.

419
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,760
If I can get this fan fixed, this could replace the XPS for me.

420
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
But it can't-

421
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,680
I don't know if it can be a production machine without-

422
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,200
The lightning bolt by the Type-C port means it may support Thunderbolt, says North Ranger.

423
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Is that true, North?

424
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Is that really a thing?

425
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,880
A lot of vendors, especially if you have a Broadwell system, are using an Intel add-on

426
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:15,560
chip in the chipset that provides not only Type-C USB support, but also 40 gig Thunderbolt,

427
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,520
things like external graphics cards.

428
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
That would be-

429
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
I was about to say that, yeah.

430
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
If I could hook up-

431
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,960
See, that would make me feel a lot better if I could hook up a high-end Ethernet adapter

432
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,120
to that USB-C port.

433
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,700
Here's FreeBSA's.

434
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,320
He sent this to me when he got his.

435
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,040
There he was listening to episode 131 of Unplugged, where we're like, where the hell is my laptop?

436
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,800
And there's his purism right there.

437
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,520
What was your out-of-the-box experience like FreeBSD?

438
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,640
Was it the same kind of rattle experience, or did you get some documentation, did you

439
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
get a nice-

440
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,760
What was your initial experience like?

441
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,840
Yeah, documentation, nonexistent.

442
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,240
I haven't played with the hardware switches yet to figure out what they turn off, but

443
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,240
it would be nice if there was some information.

444
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,000
I even looked on the hard drive to see if there was documentation in the form of a PDF,

445
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,520
and I don't see anything on there.

446
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,200
All right, so I'm turning it back on.

447
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
I'm going to check-

448
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,200
There's proof.

449
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Yeah.

450
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Wimpy wanted to know if-

451
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,480
Now the BIOS, I want to give purism credit here.

452
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,000
The BIOS is like, every setting you could ever want to tweak is available.

453
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
That's cool.

454
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,880
Some OEMs, basically all of them, they really kind of limit down the BIOS, and this one,

455
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,560
you can tweak everything from overclocking to everything.

456
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,320
So that being said, there's so much in here, it actually takes a little while to find stuff.

457
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm looking through here right now, and I don't know if I see Bluetooth, chipset, security.

458
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Look at all this stuff, Wes.

459
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I mean, look at all-

460
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Wow.

461
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And all of these have submenus to them too.

462
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,840
Like, there's just a ton of stuff in here.

463
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Yeah.

464
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,120
What specifically are you looking for, Wimpy?

465
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,920
Does it have a Bluetooth device in it?

466
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,800
And the reason I'm asking you to look in the BIOS-

467
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,800
The BIOS?

468
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,440
Well, I believe it's a BIOS, isn't it?

469
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
Mm-hmm.

470
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
Yeah, it has a BIOS.

471
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
Yeah.

472
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:16,560
Is because I'm not sure if the Bluetooth device that's in the machine is supported by Linux,

473
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,760
so it may not go up.

474
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,880
I could- I don't see anything in the BIOS, but you know what I'll do is I'll boot into

475
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:29,120
Antegros Arch, which boots- I mean, one thing, by the way, is once Linux is installed, this

476
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
thing freaking flies.

477
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,160
Like, it is nice to have a nice modern computer again.

478
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
I tell you, it's been a while since I've had it.

479
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,240
It looks like it got that Samsung SSD in there.

480
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,880
And that thing is fast.

481
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,160
So I'll see- I can log in right now, Wimpy.

482
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
It just boots that fast.

483
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
I just already- I've already booted.

484
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,720
I'm already in GNOME system settings.

485
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
So I will take a-

486
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Fucking hell.

487
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,580
It does look like it supports UEFI, right?

488
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,400
It must support- yeah, it does.

489
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Actually, look at that.

490
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
It's discovering the Bluetooth devices.

491
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,280
It is discovering the Bluetooth devices around me right now.

492
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
So it must have Bluetooth.

493
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,280
Oh, right.

494
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Okay, cool.

495
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
That works then.

496
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
That's great.

497
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
Yeah.

498
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Cool.

499
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Yeah.

500
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,120
That was something that they'd mentioned may not work at some point in the past, so they

501
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
must have changed their-

502
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,520
You know, I haven't tried the webcam either.

503
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,720
Let me try the webcam real quick.

504
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,080
Yeah, webcam works.

505
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Hey, look at that.

506
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
It's me.

507
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Hey, look, Wes, there's you.

508
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080
See?

509
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
Well, it's me.

510
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
Yeah, webcam.

511
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,080
So the webcam works.

512
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
That's good.

513
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
Frame rate's a little low.

514
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
I'm going to keep playing with it.

515
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:27,320
I think that my next big task is to see if I can alter that fan, and then on top of that,

516
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,920
I'm going to just benchmark the shit out of this thing.

517
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Yeah.

518
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,520
I mean, it's already going to sound super loud, so you might as well, you know, make

519
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
it do some work.

520
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Yeah.

521
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,320
Well, it's funny how mentally in the back of my mind, I associate loud laptop with high

522
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
CPU usage.

523
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,440
So, like, after I've been working on this thing for about 20 minutes, I was sort of

524
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,920
just, you know, getting into the flow of things.

525
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,480
And I remember thinking- I stopped my work phone and I go, why is my computer working

526
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,480
so hard?

527
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Oh, wait, no, no.

528
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
It's fine.

529
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
Yeah.

530
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,720
So if anybody knows anything about the fan noise, I would love to hear your-

531
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,480
If you could get that solved, I mean.

532
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Yeah.

533
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Yeah.

534
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
But that aside, I'm going to put that aside.

535
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,320
I'm going to keep working with it and see what kind of things I can get done with it.

536
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,140
So just to recap, I paid $1,800 for this thing.

537
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,920
It did ship 286 days late.

538
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,040
It was originally expected to ship on April 2015.

539
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,560
I backed it in November of 2015, I believe.

540
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,640
November 22nd, 2015, I believe, is when I backed it.

541
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
I'm sorry, 2014.

542
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
2014, right.

543
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,640
Sorry.

544
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,880
I wouldn't necessarily buy it today.

545
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,560
But that said, I think it would be interesting, like, I'm picturing bringing it to conferences

546
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
and whatnot.

547
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Yeah.

548
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,600
You would, you know, it might be a pretty good machine, especially if you can just-

549
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Yeah.

550
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
A little quieter.

551
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,760
And the feel in the hand is good.

552
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,560
The hinge is good on the laptop screen.

553
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,480
And it's nice to have something that feels like that.

554
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Yes.

555
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,520
Oh, I bought a MacBook and I put Linux on it.

556
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,520
Right.

557
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
It's like, this is something totally different.

558
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
Yes.

559
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
Exactly.

560
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,520
So that's exactly how I'm feeling right now about it.

561
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
So this is the Rev 2.0.

562
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,480
One more thing I wanted to show you, which I'm not super happy with.

563
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,120
I'm going to talk more about this on last, and I'll have visuals to show you guys.

564
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,080
It does have a backlit keyboard.

565
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,720
And all of the Fn keys work.

566
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,920
But I want to show you what the backlit keyboard looks like with.

567
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,720
Oh, hold on a second.

568
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
It's not working.

569
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Oh, there you go.

570
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,600
So that's the, so the keys are backlit, but the actual letters themselves are not translucent.

571
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
No.

572
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,680
There's just, there's light around the keys, but you can't actually see.

573
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,680
It doesn't seem like that would be that bright at night.

574
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,040
It doesn't work because the keys themselves are black objects in the night and there's

575
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,760
just light around them.

576
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,960
The keys have, there's basically an LED light behind the keyboard, but the keys themselves.

577
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,800
So if you were concerned about where the keyboard was, it would help you find that, but not

578
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
the individual keys.

579
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
Exactly.

580
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
That's just a, you know.

581
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Yeah.

582
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
They were confused about that.

583
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Exactly.

584
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,320
So if you ever need to find your keyboard, it can, it can do that pretty well, but you

585
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,120
can't find individual keys.

586
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:53,020
So I guess the, at the end of the day, I would say if I was betting the farm on a laptop

587
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:59,880
right now and that was my machine, I could make it work, but I would be very disappointed.

588
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,520
How about a little followup on the Librem?

589
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,720
I still have the Librem 15.

590
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,000
I have a lot of thoughts on it.

591
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,600
So let's talk about the Librem and the Apollo.

592
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:19,360
So I, as you may have been aware, Wes, last week, after 445 days of waiting, I had a chance

593
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,440
to try out the Purism Librem.

594
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Ultimate Linux laptop.

595
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,080
And I don't know if, you know what, to get the timing right on this, so we're going to

596
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,560
go to the horse's mouth directly here just for a moment, but my recollection goes down

597
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
like this.

598
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,360
In the time since I bagged the Purism, a company I'd never heard of called Entroware has come

599
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,720
around and they started shipping laptops preloaded, by the way, with Ubuntu Mate and they have

600
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,480
a couple of different products out there.

601
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,840
We'll talk more about that in a sec, but the one that I want to talk about today is Entroware's

602
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,160
Apollo laptop.

603
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,080
I think it starts at base price around 700 US greenbacks, somewhere around there, depending

604
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,680
on the conversion rate.

605
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,880
It is a 13-inch laptop and I have it here in my hands and they sent me a version of

606
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,360
the Apollo, pretty well-specced, to see how it stacks up to the Librem 15 and others in

607
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,400
terms of build quality, performance, and all of that.

608
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:18,320
So I have it here, have had it for about 24 hours, and before we go any further, I want

609
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,360
to introduce Mike from Entroware.

610
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,840
Mike, welcome to Linux Unplugged and tell the folks listening what you do over there

611
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,840
at Entroware.

612
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
What is that title of yours?

613
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:33,000
Hi, I'm the co-founder of Entroware and we build Linux computers for the UK at the moment

614
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,400
and soon some with Europe.

615
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:45,720
And the Apollo arrived on my doorstep yesterday and it is a 13-inch laptop, very similar in

616
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:53,760
sort of a look to say a MacBook Air or really the Apollo 15 only, or I'm sorry, the Librem

617
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,440
15 only 13 inches, very, very, very good build quality.

618
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,720
And so Mike, I'm just curious, I don't actually think, are you selling these in the U.S. at

619
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
the moment?

620
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,560
No, we're not selling them in the U.S. for a while.

621
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,920
The reason why yours has got a U.S. keyboard layout is because we're going to be shipping

622
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,960
them to some EU countries because they also use that layout.

623
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Oh, I got you.

624
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
I see.

625
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
I got you.

626
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,100
So a little bit about the Apollo, if you would, can you give me some background on how this

627
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:27,120
computer came to be and any kind of interesting details about the Apollo?

628
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah, we started selling Windows computers about a year and a half ago, maybe two.

629
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:43,040
We got a lot of requests for an Ultrabook and we just found an ODM in China where we

630
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:48,800
could have them built and shipped over.

631
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,640
You make it sound so simple, but what I find to be remarkable about it, and this is something

632
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,680
that every single person that I have put this in their hands has said, is it feels really,

633
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,800
really sturdy, really well built.

634
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,200
And people often tell me it feels a little heavy, which I think adds to that it feels

635
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,880
well built.

636
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,820
And so I'm curious, was it a matter of finding the right builder?

637
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,560
What is it that Entraware has been able to accomplish here when it comes to build quality

638
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:30,540
that other vendors sort of in the space maybe haven't gotten to?

639
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,840
Is it just happened to be the partner builds a good machine?

640
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,800
Because I mean, it seems, feel wise, it's pretty significantly well built.

641
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,040
Yeah, so we approached a few people and these are one of the few that did solid aluminum

642
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,880
chassis so we chose them obviously because they have just bad build quality.

643
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,840
And then the keyboard also, I don't know what the processors have selected in the keyboard,

644
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,580
but versus some of the others, the keyboard is pretty nice too.

645
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:01,400
And feels good in the hand, the keys are actually translucent so the backlighting shines through,

646
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
which is nice.

647
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,640
And the fan isn't running crazy loud.

648
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,840
The fan actually seems to properly cool the machine, which was a nice surprise when I

649
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,680
took it out of the box.

650
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,200
Is there any particular tricks you guys had to pull to make this thing work properly with

651
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Linux?

652
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Or was it all pretty easy?

653
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,400
Well, at first, the first revision we had, there was a few problems with the fan, but

654
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,440
we had the mind out in the firmware, so that's now gone.

655
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,400
Yeah, I would agree.

656
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,520
So there was definitely some problems with the fan if you ran into the same problems

657
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
I did.

658
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,920
So if I wipe the OS that this came loaded with, will the fan still work fine or will

659
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
it stop working normally?

660
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,780
No, it works exactly the same as what it's doing now.

661
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,880
So it's firmware level then.

662
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
It's totally hardware level.

663
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Well, that's awesome.

664
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,880
That's great.

665
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,880
I got it.

666
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,760
So my first impressions of this are this is one of the most well-built laptops I've ever

667
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
held.

668
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
Would you agree with me?

669
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,760
Oh, yeah.

670
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
I really want one now.

671
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
Yeah.

672
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,480
So it's got one, two USB 3.0 ports plus USB-C. It's got an SD card slot reader, full-size

673
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,000
HDMI out, and a headphone jack.

674
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,920
Entraware was kind enough to include a USB ethernet adapter in the box too because there's

675
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,680
no USB ethernet on this.

676
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,840
It's got a 13-inch screen, 1080p resolution on it, two hard drives, a 500-gigabyte spinning

677
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,800
for the home and a 120-gigabyte SSD for the root.

678
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,600
Yeah, two hard drives in a 13-inch laptop too.

679
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:31,880
Mike, that's a pretty impressive spec, Skylake Intel processor, and it's silent.

680
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,920
I haven't heard it sound since I've been here.

681
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,920
Yeah.

682
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,080
That's a pretty impressive piece of hardware.

683
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,880
Are the Apollo cells meeting your expectations?

684
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,040
Yeah, they keep growing as we get more publicity on them because they are really good for the

685
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
price.

686
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,040
Yeah.

687
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Base $700.

688
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,840
Now, the base $700 I think has like an i3 and 4 gigs of RAM, but you just bring it up

689
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
from there.

690
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,180
Yeah, that's right.

691
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,240
And then, Mike, could you talk a little bit about the choice to work with Ubuntu Mate?

692
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,080
What drove that and how's that going?

693
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:09,000
Well, I was approached by Martin about a year ago, and we just had a back-and-to when I

694
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,200
was a big fan of the project, so it was obviously a good move to start shipping them on machines.

695
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,240
Yeah, it feels fast.

696
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,560
It's my first experience with it.

697
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,920
When you get a machine with a nice, fast Skylake processor and plenty of RAM, and then you

698
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,120
throw the Mate desktop on there with the Ubuntu base, it feels really snappy.

699
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
Just ready to go.

700
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
Yeah.

701
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,600
We don't have numbers yet, but the battery life has been pretty good, and I think part

702
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,040
of that is because the desktop environment just isn't really very demanding.

703
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,080
So you feel like you get a nice performing computer with a very reasonable modern desktop.

704
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,760
Plus, you get someone like Introware here, where they're a company, right?

705
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,440
So if you have problems longer term, you know they're going to be around to support them

706
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
and to fix them.

707
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:57,120
So the number one question, Mike, that everybody in the chat room has is, how likely and possible

708
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,800
is it for Introware to eventually start selling in the US?

709
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,640
Is that a possibility for you guys, or is that just a lot of trouble?

710
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,160
It is a possibility, but we're going to wait for a few more, a larger amount of orders

711
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,640
before we start shipping over there.

712
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,280
We're going to make sure all of the use is sorted first.

713
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
Yeah.

714
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
You get it nailed there.

715
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
That makes a lot of sense.

716
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
We'll have to work on a JB group order.

717
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
Yeah.

718
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,280
There you go.

719
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Yeah, a group order.

720
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
This thing is...

721
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,160
Boy, I can't wait to just keep trying it over the week.

722
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,720
This is going to be my main machine for the week.

723
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,720
It seems like a great little just getting stuff done laptop.

724
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Yeah.

725
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,440
I'm really looking forward to putting it through its paces.

726
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,840
So far, it sounds like it's silent, and silent is a big deal for me.

727
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,320
So I'm really happy about that.

728
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,440
One thing I may be continuing to troubleshoot, and I don't know if it's just the Wi-Fi here

729
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,280
or what, but I've had a couple of Wi-Fi issues where either the transfer rate has been real

730
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,760
bad, like I'm talking like I'm getting 2,000 millisecond pings, or it just won't find the

731
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
network.

732
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,680
So in both cases, it actually could be interference.

733
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,840
So I'm going to take it out to a known good location where I only have one Wi-Fi access

734
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,160
point.

735
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,960
There's no other Wi-Fi access points around, or access eyes, and see if I have any issues.

736
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,960
But so far, other than that.

737
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,480
And then with the Ethernet adapter, of course, I've had zero problems.

738
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,400
And Ubuntu Mate has been pretty great too.

739
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,040
I really like the design.

740
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,840
Because it's a little bit smaller than the Librem, it feels a little tighter.

741
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,840
There's a notch where you put your finger that kind of is reminiscent of the way the

742
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,760
MacBooks do it.

743
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
Which looks nice.

744
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
It really all comes together.

745
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,760
It's got a bottom plate that could be removed with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

746
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,560
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 screws.

747
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,320
So you remove 12 little Philips screws, and it looks like the bottom plate would come

748
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
off.

749
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
It seems like such a good laptop.

750
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,080
Like you show up at a conference, and it's just a little different.

751
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,960
And you've got it running Linux, and it works well.

752
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
Yeah.

753
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Yeah.

754
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
I really like it.

755
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:02,240
I'm happy that the keys are actually, the letters are translucent, so the backlit key

756
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,360
light actually shines through the keys, which is nice.

757
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,360
Because otherwise it's kind of pointless to have the backlighting.

758
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,360
Mike, is there anything else you want to add about the Apollo before we move on?

759
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,160
No, that's it.

760
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
Very good, sir.

761
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,400
And Wimpy, was there anything you wanted to add?

762
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,400
Any thoughts?

763
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
There's something I'd like to add.

764
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,400
Yeah.

765
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Yeah.

766
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,080
Mike's being far too modest.

767
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,880
Mike has a relationship with a company that you'd be very interested in hearing about,

768
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,880
I think.

769
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,880
Tell me more.

770
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,880
They're our Valve partners.

771
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,880
Valve?

772
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,880
Okay, Mike.

773
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,440
Are you bearing the lead here?

774
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
Hold on.

775
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,440
We have ourselves a little Valve story.

776
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,440
I've got to hear it.

777
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Tell me about it.

778
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
Yeah.

779
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,200
So we're official Valve partners, so we're going to be building a Steam machine and shipping

780
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,720
them out in a few months.

781
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,240
Very cool.

782
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,960
Have you already begun testing?

783
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
Come on now.

784
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Are you a gamer, Mike?

785
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Yeah.

786
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,960
Cool.

787
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:05,920
We had one prototype at our camp this year for people to use, and it got a good reaction.

788
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,840
So Mike, I've got to say, I don't know a lot about Entraware.

789
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,200
My initial impressions are, you guys are very clever.

790
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,560
So it struck me just in the name of this device.

791
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,080
It's a pretty great device.

792
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:28,480
And you went with the name Apollo, which, when I say Apollo, Wes, what's the next thing

793
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,480
you think of?

794
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Fast.

795
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
Oh, you do?

796
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,480
Well, I don't know.

797
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
I think 13.

798
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
I think Apollo 13.

799
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
Oh, 13.

800
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
Right.

801
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
And what is this?

802
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
It's a 13-inch Mac.

803
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,480
It's a 13-inch laptop.

804
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,480
It's brilliant.

805
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,560
I mean, it shows you a little bit of the...

806
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,320
To me, I think it sort of demonstrates a little bit of the thought that goes into it.

807
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:54,080
It's an Apollo 13, but of course, the product name is just Apollo because the 13 just sort

808
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
of comes naturally.

809
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
It's part of it.

810
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
And it makes you think, what laptop did Chris get?

811
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
He got that Apollo.

812
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
And how big was it?

813
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
Oh, yeah.

814
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
It was 13 inches, Apollo 13.

815
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
That's clever.

816
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
Yeah.

817
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,080
And the 15 should be called Creed.

818
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
No.

819
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
No.

820
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,840
Nothing ever gets called Creed.

821
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
That has been banned.

822
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
But yeah.

823
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,640
So I think it's pretty good.

824
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,560
Kitson, you had something you wanted to add to...

825
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,600
Go ahead, sir.

826
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:23,160
When you said Apollo, I actually thought art and illumination like the Roman slash Greek

827
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
God.

828
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
Yeah.

829
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
Yeah.

830
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Okay.

831
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,160
All right.

832
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,160
Okay.

833
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
Fine.

834
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,160
Not everybody thinks Apollo 13.

835
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
But it does have proper backlit keys.

836
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
So illumination is accurate.

837
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
Yes.

838
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
All right.

839
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
Okay.

840
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
Fine.

841
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,160
Fine.

842
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,160
All those are good.

843
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,160
See, it's a clever name.

844
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,160
Nonetheless, it is a clever name.

845
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,160
So I have a...

846
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,160
If you're listening to the audio version and you're curious, what the hell does this thing

847
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
look like?

848
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,160
And probably a lot of you are listening to the audio version.

849
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:50,240
But in the show notes, I have a link to an album I took up at my campsite.

850
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,560
And I posted pictures of it because I was like, hey, you know what?

851
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,760
You know what makes a good background for photos?

852
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,760
The freaking Pacific Northwest.

853
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
Yes, it does.

854
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,820
It's a pretty good looking state.

855
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,880
So Washington is.

856
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,760
So I put that up there.

857
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,400
And yes, it does have an Ubuntu button.

858
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Actually, it's a Matei button.

859
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
So that's pretty cool.

860
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
Yeah.

861
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
I like seeing you can customize that right on the website.

862
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
That's great.

863
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
Yeah.

864
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Yeah.

865
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,400
And it's a sticker, but it's a translucent sticker.

866
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,760
So it doesn't block the light, which makes it...

867
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,240
Look at that attention to detail.

868
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Yeah, it is.

869
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,920
It's very well done.

870
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,160
So right now I'm running Ubuntu Matei 15.10 or Mate or whatever edition on there.

871
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,920
I may stick with that.

872
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,540
I don't know what exactly it is, but this particular hardware has made me also want

873
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,240
to just see what it would be like to have elementary OS on it, just to kind of go all

874
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
the way.

875
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,400
I don't know though, because the thing is, is right now for testing, Ubuntu makes such

876
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,240
a great low-key desktop environment that it's like you just get all of the machine's performance

877
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
out of it.

878
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,240
So I just don't know about it.

879
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,560
Wimpy, you had one more comment.

880
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,560
Go ahead.

881
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
Yeah.

882
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,880
The version of Ubuntu Matei that you're running there is actually sort of Ubuntu Matei 15.12.

883
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
Really?

884
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
Oh.

885
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,880
Yeah.

886
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,880
Yeah.

887
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,660
So what you've got there is Ubuntu Matei 15.10.

888
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:14,560
And then I worked with Mike to get the Matei 1.12 desktop on there, rather than Matei 1.10.

889
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:23,360
And the reason I did that is because in Matei 1.12, we introduced in the control panels

890
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,000
two-finger, three-finger touch configuration.

891
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yes.

892
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,040
And I do really appreciate that.

893
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,040
Yeah.

894
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,440
So that's why we've just given you a slightly custom version.

895
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,520
But so if I reloaded the OS, I might not get the trackpad configuration stuff?

896
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,520
No.

897
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:48,120
The trackpad works on all OSes, but Matei didn't have two- and three-finger touch options

898
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,800
until just recently.

899
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,440
That is actually exceptionally nice, because so it is a good-sized trackpad.

900
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:01,000
And when you go into the mouse settings in Matei, you can say two fingers down is a right

901
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
click, or in the corner is a right click.

902
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,800
I want to scroll by touching the right side of the trackpad, I want to scroll by using

903
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,800
two fingers.

904
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,560
Like all of that is available for you.

905
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,560
Wow.

906
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,560
Yeah.

907
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,560
Really nice.

908
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,560
So that's good to know.

909
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
Yeah, I think I might stick with it.

910
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,600
I just, I really have very little reason to replace it once I have it all set up.

911
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,920
It really works super good.

912
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,960
The only thing I might want to replace it with-

913
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,960
Sorry.

914
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,080
I was going to say, you'll be fine when you go with Antergos as well, because I know Mike

915
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,080
runs Arch.

916
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,080
Oh, really?

917
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,080
Oh, okay.

918
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,080
Cool.

919
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,920
Yeah, and I was also thinking, all the other thing I might do is I might do the 16.04 version

920
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,920
of Ubuntu Matei.

921
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,920
Yeah.

922
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,920
Yeah, and just do that.

923
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,680
And that would likely still have the configuration options, right, for my trackpad?

924
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,920
Yeah, that's all built into 16.04.

925
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,920
Boom.

926
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,920
Boom.

927
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,040
I loves it.

928
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,720
I have not done the distro balance the chatroom was asking, so yeah, there they go.

929
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,240
But I might by the time LAS comes around.

930
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,740
I think if all goes as planned, this will be my review for LAS, and we'll compare it

931
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,740
to the two.

932
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,400
I might try to do some performance stuff.

933
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,400
Yeah, you should.

934
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,720
So if anybody has any questions, or even better yet, suggestions of ways to benchmark a system

935
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,160
like this that actually produce information that we care about, and that is relevant,

936
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,140
I would love to know that, linuxactual.reddit.com, you could link the benchmarks there, or something

937
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,140
like that.

938
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,560
Oh, okay, so Wimpy, I will absolutely have to have Loki if I want to try it on this machine.

939
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,560
Why is that?

940
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,560
Yeah.

941
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,560
For elementary.

942
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:30,400
Elementary is based on 14.04, which doesn't have Skylake support.

943
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
Right.

944
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,400
Right.

945
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,400
And Loki is based on 16.04.

946
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,400
Yeah.

947
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Okay.

948
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
All right.

949
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,400
Well, I'll see.

950
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,400
You need 15.10 or better.

951
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,760
See, somebody's got to make me a Loki eye, so just watch.

952
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,660
Because it looks like, it looks like if you, here's my thinking, right?

953
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,640
You put that on here, and then you go to like a mall or somewhere, you say, look at the

954
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,640
new MacBook, what do you think?

955
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,640
Let's see what they say.

956
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,720
Should we enter prankster, Chris?

957
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:58,960
You know, before we walk away and say, oh, it's a big MacBook ripoff, I want to actually

958
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,600
make sure I'm clear.

959
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,680
When I look at it, I actually don't get the impression that it's trying to rip off from

960
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,680
the MacBook.

961
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,920
What I get the impression of is aluminum makes pretty good material for this.

962
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,920
Exactly.

963
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,640
And when you make a 13-inch machine, there's only so much room.

964
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,960
I actually, in some ways, I would say there's potential the keyboard may be better than

965
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,960
the MacBook keyboard.

966
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,680
I'm going to type some more and tell you the truth if that's... I don't know about the

967
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,200
trackpad, but the keyboard I think might be better.

968
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,960
And this thing with one, two, three USB ports, I think outclasses the MacBook in terms of

969
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:36,080
connectivity, plus a dedicated HDMI out port and an SD card slot reader.

970
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,640
This thing might outclass the MacBook in connectivity, but I'm not sure about that.

971
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,920
And so I don't actually... I think it's selling it short to say, oh, it's copying the MacBook.

972
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,160
I think what it is, it's taking design cues from a good design.

973
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:54,000
And it also, I think, is its own product, very much its own product.

974
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,120
And I like it a lot.

975
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,680
That's my first impression.

976
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,840
If you want to check out some pictures, go to the show notes.

977
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,840
And if you've got ideas on things you want me to do to test it, let me know.

978
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,800
So Skylake has got Intel graphics, so we'll see what happens.

979
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,280
We got two drives in there.

980
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,080
Those are some significant pieces of hardware for this year, and it's interesting to look

981
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,680
back at those reviews now.

982
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,080
Next we're going to talk about another piece of hardware that was way more important for

983
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,320
everyone else out there.

984
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,240
I actually got one myself, but first I want to thank DigitalOcean for sponsoring this

985
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,920
episode of the Unplugged program.

986
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,840
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED after you create an account.

987
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,040
You just apply it, and you get a $10 credit.

988
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,240
Now that's awesome, because you can run serious workhorses for like three cents an hour, or

989
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,720
just run a machine for $5 a month.

990
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,800
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

991
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,280
easy way for you to spin up an awesome Linux rig when you want it on their infrastructure,

992
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:52,560
which is all backed by SSDs, KVM for the virtualizer, Linux for the host system, 40 gigabit E connections

993
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,840
into the hypervisor.

994
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,520
I'm talking this is a serious infrastructure wrapped up with the industry's best interface

995
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,300
and most straightforward API.

996
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,480
It's unbelievable the pricing.

997
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,180
They have data centers all over the world, entire Linux systems, or just the base system,

998
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:09,300
and with Fedora 25 too, DigitalOcean.com.

999
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,880
Just add our promo code DOUNPLUGGED to your account, and get a $10 credit, and support

1000
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,880
our show.

1001
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,840
DigitalOcean.com, DOUNPLUGGED, and thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged

1002
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,280
program for all of 2016.

1003
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,720
DOUNPLUGGED, one word.

1004
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:31,200
The Raspberry Pi 3, wow, what an interesting device, and I ended up getting one pretty

1005
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,000
quickly to try out a few different projects on it.

1006
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:44,520
Okay, so the Raspberry Pi 3 has landed, wait, what, oops, sorry, I think I just dropped

1007
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
it down the toilet.

1008
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,520
Hold on.

1009
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,520
It's so small.

1010
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:53,720
It is going to be 35 US bones, has a 64-bit CPU, is my understanding, but it ships with

1011
00:49:53,720 --> 00:50:02,120
a 32-bit version of the OS, two USB ports on that thing right there, go ahead, go ahead,

1012
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
jump in any time.

1013
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:09,280
Oh, by the way, Wi-Fi like we've had before, and four USB ports, if I'm correct.

1014
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,280
Yeah.

1015
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,440
So, Whitby, can you say how long have you had this?

1016
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,600
A little bit, right?

1017
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,280
Since Friday last week.

1018
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,880
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

1019
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,600
So you've obviously been working on this thing, trying to get Ubuntu Mate desktop, working

1020
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,600
on it.

1021
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,480
What were your initial impressions of the hardware when you sat down to work with it?

1022
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,200
It looks, well, it is the same form factor as the Raspberry Pi 2 and the Raspberry Pi

1023
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,200
B+.

1024
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:42,200
So the number of ports and its size and its arrangement is almost identical.

1025
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,800
There's one minor change, and that's the location of the LED lights.

1026
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,720
But other than that, it looks like a Raspberry Pi.

1027
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:58,560
I hooked it up, tried to boot my existing image for Ubuntu Mate, and got a very colorful

1028
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:03,960
rainbow screen, which basically meant do not pass go.

1029
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,080
So yeah, then started work on making it work.

1030
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:15,280
Once I got it working, it's obvious where the performance improvements come from with

1031
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,280
this device.

1032
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,280
Oh, really?

1033
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,320
Yeah, across the board, and in some unexpected places as well.

1034
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:30,560
So it's got a new SOC, so it's a Broadcom 2837, called 1.2 gigahertz.

1035
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,720
It's an ARM V8 Cortex A53.

1036
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:41,360
It's clocked at 1.2 gigahertz, which is up from 900 megahertz as the stock clock on the

1037
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,520
Pi 2.

1038
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:52,040
And by and large, more or less, just about everything is about 50% quicker on the Pi

1039
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,140
3 compared to the Pi 2.

1040
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:00,760
So you see that in everything in terms of the responsiveness of the applications.

1041
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,720
But where you really notice it is it really starts to close the gap in terms of things

1042
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:12,220
like if you've got a web browser open and you're scrolling the web pages, that's much

1043
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:16,000
more fluid now, much more fluid.

1044
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,880
And so you've mentioned that there's Bluetooth and there's Wi-Fi now.

1045
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:25,960
So they're integrated on the SOC.

1046
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:35,880
They're using Broadcom 4343 something chip.

1047
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,680
And the interesting thing here is that in the past, one of the criticisms of the Raspberry

1048
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:49,840
Pi was that the SD host controller and the Ethernet were on the same USB bus.

1049
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:58,320
So if you were doing a file copy over Ethernet, the performance could really take a dive.

1050
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:07,080
The Wi-Fi is implemented on the SOC and on its own MMC controller and not on the USB

1051
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,080
bus.

1052
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,320
Now, I haven't tested this yet.

1053
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,840
This is what I want to test.

1054
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:20,080
But my working hypothesis is it should move data around quicker over Wi-Fi than it can

1055
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,080
over Ethernet.

1056
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,080
Hmm.

1057
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,800
It's a good excuse not to bother trying to find an Ethernet plug for it.

1058
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,800
That would be pretty cool.

1059
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,360
That would be that would be pretty damn impressive.

1060
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,960
OK, so the hardware impressions, I mean, a 50 percent improvement across the board.

1061
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
That is damn.

1062
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,960
Same form factor.

1063
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,960
That is damn impressive.

1064
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,960
I like that a lot.

1065
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,680
And I'm kind of curious to see how that might actually play out with multitasking and things

1066
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,680
like that.

1067
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,280
How did that translate, Wimpy, for you when getting whatever you needed to do to make

1068
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,880
Ubuntu Mate work on the Raspberry Pi 3?

1069
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,040
Because two things jump out at me.

1070
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,640
Number one is you kind of had to go back and retrofit the released version of Ubuntu Mate

1071
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,720
to make it work, right?

1072
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,880
Because you couldn't just say, well, go if you want to make it work, go use 16.04.

1073
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,880
Or did you?

1074
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:08,480
No, I because there wasn't much time to do this, I went with the build system I had for

1075
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:16,040
16.10 because aside from the new feature enablement, I knew the rest of the thing worked.

1076
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,440
So you know, minimize things.

1077
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,680
That said, I still only got about six hours sleep between Friday and Sunday working on

1078
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,720
this.

1079
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,720
Last down the wire.

1080
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,720
Yeah.

1081
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,720
Yeah.

1082
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,900
But to your credit, you got it right out on release day.

1083
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,900
So that looked pretty good.

1084
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,900
And that's impressive.

1085
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,900
Yeah.

1086
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,900
Yeah.

1087
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:35,900
It needs some work.

1088
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:40,920
And despite the assistance I got from the Raspberry Pi Foundation over the weekend,

1089
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,440
so they had some engineering assistance, mostly from Phil Elwell, who has just been brilliant.

1090
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:52,960
I haven't got the Bluetooth working in on the Raspberry Pi 3 for Ubuntu Mate yet.

1091
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,880
But I'm yet to hear and maybe over the next couple of days, we'll start to hear.

1092
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,820
I haven't heard if anyone's got Bluetooth working at all yet.

1093
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:06,040
It's a bit complicated to get going, and I was sort of groping around in the dark a little

1094
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:12,640
bit because I was sort of being drip fed, oh, you need this binary blob and this still

1095
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,640
doesn't go.

1096
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:19,360
And then, oh, no, you need this blob as well, which patches that other blob.

1097
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,940
You need these patches for this.

1098
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:25,220
So it was all good because I got all the information, but I just couldn't quite get the thing to

1099
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,800
enable the Bluetooth.

1100
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:33,440
So I've decided just to sit back for a few days and see what happens with the official

1101
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,440
images.

1102
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,780
Yeah, so I'm going to start taking a look at the new images.

1103
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:42,120
So today, this evening, I downloaded all of the new packages that have gone into the Raspberry

1104
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:46,600
and Archive to do with Bluetooth and firmware, and I'm sort of picking through those to see

1105
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:51,120
if there's anything different that I may have missed or overlooked.

1106
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,320
So Bluetooth will come in due course, and it will be delivered via an update, I should

1107
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,320
think.

1108
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,320
Very good.

1109
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,320
Okay.

1110
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:05,400
Now, there is another thing about the Raspberry Pi, the Raspberry Pi 3 that I think is probably

1111
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,480
more important.

1112
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,040
I think the Raspberry Pi 3 itself is the hors d'oeuvre.

1113
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,640
This is not the main event.

1114
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:22,160
So in the Pi 3, the video core, the graphics processor, has been upclocked.

1115
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:29,400
So the video core was running at 250 megahertz, it now runs at 400, and the 3D graphics processor

1116
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,080
was running at 250 and now runs at 300.

1117
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:39,880
One of the benefits of that is that you can now run 1080p video at 60 frames per second,

1118
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,120
which is good.

1119
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,640
And the other thing is that there's been an awful lot of work going on behind the scenes

1120
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:54,120
at the Raspberry Pi Foundation to do all of the graphics enablement in kernel mode setting

1121
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:58,080
and direct rendering manager and Mesa and gallium.

1122
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,540
And that's sort of experimental at the moment.

1123
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:06,880
But I have had it working for brief periods of time.

1124
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:17,320
And when that works, it's a game changer, because you can turn on the OpenGL renderer

1125
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:27,720
in VLC and get smooth video playback in VLC, nice, not the rather clunky can't quite keep

1126
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:39,120
up software version, and you can also run OpenGL accelerated software providing OpenGL

1127
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,120
versions match up.

1128
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:45,160
So if you've ever played Neverball or Neverpup, I've had that running full screen, 60 frames

1129
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,400
per second, no problem.

1130
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,400
And there are other examples of where that on the Pi 3.

1131
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,400
On the Pi 3.

1132
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,400
Yeah.

1133
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,400
Wow.

1134
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,400
Yeah.

1135
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,440
That is a big deal.

1136
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:05,520
So when that lands properly, it's GLES warheads, GLES is the implementation for the Pi 3.

1137
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:11,040
But when that lands later in the year as a fully finished thing, that takes an awful

1138
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,560
lot of burden off the CPU.

1139
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:22,640
And I think that is where this sort of pseudo desktop use case really comes into its own

1140
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:30,560
and will start to grow because using things like composited desktops becomes a reality

1141
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,040
and alleviates burden from the CPU.

1142
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,040
This is good.

1143
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,040
Yeah.

1144
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,480
But as it is, it makes a very usable desktop experience.

1145
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:46,560
I mean, imagine if for $35, you could buy a computer and plug in a USB microphone and

1146
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,920
join a mumble room and have a podcast just like we are now.

1147
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,920
Oh, yeah.

1148
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,920
Oh, yeah.

1149
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,920
That is great.

1150
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,920
That is all plugged into a Raspberry Pi 3.

1151
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,920
I'm talking about.

1152
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,920
That is great.

1153
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,920
Oh, Wimpy.

1154
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,920
Drops the bomb.

1155
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,920
Well played, sir.

1156
00:58:58,920 --> 00:58:59,920
Well played.

1157
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:08,120
You know, I was going to ask you if you think this is, I mean, wow, I mean, there you go.

1158
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,440
Podcasting is, that's probably something you can barely even do from a tablet.

1159
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:15,240
I mean, you can, but it's, I just, when I see this, at $35, Wimpy, isn't that a big

1160
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:19,840
part of the Raspberry Pi 3 is the performance for the price?

1161
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,840
It's not $50.

1162
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,840
Yeah.

1163
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,840
It's not even $45.

1164
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,840
Yeah.

1165
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:28,560
It's 35 US greenbacks, and that seems like that's sort of as a game changer, and your

1166
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,880
downloads must be bearing that out.

1167
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,880
Yeah.

1168
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,880
Yeah.

1169
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,600
I haven't looked since the new images have gone up.

1170
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:42,640
I'll check in a week or so to see how things are going, but yeah, so the Raspberry Pi is

1171
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:48,360
known to be something that retails for $35, well, or at least the traditional ones is

1172
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:51,880
obviously the zero now for $5.

1173
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:56,560
And as I understand it, they're trying to keep that $35 price point.

1174
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:02,640
So they will introduce features to that price rather than just introduce features because

1175
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,560
they can, which I think is kind of neat because, you know, it's always going to be $35.

1176
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,560
Yeah.

1177
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,560
It keeps the expectation.

1178
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,560
Yeah.

1179
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,560
Yeah.

1180
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,420
It's a step change in performance, definitely.

1181
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:18,080
And I think that it's very early now, you know, we're in day two.

1182
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:23,960
I think, you know, a few months from now, we'll be able to see the full, hopefully the

1183
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:24,960
full potential.

1184
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,640
A smart move, though, on their part to keep the form factor, right?

1185
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:35,560
By keeping the form factor the same, like groups like, groups like Mycroft, though,

1186
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,600
like Mycroft saying, hey, we're now doing the testing, and if everything works out,

1187
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,400
we're just going to include the Raspberry Pi 3 in with the Mycroft units because it

1188
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
just snaps right in.

1189
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,400
Bam.

1190
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,400
Upgrade.

1191
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,400
Isn't that, don't you think that's a big deal?

1192
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,400
And it's the same price.

1193
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,400
Yes.

1194
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,400
It's a huge deal.

1195
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,040
I think that means that people that are building things, I mean, for predictability like that,

1196
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,800
when you're building something, right, to have that kind of predictability, that's important.

1197
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:00,420
Now for others, there might be other boards out there, but for some of us, that is a huge

1198
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,420
component just right there.

1199
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:05,180
No, $35, about the same form factor, I can snap it in.

1200
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,760
When you buy it, probably the same software you used before, we'll just install to it.

1201
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,120
I think it's pretty neat.

1202
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,600
Any other thoughts, Wimpy?

1203
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:16,720
Well, the only other major change that sort of just juxtaposes what you've said is that

1204
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,840
it does require slightly more power now.

1205
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:25,560
So in the past, 1.8 amp or 2 amp power was recommended.

1206
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,120
So that's a bit of a twist, yeah.

1207
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,560
Now it's 2.4 amp.

1208
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:38,800
So if you've got existing power supplies that were kind of on the edge of being acceptable,

1209
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,480
chances are you're going to need a new power supply.

1210
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:50,280
I use an Atrix lap dock to connect Pi 2 to work on them, and I'm pleased to say that

1211
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,040
that still powers the Pi 3.

1212
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:56,800
Yeah, I mean, 2.4 amps is not too uncommon, so yeah, that should, yeah.

1213
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:04,160
Also, if Mute or Raspbian isn't your flavor, Windows 10, look at this, Wes, Windows 10

1214
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,120
Internet of Things Core for Raspberry Pi 3 is out.

1215
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,120
There's even a video.

1216
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,800
Look at this right here.

1217
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,080
It's Windows powering a wheel like a hamster.

1218
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,360
Go, Windows, go.

1219
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,360
Just like the hamster.

1220
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,360
It's learning, Chris.

1221
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,360
You got to be nice.

1222
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:22,080
So Windows 10 on the Raspberry Pi 3 controlling a closed loop wheel.

1223
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,080
You ready for this, Wes?

1224
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,600
So Raspberry Pi 3 running Windows 10 IoT Core.

1225
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,560
The wheel represents a common situation in robotics when you need to know exactly how

1226
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,960
fast a robot's going or how far it's traveling.

1227
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,200
Here I have a display connected to the Raspberry Pi 3.

1228
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,480
You can see the speed of the wheel, the speed I've chosen, and the power output to the motor.

1229
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,960
I just can't ever imagine why you would want the overhead of Windows for such a simple

1230
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:44,960
task.

1231
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,960
I know.

1232
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,640
It's just, that's never going to, that's never a value argument.

1233
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,640
You're going to win.

1234
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,640
It's crazy.

1235
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,640
Absolutely.

1236
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,640
But, you know, go to Microsoft and try it.

1237
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,680
It's going to be the people who already have all that chain there.

1238
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,680
Yeah.

1239
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,680
What do you think, Wimpy?

1240
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,680
What do you think?

1241
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,080
Oh, that's cute and everything, but let's see them come on a podcast on how we're using

1242
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,080
a Raspberry Pi 3.

1243
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,080
That's right.

1244
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,080
That's right.

1245
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,520
Raspberry Pi 3 is a nice piece of kit, but what about getting software installed on your

1246
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,740
distro of choice?

1247
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,740
Let's take a moment.

1248
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,760
Let's talk about 1604 and snap packages.

1249
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:15,240
Now, there are many things to discuss in regards to this review, and I want to cover all of

1250
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,840
them as much as we can.

1251
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,860
If you have not had a chance, it's not a prerequisite, but I would invite you to listen to episode

1252
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:27,400
413 or watch episode 413 of the Linux Action Show, where we did our review.

1253
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,040
And just as a background, because I don't know if I really went into this in the show

1254
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:36,400
or not, but basically every machine in my life, except for that one right there, that

1255
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,120
Bonobo, got reloaded to Ubuntu 1604.

1256
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,120
Wow.

1257
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,960
Ubuntu edition was the one I ran with the longest, and then I put the neon packages

1258
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,840
on there because I loves me the fresh neon.

1259
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:53,840
And I guess actually going back further, it really started the day I got the Apollo.

1260
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:59,120
I got really excited by what a good implementation Ubuntu Mate 1510 on the Apollo was, and then

1261
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,420
as soon as it felt reasonable, I brought that up to 1604.

1262
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:05,640
And then I started bringing all my other machines to 1604.

1263
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,640
One by one.

1264
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,640
Yeah.

1265
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:15,280
And so I spent a real solid month in Ubuntu, which for me was a big transition again going

1266
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,280
back.

1267
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,280
Yeah, I feel you there.

1268
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,640
But part of the reason I wanted to do it is because I really wanted to spend – when

1269
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,280
you just do it for a couple of days, you get totally overwhelmed by all the little rough

1270
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,880
edges that are just different, just because it's not comfortable and familiar, it just

1271
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,540
– it feels abrasive.

1272
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:35,320
But if you actually spend time with it, you learn, oh yeah, I do it this way, this now.

1273
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,120
Learn the true character of what it's doing.

1274
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,120
Yeah, yeah.

1275
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,360
And so I really wanted to give it its due.

1276
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,960
And so when we walked away, I walked away with some impressions that I had reflected

1277
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,320
on for that whole month.

1278
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:50,800
And those definitely took the stage of the review, I think, the bulk of the stage.

1279
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,120
But there's a lot of things covered in the 1604 review.

1280
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:58,280
And I was curious, Wes, if you – why don't we do this?

1281
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:04,440
If you'd be up for this, let's get your impressions sort of at the top.

1282
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,280
Then let's go to the Mumble Room, get some of their updates and follow-up and their impressions.

1283
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,880
And then towards the end of this shenanigans, let's talk about some of the things that

1284
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,620
have changed already or fixed already since Sunday's episode of the show.

1285
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:19,920
So like a full spectrum coverage.

1286
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:26,240
So as follow-up to our 1604 review, Wes, what are your sort of out-of-the-first-gate impressions

1287
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,240
of this brand new LTS release?

1288
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:34,480
Okay, so for context, both in work and kind of at home, I both skipped at work the 1404

1289
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,480
release.

1290
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,320
And then I used that at home, but I didn't use too much of 15.

1291
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:43,600
I guess this is kind of like, for you, a huge upgrade.

1292
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,440
Yeah, it really is a huge upgrade.

1293
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,440
That's an interesting perspective.

1294
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:51,400
So you've been stuck at 1204 for years and a majority, you know, I use some 1404.

1295
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,040
I do have like one system at 1510, but yes, there's a lot of 1204.

1296
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:58,320
And so there's so much new and so much I'm excited about.

1297
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:02,960
I mean, I've used Ubuntu on system D before, but I just, I love doing, you know, system

1298
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,040
control status and just seeing that breakdown.

1299
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,280
I'm really excited to see it at servers on work.

1300
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,760
Now did you play with the in-between ones?

1301
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,000
Yeah, I played with them a little bit.

1302
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Okay.

1303
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
You just didn't use them widespread.

1304
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I just, yeah, I didn't really deploy them anywhere.

1305
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Yeah.

1306
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
And I'm kind of in the same boat.

1307
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,280
I just traditionally just stick to the LTS.

1308
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,280
Right.

1309
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:25,040
You know, and it seems like a good point right now where once it's out, it'll have fresh

1310
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:29,400
packages for quite some time, and then you have the snap packages, and you have CFS right

1311
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,400
there.

1312
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,760
Have you played with CFS on 1604?

1313
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:36,960
I haven't on 1604, but I've used it, you know, building it myself or overloading myself installing

1314
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,800
it third party on earlier versions.

1315
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:44,600
So like I'm really excited also about like LXD 2.0, which just came out.

1316
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,680
I like LXD.

1317
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,600
I like that model and Ubuntu supports it very well.

1318
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,640
So do you use a lot of other desktop environments other than just Unity?

1319
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,640
Yeah.

1320
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,840
I almost never use Unity really.

1321
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,840
So I'm trying it out right now.

1322
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,160
It's not bad.

1323
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,680
The animations are pretty slick and it's definitely, I've seen the touch-ups from what I'm used

1324
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:07,660
to, you know, especially seeing it work a lot of the deployments I've done before.

1325
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:10,920
So Unity is nice, but you know, normally I use a Cinnamon a lot for Linux Mint or I use

1326
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:16,200
a tiling window manager, but I'm really excited for just having like, I feel like 1604 will

1327
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,320
be a release I can deploy in almost every part of my life.

1328
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,400
The places where I don't need firsthand management or where Arch doesn't make the most sense,

1329
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,180
you know, maybe for less minimal stuff, but anywhere where I just need a general Linux

1330
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,320
where I know that the packages will be what I need, there'll be a way, especially with

1331
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,320
snap packages.

1332
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:36,320
There'll be a way to get the software that I want and I can figure out the way I need.

1333
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,320
I'm really excited.

1334
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,320
Yeah.

1335
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,800
That's sort of my takeaway too.

1336
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,800
And I kind of wanted to, I joked a lot during the livestream, but I actually am kind of

1337
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:50,240
curious on Popey's take for it because not just because he worked with Ubuntu and works

1338
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,240
at Canonical, but honestly because he's obviously been following this for a long time and has

1339
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,500
good insight on this.

1340
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:59,840
And I wonder too if maybe these are some of the elements that he's excited about.

1341
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,920
And I know I've kind of asked him to dance it like a monkey before on this topic, but

1342
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,760
I know that the snap packages are sort of the weakest area of coverage in our review

1343
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:12,040
and it's sort of, I feel like the biggest long-term ramifications of 1604.

1344
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,680
And so I don't know, Popey, do you have any, just sort of take on our review and thoughts

1345
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,280
on it and maybe thoughts on snap packages specifically?

1346
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:22,120
Can't talk Chris, I'm busy playing games on 1604.

1347
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,120
Nice.

1348
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,120
Yeah.

1349
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,120
Okay.

1350
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,120
You know what?

1351
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:29,000
That's another thing is it is a great platform for Steam games.

1352
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Yeah, I kid.

1353
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I'm joking.

1354
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I was actually playing 1604.

1355
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Yeah, I believe you.

1356
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:43,440
But yeah, the snap stuff, you know, when I first heard about this a couple of years ago,

1357
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:49,200
I was kind of skeptical because the guy who was telling me about this was outside a hotel.

1358
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:54,440
You know, we'd all had an intro to what Snappy was and only a few people have been involved

1359
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,500
in what it was going to be.

1360
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,200
And I didn't quite get it.

1361
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:07,000
And it's only now that I realize how many people depend on things like AUR in Arch or

1362
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,240
self-updating applications like Chrome and other things that just like sort themselves

1363
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,080
out and nobody has to worry about it, right?

1364
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:20,740
And you know, we used to think that PPAs were a marvelous way to get stuff to users.

1365
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:26,880
But actually, it's quite abrasive to get from, you know, I want to have the latest version

1366
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:34,780
of whatever, Atom or, you know, Sublime or whatever, whether it's free software or proprietary.

1367
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:39,880
It's quite abrasive to get from I want that thing to getting that thing.

1368
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:47,520
And I think Snap can make that a whole lot easier and also make it so that you can have

1369
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,560
the latest version of stuff up to date all the time on your system and that is compelling

1370
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,560
for a lot of people.

1371
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,560
Yeah, extremely.

1372
01:09:54,560 --> 01:10:00,520
And I know every year I talk to Frank about this problem from ownCloud and this, I'm really

1373
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,720
curious this year to say, what do you think about this?

1374
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:03,840
What are your thoughts on this?

1375
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,000
I know they're relying right now on the openSUSE build service.

1376
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,520
And so one of the things that we kept going around and around about is this seems maybe

1377
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,600
like a little bit too late, Pobi.

1378
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,320
It seems like maybe this should have come about.

1379
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:23,160
But if you look at the origins of where Snap packages were originally created for, there

1380
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:30,680
is almost no no route to here without having gone through the Ubuntu phone process, right?

1381
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:35,240
Yeah, we learn a lot from click packages on the phone and

1382
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,240
Click packages.

1383
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,240
That's click packages.

1384
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,240
Thank you.

1385
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,240
Yeah.

1386
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,240
Yeah.

1387
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,240
So, you know, like, I'll give you a good example.

1388
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:49,720
There's a developer who created a game for Ubuntu phone called Balls.

1389
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,840
And it's written in SDL2.

1390
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,720
It works on the phone.

1391
01:10:54,720 --> 01:11:03,020
And he cranks out a new version once, maybe twice a day, how he can just push a new version

1392
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:04,680
to the store.

1393
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:10,760
And it's on his customers handsets, or his users or whatever you want to call them that

1394
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:16,240
the people who play his game, he can build a new level in 15 minutes that he has to work

1395
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,800
on his game.

1396
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,560
He can build a new level, crank out a click package, shove it in the store, and thousands

1397
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,480
of people have it straight away, right?

1398
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,640
And so that works great on the phone.

1399
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,520
But you know, you and I both know, I'll give you a little secret, right?

1400
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,880
We don't have millions and millions of phone users, right?

1401
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,440
But we do have millions and millions of Ubuntu desktop users.

1402
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:46,680
So take that technology that we used on the phone to deliver applications super fast to

1403
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:53,160
the users on the phone and bring that to the desktop, then all those millions of users

1404
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:57,400
can potentially have super up-to-date packages with all the lessons we've learned from the

1405
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,400
phone.

1406
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,400
Hmm.

1407
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,400
I do like that.

1408
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,360
I feel like it's one of those things that we won't see pay off for quite a while though.

1409
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,360
Potentially.

1410
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,120
I mean, we're working on tools to make it easier.

1411
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:12,760
So like, you know, we're all working on snapifying, we call it.

1412
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,760
Not formally.

1413
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,560
That's just like a stupid term.

1414
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,680
Not snap-crafting, or...

1415
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:21,040
Yeah, there's not a verb for it really.

1416
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,040
Snapping?

1417
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,040
Snapping, yeah.

1418
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,040
You don't want to snap.

1419
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,040
Yeah.

1420
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,240
So we're all working on, yeah, snapification sounds good.

1421
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,640
Sounds very George W. Bush.

1422
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:35,200
And we're all doing a bit of that to iron out all the kinks and figure out, you know,

1423
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:39,440
because every application is different and some things have different requirements, and

1424
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,520
because of our security model to ensure that one application can't stomp on the files of

1425
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:52,120
another or you don't get one file, you know, able to access the data from another application

1426
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:58,720
and like send your key presses elsewhere, the security side of things is super critical

1427
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:05,880
and we're just discovering the edge cases of, you know, what each application needs

1428
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,520
in terms of security with Snappy.

1429
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,880
And so we're pushing the boundaries of that, trying to make sure that we're getting all

1430
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:16,840
that done so that when a developer comes along and wants to snappify their app, it's all

1431
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,840
ready for them.

1432
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:24,200
This is something that I want to talk to you about because I was just arguing with Noah

1433
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,200
that one of the emails we get all the time on quarter radio, and one of the things that

1434
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:34,320
Mike has run into, is he says, right, okay, I'm going to develop for Ubuntu.

1435
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:38,480
I'm going to release an app for the Ubuntu desktop for Ubuntu users.

1436
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:47,000
And I'm going to use which SDK, which toolkit, which backend language, and I distribute it

1437
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,160
to my end users with reliable, secure updates.

1438
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,160
How?

1439
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:57,480
Okay, so if I want to distribute for Ubuntu reliably via software update, how do I do

1440
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:58,480
that?

1441
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,320
And if I'm just saying, just say I'm like, say I'm the developer of your favorite application

1442
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,720
that's available for another platform that just has decided now is the time to target

1443
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,120
the Linux desktop.

1444
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,360
How do they figure this out?

1445
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:15,360
They either, A, somehow get it submitted to Debian downstream so it gets included in the

1446
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,840
Ubuntu repos and thus gets updated when their system updates.

1447
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:23,840
They figure out how to create a Launchpad account and create PPAs and publish their

1448
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,520
own repo.

1449
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,960
They figure out how to package a deb file or pay somebody, which is a common thing that

1450
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:37,960
developers do, is just hire some guy or gal to package a deb file for them, and then they

1451
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:41,680
post it on their website, which then means you don't get to take advantage of any of

1452
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,000
the built-in package management.

1453
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Nope.

1454
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Check back.

1455
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,840
And so what Mike and I have kicked around a ton on Coderadio is this is a shitty story

1456
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,400
to tell developers.

1457
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,720
This just doesn't work for them.

1458
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,720
They can't bank on that.

1459
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,880
They can't take that to the bank.

1460
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:02,720
And so I think that the SNAP packages is probably the best answer to this, and I think it answers

1461
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,720
a bigger question than we all realize is being asked.

1462
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:09,320
Do you agree with my sort of rough assessment, Popi?

1463
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,320
Right.

1464
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:16,520
And for a slow-moving free software project, there's a good argument for you should put

1465
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:21,720
it in Debian or AUR or wherever that hits the most number of free software developers.

1466
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:25,040
But that's not really practical for a lot of people that are maybe bringing something

1467
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,640
over to the Linux desktop for the first time.

1468
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,640
Right.

1469
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,920
And that's just one method.

1470
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:36,120
I'm just trying to say that putting it in Debian is not inherently a bad thing.

1471
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,120
Right.

1472
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,120
There's nothing inherently wrong with that.

1473
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,800
If you could do it, it's great.

1474
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,800
Right.

1475
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:45,200
But we've seen – or if you can find a Debian developer to sponsor your upload or whatever

1476
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,200
the process is.

1477
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:53,480
But we've seen recently friction in Debian where an upstream developer wants more recent

1478
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:59,920
versions of their application in the distro, and the Debian policy doesn't allow that

1479
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:00,920
to happen.

1480
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,920
Right.

1481
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,240
You're referring to the X-Screen saver thing.

1482
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,240
Right.

1483
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:09,800
And so with a system where the developer is put in control of how they distribute their

1484
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:16,760
code and with automated reviews and sandboxing, these three things put together means that

1485
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,440
developers are happy because they can distribute the version of their software that they're

1486
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,260
happy with when they want to.

1487
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:27,200
Users are happy because they get the latest version of Crack that they want, and users

1488
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:32,080
are also happy and sysadmins are happy because the system is secure because the apps are

1489
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,720
siloed from each other.

1490
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,400
So it seems like a win-win-win all the way around.

1491
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,240
R Brown, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in because also – I mean, we've seen

1492
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:43,640
this play out in a lot of instances, but own clouds are probably one of the more prominent

1493
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,640
ones.

1494
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,640
Wouldn't you agree?

1495
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,640
Yeah.

1496
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:52,520
They're a pretty good example of one of those projects where, yeah, they're really – well,

1497
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:57,680
in the case of the Debian one, it wasn't just a case of not able to get the version

1498
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:03,200
in there, but also the Debian developer putting in what own cloud considered was an unsafe

1499
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,200
upgrade path.

1500
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,200
Right.

1501
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:10,120
Now, Richard, I just want your frank opinion, not even as a representation of SUSE, just

1502
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:14,680
as a representative of the Linux community.

1503
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,200
Do you bang your head against your desk?

1504
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:20,580
Do you facepalm a little bit when you go, guys, guys, guys, we've got the open bususa

1505
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:21,580
build service.

1506
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,780
It's working great.

1507
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:25,040
Projects like own cloud are using the hell out of it.

1508
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,840
Don't reinvent the wheel of snap packages.

1509
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,120
Just put it in the open build service.

1510
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:35,120
Is there a facepalm moment for you or do you see it in a different light?

1511
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,360
There is to a large extent.

1512
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:43,920
When you mix in the Ubuntu mobile thing, there's maybe a case to be made there, but I'm not

1513
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,920
sold on it.

1514
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:45,920
No.

1515
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,920
Hmm.

1516
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:47,920
Yeah.

1517
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,920
This is where our debate was going –

1518
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:49,920
I see.

1519
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,600
– in the living room, and – no, no, I don't know.

1520
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:59,560
When we talked about it, my take was – see, I guess it's – I have two opinions because

1521
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:05,280
snap packages on their own right are pretty slick technology and a pretty great idea and

1522
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:11,200
something that I think pretty much anyone who's new to the scene, you can look at how

1523
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:16,400
to build these things, how to write the description file, and you're going to get it.

1524
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,800
It's going to be easy.

1525
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:18,800
I love that a lot.

1526
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,600
And it might be familiar for how you're doing packaging things for other systems already.

1527
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:23,600
Sure.

1528
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,600
Yeah.

1529
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,600
Yeah.

1530
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,840
So that – I'm pretty jazzed about it in the big picture.

1531
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:35,880
At the same time, I don't want to say this in a flamey way, but if Ubuntu would have

1532
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:39,440
just – if it could have gone like this, like what if it could have gone like this?

1533
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,840
Like Canonica would have been like, all right, we're going to go focus on mobile for a bit,

1534
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,960
so what we're going to do is if you want to worry about getting desktop software on

1535
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,720
our desktop, we're just going to hook in with the openSUSE build service.

1536
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:56,120
And we're just going to hook in with that, and that's going to be sort of our official

1537
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,760
avenue for getting software on our desktop.

1538
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:03,740
And I feel like that would have been a game changer for desktop Linux because instead

1539
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:10,920
of now getting packages bundled for Debian and Ubuntu out of the goodwill of the developer,

1540
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:15,600
it would have been a standardized method to deliver software to the Linux desktop.

1541
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:21,160
What guarantee would Canonical have had that the openSUSE build service would have kept

1542
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:24,720
their values and their priorities in mind?

1543
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,040
Besides the fact we've been doing it for 10 years now?

1544
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:33,280
Well, so I guess what I'm asking is Canonical has – Canonical invented the PPA system

1545
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:37,600
and for better or for worse, they have these devs that are available on the download, but

1546
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,960
that was – at the time that that came out, that was far and away better than anything

1547
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,720
else we had had on Linux, and so I think it's a little unfair to say that because other

1548
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:50,600
competition has rose up around them and they are now taking those steps to advance it,

1549
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:55,240
I think it's a little unfair to say, well, all of a sudden Canonical has just done it

1550
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,240
all wrong.

1551
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,240
And I guess –

1552
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:01,160
No, I don't want to come across to saying they've done it all wrong because I don't

1553
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,160
agree.

1554
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,280
I think that PPAs were a decent addition.

1555
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:11,080
And so here's where I'm coming from on this, and just really quickly is Seuss Martin

1556
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:17,280
in the Linux action show subreddit said, sorry, Chris, no offense.

1557
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,280
Which is always –

1558
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,280
I'm about to say something offensive.

1559
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,080
Yeah, I just pissed in your flower bed.

1560
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,080
Not to upset you.

1561
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,080
Anyways –

1562
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,080
That's good.

1563
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:31,880
But that was not a review, more like an hour-long monologue about how bad PPAs are, and I want

1564
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:32,880
to stop right there.

1565
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,000
I actually think as far as PPAs go, they're not an awful system.

1566
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,680
I don't think it's that bad.

1567
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,800
I think it was a good addition when PPAs were launched a long time ago.

1568
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,640
I'm trying to look at Wikipedia to find out the date, but they don't have it.

1569
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,640
2009.

1570
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,640
Thank you.

1571
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:52,120
They certainly filled the need.

1572
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,120
Right.

1573
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,680
Yeah, this was solid in 2009.

1574
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,680
Great idea.

1575
01:20:55,680 --> 01:21:00,760
2009 is too long ago now, and it needed to be iterated on continuously since then.

1576
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:06,080
And what happened, in my estimation, is it just didn't become a priority.

1577
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:10,200
And then the cloud took off, and then rapid software development took off, and people

1578
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:17,280
start creating entire applications that run on the web based on Node.js and plug-ins that

1579
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,520
can be completely revoked.

1580
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,380
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

1581
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:23,960
And in days, they have a new web application.

1582
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,080
And then in months, they have iterated three times.

1583
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:31,160
And all of a sudden, we now find ourselves in a world where, unarguably, OpenSUSE were

1584
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:37,120
the leaders, where Fedora has a very competent solution, where Arch has a crushing lead with

1585
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,040
the user repository.

1586
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:42,840
We now find ourselves in a world where Ubuntu is behind in this regard.

1587
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,220
I'm not saying PPAs are bad.

1588
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:50,240
I'm saying that if we could have switched over to another solution by now, I like the

1589
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,160
build service just as my personal one.

1590
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,360
Yeah, it works well.

1591
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,260
We would have fundamentally changed how software is distributed for Linux.

1592
01:21:57,260 --> 01:22:03,160
The answer for developers that I talked about earlier would have been target the build service

1593
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:07,600
with clear documentation, a large community, and it would have made it available to just

1594
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,440
about every damn distro on the planet.

1595
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:16,680
Now I'm very excited for Snap packages, but at the same time, I kind of feel like it's

1596
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,840
too little to, well, not too little, but it's too late.

1597
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:24,840
16.04 and Snap packages, definitely notables from 2016.

1598
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,320
One of the next segments that's coming up is one of the first really, well, not really

1599
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:33,160
one of the first, but one of the many super solid technical contributions that Wes has

1600
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,280
brought to the show.

1601
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:38,900
It's been great having Wes on the show in 2016, and our next segment is a great example

1602
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:39,900
of that.

1603
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:43,080
And it's so great because he's not caught up in all the buzz and the hype around some

1604
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,800
of these things, and he gives you a real practical, straightforward, working with us every day

1605
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,800
kind of take.

1606
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,360
First, speaking of working with things every single day, your education is one of them,

1607
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,720
and that's Linux Academy.

1608
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:57,120
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged is where you go to support the show and get a seven-day

1609
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,120
free trial.

1610
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:02,000
Linux Academy is a platform created by Linux enthusiasts for you to learn more about all

1611
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,880
things Linux and the great stuff built on top of it.

1612
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,680
And they're just geniuses about the way they've set this up.

1613
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:12,220
They have self-paced, in-depth video courses for every Linux and cloud and DevOps topic.

1614
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:17,180
They have labs that give you hands-on, scenario-based training, which helps me with my testing anxiety.

1615
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:19,800
Future mentoring is available when you need it, actual human beings.

1616
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,400
And then if you're not quite sure what path to take, well, they have learning paths for

1617
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,260
you, a series of courses and content planned by those human beings.

1618
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:29,880
They have cert training if that's the route you want to go, nuggets for tiny bits of sparkly

1619
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:34,860
wisdom, course schedulers to work with your busy schedule, study guides and comprehensive

1620
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:40,500
downloads that have audio or PDFs that you can read or listen to offline, and note cards

1621
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:44,920
that are forked and worked on by the community, and the community is full of Jupyter Broadcasting

1622
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,920
members.

1623
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,920
I love it.

1624
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:49,080
Twitter.com slash unplugged is where you go.

1625
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:55,640
And kind of fun to watch their feed right now on Twitter, twitter.com slash linuxacademycom.

1626
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:00,760
They're at an AWS event that's going on, and they have a booth there, and there's a lot

1627
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:04,140
of shenanigans going on, and they're giving away drones, too.

1628
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,140
This is awesome.

1629
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:06,140
And they have giant plushies.

1630
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,140
What?

1631
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:10,540
I want a giant plushie and a drone.

1632
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,540
This is pretty cool.

1633
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:12,540
Their Twitter feed's great.

1634
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:15,760
You can learn about new content coming to Linux Academy and see some of the shenanigans

1635
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,760
they're up to.

1636
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,940
Again, that's linuxacademycom on Twitter if you want to see that, and some of the video

1637
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:22,820
from the AWS event they're at.

1638
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:26,060
It's cool to see them down there and getting hands-on with all the big stuff that Amazon's

1639
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:30,540
announcing today, so that way they can integrate it into their courseware pronto.

1640
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,620
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1641
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:36,020
Go there, support the show, and sign up for a seven-day free trial.

1642
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:40,100
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the show all

1643
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,100
year.

1644
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,100
LXD.

1645
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:45,580
It's like the non-hyped Docker, and Wes has had some real hands-on experience.

1646
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,180
I love this contribution to the show.

1647
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:52,860
All right, Mr. Wes, so you said to me, okay, Chris, I know we've talked about Ubuntu 16.04

1648
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:55,340
a lot, but let's be real.

1649
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:58,260
We've mostly focused on the desktop, where we've trashed on it a little bit.

1650
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:01,020
Plus, I mean, does anyone even use Linux on the desktop?

1651
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:02,020
I don't know.

1652
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:03,020
No, I could, obviously.

1653
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:04,020
Obviously.

1654
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:05,020
Oh my gosh.

1655
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,020
Oh my gosh.

1656
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:07,020
Whew.

1657
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:11,300
But, you know, there's the whole other element of the Ubuntu server.

1658
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:13,860
The server, where it's actually hugely successful in a big way.

1659
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:14,860
So have you used it at all?

1660
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:15,860
Yeah.

1661
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:16,860
Oh, yeah.

1662
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:17,860
Yeah.

1663
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:18,860
Wait.

1664
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,940
Do I have any local 16.04 servers?

1665
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:21,940
No.

1666
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:22,940
No, I don't.

1667
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:29,140
I only have Digital Ocean Droplets, but we've got a handful of them now, and I don't really

1668
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:30,140
have anything to say.

1669
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:32,140
I guess that's a good thing in a server, right?

1670
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,140
Yeah.

1671
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:34,140
They just freaking run.

1672
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:35,940
We've set up a software on them.

1673
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:40,500
We have some 14.04 Droplets we want to move to 16.04, because we... I'll tell you one

1674
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,500
... Okay.

1675
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,500
Okay.

1676
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:43,500
Okay.

1677
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,740
Okay.

1678
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:50,540
It is a pain in the ass now to like... It is a major pain in the ass to write init scripts

1679
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:54,900
for Upstart, and it's like the last thing I want to do, or it's the last thing anybody

1680
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,820
on the JB crew wants to do, is learn Upstart at this point.

1681
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:58,820
Oh my gosh.

1682
01:25:58,820 --> 01:25:59,820
Yes.

1683
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:00,820
Who wants to learn Upstart?

1684
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:01,820
No.

1685
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:02,820
It's dead.

1686
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:03,820
Yeah.

1687
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:04,820
Exactly.

1688
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:05,820
And here's the other thing, is tons of the projects I've been using for a while now have

1689
01:26:05,820 --> 01:26:06,820
systemd init scripts.

1690
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:07,820
Yep.

1691
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:08,820
They come.

1692
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:09,820
They're right there.

1693
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:10,820
Yes.

1694
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:11,820
Yes.

1695
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:12,820
Yes.

1696
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:17,320
And so I can use those examples and things, but that's pretty much the entire summary

1697
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:18,840
of my review from the servers.

1698
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,840
It works.

1699
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,140
I don't really have any complaints, and it does everything I expect, which, by the way,

1700
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:25,560
exactly what I want on my server.

1701
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,560
It just is.

1702
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,560
Yeah.

1703
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:28,560
It's consistent.

1704
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,940
So you, however, have had a bit of a bigger route change.

1705
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:33,900
I'm in the weird position of like... I mean, I use Arch for a lot of things.

1706
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,060
It's what I'm most familiar these days with.

1707
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:40,260
I know how to bend it to my will, get whatever I need to do done with it.

1708
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:43,780
I'm in the weird position where I'm considering switching to Ubuntu for a lot of my larger

1709
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:51,060
server uses, mostly because of LexD, as they call it, which is LexD 2.0 is just released,

1710
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:56,940
and that's their container lighter visor, they jokingly call it, and it's meant to be

1711
01:26:56,940 --> 01:27:02,660
a new way to interact with the Linux container, or LexC, subsystem and the infrastructure

1712
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:03,660
they've set up.

1713
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:10,100
So if you're not familiar, you can go to linuxcontainers.org, backslash.org, and you can go to linuxcontainers.org,

1714
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:14,140
backslash LXD, backslash try-it, which we will have a link in the show notes.

1715
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:16,340
And you can give it a try right now, and it's a...

1716
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:17,340
Now hold on.

1717
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:23,260
When you say give it a try, you mean I can go to a webpage and I can spin up a LXD container

1718
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:24,260
in real time?

1719
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:25,260
Yeah, let's try it.

1720
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:26,260
Let's do it right now.

1721
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:27,260
Are you ready?

1722
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:28,260
You want to do it?

1723
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:29,260
Okay, here we go.

1724
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:34,740
So I am at linuxcontainers.org, slash LXD, slash try-it, again, link in the show notes.

1725
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:37,540
Yeah, where's the FPV6 connectivity, Chris, at the studio?

1726
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,540
Come on.

1727
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:39,540
I know, right?

1728
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:41,740
You've accepted the terms of service, because of course I do.

1729
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:42,740
They're pretty reasonable.

1730
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:44,820
Now, they are going to start the container on the fly now.

1731
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:48,700
Because we just gave out the URL, it's going to get slow here, but before it gets slow,

1732
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,780
you can see right here, Wes, right here, boom!

1733
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:56,520
I got a console, I got an LXD container, I'm now root inside a container nested inside

1734
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,900
an LXD install, which is sort of like LXD inception.

1735
01:27:58,900 --> 01:27:59,900
Yes, right.

1736
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,900
What am I seeing here, Wes?

1737
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:01,900
What am I seeing?

1738
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:07,580
You're seeing they ran LXD exec container name bash, and it just gets you executed as root

1739
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,780
inside the container a bash shell.

1740
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:10,780
This is pretty cool.

1741
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:11,940
This is a pretty cool way to do it.

1742
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:12,940
Yeah, it's pretty neat.

1743
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:16,660
So one of the neat things that they've, LXD was pretty complicated to use.

1744
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:20,860
It's really neat to use, if you've ever tried it, if you need system-level containers.

1745
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:25,020
But there's a lot of things to learn, and a lot of configuration things to set up.

1746
01:28:25,020 --> 01:28:26,020
Sure.

1747
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:29,740
LXD, or LXD, it's a lot simpler, and so you can kind of just get an image going, and they

1748
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:30,900
have default profiles set up.

1749
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:37,700
So the default one, it runs as an unprivileged container, meaning that it actually runs in

1750
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:41,260
a user namespace, so that root in the container is no longer root on your host.

1751
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:46,760
It's actually matched to UID 1 million or something like that, and hopefully that get

1752
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,660
you some added security.

1753
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:50,540
But it also has default profiles.

1754
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:54,500
If you want to run Docker in there, you just change your container to be on the Docker

1755
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:58,280
profile, and they tweak some of the security settings and the nesting settings so that

1756
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:00,460
you can run Docker inside your container.

1757
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,460
Huh.

1758
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,860
So you're just starting to play with this, but how's the workflow bit?

1759
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:04,860
Is it pretty easy to use?

1760
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:05,860
It's neat.

1761
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:09,420
So LXD used kind of a template workflow, so where you'd use something like packstrap or

1762
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:13,180
debootstrap or whatever to get your container implemented on the machine you're running

1763
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:14,180
it on.

1764
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:20,020
LXD uses an image-based format, so you actually just have a tar gz of your container root

1765
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:24,140
file system, and it also takes great advantage of CFS.

1766
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:25,140
It's awesome.

1767
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:29,340
So in 16.04, you just install the userland tools, the kernel module's built for you,

1768
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:30,620
you just load that up.

1769
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:36,140
It has a pseudo-LXD in it, and it'll walk you through it, it'll even set you up like

1770
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:39,860
a loopback-mounted ZFS file system if you want, right?

1771
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:41,540
So that's what I'm using on the laptop here.

1772
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:44,340
Or if you want to have, you know, you have an actual pool of disks to use, you can use

1773
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,340
that, or use one that you already have.

1774
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:50,500
And so what that means is, when you want to use like a new, they give you some image servers

1775
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:55,260
by default with the, you know, Ubuntu 16.04 container image, you can just pull that down,

1776
01:29:55,260 --> 01:30:00,380
but once you have that image, every new container you start, it's just a, it's just a copy-on-write

1777
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:01,380
copy of that, right?

1778
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:04,300
So you, you, it's basically free, except for what you change it.

1779
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,300
That's slick!

1780
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,700
And all, again, super easy to set up.

1781
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:09,980
And I've already set up like an arch verge, so they don't have, they have like Alpine,

1782
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:10,980
they have Fedora.

1783
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:15,580
So wait, so you're saying, you're saying you have, okay, so, for example, if I were to

1784
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:21,380
do this on a, on a droplet, I could have an Ubuntu 16.04 droplet, but in the container,

1785
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:22,380
run arch.

1786
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:23,380
Yep, absolutely.

1787
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:25,340
So they don't have one provided on there.

1788
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:30,260
They have like an image, images.linuxcontainers.org, where they have like Fedora, Cora, like lots

1789
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:34,380
of pre-built stuff for you, but arch wasn't one of them, but you just take a, you know,

1790
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:37,620
you make a reasonable arch file system, you package it up in a tar and it's really easy

1791
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:38,620
to get it as your own.

1792
01:30:38,620 --> 01:30:42,340
And then you can, they, the other neat thing is it's a networked, like it's all done over

1793
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:43,460
a REST API.

1794
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:44,980
That's like, that's how the client talks to it.

1795
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:45,980
That's how you can talk to it.

1796
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:49,020
They have Python bindings and it also talks over the network.

1797
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:53,460
So I can have a server here and then a server on a droplet somewhere, and I can go make

1798
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,420
myself a new image, have containers here.

1799
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:58,500
And if I make a container I really like here, I can just push it over to the server and

1800
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,500
it will run there.

1801
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,500
That is nice.

1802
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,500
Talking about rapid development.

1803
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,820
You can even snapshot up here, then push the snapshot up to the, it's, it's, I'm really

1804
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:05,820
excited.

1805
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:07,740
I might have to change a lot of my infrastructure to use this now.

1806
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:09,260
That is super, super neat.

1807
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:14,140
I like Wes's discussion about LXDE and while we're talking about things that are very practical,

1808
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:18,220
let's talk about the Linux desktop in terms of pragmatic reasons and philosophical reasons

1809
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:19,220
to use Linux.

1810
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,220
All right.

1811
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:23,740
So I, I'll, I don't want to go too far in this without bringing in the mumble room because

1812
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:26,140
this is sort of the segment I wanted to give them a chance to shine.

1813
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:30,900
However, I got to ask you, I don't think I actually know the answer to this question

1814
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:31,900
either.

1815
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:35,060
I was just trying to think if I knew what you were going to say.

1816
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:45,460
Do you today use the Linux desktop for idealistic reasons or for purely pragmatic practical

1817
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:48,460
reasons today?

1818
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:54,500
And is that different than when you first tried Linux?

1819
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,500
I think I've kind of come full circle.

1820
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,060
You know, I grew up kind of playing with windows.

1821
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:03,100
I remember trying to change the like windows boot screen and breaking the family computer

1822
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,780
for a while, that kind of thing.

1823
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:08,220
And you quickly figure out like what you can and what you cannot change with windows.

1824
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:12,860
And so Linux started out as this like wonderful playground and like I knew what open source

1825
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:13,860
was.

1826
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:16,380
I kind of like started trying to program, but it was, it didn't mean a lot.

1827
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:18,100
I couldn't really use it to do any, you know what I mean?

1828
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:21,980
Like, I mean, I could do a lot and I loved all this software, but it was like, this is

1829
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:22,980
just fun.

1830
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:25,020
This let me like really deep dive.

1831
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:30,220
And I think somewhere in the middle there, I really stuck around because, I mean, at

1832
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:33,580
some point I started going to school and like, well, I mean, Linux was very important for

1833
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:34,580
that.

1834
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:37,140
You know, you can write a paper on just about any operating system.

1835
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:43,460
So I think it really, the, the idle ideology, it really did, it really did sink in.

1836
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:46,820
You know, and it, you know, it made me, it made me want to try more distributions.

1837
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:50,700
It made me want to try to, you know, you can play with free BSD or something else, look

1838
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:53,300
at the little different ideology.

1839
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:57,260
But I think today, I don't think there's another platform where I could get what I need to

1840
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:58,260
get done.

1841
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,700
Like there's definitely both parts, like both parts are very important.

1842
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,980
I think the ideology is, it's important.

1843
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:04,980
I think freedom is important.

1844
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:08,660
I think open source is important, but it's also just, I need to, I need an operating

1845
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:11,080
system that is malleable and where I can change things.

1846
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:17,460
And like the ideology definitely informs that, but at some day, be it as long as it is free,

1847
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,460
I think I can make it work.

1848
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,460
You know?

1849
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:20,460
Okay.

1850
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:21,460
All right.

1851
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,980
So let's, let's bounce to the mumble room and then I'll give you my thoughts.

1852
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,780
So BC, I'll let you go first.

1853
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:29,220
Do you use it today for ideal, idealistic or practical reasons?

1854
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:31,180
And is that how you started using Linux?

1855
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,180
Yeah.

1856
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:36,020
So the first time I installed Linux, it was like 15 years ago.

1857
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:37,020
Yes.

1858
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:38,620
Coming directly from Windows.

1859
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:46,340
I started, just wanted to check out what exactly it is right now as I use Linux full time.

1860
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:48,980
I'm just much more productive with it.

1861
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:57,780
However, it's not just productive because I try to use as little close software as possible.

1862
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:04,460
So in reality, both interesting thing there too, because you can kind of reach a limit

1863
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:05,780
where you're like, well, I want to be free.

1864
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:09,740
And then sometimes you hit that area where you're like, well, my operating system is

1865
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:12,700
free, but this application is proprietary and I need it.

1866
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:13,700
Yeah.

1867
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:15,220
I use Windows for some things.

1868
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:21,180
For example, game development, I use KVM with GPU pass-through, unfortunately.

1869
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:22,180
Yeah.

1870
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:23,180
Okay.

1871
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:24,180
All right.

1872
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:25,180
Good.

1873
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:28,780
And it sounds kind of like sort of a similar situation, Uber Panda, I want to hear your

1874
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:29,780
thoughts.

1875
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:30,780
Yeah.

1876
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:36,180
Yeah, so I started using Linux because of battery life reasons.

1877
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:41,900
My laptop on Windows lasted like one hour and I just started using AuctionX and it lasted

1878
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:43,620
for two and a half hours.

1879
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:46,140
So I used that.

1880
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:50,580
And then I understood what was free software, that kind of thing.

1881
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:57,140
So it became an ideology and now I think free software is good and Windows is also a terrible

1882
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,140
operating system.

1883
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:00,980
So I use Linux for both reasons.

1884
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:01,980
Yeah.

1885
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:02,980
Interesting.

1886
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:03,980
I love it.

1887
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:04,980
I think that's pretty, I think that actually makes a lot of sense.

1888
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:08,780
Now, okay, Mr. Heaven, so it sounds like you've been around the block a couple of times,

1889
01:35:08,780 --> 01:35:12,180
including over into the FreeBSD camp and then ended back on Linux.

1890
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:16,900
So is that for idealism or is that because just made more sense, practically speaking?

1891
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:25,860
Well, the reason why I went, or at least let's say during my first bit of open source adventures,

1892
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:28,380
of course, I like the technical things.

1893
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:33,700
So I went into a, you know, adventure and benchmarking a whole bunch of file systems.

1894
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:37,500
I found XFS while I was on Linux and I loved it.

1895
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:43,940
Thing is, my philosophy is closer to the BSD philosophy versus the Linux one.

1896
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:49,820
So I actually went over to desktop BSD and whatever that other one was and FreeBSD and

1897
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:51,620
I went there for a while.

1898
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:56,640
Thing is, the XFS port wasn't up to stuff, it wasn't up to date enough.

1899
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:02,540
So even though I love FreeSP's philosophy of true freedom, it allows you to keep secrets

1900
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:08,060
if you want, but Linux pretty much prevents you from keeping secrets if you, you know,

1901
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:11,520
regardless if you want to or not, other than the LGPL.

1902
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,980
So I went back to Linux because of XFS, because all of my storage was XFS and FreeBSD didn't

1903
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:20,260
actually provide what I needed.

1904
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:24,380
So that's, that's a practical, that'd be a practical reason there.

1905
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:27,980
That is actually a practical reason, even though it's slightly philosophical as well.

1906
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:29,540
Oh man, that's so interesting.

1907
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:35,860
All right, Mini MC, your practical or idealism for your initial adoption of Linux and where

1908
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:38,300
you're at today?

1909
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:40,780
So I wanted to know something new.

1910
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:47,900
I started with Linux 6.1, I just wanted to see something new and all missing stuff was

1911
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:52,980
really hard to replace and then from time to time it became a feature.

1912
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,980
So now Linux changed my whole workflow.

1913
01:36:55,980 --> 01:37:00,980
So it stripped me down to the basics and I'm much faster, much clearer in my workflow than

1914
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:02,980
I was before, I guess.

1915
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:03,980
Interesting.

1916
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:05,980
Yeah, I know.

1917
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:10,060
What's been interesting for me just on the workflow part is I've had the opportunity

1918
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:15,060
now of moving a couple of different types of workflows onto Linux, started as just moving

1919
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:21,100
like desktop Microsoft workflow, like Office and Outlook, getting that running on Linux

1920
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:24,940
and doing interacting with Windows file shares and that workflow was a major workflow.

1921
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:29,660
And I, it took me a while, I mean it took me a while to make that more efficient under

1922
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:34,140
Linux to be able to justify running Microsoft applications on Linux, but I got there.

1923
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:39,060
I eventually got there and then I moved, I went as a consultant, I had to move that workflow

1924
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:45,420
onto Linux when I did IT consulting for a while and then, you know, just here at Jupyter

1925
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:50,500
Broadcasting there have been so many workflows that are sort of, they start with the Mac

1926
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:54,660
and then I was like I have to move this to Linux and definitely one of the biggest ones

1927
01:37:54,660 --> 01:38:00,640
for me was my unfilter clip editing and workflow because that just, it started out as such

1928
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:07,100
a Mac centric just couple of tools that I just hated using and it just was a mess and

1929
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:12,500
moving that over to Linux and finding that to be, and being able to then use all of my,

1930
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:16,420
you know, my traditional Linux skills on the command line and being able to take advantage

1931
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:19,500
of things like Quake and being able to take advantage of things like Avid Mux and being

1932
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:24,860
able to install codecs, you know, by just a command away, it made it very practical

1933
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:26,580
in that case to move that workflow over there.

1934
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:31,100
So that workflow element and just because I have a better workflow sometimes is enough

1935
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:32,100
of a reason.

1936
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:35,020
And more options in how you make that workflow, right?

1937
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:38,820
So Rotten, I wanted to hear your practical or idealism.

1938
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:46,060
Well, I started as a practicality thing because I was a beta tester for Windows 7 for about

1939
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:51,100
a year before it was released and when it came to the point where they were about to

1940
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:54,700
release it, they said all beta testers now had to pay for it.

1941
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:58,600
So and it wasn't like, you know, you had a certain amount of time to pay for it.

1942
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,140
They stopped your Windows 7 from working.

1943
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:02,140
Oh yeah.

1944
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:03,140
Oh yeah, that's right.

1945
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:07,900
Yeah, so it was completely like just stripped away from me and they gave me, I think like

1946
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:13,900
a week ahead of time, you're going to lose the access to run the system that you've been

1947
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:20,180
working for free to fix bugs and, you know, find problems that we've obviously have not

1948
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:22,280
finished fixing yet.

1949
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:26,500
And then it to the point where I was just like, you know what, out of spite, screw it.

1950
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:29,660
And I was already dual booting at the time, but then I just kind of like just wiped it

1951
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:34,700
and went to the Linux way and been there the whole time.

1952
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:37,860
And now it's become both.

1953
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,020
I didn't really know what the ideology was at the time.

1954
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,020
Exactly.

1955
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:42,020
Right.

1956
01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:43,020
Yeah.

1957
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,020
It's hard to pick up on it.

1958
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,020
Yeah.

1959
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:46,020
Yeah.

1960
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:49,860
So now it's more like the ideology made me stay and the practicality made me come over.

1961
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:50,860
That's a good way to put it.

1962
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:55,020
Landrash, I wanted to hear your ideology versus practicality, where you started and where

1963
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:57,380
you ended up.

1964
01:39:57,380 --> 01:40:04,140
I started in school with using it when I needed to for courses and stuff, going over to practicality

1965
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:08,540
when I got used to it and basically getting the only way I could do things was with Linux

1966
01:40:08,540 --> 01:40:10,020
because I needed the tools.

1967
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:11,740
I had the tools I needed there.

1968
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:16,180
I'm going to Windows for like shooting myself in the foot and doing it 10 times slower.

1969
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:18,340
I think we've all been there.

1970
01:40:18,340 --> 01:40:19,340
Yeah.

1971
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:20,820
He's finding that school's pretty cool.

1972
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:24,060
Okay, Mr. Ranger, how about yourself?

1973
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:29,460
I'm another one that I started out practical because back in the late 90s, early 2000s,

1974
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:34,260
worked at a computer shop where we needed easy internet sharing and IP chains was where

1975
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:35,260
it was at.

1976
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:36,260
Nice.

1977
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:42,180
Similar to your banking story, we had a point of sale system that was crashy and the networking

1978
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:43,580
on it was horrible.

1979
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:50,100
And oddly enough, the perfect solution was to run it in DOSBox.

1980
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:56,540
And even to this day, just a few months ago, I was an officiant at my sister's wedding

1981
01:40:56,540 --> 01:41:02,180
and I needed some random government form and I was trying to figure out how to modify this

1982
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:08,420
the way that I needed and Scribus was one command line install away.

1983
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:14,660
So I'd say practically, Linux is so easy to get software for and so easy to find software

1984
01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:18,140
that does whatever task you need that day.

1985
01:41:18,140 --> 01:41:20,580
So for me, way practical.

1986
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:21,580
Cool.

1987
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:25,420
I think that's an interesting thread in what Swift 110 here is commenting.

1988
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:28,700
It's interesting how practical is so different.

1989
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:32,900
There's a lot of enterprise cases or if you're a creative type where it's less practical

1990
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:35,900
because the tools you need are proprietary and expensive.

1991
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:41,220
But there's a lot of other cases where the ideology of freely available makes for these,

1992
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:46,220
if you're underprivileged, if you're out of budget for the quarter and you really have

1993
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:49,700
a problem that you want to get solved, free software is there for you.

1994
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:50,700
Yeah.

1995
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:51,700
Yeah, it really is.

1996
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:53,900
In fact, I'm going to touch on that one.

1997
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:56,860
I'll share mine here at the end, but I'm glad WW wants to share his.

1998
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:57,860
Go ahead, WW.

1999
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:58,860
What's yours?

2000
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:07,180
So I started back in Red Hat 5.1 in 96, 97.

2001
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:08,700
I didn't have LUNTS back then.

2002
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:10,740
I lived in the desert.

2003
01:42:10,740 --> 01:42:17,740
So I was lucky enough to have friends that were into Linux and into ham radios.

2004
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:23,120
And you can walk into a software, et cetera, and buy Mandrake Linux or whatever.

2005
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:29,020
Or if you weren't lucky enough, you can have an independent ISP and order Linux online

2006
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:30,480
and get it.

2007
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:33,260
And so I think I should have been on it longer.

2008
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:39,140
I should have been on it before, since Windows 3.1, because I always like to dig into the

2009
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:44,580
system and figure out how it's running and what it's doing and how to change it or how

2010
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:45,780
to move it around.

2011
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:51,540
So for me, practically, it's been something that I've been striving to be more on, even

2012
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:57,560
though I've been someone that dual boots and still uses Windows for what I really need

2013
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:59,480
to do.

2014
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:02,980
It's ultimately where I hope I end up is more on Linux.

2015
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:07,580
And I'm not sure about the ideological side.

2016
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,940
I like to be more pragmatic.

2017
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:13,280
So for me, it's more of a practical reason to be on Linux.

2018
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:19,380
And that makes more sense in the long term than being stuck on a closed system that you

2019
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:27,040
will never be able to open and openly use a way you believe it should be used.

2020
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:32,300
So long term for me, I think it's going to be practical.

2021
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:39,980
Maybe once I get a chance to read more into the ideological stuff, it'll be both for me

2022
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:40,980
right now.

2023
01:43:40,980 --> 01:43:41,980
So more of a practical reason.

2024
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:46,460
You know, I think what I'm really picking up, and it echoes mine, is sometimes you come

2025
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:50,740
at it from what feels like a very practical reason, and then you get there and you discover

2026
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:51,740
the philosophy.

2027
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:57,740
So I'll tell you, mine really started as a need to solve a limitation of Windows.

2028
01:43:57,740 --> 01:44:02,460
Windows just simply at the time, Windows NT4, was not good enough for the job I needed it

2029
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:03,460
to do.

2030
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:05,020
And so I had to find another solution.

2031
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:07,940
It started very practical.

2032
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:12,980
I think particularly for me, if you watch the back catalog of the Linux Action Show

2033
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:19,740
with this in mind, you can see where I switch from a pragmatist to more of an idealist.

2034
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:25,260
And now I'm on Linux simply because I can't stand to use any other platform.

2035
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:28,460
I couldn't imagine having to use Windows as my daily driver.

2036
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:30,860
I don't know what I would do.

2037
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:34,980
So you could claim that's practical, but I think really I'm here now for the idealism.

2038
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:39,700
And I'll tell you, for me, it took a while for it to sink in, mostly because there were

2039
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:44,740
so many problems I needed to solve, and it didn't really hit me until I started thinking

2040
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:47,700
about it in the way that affected my own bottom line.

2041
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:53,380
And then it clicked, and it was really in the sense of my clients kept getting screwed

2042
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:59,100
over by companies like Microsoft and many other proprietary companies that would just

2043
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:04,160
extort them for support contracts that were unbelievable and that would change and drop

2044
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:10,140
features at a moment's notice and completely leave them off on this old version that was

2045
01:45:10,140 --> 01:45:15,620
no longer supported for a decade because the next version up completely uplifted their

2046
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:16,980
workflow.

2047
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:23,260
And what I discovered over time, both in a sense of software and hardware and in contracts,

2048
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:27,740
is that vendor lock-in can be paralyzing for a company sometimes.

2049
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:33,720
And so that was in which the lens that I first looked at the advantages that a core open

2050
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:39,540
source infrastructure gives you, the kind of visibility into the long-term viability

2051
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:44,580
or even the emergency eject lever of forking and maintaining it by hiring your own developer.

2052
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:46,420
It's a really interesting business case for that.

2053
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:47,820
You get a lot of freedom there.

2054
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:52,140
It's huge, because I can tell you, you can deploy your infrastructure on this, and worst

2055
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:57,820
case scenario, if they stop making this thing, you can go hire a developer, and that developer

2056
01:45:57,820 --> 01:46:02,060
can continue the thing because all of the code is completely free and open source.

2057
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:04,660
And for an enterprise, that's not a crazy proposition.

2058
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:05,660
No.

2059
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,540
They already have developers, or they can hire one.

2060
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:08,540
Yes.

2061
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:12,180
And if it's a core piece of their business that makes them money, they like having that

2062
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:13,180
flexibility.

2063
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:16,820
And so it's with that perspective that looking at open source, the way that it would solve

2064
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:22,180
that problem that I realized, oh, shit, this is the killer feature.

2065
01:46:22,180 --> 01:46:24,200
It's not the great package management.

2066
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:25,420
It's not the stability.

2067
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:26,540
It's not the security.

2068
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:28,400
It's not the transparency.

2069
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:33,300
It's not all of the incredible minds and diverse opinions that are contributing to this.

2070
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:40,940
It's this fundamental open license, this GPL, that is the actual killer feature of this

2071
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:41,940
platform.

2072
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:47,780
And it took me a while to get there, but now it is based upon that, which I look at everything

2073
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:49,460
else.

2074
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:57,300
You can't have a practical Linux desktop experience without that idealism that led to the GPL

2075
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:58,300
and the GNU stack.

2076
01:46:58,300 --> 01:47:02,780
You can't have the full practical Linux desktop, which is a sensible reason that we're all

2077
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:03,780
using.

2078
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:04,780
It wouldn't exist without that.

2079
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:11,100
And so once I sort of made that sort of transition, that revelation, I realized, oh, I'm actually

2080
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,020
an idealist.

2081
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:17,180
And when I make decisions based on that, in the long run, those always tend to be the

2082
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:19,060
ones that pay out.

2083
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:24,160
And when I make a decision that's not oriented towards that, it tends to screw me eventually.

2084
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:28,500
And that has bared out in my personal life for stuff I just use myself, and it's bared

2085
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:31,220
out in my professional life with my clients and whatnot.

2086
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:35,780
And I'm very, very, very, very, very proud of the fact that I can go back to almost any

2087
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:40,060
of my clients and any of the Linux and open source solutions that I implemented are still

2088
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:42,580
maintainable and supportable today.

2089
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:46,660
And I cannot do that.

2090
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:51,540
It's literally not possible because aging them out is part of the process, and locking

2091
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:54,500
you into their support path because that's where they make all of their money in the

2092
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,860
enterprise is part of the process.

2093
01:47:56,860 --> 01:48:01,300
And so it took that particular doorway in which I saw it, then it really sort of lit

2094
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:02,300
up for me.

2095
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:03,300
But it was very pragmatic.

2096
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:05,260
It's funny how linked these two are.

2097
01:48:05,260 --> 01:48:08,700
I feel like a lot of people, that pragmatism, especially if you're, I feel like networking

2098
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,900
is a huge part where you're like, I want my internet gateway.

2099
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:14,340
And I feel like it actually that's a more solid foundation because if you're just in

2100
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:18,580
it for the idealism, then that idealism is going to last you as long until you want to

2101
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:21,620
watch something on Netflix or you're going to watch a TV show.

2102
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:23,260
I mean, where do you draw the line at that point?

2103
01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:29,060
Do you abandon all the proprietary lockdown media altogether?

2104
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:30,060
That's pretty hard.

2105
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:31,580
And maybe you do, and maybe that works for you.

2106
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:35,220
But to me, it seems like that eventually after a certain amount of time, unless you're freaking

2107
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:37,460
Richard Stallman himself, you're going to give.

2108
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:39,660
That dam eventually is going to break.

2109
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:42,520
And then what do you have if all you have is the idealism?

2110
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:47,660
If there's not the pragmatic thing that you're also grounded with, I feel like it's not quite

2111
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:48,660
as strong as a grip.

2112
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:50,620
If you can't get anything done, then what's the point?

2113
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:51,620
Yeah.

2114
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:52,620
Yeah.

2115
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:53,620
So it's a fascinating topic.

2116
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:57,140
And there's a couple, it popped up a couple of times on Reddit in the last couple of days.

2117
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:58,980
And so we thought we'd ask it here in the show.

2118
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:01,700
And I'd like to hear your stories to linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

2119
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:02,700
Please go.

2120
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:03,700
That's a great forum.

2121
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:06,420
I always enjoy those Linux desktop discussions.

2122
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:08,900
I could probably do it every single week.

2123
01:49:08,900 --> 01:49:10,980
I know you guys would get sick of it, so I don't.

2124
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:11,980
But I freaking love it.

2125
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:16,980
I just something about like having that conversation with the virtual lug and Wes is super satisfying

2126
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:17,980
for me.

2127
01:49:17,980 --> 01:49:18,980
You know what else is super satisfying?

2128
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:21,300
Seriously, saving a ton of money on my wireless.

2129
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:24,260
I can't even believe what people pay.

2130
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:25,260
Ting is brilliant.

2131
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:29,400
Linux.ting.com is where you go to get $25 in credit or off a device, and then you only

2132
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,580
pay for what you use with no contract.

2133
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:33,180
No termination fee.

2134
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:34,900
They don't block updates.

2135
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:38,260
They're just simply on a mission to make mobile make more sense.

2136
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:42,340
They're backed by two cows, so they've been around forever, and it's so great to just

2137
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:43,340
pay for what you use.

2138
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:46,500
If you got Wi-Fi at home and work, you're going to be shocked with how much money you

2139
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,500
can save.

2140
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:54,340
And for me, what I love about it is I have a Ting CDMA and a Ting GSM MiFi.

2141
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:58,700
When I travel, I use whichever one works better, and I just pay a little bit more that month

2142
01:49:58,700 --> 01:49:59,820
for my data usage.

2143
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:04,380
It's not a big deal because all of the other 10 or 11 months out of the year, I'm not

2144
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:08,240
traveling, and so it totally works out saving me tons of money.

2145
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:11,060
You can find out more by clicking on the Ting Savings Calculator.

2146
01:50:11,060 --> 01:50:14,620
One of the other things I really love about Ting, and with the holidays coming up, you're

2147
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:19,220
gifting cellular service, you get a $9 Ting GSM SIM, and you want to put it in the stocking.

2148
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:20,220
I'm serious.

2149
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:21,220
Why not?

2150
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:22,220
$9 SIM cards?

2151
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:26,020
Yeah, it's really, with no contract nor the termination fee, just pay for what you use.

2152
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:28,420
That's seriously awesome, but you're giving away to friends and family.

2153
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:29,540
You don't want to have to play tech support.

2154
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:30,860
Well, you don't have to worry about it.

2155
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,840
Ting has crazy great customer service.

2156
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:35,980
They have real human beings that sit on the phone and work with you.

2157
01:50:35,980 --> 01:50:36,980
Calling Ting.

2158
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:37,980
This is Isabelle speaking.

2159
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:38,980
How can I help you?

2160
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:39,980
Hello?

2161
01:50:39,980 --> 01:50:43,220
Thanks for calling Ting.

2162
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:45,220
This is Isabelle speaking.

2163
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:50,980
Hey, this is Isabelle at Ting.

2164
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:54,340
People never believe it's a real person, but it is, and I think that's really kind of a

2165
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:56,180
cool service that Ting offers.

2166
01:50:56,180 --> 01:51:00,380
They have great prices, unbelievably cheap devices, all the way up to the Cadillacs or

2167
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:01,380
just the SIM.

2168
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:06,100
You just get started by going to linux.ting.com, and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the

2169
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:11,180
Unplugged program now for the whole year, linux.ting.com.

2170
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:14,520
Now there's a big moment for me personally in Linux Unplugged this year.

2171
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:19,760
That's when I gave Wes a challenge to get Arch Linux working on my 2013 MacBook Pro

2172
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:21,980
Retina by the end of the show.

2173
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:27,260
I was super skeptical, because in the past, MacBooks have been such a headache.

2174
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:29,660
Well, Wes was up for that challenge.

2175
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:34,460
So the question is going to be coming in pretty soon, because rumors have it that your friends

2176
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:37,140
in Cupertino will be releasing a new MacBook soon.

2177
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:39,260
Hey, oh, it's been about time.

2178
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,820
Jeez, it is ridiculous.

2179
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:43,620
And you know what's going to happen.

2180
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:48,820
The current models, which are still perfectly usable, will go up on eBay, and people can

2181
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:51,460
buy them for a reduced price.

2182
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:54,420
And we have a pretty common question that comes into the show.

2183
01:51:54,420 --> 01:51:56,220
How do you install Linux on the MacBook?

2184
01:51:56,220 --> 01:51:57,220
Does it work?

2185
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:58,220
What should I know about?

2186
01:51:58,220 --> 01:52:01,020
And is it worth the amount of effort that might be required?

2187
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:02,540
Have you ever done this before?

2188
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:07,740
You know, I have, but it's been, oh boy, probably three years at least.

2189
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:08,740
So this week...

2190
01:52:08,740 --> 01:52:09,740
Actually, I was installing Debian.

2191
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:10,740
Really?

2192
01:52:10,740 --> 01:52:11,740
Yeah.

2193
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:12,740
Great.

2194
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:16,540
I'm going to see if by the end of the show, Wes can get Arch Linux, or maybe Fedora Linux,

2195
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:18,700
we'll see, running on a MacBook.

2196
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:21,500
It's like a late 2013 model, I think.

2197
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:24,300
And we'll kind of give you a report of what it's like to try it.

2198
01:52:24,300 --> 01:52:28,180
If he can get the dedicated graphics working, the wireless working, and we'll give you a

2199
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:29,180
review.

2200
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:31,540
So that way, some people out there, they just want that hardware.

2201
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:33,860
This is an old production rig that we have that's like, it's good.

2202
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:37,380
I'd like to see if you could leave macOS on there, because I think a lot of people are

2203
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:38,580
going to want to do that.

2204
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:42,180
Based on the emails we've received, people want to do a boot, and I can understand that.

2205
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:43,180
Yeah, absolutely.

2206
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:44,180
And if you want to do firmware updates...

2207
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:51,100
Wes, I officially am handing you this Linux-unplugged branded thumb drive, which contains the latest

2208
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:54,220
official released Antigros image from last month.

2209
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:55,220
Sure, it's signed with the JBSign.

2210
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:56,220
Oh, yeah.

2211
01:52:56,220 --> 01:52:57,220
Oh, yeah, I checked it for sure.

2212
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:58,220
Oh, yeah, for sure.

2213
01:52:58,220 --> 01:52:59,220
Absolutely.

2214
01:52:59,220 --> 01:53:00,220
So there you go, Wes.

2215
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:01,220
Good luck to you.

2216
01:53:01,220 --> 01:53:02,220
Oh, thank you, sir.

2217
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:03,220
There is a...

2218
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:04,460
It is already partitioned into two separate...

2219
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:09,420
Well, there's the OS X partition, because I've played with Linux on there before, is

2220
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:10,740
like already shrunk down.

2221
01:53:10,740 --> 01:53:11,860
And so there is like a...

2222
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:14,980
There's like right now, I just made it like fat or something for you that you can mess

2223
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:15,980
around with.

2224
01:53:15,980 --> 01:53:17,060
So there you go, Wes.

2225
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:20,340
The challenge is officially launched.

2226
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:26,420
I wanted to mention something that I think was well said, and it started a conversation

2227
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:29,500
that I think probably wasn't necessary.

2228
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:35,020
But I wanted to give a shout out to Ninja Aaron, who 23 hours ago created a Linux action

2229
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:38,820
show subreddit post saying a quick comment about the ButterFS coverage on the latest

2230
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:40,220
Linux action show.

2231
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:46,220
And that's where we discussed the fact that the official ButterFS project Twitter account

2232
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:48,740
recommended people use ZFS or ZFS.

2233
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:49,740
That's pretty wild.

2234
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:50,740
That was wild.

2235
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:53,180
And our story was really about the reaction to that.

2236
01:53:53,180 --> 01:53:54,860
But you know, he makes a great point.

2237
01:53:54,860 --> 01:54:00,940
He says that ButterFS is definitely having its issues, but he makes a couple of good

2238
01:54:00,940 --> 01:54:03,620
use case for ButterFS in this post.

2239
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:10,340
And I guess I did want to mention like, I'm not necessarily opposed to the idea of people

2240
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:14,940
that want to use ButterFS on their laptop that has an SSD drive.

2241
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:20,980
I don't really think ButterFS is like the devil file system.

2242
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:28,020
Really where I have an issue with the ButterFS advocacy, it really comes down to when people

2243
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:32,060
try to advocate that it should be used in a business slash enterprise setting, however

2244
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:36,220
you want to describe that.

2245
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:41,300
I started in IT in the year 2000, about 99.

2246
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:44,700
Well actually really, actually that's not true, 97 was when I actually officially got

2247
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:51,020
paid in IT when I was at that time desktop tech support.

2248
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:54,980
But one of the things that I had two – there was – I had two challenges over my career

2249
01:54:54,980 --> 01:55:00,540
that were very much about data retention and then I had many challenges beyond that.

2250
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:06,260
But there were some that were very particular legally mandated, very, very, very carefully

2251
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:10,980
audited use cases that I can't even really go into.

2252
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:16,900
And in these scenarios, you know, back then we used very, very cutting edge file systems

2253
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:22,620
that were very risky, mostly because that was all that was available at the time.

2254
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:27,860
And so it's not that I'm also like some holier than thou soapboxer who says, oh you should

2255
01:55:27,860 --> 01:55:29,700
never use ButterFS because you're a lunatic.

2256
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:33,300
I mean I've been the guy that's been putting in a file system that's a little edgy in

2257
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:34,300
production.

2258
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:35,660
I have on a lot of my systems.

2259
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:43,060
But there is sort of – I guess there is sort of this – it feels to me like there

2260
01:55:43,060 --> 01:55:47,540
is this failure to look within a bit to sort of self-analyze and say we've made a mistake

2261
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:48,540
here.

2262
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:51,900
And so I wanted to acknowledge that while I have been sort of anti-ButterFS in the last

2263
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:56,180
few weeks as there's been more flaws, I also think there's many useful use cases

2264
01:55:56,180 --> 01:56:01,820
for it and I wanted to give a shout out to Mr. Ninja Aaron for kind of very well stating

2265
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:06,860
that case and making me reflect on it a bit and go, you know, I myself if I – actually

2266
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:10,460
for this MacBook here, I would absolutely consider ButterFS on there.

2267
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:12,460
You should have said that like two minutes ago.

2268
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:16,860
You're getting the XT4 just because I figured you wouldn't mind if it was safe and solid.

2269
01:56:16,860 --> 01:56:17,860
I don't mind.

2270
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:18,860
So you're actually that far, huh?

2271
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:19,860
It's installing right now.

2272
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:22,500
So then in order for you to be that far, that means you've got wireless working.

2273
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:23,500
Oh yeah.

2274
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:24,500
Ah.

2275
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:27,780
Now that wireless fix, this is one of the interesting things, that wireless fix will

2276
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:31,580
not persist once you reboot into the main OS after it's been installed.

2277
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:35,940
No, but maybe I'll be smart enough to root into and install that preemptively.

2278
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:36,940
Thank you for the reminder.

2279
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:37,940
Damn it.

2280
01:56:37,940 --> 01:56:44,180
You know, Wes, I'm actually pretty impressed that you got the Wi-Fi working without any

2281
01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:45,640
other connectivity.

2282
01:56:45,640 --> 01:56:47,220
So what did you do?

2283
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:48,220
What did you do?

2284
01:56:48,220 --> 01:56:51,820
Because this is going to be – the number one challenge is these MacBooks, any recent

2285
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:55,700
MacBook doesn't have an Ethernet port and everybody that's going to be doing this

2286
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:58,020
is going to run into this problem where they're not going to have Wi-Fi when they get in a

2287
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:59,020
live environment.

2288
01:56:59,020 --> 01:57:01,980
What did you do to enable networking without having a connection?

2289
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:06,380
Well I had conveniently – we're installing Antigros here and I had an Arch Linux little

2290
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:07,660
laptop right here.

2291
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:14,580
So I just ran make package, built the package, copied it on a USB drive, installed it, mod

2292
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:17,820
probed the BroadCam drivers and away we went.

2293
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:18,820
Well played, sir.

2294
01:57:18,820 --> 01:57:19,820
Which I was very pleased.

2295
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:20,820
Everything worked perfectly.

2296
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:21,820
Well played.

2297
01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:22,820
Network manager picked it right up.

2298
01:57:22,820 --> 01:57:24,100
We were on the network.

2299
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:25,100
Damn.

2300
01:57:25,100 --> 01:57:28,020
And also I'm impressed that you remembered the Wi-Fi password too.

2301
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:31,220
Because I didn't tell you what that was and you still – good job.

2302
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:34,740
Anybody have thoughts on ButterFS in the mumble room before we move on to just a quick shout

2303
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:35,740
out I have?

2304
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:39,460
I'll just say I'm excited for BcashFS.

2305
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:42,420
We'll see when that's actually usable.

2306
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:46,020
Is that a B-tree kind of like RAM based?

2307
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:47,020
Yeah.

2308
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:48,020
I'd second that.

2309
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:49,020
Yeah.

2310
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:50,020
Okay.

2311
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:51,020
All right.

2312
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:52,020
Tease me a little bit.

2313
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:53,020
Let's see.

2314
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:54,020
There's actually a Patreon for it.

2315
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:55,020
Are you serious?

2316
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:56,020
Wimpy, why are you looking forward to it?

2317
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:57,020
Let's throw it right there.

2318
01:57:57,020 --> 01:57:58,020
Oh my god.

2319
01:57:58,020 --> 01:57:59,020
Okay.

2320
01:57:59,020 --> 01:58:00,020
Maybe that'll explain it better than I could probably.

2321
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:11,940
Bcash is something that I've used to accelerate spinning drives by putting a Bcash partition

2322
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:20,140
on solid state to effectively create sort of a level two cache.

2323
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:21,140
This is great.

2324
01:58:21,140 --> 01:58:26,100
And the authors behind Bcash realized that they were very close to actually having a

2325
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:28,380
full block file system.

2326
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:34,020
So they're going the next step to implement it as a copy on write file system.

2327
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:35,340
They only have 38 patrons.

2328
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:38,820
I feel like maybe we could bump that up a little bit for them.

2329
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:44,060
So it's going to be a copyright on write file system like ZFS or ButterFS.

2330
01:58:44,060 --> 01:58:45,300
They aim for good performance.

2331
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:49,300
They say significantly better than existing copy on write file systems comparable to the

2332
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:51,340
performance of Extended4 or XFS.

2333
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:52,340
Hello.

2334
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:53,340
We really need this.

2335
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:54,340
Oh wow.

2336
01:58:54,340 --> 01:58:59,660
Metadata and data checks on multiple devices including replication and other types of RAID,

2337
01:58:59,660 --> 01:59:03,620
caching, compression, encryption, snapshots, and scalable.

2338
01:59:03,620 --> 01:59:07,320
It's been tested up to 50 terabytes and will eventually scale higher.

2339
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:12,260
Already working on stable with a small community of users.

2340
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:14,700
This is super exciting.

2341
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:18,420
And what I really like about it is, and this is where I was trying to get to in the conversation

2342
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:23,100
on Sunday but I think I went off track, is ButterFS, when you look at the model, almost

2343
01:59:23,100 --> 01:59:29,340
seems like this funding model makes a lot of sense.

2344
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:34,380
It's just they would need way more support because it really is a full-time job.

2345
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:40,300
It is a lot of work to do this properly and this is great.

2346
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:44,700
So Bcash, I'll put a link to the Patreon in the show notes so that could be really cool.

2347
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:46,340
I'll check it out more after the show.

2348
01:59:46,340 --> 01:59:49,100
Okay Wes, I heard you rebooting during that spot.

2349
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:50,100
I heard you.

2350
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:52,100
How's it going over there?

2351
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:53,100
It's installed.

2352
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:55,100
Now we're working on getting it to show up in the bootloader.

2353
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:56,100
Do you have a preference?

2354
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:57,100
Do you want Refind?

2355
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:58,100
Do you not?

2356
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:59,100
I don't know.

2357
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:01,140
I don't know what's the difference.

2358
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:02,140
This is all new to me.

2359
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:05,580
I mean you can get it to work with the native EFI bootloader.

2360
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:06,580
That seems good.

2361
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:10,620
Okay, but you can also install Refind which is kind of just a nice, better bootloader.

2362
02:00:10,620 --> 02:00:15,020
What would make it easier to get the NVIDIA graphics working because that's part of this.

2363
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:16,020
That's a good question.

2364
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:19,260
Because I think that's like a kernel boot parameter because otherwise I think it uses

2365
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:21,860
the Intel graphics by default.

2366
02:00:21,860 --> 02:00:26,620
So I want to talk about why this is happening because this is some crazy bull crap.

2367
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:33,260
I mean actually I will be, in full disclosure, I will be honest with you.

2368
02:00:33,260 --> 02:00:38,220
The number one question we have ever gotten into the Linux Action Show and Linux Unplugged

2369
02:00:38,220 --> 02:00:44,700
and I am literally talking since episode one over a decade ago of Linux Action Show, the

2370
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:50,220
number one question we have gotten is how do I get Linux working on a Macbook?

2371
02:00:50,220 --> 02:00:55,500
And we answer it from time to time but we never really fully go into it and it's one

2372
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:59,860
of these things that we're simply sick and tired of getting the question asked and so

2373
02:00:59,860 --> 02:01:02,040
we just don't address it a lot.

2374
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:10,620
And I was, I've been using the Entraware Apollo as my daily driver at home pretty much since

2375
02:01:10,620 --> 02:01:13,780
my review and absolutely loving it.

2376
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:19,980
And it is light, the battery lasts for hours, it's small enough that I can carry it and

2377
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:23,260
just bring it to work when I need it and not have to worry about bringing the power adapter

2378
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:31,340
and it is a very nice machine and I have all my stickers all over it, I really enjoy it.

2379
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:38,220
But then No Man's Sky came out and that damn game, I can't help but love it and it requires

2380
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:46,260
OpenGL 4.5 support and SSE 4 I think and basically dedicated graphics and that's where the Macbook

2381
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:47,260
came in.

2382
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:51,980
And then I connected with, okay, so I sort of visualized myself as an audience member.

2383
02:01:51,980 --> 02:01:57,180
I've either bought a used Macbook, I've inherited a Macbook or I'm sick and tired of Mac OS

2384
02:01:57,180 --> 02:02:00,780
and Apple is not getting around to updating this thing.

2385
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:03,980
And one of the things that I know from previous testing experience is that Linux runs a hell

2386
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:06,460
of a lot faster on the Macbook than OS X does.

2387
02:02:06,460 --> 02:02:12,300
So the fact that this is a 2013 is going to feel, it's going to feel, I estimate under

2388
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:14,580
Linux it's probably going to feel like a brand new machine, like it's probably going to feel

2389
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:18,220
very fast, I mean it's got the PCI SSD in there, it's got dedicated 7.

2390
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:21,980
I thought about using F2FS or whatever.

2391
02:02:21,980 --> 02:02:28,820
It's got dedicated Nvidia graphics, it's got a wonderful retina screen on it, it's a pretty

2392
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:29,820
nice laptop.

2393
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:30,820
Yeah, it is a nice laptop.

2394
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:32,980
And people generally accept that the Macbook is built well.

2395
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:37,900
So the question has always been how reasonable would Linux be on the Macbook because my intention

2396
02:02:37,900 --> 02:02:42,380
is, and I know this sounds ridiculous, is to then install Wine and then install No Man's

2397
02:02:42,380 --> 02:02:43,380
Sky.

2398
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:48,260
But eventually I plan to also put OBS on there and do some broadcasting from it because it

2399
02:02:48,260 --> 02:02:49,780
does have a four core processor as well.

2400
02:02:49,780 --> 02:02:51,660
Oh sure, yeah, that would work well.

2401
02:02:51,660 --> 02:02:57,740
So that was sort of the impetus for myself to want to try Linux on the Macbook.

2402
02:02:57,740 --> 02:03:01,300
And then that sort of sent us down the path of trying to figure out, well what do you

2403
02:03:01,300 --> 02:03:02,940
need to know before you put Linux on a Macbook?

2404
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:06,460
And it definitely seems to be one of the things you have to get your head around is what model

2405
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:08,060
of Macbook do you have?

2406
02:03:08,060 --> 02:03:13,620
And this is somewhat not obvious since Apple just calls everything Macbook.

2407
02:03:13,620 --> 02:03:17,420
And if you have Mac OS on your system, you can actually entertain this by going into

2408
02:03:17,420 --> 02:03:18,420
the About Mac system.

2409
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:21,300
And I have a screenshot of this in the show notes.

2410
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:25,380
You go in there and it'll tell you it's a late model something something.

2411
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:31,500
You Google Macbook Pro late model 2013 and it will tell you the specific model number.

2412
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:34,020
It's 11 comma two or something like that, right Wes?

2413
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:35,180
Yes, I believe so.

2414
02:03:35,180 --> 02:03:38,020
Yeah, and there's like other ones, like older ones are like, you know, different.

2415
02:03:38,020 --> 02:03:42,140
So it's a major model number comma minor model revision.

2416
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:47,020
And you can find like arch wiki entries, which for mine I've linked in the show notes, that

2417
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:52,020
specifically tell you about the little kind of esoteric tweaks you have to make to make

2418
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:54,620
it work on your particular Macbook model.

2419
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:59,980
And as I look at this, I think this could be a really great Linux box if all of this

2420
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:01,180
works out.

2421
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:03,500
So I'm kind of really interested to see where it goes.

2422
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:07,840
I'll try the Thunderbolt out and then I can report back to the audience on some of my

2423
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:09,940
adventures with it.

2424
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:13,380
I also was kind of wondering, I was kind of wanting to pick Wimpy's brain and ask him

2425
02:04:13,380 --> 02:04:17,940
if he hears many people in the Ubuntu Mate community that are running it on the Macbooks.

2426
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:21,340
Because that also crossed my mind as a possible distro if we couldn't get Arch working.

2427
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:31,140
Yeah, it does crop up from time to time, mostly in discussions in the Ubuntu Mate community.

2428
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:35,580
And if it's something that you're interested in doing, then that is the place to first

2429
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:42,540
search because it's a discourse so you can find the right discussions easily.

2430
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:47,920
And if your model hasn't been discussed, then start a new thread and there are a few people

2431
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:52,100
in there that can assist you with that.

2432
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:55,220
It doesn't come up a lot.

2433
02:04:55,220 --> 02:04:58,140
It comes up a bit, but not loads.

2434
02:04:58,140 --> 02:05:03,700
It's certainly not a major platform I'm seeing people use Ubuntu Mate on.

2435
02:05:03,700 --> 02:05:04,700
Good.

2436
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:08,340
At this point, I don't know if I feel like recommending it, although maybe I'll feel

2437
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:10,140
differently after we try this.

2438
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:15,680
I do see it as like, a couple of things have changed recently.

2439
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:21,740
First of all, based on some of my reading, the roadblocks of getting the wireless working,

2440
02:05:21,740 --> 02:05:25,380
the Broadcom wireless, have been significantly reduced.

2441
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:30,340
But the big change, which is in the more recent kernels, been around for a little while now,

2442
02:05:30,340 --> 02:05:36,740
but it depends on your distro, there is built-in kernel-level support with the Synaptics driver

2443
02:05:36,740 --> 02:05:40,780
for the MacBook trackpad or whatever you want to call it.

2444
02:05:40,780 --> 02:05:44,380
And that was something that used to be a sticking point on my particular model.

2445
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:47,260
Have you had to do anything to get the trackpad working or has it been working?

2446
02:05:47,260 --> 02:05:48,820
No, it's just been working.

2447
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:53,060
It's not quite as nice as the default one, but I've got scrolling, I've been impressed

2448
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:57,340
with the media keys have working even in the live media.

2449
02:05:57,340 --> 02:05:58,340
What about the...

2450
02:05:58,340 --> 02:06:01,140
I can see the high DPI support in GNOME working nicely.

2451
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:02,140
Really?

2452
02:06:02,140 --> 02:06:06,020
You can see the tiny text on the console boot up and then once you've got to the login screen.

2453
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:07,020
Really?

2454
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:08,020
Did GNOME just automatically go high DPI mode?

2455
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:09,020
Yeah.

2456
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:10,020
No way.

2457
02:06:10,020 --> 02:06:11,020
Really?

2458
02:06:11,020 --> 02:06:12,020
Yeah.

2459
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:13,020
At least in the integration.

2460
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:16,820
Now, what about the keyboard backlight?

2461
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:17,820
That's a great question.

2462
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:18,820
Is that working?

2463
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:19,820
Can you turn that on?

2464
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:20,820
Oh, yeah.

2465
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:23,260
And it even has the scrollable GNOME menu.

2466
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:24,260
Shut up.

2467
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:25,260
Shut up.

2468
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:26,260
Really?

2469
02:06:26,260 --> 02:06:27,260
Yeah.

2470
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:28,260
Wow.

2471
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:29,260
That's actually pretty...

2472
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:30,260
Look at GNOME kicking ass on that thing.

2473
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:36,180
So are you in the live media right now or are you in the installed OS?

2474
02:06:36,180 --> 02:06:37,820
Well now I'm in the installed OS.

2475
02:06:37,820 --> 02:06:39,900
Actually I have to review how it actually got here.

2476
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:44,540
I was just kind of troubleshooting that, but I rebooted again and I expected it to go into

2477
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:48,260
Mac OS X, but it went right into yours.

2478
02:06:48,260 --> 02:06:51,140
This is really going to be nice to be able to play No Man's Sky at home if you get this

2479
02:06:51,140 --> 02:06:52,140
working with.

2480
02:06:52,140 --> 02:06:53,140
I'm pretty excited.

2481
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:54,140
All right.

2482
02:06:54,140 --> 02:06:55,140
So where are you at with that thing?

2483
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:56,140
I've got it booting.

2484
02:06:56,140 --> 02:07:02,820
I'm making sure the bootloader is actually working and getting the Wi-Fi back up.

2485
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:03,820
Nice.

2486
02:07:03,820 --> 02:07:04,820
All right.

2487
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:05,820
Let's go...

2488
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:06,820
We'll see about that.

2489
02:07:06,820 --> 02:07:07,820
Proprietary driver.

2490
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:08,820
JB titles.

2491
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:09,820
JB titles.

2492
02:07:09,820 --> 02:07:12,580
So this is a MacBook with an NVIDIA chip in it.

2493
02:07:12,580 --> 02:07:13,580
Yes.

2494
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:14,580
Yeah.

2495
02:07:14,580 --> 02:07:16,380
I think it's a 750, I think, or a 760.

2496
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:19,540
And is this a new computer or one that went around?

2497
02:07:19,540 --> 02:07:26,300
It's one that I used back in like before, I think even before I hired Rekai for editing.

2498
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:28,620
And then once Rekai came on board, he had...

2499
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:29,620
750M.

2500
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:30,620
Okay, 750M.

2501
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:34,980
He got the dedicated Mac and then this sort of became like every time I wanted to do a

2502
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:38,780
comprehensive video editing project, this was my machine I would go to and still do

2503
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:42,620
to some degree, but I've been transitioning to Cadian Live more and more.

2504
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:47,080
So I've had this sitting around and it's a late 2013 model that...

2505
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:50,860
And I actually think with an old MacBook, you have a better success rate with a slightly

2506
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:54,220
older model, which is kind of bears out why I think you'll probably see more of these

2507
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:58,140
showing up on eBay when the new model comes out because it's literally been too long.

2508
02:07:58,140 --> 02:07:59,380
And so they'll probably...

2509
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:04,140
People throw their old models on eBay and you might have Linux users who want a particular

2510
02:08:04,140 --> 02:08:08,940
build quality of a machine grabbing these and snapping these up perhaps.

2511
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:12,020
So this is a Pro 15 or some description, is it?

2512
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:13,020
Yes.

2513
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:14,020
Yeah.

2514
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:22,820
It's a late 2013 MacBook Retina 15-inch with the 750M and the one terabyte SSD, PCI SSD

2515
02:08:22,820 --> 02:08:26,220
and 16 gigabytes of RAM.

2516
02:08:26,220 --> 02:08:28,300
And Wes, did you decide on a bootloader?

2517
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:32,460
Well, right now it's just using the built-in EFI.

2518
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:34,920
So like when you hold down the option key or whatever it is?

2519
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:36,460
That's what I'm working on confirming for you.

2520
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:37,460
Interesting.

2521
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:41,820
But we might just install Refind anyway because it's awesome.

2522
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:47,660
It would be interesting to compare battery life between the systems, you know, TLP installed

2523
02:08:47,660 --> 02:08:48,660
and all that.

2524
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:54,300
It would really interest me because they say Linux is not well optimized for these kind

2525
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:55,300
of computers.

2526
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:58,820
Well, to be fair, the cards are definitely stacked against Linux.

2527
02:08:58,820 --> 02:09:05,180
However, I was reading the Arch Wiki and it appears that LM Sensors now has some support.

2528
02:09:05,180 --> 02:09:10,700
But see, honestly, the core issue why I've never really been super compelled to do this

2529
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:12,720
is the way Macs are built.

2530
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:18,140
They are Intel machines, absolutely, but they use a completely different power management

2531
02:09:18,140 --> 02:09:22,540
and cooling management architecture than a standard desktop PC.

2532
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:26,740
And honestly, if I were Apple, I would too because ACPI and all of that is just total

2533
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:27,740
shit.

2534
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:30,340
So what Apple did is they created the SMC controller.

2535
02:09:30,340 --> 02:09:35,500
And the SMC controller is both hardware and software and the software component is only

2536
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:37,920
available in Mac OS X.

2537
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:41,900
There's no open source equivalent to it because Apple holds all of the information.

2538
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:48,620
And the SMC controller is used by Mac OS X to escalate the fans with CPU usage.

2539
02:09:48,620 --> 02:09:55,260
So the OS is constantly monitoring the demands and predicted demands, the predicted demands

2540
02:09:55,260 --> 02:10:00,600
if you can even believe that, of the OS workload based on your average workload and it preemptively

2541
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:06,060
throttles the thermal management of the Mac based on whatever metrics that Apple has come

2542
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:07,700
up with with their black magic.

2543
02:10:07,700 --> 02:10:11,860
And there's just literally no way to translate that to Linux or Windows.

2544
02:10:11,860 --> 02:10:15,820
It's the same problem for boot camp users who decide to run Windows 7 to 10 on their

2545
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:17,800
Mac hardware.

2546
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:19,740
They have the same exact issue.

2547
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:24,980
And in the past, what I had done is I got a program called SMC control.

2548
02:10:24,980 --> 02:10:27,720
And SMC control is a Mac OS program.

2549
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:33,700
What you do is you can use SMC control to hard set your fans to a certain RPM.

2550
02:10:33,700 --> 02:10:38,080
So that way at least there's some thermal cooling because otherwise what happens is

2551
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:44,780
without the SMC controller kicking in via software ignition, then the thermal limits

2552
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:47,540
of the actual hardware are what dictate the fan usage.

2553
02:10:47,540 --> 02:10:48,540
Yeah, it's not what you want.

2554
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:49,540
No.

2555
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:53,180
So when you actually get to the full thermal limits of the Intel i7 processor, that's when

2556
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:54,240
the fans cool.

2557
02:10:54,240 --> 02:10:58,020
When you get to the thermal limits of the GPU, that's when the fans kick on.

2558
02:10:58,020 --> 02:11:04,860
So by using SMC controller in Mac OS X, I could set the fans at a steady 5500 RPM or

2559
02:11:04,860 --> 02:11:09,140
4000 RPM depending on my workload and then restart in the Linux.

2560
02:11:09,140 --> 02:11:13,300
If you shut down, then the SMC controller reset.

2561
02:11:13,300 --> 02:11:17,620
And so if I booted from a cold boot right into Linux, I have no fan control.

2562
02:11:17,620 --> 02:11:22,560
But if I would first boot into Mac OS and then use SMC control, which is a third-party

2563
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:26,580
utility that only supports most Macs, and then use that to set the fan and then reboot

2564
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:30,100
from that into Linux, I could have proper thermal management.

2565
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:33,980
So one of the things that appears to have changed since I had to do that rigamarole

2566
02:11:33,980 --> 02:11:40,860
was LM Sensors appears to have some capacity to control the thermals on the MacBook now.

2567
02:11:40,860 --> 02:11:46,060
And so that could make a significant difference in battery life and it's absolutely an area

2568
02:11:46,060 --> 02:11:50,060
I'm going to test versus Mac OS, whatever the current release is.

2569
02:11:50,060 --> 02:12:00,900
I was just looking on eBay in the UK at that spec and they still sell used for around £1,200

2570
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:01,900
which is about $1,500.

2571
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:02,900
Isn't it amazing?

2572
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:08,260
See, I think Apple has always managed to have super good resell because they only at best

2573
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:10,420
release a model a year it seems.

2574
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:22,420
So by their apparent nonchalant attitude towards their Mac hardware customers, they have created

2575
02:12:22,420 --> 02:12:29,460
a very robust aftermarket value for the MacBook.

2576
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:33,540
But every time a new one comes out, everything shifts down a bracket.

2577
02:12:33,540 --> 02:12:38,540
So I believe this MacBook will probably shift down to about $800 once the new MacBook comes

2578
02:12:38,540 --> 02:12:40,060
out in September.

2579
02:12:40,060 --> 02:12:42,300
And this, a Core i7...

2580
02:12:42,300 --> 02:12:45,980
So is that still a current model even though it's been around for a few years?

2581
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:46,980
No, no, no, no.

2582
02:12:46,980 --> 02:12:51,780
But because the current model will shift down a price range and because this is a model

2583
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:56,700
or two below the current model, this is going to come down significantly to about $800.

2584
02:12:56,700 --> 02:12:57,700
That's my estimation.

2585
02:12:57,700 --> 02:13:00,640
I could be totally wrong but that seems to be the history is because this is like two

2586
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:06,300
models or three models behind, this is going to be the real bottom basement, like still

2587
02:13:06,300 --> 02:13:13,180
get an i7, still get Thunderbolt, still get Retina, still get PCIe storage, but under

2588
02:13:13,180 --> 02:13:14,180
$1,000 easily.

2589
02:13:14,180 --> 02:13:17,220
I believe that will be the price of this machine.

2590
02:13:17,220 --> 02:13:21,260
And at that price range, it almost becomes reasonable to experiment with Linux on it

2591
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:22,980
and just see, well, what the hell?

2592
02:13:22,980 --> 02:13:28,500
Because it's a $600 to $800 MacBook depending on spec and at the end of the day, if it doesn't

2593
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:31,140
work, I could just do Mac OS X with Linux and VMware.

2594
02:13:31,140 --> 02:13:33,860
And so I think you're going to have a lot of Linux users that will pick this thing up

2595
02:13:33,860 --> 02:13:38,660
because the cult of hardware worship around the MacBook, they'll pick this thing up, they'll

2596
02:13:38,660 --> 02:13:39,660
try putting Linux on it.

2597
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:42,900
And so I was like, this is probably something that I'm going to get a whole new wave of

2598
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:43,900
V-mails about.

2599
02:13:43,900 --> 02:13:47,020
I'm kind of preemptively guessing that.

2600
02:13:47,020 --> 02:13:48,540
I'm still rocking Arch on the MacBook.

2601
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:52,380
I'm dual booting Final Cut OS and Arch and I'm keeping it up to date every single week.

2602
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:53,580
I love it.

2603
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:58,100
Now let's stop right here and reflect on the fact that Vim's birthday gave a moment for

2604
02:13:58,100 --> 02:14:01,340
us nano users to unite.

2605
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:05,580
Let's celebrate a very important birthday that almost just passed us right by.

2606
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:06,580
I know, right?

2607
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:12,260
But we did manage to catch it and it's something that we all can relate to.

2608
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:18,300
It's at a milestone, the 25th birthday where Vim's car insurance finally goes down in price.

2609
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:20,540
Happy, happy birthday to Vim.

2610
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:23,540
This is a rowdy crowd.

2611
02:14:23,540 --> 02:14:26,340
Come on, guys.

2612
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:27,340
You're in my house.

2613
02:14:27,340 --> 02:14:28,340
Hold on.

2614
02:14:28,340 --> 02:14:29,340
That's right.

2615
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:34,220
Over 25 years ago, over 25 years ago it was started.

2616
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:39,220
You see, the problem was is that Bram, he wanted something like Vim for his Amiga.

2617
02:14:39,220 --> 02:14:41,060
He was a big user of VI.

2618
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:42,060
I'm sorry, I should say VI.

2619
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:45,220
He wanted something like VI but they didn't have anything like that on the Amiga.

2620
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:53,740
So in 1991, on November 2nd, he released the first version of VI, Imitation Edition, after

2621
02:14:53,740 --> 02:14:57,340
three years of working on it, the VI Imitation Edition.

2622
02:14:57,340 --> 02:15:02,700
Two years later, with the version 2.0, so the first version took three years, second

2623
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:08,120
version took two years, two years later, with version 2.0 of Vim, the feature set had exceeded

2624
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:12,500
that of the original VI or VI.

2625
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:19,420
And so they changed the acronym from Vim Imitation to Vim Improved.

2626
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:20,860
Isn't that great?

2627
02:15:20,860 --> 02:15:22,080
That is really cool.

2628
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:23,500
That is really cool.

2629
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:27,500
That is, you know, that is a big milestone, 25th birthday.

2630
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:30,820
And indispensable to, I mean, think about where it's gone and how widely it's deployed

2631
02:15:30,820 --> 02:15:31,820
today.

2632
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:32,820
Thank God we have Nano.

2633
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:33,820
I mean, what?

2634
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:34,820
No.

2635
02:15:34,820 --> 02:15:35,820
Come on.

2636
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:36,820
And they still don't know how semantic versioning works.

2637
02:15:36,820 --> 02:15:43,380
I used Nano once in a video recently and I've been getting crap about it for two weeks.

2638
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:44,860
Chris, you used Nano?

2639
02:15:44,860 --> 02:15:47,340
You just got to say it's for the new Linux users.

2640
02:15:47,340 --> 02:15:48,340
You know, you're trying to be friendly.

2641
02:15:48,340 --> 02:15:49,340
What are you doing?

2642
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:50,340
What are you doing?

2643
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:53,780
That's where they, I thought you would use VI or Emacs.

2644
02:15:53,780 --> 02:15:57,780
Why are you using Nano?

2645
02:15:57,780 --> 02:15:58,780
I think it's nice.

2646
02:15:58,780 --> 02:15:59,780
What are you doing, man?

2647
02:15:59,780 --> 02:16:00,780
Nano-W, Nano-TACW forever.

2648
02:16:00,780 --> 02:16:01,780
I don't even know what TACW does.

2649
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:02,780
Enlighten us.

2650
02:16:02,780 --> 02:16:03,780
Oh, man.

2651
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:12,780
It just supports wide characters without cutting it off.

2652
02:16:12,780 --> 02:16:16,580
So it's like when you've got config files, that's all it does.

2653
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:22,540
But you know, I just, I actually, if I'm editing the file, I don't know what this is.

2654
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:25,900
If I'm editing the file, I tend to use Vim because I got like my colors and all that

2655
02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:26,900
kind of stuff.

2656
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:32,420
But if I'm viewing a file and I don't want to use cat or more or whatever, like if I

2657
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:37,320
don't want to just like look at the file, I just want to just like for some reason open

2658
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:39,020
it up but not edit it.

2659
02:16:39,020 --> 02:16:42,220
Like when I'm going to look at a file and I'm going to dig around, but I'm not going

2660
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:45,500
to use pseudo, I use Nano for some reason.

2661
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:50,700
And then when I'm going to edit the file with root privileges, I pseudo, VI, then the file.

2662
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:51,700
Okay.

2663
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:52,700
Isn't that weird?

2664
02:16:52,700 --> 02:16:53,700
That is weird.

2665
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:55,100
But I mean, I can see, you know, if it's just something you've learned in your fingers now

2666
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:56,460
and you just type it, right?

2667
02:16:56,460 --> 02:17:00,780
It's like the one is my viewing editor and one is my editing editor.

2668
02:17:00,780 --> 02:17:03,500
Not sure viewing editor is a consistent idea.

2669
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:06,180
It's so dumb because I do every now and then when I'm already in there, Nano-W, I'll just

2670
02:17:06,180 --> 02:17:07,180
change that real quick.

2671
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:08,180
Right.

2672
02:17:08,180 --> 02:17:11,740
And then it's like, I go to save and it's like, you don't have the privilege because

2673
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:12,740
you're in pseudo.

2674
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:15,220
And you don't have that Vim trick of using pseudo-T to get out of it, right?

2675
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:17,460
It's so stupid.

2676
02:17:17,460 --> 02:17:18,460
But it's habit.

2677
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:23,220
It's habit from a decade ago when I was revolting and I wanted to find a new text editor.

2678
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:30,220
And I had this boss who was the only other Unix slash Linux guy in the office with me

2679
02:17:30,220 --> 02:17:33,180
and we would prank each other constantly.

2680
02:17:33,180 --> 02:17:38,500
And so I remember like I had replaced Vim like when he would use VI, it would echo like

2681
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:40,020
Bruce Stinks or something like that on there.

2682
02:17:40,020 --> 02:17:41,740
Bruce is a monkey on the...

2683
02:17:41,740 --> 02:17:46,220
And we did things like we'd set up cron jobs to send system-wide messages on the hour so

2684
02:17:46,220 --> 02:17:49,140
every user logged into the system would see Bruce smells like a monkey and things like

2685
02:17:49,140 --> 02:17:50,140
that.

2686
02:17:50,140 --> 02:17:51,140
We'd mess around with each other.

2687
02:17:51,140 --> 02:17:54,780
And I remember Nano was sort of the prank we would use.

2688
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:58,060
We'd set up an alias just so things would launch in Nano or whatever.

2689
02:17:58,060 --> 02:17:59,060
There was all these...

2690
02:17:59,060 --> 02:18:02,620
So I think that's where it started and then it just sort of became...

2691
02:18:02,620 --> 02:18:03,620
Because I got pranked.

2692
02:18:03,620 --> 02:18:04,620
I think I just stuck with it.

2693
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:05,620
And he's just like, well, I'm not gonna let this...

2694
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:06,620
Screw this.

2695
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:07,620
I'm not gonna let this defeat me.

2696
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:08,620
I will use this editor.

2697
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:09,620
Yeah.

2698
02:18:09,620 --> 02:18:10,620
That's exactly...

2699
02:18:10,620 --> 02:18:11,620
And it is a file editor.

2700
02:18:11,620 --> 02:18:15,060
So here I am years later and I'm getting crap from the internet and it's like, okay, you

2701
02:18:15,060 --> 02:18:16,060
guys don't understand.

2702
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:19,220
That's how a lot of stories end.

2703
02:18:19,220 --> 02:18:26,620
So I just pasted you a command you can run which shows the most popular 10 commands in

2704
02:18:26,620 --> 02:18:27,620
your Bash history.

2705
02:18:27,620 --> 02:18:28,620
That's awesome.

2706
02:18:28,620 --> 02:18:29,620
Oh, that's a great one.

2707
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:37,580
And for me, the top five, number one is LS by a factor of two above the next thing I've

2708
02:18:37,580 --> 02:18:39,380
ever run, which is CD.

2709
02:18:39,380 --> 02:18:44,420
Right, so LS and CD and then pseudo, which is not unreasonable on Ubuntu where you don't

2710
02:18:44,420 --> 02:18:45,700
get root account by default.

2711
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:46,700
Yeah.

2712
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:49,740
And then the next one is my editor of choice, which I'm not gonna name because I'll just

2713
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:50,740
get hate.

2714
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:53,220
And then there's other stuff after that.

2715
02:18:53,220 --> 02:18:57,340
But yeah, LS and CD and pseudo, they seem like reasonable things to have at the top

2716
02:18:57,340 --> 02:18:58,340
of your list.

2717
02:18:58,340 --> 02:19:02,140
So I think you should say, and we can debunk a myth here.

2718
02:19:02,140 --> 02:19:05,660
Well, I'll go first.

2719
02:19:05,660 --> 02:19:07,460
My favorite editor is Nano.

2720
02:19:07,460 --> 02:19:14,420
Were you here earlier in the show where I admitted to getting crap for the last two

2721
02:19:14,420 --> 02:19:16,020
weeks because I use Nano?

2722
02:19:16,020 --> 02:19:23,180
I heard you mention it and I wasn't here to back you up, but I've been using Nano forever.

2723
02:19:23,180 --> 02:19:31,140
This is mostly because the first Unix system I used, Pine was the email client and consequently

2724
02:19:31,140 --> 02:19:35,140
Pico was the editor.

2725
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:37,180
Nano is a Pico clone.

2726
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:43,260
So hard coded into my DNA is all the key bindings for Nano.

2727
02:19:43,260 --> 02:19:48,220
I knew there was a reason I liked you, Martin, that must be it.

2728
02:19:48,220 --> 02:19:52,580
All these people that say that Vim and Vi are so powerful and there's all these key

2729
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:53,580
bindings.

2730
02:19:53,580 --> 02:19:56,420
Well, there's all these key bindings in Nano as well.

2731
02:19:56,420 --> 02:20:00,340
And if you know them, it's just as fast and productive.

2732
02:20:00,340 --> 02:20:01,340
I love you.

2733
02:20:01,340 --> 02:20:02,340
That is amazing.

2734
02:20:02,340 --> 02:20:05,500
I forgot about Pico and that absolutely, and Pine, yes.

2735
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:06,500
Yes.

2736
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:08,940
So is it Nano for you too, Popey, that I take it?

2737
02:20:08,940 --> 02:20:09,940
Yep.

2738
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:10,940
All right.

2739
02:20:10,940 --> 02:20:13,300
Now, JDA, I think I saw that go by.

2740
02:20:13,300 --> 02:20:14,700
You also use Nano.

2741
02:20:14,700 --> 02:20:21,860
Yes, I also use Nano and I'll say as a visually impaired Linux user, yeah, I'm low.

2742
02:20:21,860 --> 02:20:28,460
So it's a lot more user friendly when you're zoomed in to a pretty high degree on a monitor

2743
02:20:28,460 --> 02:20:33,920
than the alternatives out there and just as someone who's tried all the different ones

2744
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:39,180
and accessibility standpoint, Nano takes the cake and I just wanted to throw my two cents

2745
02:20:39,180 --> 02:20:40,180
in there.

2746
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:42,420
I can't believe we started this show out with me admitting to all the crap I was getting

2747
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:44,860
and Ben, you use Nano as well?

2748
02:20:44,860 --> 02:20:45,860
Yeah, man.

2749
02:20:45,860 --> 02:20:46,860
Look at you.

2750
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:47,860
Nobody stood up.

2751
02:20:47,860 --> 02:20:48,860
Nobody said anything.

2752
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:49,860
Yes.

2753
02:20:49,860 --> 02:20:50,860
Club Nano.

2754
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:51,860
There we go.

2755
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:52,860
A wrong has been righted.

2756
02:20:52,860 --> 02:20:53,860
Wait a minute.

2757
02:20:53,860 --> 02:20:55,460
You see guys, I am visually impaired too.

2758
02:20:55,460 --> 02:20:59,760
I have to wear glasses because I have a stigmatism and light problem and truthfully, I just got

2759
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:04,940
to use Nano because of my sight and because, you know, I also have autism, so it's kind

2760
02:21:04,940 --> 02:21:07,380
of hard for me to wrap my head around other areas.

2761
02:21:07,380 --> 02:21:08,380
So yeah.

2762
02:21:08,380 --> 02:21:09,380
You don't have to justify it.

2763
02:21:09,380 --> 02:21:10,380
Just embrace it.

2764
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:11,380
That's right.

2765
02:21:11,380 --> 02:21:12,380
I love the Nano.

2766
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:13,380
It's fine.

2767
02:21:13,380 --> 02:21:16,140
Here's some funny follow up from that Nano users unite episode.

2768
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:21,700
Since episode 170 weeks ago, I'm still getting emails and trickle tweets about other Nano

2769
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:24,600
users who are coming out and their love for Nano.

2770
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:28,820
We truly have united, which is, I don't know what that is.

2771
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:29,820
It's funny.

2772
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:30,820
If nothing else, I guess.

2773
02:21:30,820 --> 02:21:31,820
I don't know.

2774
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:32,820
I don't.

2775
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:36,500
It's like I'm not sure we need to now we need to support some sort.

2776
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:40,100
We need to form like some sort of support group, I guess, right?

2777
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:41,100
I will.

2778
02:21:41,100 --> 02:21:42,100
That brings us to the end.

2779
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:47,500
I hope this wasn't your first experience for the unplugged program because this is not

2780
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:49,140
how this show normally goes.

2781
02:21:49,140 --> 02:21:52,700
I don't normally have a fireplace behind me.

2782
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:54,500
If you're listening, I have a fireplace behind me.

2783
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:58,060
I don't normally have presence in the studio.

2784
02:21:58,060 --> 02:22:00,020
We don't normally play clips of our own show.

2785
02:22:00,020 --> 02:22:02,620
It's not really how this show actually coming.

2786
02:22:02,620 --> 02:22:05,540
If this is your first time watching, this might have been the perfect episode because

2787
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:08,260
you now kind of get an idea feel for what we talk about.

2788
02:22:08,260 --> 02:22:11,180
You can submit contact Linux action show at reddit.com and shared subreddit with Linux

2789
02:22:11,180 --> 02:22:12,180
action show.

2790
02:22:12,180 --> 02:22:15,540
You can go to jupyterbroadcasting.com contact and found out and find out when we're live

2791
02:22:15,540 --> 02:22:16,540
at the calendar page.

2792
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:17,820
Thanks for being here.

2793
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:41,900
See you next week and happy holidays.
