WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
I think all right, but that's not what I want to discuss in the pre-show

00:03.240 --> 00:09.420
You know what I want to talk about in the pre-show is this might just make fedora work for me. You ready for this one?

00:09.960 --> 00:15.480
York in fedora, you know that is the art user repository management tool

00:15.480 --> 00:20.600
What yeah, yeah, yeah, so basically the art user repository in fedora

00:20.960 --> 00:25.440
This is okay. That is like it right there. You think so you think this could be it I?

00:25.440 --> 00:31.400
I think that would be sweet. Yeah, so yet another repository tool is what your it stands for

00:31.400 --> 00:37.480
It's a wrapper for pac-man which adds automated access to the a you are you word has the same syntax as pac-man and for now

00:37.480 --> 00:41.600
And now fedora you just couldn't use your to install a you are packages in fedora

00:42.600 --> 00:46.280
This is no joke. I wonder if anybody that in the chat room has tried this

00:46.280 --> 00:50.520
This is amazing because fedora 22 is really solid, but at the time I tried it

00:50.520 --> 00:55.720
I was having a hard time getting a couple of apps. I needed her upad mumble and telegram. Yeah, definitely right

00:55.720 --> 00:59.880
That's why that's one reason. I never really used it because I couldn't get the apps for it. Yeah, in fact

00:59.880 --> 01:01.880
I think I just read somewhere that

01:03.320 --> 01:06.500
What was it? I think they said that essentially that I can't remember where I just saw this

01:06.500 --> 01:11.800
But there were fedora repositories have essentially kind of stopped growing in terms of software and this could really help that

01:11.800 --> 01:15.480
I mean the a you are in in in fedora would be really I don't know how well it could possibly work

01:15.480 --> 01:22.160
Yeah, so does it make me that actually I'm or dnf. I guess now I would think it downloads the tar. GZ stuff and builds it

01:22.160 --> 01:26.660
Right you're just building it. So it's almost like our own version of ports from freebsd. Yeah, kind of like the a you are is really

01:26.660 --> 01:32.260
It's yeah, it could be crazy everybody out there. Try gotta if you try it out there a dear listener. Let us know

01:32.760 --> 01:35.180
Maybe I'll try it. Yeah, I might try to put in a VM

01:35.480 --> 01:37.520
Well in fedora is so easy to recommend, you know

01:37.520 --> 01:42.560
Especially people with Macs or other things where you just get a nice setup environment. Yeah, but you don't have all the packages you need

01:42.560 --> 01:49.240
Yeah, yeah, that is always the killer. Mm-hmm. This is Linux unplugged episode 103 for July 28th

01:50.160 --> 01:52.160
2015

02:02.520 --> 02:06.160
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly talk show that surrounded the 100 mark

02:06.160 --> 02:10.840
My name is Chris and we have a great show and I'm happy to say that Wes is in studio. Hey Wes. Hey Chris

02:10.840 --> 02:16.400
Hey, how's it going buddy? Oh, it's going great. How about yourself? Thank you for making it right after the big move to Seattle

02:16.400 --> 02:19.800
That's pretty cool. Oh, I'm happy to be here. So are you good? Are you exhausted?

02:19.800 --> 02:24.600
I mean, come on be honest. This is my recovery session got a nice beer hanging out with the fine folks in the room

02:24.600 --> 02:26.680
What could be better? Well, we got a great episode today

02:26.680 --> 02:31.440
so we're gonna do a couple of updates on some stories that are relevant in the community of the Linux unplugged show and

02:31.840 --> 02:34.720
kick those around with our virtual lug and then after that I

02:34.720 --> 02:41.280
Have some really awesome clips from OSCON. I went down there armed with a portable audio recorder

02:41.600 --> 02:48.640
Just to record interviews exclusively for the unplugged show and it turns out going down there with this tiny little recorder as opposed to a big

02:48.760 --> 02:51.960
Camera you get a lot more intimate personal interviews with folks

02:51.960 --> 02:56.900
And so we've got some really good chats coming up in today's episode of Linux unplugged from OSCON

02:57.160 --> 03:00.540
2015 can't wait to play those for you and then later in the show

03:00.540 --> 03:06.420
radio is about to be over overtaken by an open source gunk works project right here in our community and

03:06.500 --> 03:12.060
The very creator of that project joins us in the mumble room today to give us a little insights on his plans to overthrow

03:12.380 --> 03:16.580
The proprietary hold on radio broadcasts. It's a big deal

03:16.580 --> 03:22.060
We're gonna talk to him today and maybe maybe just maybe you might see it worked into a future Jupiter broadcasting initiative

03:22.340 --> 03:24.460
And then if we have enough time at the end of the show

03:24.460 --> 03:26.460
I got a few things I want to reminisce about

03:26.460 --> 03:30.700
Where we were just doing the back of the napkin math in the pre-show and we were like wow

03:30.700 --> 03:33.820
we are in the 10th year of the Linux action show unbelievable and

03:34.860 --> 03:38.740
Anytime you've been doing something for 10 years you get a little bit of an itch. Sorry, honey

03:38.740 --> 03:42.180
I'm not talking about you. No, no, no, baby, baby. I love you. I'm not talking about you, baby

03:42.340 --> 03:47.540
But I'm talking about the show sweetie. God what you see that look I'm getting West. That's I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble

03:49.620 --> 03:53.380
Anyways, we're thinking about making some changes to the show and if we have time later, I'll talk about that

03:53.380 --> 03:57.500
If not, maybe we'll just cover it in a future episode, but why don't we start our buddy?

03:57.500 --> 04:01.280
Wimpy who sometimes joins us from time to time is the guy behind the Ubuntu Mate

04:01.820 --> 04:03.580
Matai mate

04:03.580 --> 04:05.580
like the drink and

04:05.740 --> 04:10.740
He made a lot of news this week and I'm just curious. I wanted to kick it around with you guys

04:10.740 --> 04:12.540
Do you guys think this is a really huge deal or not?

04:12.540 --> 04:19.820
I was and why did this get so much traction when when wimpy announces that the Ubuntu Mate version of 1510 will not ship

04:19.820 --> 04:21.820
With the Ubuntu software center. It has been

04:21.820 --> 04:24.300
Removed is it just me or

04:25.420 --> 04:29.180
Were you surprised? I mean West I'll throw it to you first and we'll throw it to the mumble room

04:29.180 --> 04:31.760
We haven't brought them in yet. I should do that time appropriate greetings mumble room

04:35.820 --> 04:37.420
So I'm gonna ask you in a second

04:37.420 --> 04:41.260
But I'll throw it to West first West does it make sense to you to pull out the software center and why do you think?

04:41.260 --> 04:46.520
This made so much news when wimpy announced I I've seen it covered on pretty much every Linux news outlet

04:46.520 --> 04:51.000
It was the top of the our Linux subreddit. I was in the Ubuntu subreddit

04:51.000 --> 04:55.100
It was the number one voted story in our subreddit this weekend. What do you think why?

04:55.100 --> 05:01.940
I mean, I do think that you know being a being a spin of Ubuntu itself, you know the Mate edition people do

05:02.300 --> 05:06.860
You know, they kind of assume there'll be a certain underlying familiarity in the architecture the infrastructure

05:06.860 --> 05:10.580
Yeah, the underpinnings of what you've come to know and love about Ubuntu. Yes, exactly

05:10.580 --> 05:13.180
Well, many of us may not use the software center

05:13.180 --> 05:18.120
I could see how people who are more into the Ubuntu community in general. Yeah, here's my question to you

05:18.120 --> 05:21.260
It seems like if I if if I'm a new user

05:21.580 --> 05:24.000
So when we when we had chase switch to Linux

05:24.300 --> 05:29.660
The first thing he did is anytime you wanted anything from Steam to Chrome. He went to the software center

05:29.660 --> 05:35.740
That's just kind of like their expectation now. And so if there's nothing there, let me ask you this if there's nothing there

05:35.740 --> 05:42.300
Is that better than having something that's not very good in fact rotten? Do you want to start all I can toss this to you

05:42.300 --> 05:48.500
Rotten corpse. Do you think having nothing there is better than having something? That's awful. Yes

05:49.140 --> 05:52.140
But that's not what a bunch of money is doing

05:52.900 --> 05:56.120
so that's not even that's not even at all on the

05:56.500 --> 06:01.760
Like in the page right now because they're replacing it. They're not removing it. Yeah. Well, don't go there

06:01.760 --> 06:04.340
Yeah, cuz I want to get there but just yeah, we'll talk about that in a second

06:04.340 --> 06:10.580
But I mean, but yeah, if because the Ubuntu software center is atrocious. Yeah, it should be removed by Ubuntu

06:10.580 --> 06:15.900
Then yeah, it is a bad thing because when someone's using something and it takes, you know

06:16.220 --> 06:23.020
It take the the software center to get new software takes longer to open than to install the software

06:23.740 --> 06:30.700
That's a bit problem. So you think they'll run honestly, I mean, I mean bashing the software center aside, honestly

06:30.700 --> 06:32.700
Is it better to have nothing at all?

06:33.060 --> 06:35.460
than to have so the reason I'm asking is

06:35.460 --> 06:41.260
This aside from what the Ubuntu Mate project is doing is it maybe just better to just remove it than have nothing at all

06:41.260 --> 06:45.220
So Chase's experience when he went to install steam he got two different entries for steam

06:45.220 --> 06:50.220
He was then prompted to create a canonical account and then he had to try to give it his address and his payment information

06:50.460 --> 06:56.820
To canonical to download the free steam installer and he was completely lost and and it just stopped him dead in his tracks

06:56.820 --> 07:02.680
And he had to come to me and say what should I do? So rotten? Do you think is it better before there's a replacement to pull it?

07:02.680 --> 07:05.040
Yeah, I'm for that particular

07:05.600 --> 07:08.400
software center, yeah, it is by far the worst and

07:09.080 --> 07:12.360
It there are so many bugs with it that it's that that they have I mean

07:12.360 --> 07:17.400
They've they've made one update in two years and they're fully and canonicals fully aware that it's awful

07:17.400 --> 07:25.000
So yeah, they should remove it because people who are coming to Linux without having any connection to it. What's before whatsoever?

07:25.400 --> 07:27.400
They're gonna be googling stuff anyway

07:27.400 --> 07:33.080
So all they're going to do is see the first example of a software center. That is awful. Mm-hmm

07:33.080 --> 07:36.440
Especially if it we've been conditioned with you know, nicer Mac stores

07:36.440 --> 07:39.880
Even the Windows Store and now mobile and now mobile everyone thinks about it

07:39.880 --> 07:44.400
It might be easier to teach people we don't do that this way in Linux then to give them the half-assed

07:44.400 --> 07:48.360
Version that we might have so wimpy. I'm glad you could make it

07:48.360 --> 07:53.240
So tell us about this update and where now the Ubuntu Mate project is gonna take this

07:53.240 --> 07:58.840
What's the Ubuntu Mate's answer to this problem that we've kicked on for I mean, it feels like since the inception of the show

08:00.840 --> 08:04.760
Yeah, I've just literally just joined the chatroom so I

08:05.320 --> 08:09.320
I love you wimpy. No excuses. I want to know if I want to give you a big hug and a kiss right now

08:09.320 --> 08:11.800
But I was just I just a recap really quickly

08:11.800 --> 08:16.040
I was just mentioning like first of all, holy shit. Did you get a ton of coverage about this change?

08:16.280 --> 08:18.280
Congrats to you and number two

08:18.280 --> 08:24.040
And number two you didn't are you joking? You didn't notice maybe now I now I saw some of it

08:24.040 --> 08:29.480
I saw I because I because I follow all of the feeds for all of our shows to me

08:29.560 --> 08:34.800
When a story shows up more than a dozen times, that's a lot of coverage and your story got a ton of coverage

08:34.800 --> 08:38.600
You've got the top of our Linux you were the top voted story on the Linux action show subreddit

08:38.600 --> 08:42.720
Which is actually a fairly large generates quite a bit of traffic you got you were on softpedia

08:42.720 --> 08:48.040
You got you got coverage all over the place. Plus not only that you got six reshares on Google Plus

08:48.040 --> 08:54.440
so I saw it in my Google Plus feed constantly and you generated a ton of discussion the Ubuntu subreddit and the our Linux subreddit and

08:54.800 --> 09:00.680
And the thing that got me the most about your post wimpy is you say we have something lined up by way of replacement

09:00.680 --> 09:06.400
And it's not synaptic and that I was like, oh, what is it? So wimpy why this change and where are you going?

09:06.400 --> 09:09.040
You got to tell me. Okay. All right. Okay, so

09:09.800 --> 09:11.440
There's a new

09:11.440 --> 09:19.520
So I've only seen a couple of articles on this and I've had some feedback through the Ubuntu Marte community. So, okay

09:21.840 --> 09:26.920
I've written a new utility for Ubuntu Marte called Ubuntu Marte welcome. Oh

09:27.560 --> 09:28.600
and

09:28.600 --> 09:34.760
One of the features that that has is a simple one-click install for applications

09:35.240 --> 09:36.760
that are

09:36.760 --> 09:38.760
popular and or

09:38.760 --> 09:47.240
Difficult to install and or proprietary and difficult to install. Hmm. So in there, it's a highly curated

09:48.280 --> 09:53.200
selection of applications and the list of applications that are in there are built around

09:54.400 --> 09:56.000
tasks that

09:56.000 --> 10:00.680
Myself and my immediate family and friends that using Ubuntu Marte

10:01.720 --> 10:05.680
Need to accomplish and the software that they need to install to do it

10:05.680 --> 10:09.120
so my father-in-law said to me Ubuntu Marte is great and

10:09.800 --> 10:13.840
Once you've set it up for me, I can do all of these things I need to do

10:13.840 --> 10:17.720
But if you're not here, I can't you know install the things I need

10:17.720 --> 10:18.200
Yeah

10:18.200 --> 10:23.040
So I've just put those things in there that people need to get stuff done and that's really what it's about

10:23.040 --> 10:25.920
It's one-click install get stuff done

10:26.440 --> 10:33.920
So I've developed the means of installing software and it doesn't necessarily have to be stuff that's in the official repositories

10:33.920 --> 10:40.600
So for example, there's a one-click installer for Steam. There's a one-click installer for Google Chrome

10:40.600 --> 10:47.680
There's a one-click installer for the Hangouts plugins and so on and so on and behind the scenes it enables the necessary

10:48.200 --> 10:53.800
PPAs only if that PPA is from the developer. So rotten knows about this

10:53.800 --> 10:59.820
They're not human said said go and get your developer for you get to put a build

10:59.820 --> 11:06.860
for widely into the PPA and then I can turn this on and you can have you get installed from the PPA and

11:07.500 --> 11:10.740
You then get a conservative stable

11:11.900 --> 11:13.900
distribution with rolling applications

11:14.820 --> 11:16.980
so Wow now I have I

11:17.380 --> 11:19.380
Love it. That's that's brilliant

11:19.380 --> 11:24.660
And I love that you're you're basically getting the low-hanging fruit first there with Steam and Chrome and things like that

11:24.660 --> 11:30.420
Which is like going to be like the checklist of the first apps that pretty much everybody I've switched to Linux asked me about

11:30.420 --> 11:35.280
Yeah, I mean, okay. So, you know those yeah, you know those articles that say, you know

11:35.280 --> 11:39.020
The 27 things you need to do after you install. Yeah, that's right

11:39.020 --> 11:44.580
This is the antedote because those 27 things are all a button, you know

11:45.540 --> 11:46.780
lip DVD

11:46.780 --> 11:47.580
CSS well

11:47.580 --> 11:50.300
I'm kind of what you're doing too in a lot of ways is you're taking a

11:50.300 --> 11:54.580
lot of the distro tweak tools where you go out there and you you copy a

11:54.660 --> 11:59.740
W get command with it runs as root from the from their website and you paste it in your terminal and then it downloads and

11:59.740 --> 12:01.900
Installs and add stuff to your repo and then all of a sudden next thing, you know

12:01.900 --> 12:05.860
Uh, like a Lua interface app comes up or some GTK app comes up. You know, what is this?

12:05.860 --> 12:06.060
Okay

12:06.060 --> 12:10.700
I'll check these boxes and you don't really quite know how legit it is and what you're doing is you're sort of legitimizing that process and

12:10.700 --> 12:14.000
Saying well, here's a sanctioned way to get this low-hanging fruit and it's brilliant. Yeah

12:14.940 --> 12:19.660
It's also more than just the most common things people are expecting. So that's wimpy said there

12:19.660 --> 12:21.420
Hey, he asked

12:21.420 --> 12:28.180
We he's he mentioned to me about getting you get into the welcome as well. And we didn't have a 1510 branch

12:28.180 --> 12:29.860
So when he asked for it

12:29.860 --> 12:33.380
We immediately just launched one so we can get it in there. So like

12:33.940 --> 12:39.780
This it's a lot more important than just you know, the the stupid 20 things after you install. Yeah

12:39.780 --> 12:43.380
But like it's actually getting people to in some ways

12:43.380 --> 12:49.500
It's sort of greasing the the wheels for 1510 when it lands because people are gonna have to move forward on that

12:49.500 --> 12:53.700
That's cool, too. Exactly. Yeah, and the other thing is if there's an application

12:53.700 --> 13:00.140
Let's say for example Dropbox Dropbox is a one-click installer in there Dropbox apps Android and iOS

13:00.700 --> 13:04.460
Application so where there's an Android and or an iOS application

13:04.500 --> 13:10.620
There are buttons to take you to the app stores for those companion applications on the mobile platforms

13:10.620 --> 13:16.340
So it tells you what they are equivalent to so for Kim, for example, it explains. This is a little additive to

13:16.340 --> 13:24.380
Photoshop you like that? That's very nice. One of the things we've done is added the CMYK plugins for GIMP

13:24.380 --> 13:26.380
You know, oh wow

13:26.380 --> 13:28.380
It adds all the extra bits and pieces

13:28.380 --> 13:35.080
This is incredible. Wimpy, I love this and so Wimpy are you I mean, you know, this is not obviously not the replacement

13:35.660 --> 13:39.480
Yeah, I mean this is like this is like this is like a stopgap, isn't it?

13:39.480 --> 13:41.080
I mean this is you know, honestly Wimpy though

13:41.080 --> 13:45.100
I could see companies that would be wanting to partner with your distribution to maybe get a button in there, too

13:45.100 --> 13:51.240
Yeah, we'll be the process for changing the software that's added for this. Well, it's it's all at the moment

13:51.240 --> 13:56.140
It's the simplest thing possible. So it's just so effectively welcome is a very simple

13:56.880 --> 14:02.200
Webkit browser with my own protocol handlers to hand handle things like

14:02.800 --> 14:05.720
handling installations handling software removals

14:06.240 --> 14:13.900
Launching executables and doing things so instead of having just hyperlinks that navigate you have actions that trigger things off

14:13.900 --> 14:19.300
now behind the scenes it's it's using apt daemon, which is all the same technology that the

14:19.820 --> 14:27.900
Ubuntu software center uses for actually handling the business end of installing the software, you know and resolving all of the dependencies and all of that

14:27.900 --> 14:29.260
Yeah

14:29.260 --> 14:34.660
But because I've now got this mechanism of saying here is an application click this button to install it

14:34.660 --> 14:38.700
Yeah, and the undercurrent of feedback that I've had

14:38.700 --> 14:43.620
From the Ubuntu Marte community up to this point. We'll get to that in a moment

14:43.620 --> 14:50.500
But up to this point has been why is the Ubuntu software included? You know, it's it's slow

14:50.500 --> 14:55.920
It's bulky people always explain what the alternative is that they install. It's all synaptic

14:55.920 --> 14:56.820
Yeah

14:56.820 --> 15:00.780
So I thought right well now I've got this option to install things after the fact

15:00.780 --> 15:04.760
I'll remove the Ubuntu software center from the default install

15:04.760 --> 15:09.400
To satisfy all of those people that say they didn't think it should be there in the first place

15:09.400 --> 15:13.780
And I'll add a link in the welcome to install it

15:14.280 --> 15:16.320
So you can still choose to install it?

15:16.400 --> 15:19.700
But given that people have said they weren't keen on it

15:19.760 --> 15:24.000
I've been out and I've looked at all of the alternatives that are out there. So I've looked at the

15:24.440 --> 15:28.840
The deep in software center and considered forking that but that's a bit

15:28.840 --> 15:34.760
A bit too much like hard work mostly because a lot of the comments in the source code are in Chinese and my Chinese is

15:34.760 --> 15:36.760
Well, I don't speak Chinese

15:36.760 --> 15:38.760
Just a small area

15:38.760 --> 15:43.320
Yes, it's a small problem. I've looked at the Ubuntu software center, which is nice and lightweight

15:43.320 --> 15:46.040
but the problem there is that that doesn't have the facility to

15:47.440 --> 15:51.800
Log in with your Ubuntu one account and access prior purchases

15:52.780 --> 15:57.780
So that's why the Ubuntu software center is relevant. Anyway, right cut long story short

15:57.780 --> 16:01.160
I've contacted the author of app grid and

16:01.760 --> 16:07.160
He has agreed to me adding an install option for app grid

16:07.160 --> 16:09.560
You know the Ubuntu Marte welcome

16:09.560 --> 16:09.880
No

16:09.880 --> 16:18.260
So now you'll be able to choose whether you want to install the Ubuntu software center or a grid and use that as your

16:18.760 --> 16:21.880
That's your interface perfect. That is perfect

16:22.520 --> 16:26.480
Wow, you know wimpy and I I think what I love about this is

16:26.480 --> 16:32.520
I mean, I what the hell do I know but it seems like to me you could develop out that welcome screen

16:33.160 --> 16:35.040
if I was

16:35.040 --> 16:36.520
I'm trying to think of a good fit

16:36.520 --> 16:40.760
But if let's just take the mirror media player or whatever if I was an open source project

16:40.760 --> 16:42.560
I would or there is a you know

16:42.560 --> 16:48.380
There's some really cool apps being built for the elementary OS like some of you may have seen this weekend a news reader for gnome

16:48.440 --> 16:52.480
Going around that's sort of built for elementary OS first, but it works on any platform

16:52.480 --> 16:56.240
There's some really neat apps that are being developed these days and they could reach out and say, you know

16:56.240 --> 16:58.680
We'd love a little time a little a little welcome

16:58.680 --> 17:03.360
You know a little welcome space here because and and of course your taste and preference would pick which ones get featured there

17:03.440 --> 17:10.200
But it could be a really neat way to expose users to some some I guess like curated well picked and well placed apps

17:10.200 --> 17:12.760
Are you thinking about that or are you resistant to that?

17:13.440 --> 17:15.080
No, I am thinking about that

17:15.080 --> 17:23.400
So I've got a long list of applications that I haven't added yet some I definitely will and some I'm considering but basically the selection

17:23.600 --> 17:25.040
criteria is

17:25.040 --> 17:28.560
Does this integrate well with the Ubuntu Marte desktop?

17:28.560 --> 17:33.680
So so long as it it installs and it works and it integrates and for example

17:35.000 --> 17:41.360
Some applications say some of the KDE applications which are very nice pulling so much of KDE

17:42.040 --> 17:49.200
Underneath that it fills the menus and what have you with a load of KDE applications, which makes it look a bit messy and confusing

17:49.200 --> 17:55.720
Yeah, I have to touch those. Yeah, which is unfortunate because some of them are really good. Mm-hmm

17:55.960 --> 17:59.480
So yes, so long as it integrates well, so yes, you know things like, you know

17:59.760 --> 18:07.400
Do we remove Thunderbird from the default installation and put that in welcome alongside Geary for example? Yeah

18:08.400 --> 18:16.360
Yeah, you know so I've but this is a way because you know, sometimes you get these derivatives of a distribution which are

18:16.360 --> 18:18.360
in name of distribution

18:19.520 --> 18:25.920
Ultimate version. Yes gaming edition or whatever. Yeah, they've got everything imaginable install and it's great

18:25.920 --> 18:28.960
Cuz you install this one thing and you've got everything. Yeah

18:29.000 --> 18:35.600
Well, this is a way for me to make Ubuntu Marte do everything, you know easily access everything

18:35.600 --> 18:40.440
But you don't actually have to ship right, you know a five gigabyte, you know distro

18:40.440 --> 18:44.880
Yeah, I get to pick and you can choose what you want and welcomes asynchronous as well

18:44.880 --> 18:47.760
And so just to clarify like API 984 in the chair

18:47.760 --> 18:50.800
I'm saying what are the sources you're working when a lot of case with these developers to say hey

18:50.800 --> 18:55.080
Give me a PPA that I can you're going to develop and for the 1504 directly, right?

18:55.080 --> 18:59.480
Or I mean 1510 directly so a lot of cases like it's best case scenario for the source, right?

19:00.120 --> 19:07.440
Yeah, so I'd say half of the applications that are in there are just coming out of the official archive at the moment

19:07.440 --> 19:12.080
So it's just an apt and an under the hood. It's doing an apt install. Yeah, I'd say

19:12.080 --> 19:19.200
25% are using a PPA, but it's the PPA from the developer

19:19.200 --> 19:25.880
So I'm not just finding an app that happens to be in some random PPA and enabling a random PPA

19:25.880 --> 19:28.160
I'm actually going to the developers and

19:28.720 --> 19:36.240
Finding their stable PPA or if it doesn't exist asking them to make one and using that and then in other cases for the likes of

19:36.240 --> 19:44.000
Virtual box 5 for example and Dropbox and steam it's actually enabling the steam and Dropbox and

19:44.400 --> 19:49.400
Virtual box sure third-party repositories and doing all of the so you get the updates right from them stuff

19:49.520 --> 19:54.960
Yeah, so you are getting the official, you know latest versions from their archives. That is cool

19:55.800 --> 20:00.080
Nice wimpy. Well, I'm glad you're able to stop by and give us an update on that because that's I will like somebody

20:00.080 --> 20:06.240
Mentioned isn't is an app grid proprietary and the answer to that question is yes app grid is under a proprietary license

20:06.880 --> 20:10.160
Which is why I contacted the author to ask if I could

20:10.840 --> 20:12.840
include an installer for it

20:18.960 --> 20:25.640
Yeah, and upgrades written in Python so actually you can go and look at the source code

20:25.640 --> 20:27.640
Oh

20:28.280 --> 20:31.760
As long as if I get a little suspicious I can take a look is that what you're saying right? Yeah

20:33.440 --> 20:37.600
If something's installing something in my system, I want to know what it's doing underneath

20:37.760 --> 20:40.720
But as far as it's licensing, I don't care. Mm-hmm

20:40.720 --> 20:41.040
Yeah

20:41.040 --> 20:48.840
But that's why I'm going to continue to include a link to install the Ubuntu software center and clearly label that as an open source

20:48.880 --> 20:53.280
You know tool and then upgrade as an alternative to that

20:53.280 --> 20:57.840
But yes under I mean for example, there's in sync is in

20:58.680 --> 21:03.800
Ubuntu Marte welcome, which is a third-party proprietary application. That is a

21:04.480 --> 21:07.040
Google Drive sync. Yeah utility

21:07.680 --> 21:11.760
In my opinion is the best to the job, but it is a commercial application

21:12.040 --> 21:14.000
But it says so in there

21:14.000 --> 21:20.040
This is a commercial application after the evaluation period if you still want to use it. You will have to pay for it

21:20.040 --> 21:23.240
With a link to yeah, you know, yeah much it costs. Yeah

21:23.840 --> 21:28.040
Because well, you know, there are open source alternatives, but my choice is

21:28.640 --> 21:33.160
The best-in-class application like integrates well with the Ubuntu Marte desktop

21:33.160 --> 21:39.120
Yeah, and I could go for gripe, but gripe is not the best-in-class application. Yeah, and I

21:40.000 --> 21:47.200
Found out it's some unpopular, but I don't think Ubuntu software center is the best-in-class software center for Ubuntu

21:47.200 --> 21:50.160
I think app grid is there you go

21:50.160 --> 21:52.960
Well put and I support you a hundred percent on it

21:52.960 --> 21:57.080
And I like to see a little taste involved in some of these desktop app pick selections

21:57.480 --> 22:01.040
And you know truth be told people that think there's maybe like for example in sync

22:01.040 --> 22:05.880
If you think there's a better solution, then you're probably the person that knows how to go get it and install it. Yeah, definitely

22:05.880 --> 22:07.880
yeah, including including the

22:08.360 --> 22:12.520
Plugins for the cars your file manager, for example, so it does all of that, you know

22:12.520 --> 22:18.440
Yeah, stop integration now this business about Ubuntu software center considering how much you know, I've heard

22:18.440 --> 22:22.640
Oh, we don't like it. We'd rather you choose something else now

22:22.640 --> 22:28.440
I've suggested that I'm gonna remove it man. Am I unpopular? This is the biggest misstep. I've made in

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
I've started the project

22:32.520 --> 22:36.840
Silent the silent majority of risen up and they're not so silent anymore, huh?

22:36.840 --> 22:44.840
No, no, they've all found their voice and they're making it plainly clear that all I can imagine that's where cheerleaders popping up and screaming

22:44.840 --> 22:46.960
No, I imagine it goes something like this

22:47.080 --> 22:53.240
The only reason I move people to Ubuntu is because they expect a software center and it's the only one that at least has a software

22:53.240 --> 22:56.400
Some of them for the use regardless of how good it is. Is that essentially what you get?

22:57.440 --> 23:00.320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's your choice

23:00.320 --> 23:06.000
You choose the Ubuntu software center or you can choose upgrade and a friend of mine has just popped in and chapter chat room

23:06.000 --> 23:09.520
Joe Ressington and we've been exchanging some message earlier on

23:10.680 --> 23:15.460
On hangouts. So so Joe now I won't be compiling at the grid

23:16.200 --> 23:23.040
Grid is written in Python and it's an interpreted language. It will be installed from the app grid developers PPA

23:23.360 --> 23:26.040
Wimpy you should give Joe the pro tip and have him join us in the mumble room

23:26.040 --> 23:30.440
I mean, come on, he could he could give you Joe in the UK. Yeah, he's

23:30.440 --> 23:37.920
Known as the Linux podcast, right? I mean, I know he has a microphone. So I know he probably knows how to make mumble work

23:37.920 --> 23:41.440
I'm just saying he does know how to make mumble work. I'd love for Joe

23:43.080 --> 23:48.200
Conversation because I know he's got some strong feelings about proprietary software being listed in there and this is the place

23:48.200 --> 23:50.300
I'm just saying I'm just yeah, okay

23:50.520 --> 23:55.880
Wimpy is there anything else you want to mention on the exists? No, no, no, I guess I'm going to be

23:55.880 --> 24:03.680
Just as his wife is asleep. So yeah, that's always a good excuse. Yeah, I think I think he I think you'd have been up for it

24:04.560 --> 24:08.140
Yeah, well keep us posted on how it goes. I'm sure we'll check back in

24:08.140 --> 24:12.640
He may have another chance to give it to rib you because I have a feeling this is gonna be something follows interest

24:14.400 --> 24:18.560
Joe's like Joe's on at least four other podcasts. So he's got plenty of opportunity to call me

24:18.560 --> 24:22.520
I know it's happy just happens to be during this one. The wife is sleeping. I will I'll try not to take it personally

24:22.520 --> 24:29.160
I'll die honestly, I know I know his wife has very good sleep practice and she likes an early night

24:29.160 --> 24:35.800
I'll get poppies joined in as well. Oh goodness, but let's let's change the topic. All right. Well wimpy. Thank you very much

24:35.800 --> 24:38.840
I appreciate your welcome as always

24:39.720 --> 24:45.720
You know, there was one story I wanted to get to that maybe I'd like to poke poppy about but before we get to that

24:46.680 --> 24:48.600
I'm not gonna say it's about plasma mobile

24:48.600 --> 24:53.400
But before we get to that I want to talk about ting our first sponsor here on the Linux unplugged program

24:53.400 --> 24:59.440
Go to linux.ting.com to support the Linux unplugged program and check them out because what I love about ting is there's no contract for your

24:59.440 --> 25:01.520
Service and you only pay for what you use

25:01.520 --> 25:05.160
So just put that in your brain organ for a second and think about that

25:05.160 --> 25:11.240
It's a flat six dollars a month for the line and then it's just your usage on top of that and that is select

25:11.240 --> 25:16.040
So when we went to OSCON Noah had a ting phone Noah's wife had a ting phone

25:16.040 --> 25:22.320
I had a ting phone my wife had a ting phone and we were rocking the communication down there and what's super slick

25:22.720 --> 25:29.560
Was Noah had a rental and so we were driving from where we had the family staying to OSCON and I turned on the Wi-Fi

25:29.760 --> 25:37.480
Hotspot mode and connected Noah's car his rental car to the Wi-Fi hotspot on my s6 as we're driving down

25:37.480 --> 25:42.500
I-5 and like the media system on his car is like pulling down track information from the internet and

25:42.500 --> 25:47.300
All it's totally cool, and I don't care. I'm honey badger about it because I'm just paying for my usage

25:47.300 --> 25:48.940
I don't have to be like in some sort of special

25:48.940 --> 25:54.260
Shared data plan to have wife Wi-Fi tethering or anything like that and you can try it out to go to linux.ting.com

25:54.260 --> 25:57.980
And try out the savings calculator and see how much you'd save by switching to ting

25:57.980 --> 26:02.780
I'm saving over two thousand dollars every two years no contract right so there's no early termination fee

26:02.780 --> 26:08.460
And if you're in one of those duopoly contracts ting has an early termination relief program. Yeah, dude. They're crazy

26:08.460 --> 26:09.960
They got early termination relief program

26:09.960 --> 26:14.660
They're gonna help you get out of that contract and here's something else that's different about ting when you call them you get to

26:14.660 --> 26:20.100
Speak to a human being you call them a 1-8-5-5 ting FTW is anytime between 8 a.m.. And 8 p.m.. On the East Coast

26:20.620 --> 26:24.740
In fact check their site because they do they do move that window depending on demand

26:24.940 --> 26:29.700
And you get to speak to that human being a human being and they also have one of the best control

26:29.700 --> 26:34.700
Well they have the best not one of they have the best control panel in the business that way you can manage your account turn

26:34.700 --> 26:40.980
Devices on and off name them check your usage set alerts that set thresholds transfer devices deactivate devices

26:40.980 --> 26:45.340
When no is heading out of here at the end of our oscon trip. I went into my ting dashboard

26:45.340 --> 26:50.940
I removed my Nexus 5 from my dashboard within an hour to he was able to add to his dashboard, and he had a Nexus 5

26:51.940 --> 26:57.620
Never had to call anybody all through their super slick website no termination fees no contract hoop

26:57.620 --> 27:01.060
That's like hey man. You want to try out the Nexus 5 for a little bit here you go

27:01.060 --> 27:05.160
And I just move up click a thing click a thing boom. We're done. It's so nice

27:05.160 --> 27:10.100
I just did it right from the ting dashboard in seconds and everything's like that with ting and just for six dollars a month

27:10.100 --> 27:12.720
For the line if you got a few people in your family, or you got a small business

27:12.720 --> 27:16.980
There's no cheaper way than going with ting, but it's not the kind of cheap you're familiar with it's cheap in the way

27:16.980 --> 27:21.300
That's inexpensive, but still the service is awesome, and they have something most carriers. Don't have

27:21.940 --> 27:25.780
Two networks to choose from they have a CDMA and GSM network

27:25.780 --> 27:30.980
So you can figure out which one has the best coverage or data speeds in your area and pick that one like in my Nexus

27:30.980 --> 27:36.060
5 I get to bounce between CDMA or GSM and because they have GSM and CDMA network

27:36.060 --> 27:40.060
There's a ton of devices you can bring and if you're gonna bring a device you go to linux.ting.com

27:40.060 --> 27:46.600
They'll take $25 off your first month of service that more than paid for my first month. That's how that's how I really $25

27:46.600 --> 27:51.620
That's a little I mean I when I think about a smartphone 25 now now that I got now

27:51.620 --> 27:52.340
I got a couple of phones

27:52.340 --> 27:52.660
I'm down

27:52.660 --> 27:57.860
I'm only down to a couple of phones now because I've been given a couple away now now I'm like around 35 37 40 bucks a

27:57.860 --> 28:03.180
Month that's still not that bad though for three smartphones that with unlimited data just pay for what I use right

28:03.180 --> 28:08.240
I don't have to worry about going over some origin getting some crazy charge when I turn on my my hotspot or tethering and if I

28:08.240 --> 28:11.140
Pay a little more one month that all washes out because most months

28:11.140 --> 28:15.180
I'm saving a ton of money cuz I'm pretty Wi-Fi savvy so I just when I wrap my head around this

28:15.180 --> 28:17.180
I think how else would I have been able to do this?

28:17.340 --> 28:21.620
Especially for Jupiter broadcasting where we don't have the budget to spend hundreds of dollars a month on cell phone lines

28:21.620 --> 28:25.940
I don't know how I would have done this without ting go to linux.ting.com try their savings calculator

28:25.940 --> 28:31.480
See how much you would save remember they have an early termination relief program on top of that and give them a try

28:31.580 --> 28:36.960
tons of great devices do if you just want to buy a device starting around $60 for a feature phone all the way up to

28:36.960 --> 28:44.980
The best devices in the market linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged

28:45.620 --> 28:53.820
So this week one of the big stories that we saw hit the interwebs was plasma mobile a free mobile platform created completely from scratch

28:53.820 --> 28:58.700
Totally from scratch no no other

28:59.140 --> 29:05.780
Distributions or projects that they are sitting on top of and it has hit the web and images are ready for the Nexus 5 and it

29:05.780 --> 29:13.020
Is based on freedom user friendliness and privacy and of course the plasma desktop now in reality I Josh

29:13.540 --> 29:16.940
Just like so many other great open source projects. They're standing on the shoulder of Giants

29:16.940 --> 29:22.620
I'm sure there is tons and tons of Ubuntu mobile work in here. We do know that they are using live hybrids to get

29:22.620 --> 29:27.500
Android video drivers working under Linux and of course all of the work under Qt

29:27.500 --> 29:31.620
But rotten corpse you've had a little bit of heads up about there's a little bit of time to look at this

29:31.620 --> 29:33.940
What were your first impressions when you started to learn about this new project?

29:34.740 --> 29:38.780
I was really excited. They actually told me I talked to a developer for

29:39.540 --> 29:41.540
Plasma mobile and they said that

29:41.780 --> 29:43.780
It's it is based on

29:44.380 --> 29:49.220
It has a lot of Ubuntu stack, but it also has like one of the graphics drivers for Android

29:49.220 --> 29:54.860
But everything else is all Linux based. So it's it is sharing some stuff that it that I could bunch who has

29:54.940 --> 29:57.980
They've also built a lot of their own stuff too for the shell. Mm-hmm

29:58.900 --> 30:05.840
And and there are their app system and the widget system is completely unique and there's the demo of it is it's pretty cool

30:06.620 --> 30:08.340
So I'm actually looking forward to it

30:08.340 --> 30:13.860
And it's the best part is that the plasmoids that are based on the desktop are actually to work in the phone, too

30:14.300 --> 30:16.500
Yeah, that's pretty nice. So those are ready to go

30:16.500 --> 30:18.500
I

30:18.940 --> 30:22.980
Guess I mean, I don't I I probably I'm sure you have nothing but nice things to say

30:23.220 --> 30:26.580
But what are your first impressions when you see a project that in a lot of ways?

30:27.100 --> 30:32.500
Is somewhat competition for Ubuntu touch. Do you think this is good? I'm sure you do right? I think it's great

30:32.500 --> 30:36.340
Yeah, of course you do the whole idea of having lots of different

30:37.100 --> 30:41.900
Lots of diversity in the Linux mobile market. It's great. Okay. Why would I say anything?

30:41.900 --> 30:44.900
Well, so here's the yeah, of course, why else could you say anything else?

30:44.900 --> 30:52.340
You know what? I've noticed is the particular group that is putting this out has been particularly vocal about their feelings about canonicals efforts in

30:52.340 --> 30:58.100
This area I would say perhaps they've been discouraging about those efforts a lot of claims about duplicated effort a lot of claims about

30:58.740 --> 31:01.420
Reinventing code that already exists, but in reality

31:02.540 --> 31:04.940
I'm not so sure. I think there's a few

31:04.940 --> 31:10.500
I mean you can you can always hunt down individuals who can be vocal and negative about any particular project

31:10.500 --> 31:12.500
I could probably find someone negative about anything

31:12.500 --> 31:18.260
Of course, of course, you know, I don't think I don't think it's fair to paint the entire

31:18.820 --> 31:24.580
You know KDE or plasma community as negative towards one thing because there are a bunch of individuals who each have their own idea

31:24.580 --> 31:29.500
I think it was interesting that one of the things they showcased in this video is out of the box

31:29.700 --> 31:31.740
They're planning for support for Ubuntu touch apps

31:32.820 --> 31:34.820
Yeah, that's cool. I mean

31:35.300 --> 31:38.560
You know what you got to remember is what we're using on a bunch of touches

31:38.560 --> 31:43.920
You know QML and I know there have been comments in the past like oh look

31:43.920 --> 31:48.440
I want to have finally come around to Qt being like the right way to do things and and

31:48.720 --> 31:54.840
You know this so it's no surprise that they support that kind of stuff as well on on the plasma mobile because you know

31:54.840 --> 31:57.280
That's that's that's their bread and butter. Yeah

31:57.840 --> 32:02.040
I'm I'm I find it a great that they put an image out for the Nexus 5

32:02.040 --> 32:04.120
It makes me want to try although I don't have my Nexus 5 right now

32:04.120 --> 32:08.520
But that that's kind of neat is anybody in the mumbroom actually flashed a Nexus 5 with it and tried it

32:10.080 --> 32:12.080
Yeah, I should know what I'm doing tonight

32:13.640 --> 32:15.840
That's neat, I guess I'm excited

32:17.200 --> 32:21.640
Anything that puts more development momentum behind mobile Qt apps

32:21.640 --> 32:25.880
I'm actually all for because I really think that'd be good for everybody in general

32:25.880 --> 32:30.560
I think Qt's a great great great toolkit for this and I would love to see more Qt development

32:30.560 --> 32:35.700
Especially around mobile because not only would it make great apps for plasma desktop

32:35.700 --> 32:39.460
But it would make great apps for Ubuntu touch and make great apps for the unity 8 desktop

32:39.460 --> 32:43.300
I would imagine I mean, I think it's a it's an amazing toolkit with a lot of runway

32:43.300 --> 32:49.340
And so I'd love that about this. I also the other thing I love about this is actually getting more people to dogfood Whalen

32:49.340 --> 32:54.020
That's a really good thing and that's something that Ubuntu touch doesn't give us right now. And so that's awesome, too

32:54.740 --> 32:58.140
That all said I don't know how far this is gonna go

32:58.140 --> 33:03.580
But I'm totally willing to sit back and willing to wait and watch and I'm really curious to know what they have in the works

33:03.580 --> 33:08.540
Like app store wise and integration wise and partnership wise. I really want to talk to them soon and rotten

33:08.540 --> 33:12.540
We're kind of in the background setting up something to talk to them in the future, but we just don't have a nail down, right?

33:21.940 --> 33:26.100
Stay tuned and find out. Yeah, so that's neat. That's neat. So

33:26.100 --> 33:31.860
The what's the web browser says peacemaker? I don't know. Does anybody know what the web browser is on plasma mobile rotten?

33:31.860 --> 33:37.980
Are you up to I think it's the Ubuntu browser, but the one for their mobile version, but I'm they haven't

33:38.620 --> 33:40.620
Specifically said yet. Okay, so that that's yeah

33:41.700 --> 33:47.100
The the image I tore apart the image to have a look at it when when it came out and

33:47.900 --> 33:50.740
There's some yeah, there's some Ubuntu components in there

33:50.740 --> 33:56.820
I I wouldn't necessarily expect those to be in there forever. I would I would expect there

33:57.100 --> 34:00.580
You know things like our in the image and in the demo

34:00.580 --> 34:03.820
There's our weather app and the music app and the calculator and the web browser

34:03.820 --> 34:07.940
I wouldn't be surprised if those get replaced with more natural, you know

34:07.940 --> 34:12.620
K KDE bedfellows than than the ones we have but I'm you know

34:12.620 --> 34:15.860
I'd love to share work with those guys and for you know

34:15.860 --> 34:21.660
If they've got patches for our apps that are appropriate for them or if we've got things that we need to do to make it

34:21.660 --> 34:25.540
Work on on their platform. That'll be awesome. Does it feel validating a

34:26.540 --> 34:32.500
Little bit to some degree. Yeah, there's there's you know, the fact that someone can take that image and

34:32.940 --> 34:35.260
You know if you if you rip the image apart inside it

34:35.260 --> 34:40.120
there's a shell script and that shell script basically takes an Ubuntu touch image rips out the

34:40.120 --> 34:46.140
Yeah, mear and unity and here the bits that they don't want adds a PPA and puts in you know

34:46.140 --> 34:47.840
The KDE stuff which is exactly what you know

34:47.840 --> 34:55.140
Many derivative Linux distributions are is they rip apart that's the initial that's what you do with your preview version is you rip apart somebody else's

34:55.920 --> 35:01.200
Distro and then you put back in the value that you want to put in and then you distribute that for people to play with

35:01.200 --> 35:04.280
People play with it and then you maybe you'll make a more robust solution

35:04.280 --> 35:09.280
So I don't doubt they'll have image creation servers and all the kind of infrastructure that we have for hours

35:09.280 --> 35:14.160
But they'll be generating their own images and it may well be that they don't they don't use Ubuntu touch underneath forever

35:14.160 --> 35:20.040
That's yeah, you know, they may well choose mere or someone or something else gentoo who knows that was the meta story

35:20.040 --> 35:21.760
I took away from this is that

35:21.760 --> 35:27.780
The Ubuntu project has created something that a bunch of really smart people felt it was worth basing their project off of

35:28.120 --> 35:31.260
because I think in a lot of ways that's sort of

35:31.760 --> 35:37.440
One of the better validations of an open source project is that another group of really talented people can look at it and go there's some

35:37.440 --> 35:40.160
serious merit here and we want to incorporate this and start from here and

35:41.000 --> 35:42.960
Regardless of how long they use that as the base

35:42.960 --> 35:47.080
I think in some ways it adds legitimacy to the efforts that canonical is working on here

35:47.080 --> 35:52.040
Is that another group of really smart people think it's worth their time and maybe inspires other people to do the same thing and create

35:52.040 --> 35:53.160
interesting other spins

35:53.160 --> 35:53.640
Yeah

35:53.640 --> 35:55.640
and now we have

35:55.680 --> 36:02.220
prerequisite to maybe KDE taking a page out of Microsoft's book and making KDE hearts canonical

36:03.560 --> 36:05.560
I'm just waiting for my next

36:05.560 --> 36:07.960
Yeah, I think you're pushing in

36:09.160 --> 36:14.120
No kid, but maybe just a little softer touch. All right. Well, that's fascinating. Thanks for the updates guys

36:14.120 --> 36:20.720
I want to transition to OSCON. This is the meat of today's episode is I got some really great stuff down at OSCON

36:20.720 --> 36:24.040
I I'm really happy with the way everything turned out and I want to cover that

36:24.040 --> 36:28.080
So before we jump into our exclusive OSCON coverage in Linux unplugged

36:28.080 --> 36:34.060
I'd like to mention DigitalOcean next sponsor of the unplugged program and boy to DigitalOcean come through all of the clips

36:34.060 --> 36:40.120
You're about to see all of the interviews you saw on Linux action show all of it transferred archives stored moved between

36:40.520 --> 36:42.680
Destinations using DigitalOcean and why not?

36:43.200 --> 36:48.100
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to get your own rig up in

36:48.100 --> 36:51.480
The cloud I'm talking a Linux big bay Linux rig based on KVM

36:52.040 --> 36:53.720
SSD for the IO

36:53.720 --> 37:00.560
Top-tier internet connections and HTML 5 UI to manage all of it and you get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start

37:00.560 --> 37:08.240
Only five dollars a month for 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a freaking terabyte of transfer a freaking terabyte

37:08.560 --> 37:11.540
They have data center locations in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam

37:12.220 --> 37:14.320
London and a brand new one in Germany

37:14.320 --> 37:20.000
But what I love about DigitalOcean with keeps me coming back is that sugar of their interface that UI is done

37:20.000 --> 37:25.880
So well, first of all, it works in all your devices. So that way you don't have to worry about that even even the console

37:25.880 --> 37:31.720
They've written a web console in go that watches the machine from post all the way up to boot

37:31.720 --> 37:35.800
You don't have to worry about needing Java or ActiveX or anything like that

37:35.800 --> 37:38.840
And then you can do a pretty much all the functionality you'd want, you know

37:38.840 --> 37:43.880
You can manage your snapshots. You can do DNS management. You can deploy applications. You can back up replicate archive

37:44.760 --> 37:47.480
Expand the storage all the stuff you'd expect

37:47.480 --> 37:50.200
But if you just decide you want to automate that s you know

37:50.200 --> 37:53.680
You want to take it to the next level you want to do it at scale or you want to integrate it in with your update

37:53.680 --> 38:00.400
Systems or your puppet management infrastructure DigitalOcean has a very slick API that allows you to do all this stuff very straightforward

38:00.400 --> 38:05.980
In fact, there's a ton of really good community applications already built around this slick API that you can take advantage of right now

38:05.980 --> 38:13.040
Absolutely as just part of your DigitalOcean service and remember all of this starts at just five dollars a month

38:13.040 --> 38:18.040
And if you use our promo code do unplugged one word lowercase do unplugged

38:18.480 --> 38:22.680
You'll get a ten dollar credit. You can try that five dollar rig two months for free

38:22.680 --> 38:28.680
This is a Linux powered rig that is unbelievably fast up in this up in the cloud up in the sky up on somebody else's computer

38:28.680 --> 38:31.320
Whatever you want to call it it rocks and has only five

38:31.800 --> 38:38.400
Dollars a month and you can choose from fedora 22 Ubuntu LTS current versions. They got free BSD

38:38.400 --> 38:41.600
They've got Debian they have really nice one-click deployments

38:41.600 --> 38:42.680
If you want to get a ghost powered

38:42.680 --> 38:48.760
You know ghost is a great blogging platform markdown powered if you don't need WordPress if you don't need something as advanced as WordPress

38:48.760 --> 38:50.600
You just want to post and go check out ghost

38:50.600 --> 38:54.880
Why not host on a digital ocean drop you want own cloud you want to do google file your life check out digital ocean

38:54.880 --> 38:58.760
Do you want to have a minecraft server a mumble server check out digital ocean you want to have a gitlab server check out

38:58.760 --> 39:03.760
Do you get the point it can do all of these things at five dollars a month and of course you're relying on Linux is

39:03.760 --> 39:08.760
A fantastic memory infrastructure to just keep going and going and going and you could up it as you need it grows with you and

39:08.760 --> 39:12.160
If you use the promo code do unplugged you get the ten dollar credit you try it two months for free

39:12.600 --> 39:18.200
We also have incredible tutorials to take it to the next level as well go to digital ocean.com use our promo code do

39:18.200 --> 39:25.000
Unplugged one word and a huge. Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program. It's a really great setup

39:25.000 --> 39:28.760
I've got tons of droplets Noah's got tons of droplets West you got to go over there and create a droplet

39:28.760 --> 39:32.020
I have done. Oh, that's right. You do. What do you use digital ocean for?

39:32.480 --> 39:36.040
Well a number of things it's a they have great pipes over digital ocean

39:36.040 --> 39:40.040
So I have a few servers over in Europe. This is my proxy server downloads things stores them in a cache

39:40.040 --> 39:44.640
Good cause great good call has to run sync thing on pretty much all of them, which that's also

39:44.640 --> 39:50.480
My data with me all the time. Yeah sync thing bit torrent sync and own cloud are great uses. I love the proxy idea

39:50.480 --> 39:55.920
That's really slick digital ocean.com use the promo code do unplugged and go build yourself something on a droplet

39:56.000 --> 40:01.560
You'd be surprised how far you can get at just five dollars a month. Okay, so our next segment

40:01.560 --> 40:03.080
I'm really excited. We've got some great stuff

40:03.080 --> 40:08.880
but first I I want to touch on a big conversation we had in Linux action show this Sunday around RFID tracking at

40:08.880 --> 40:15.480
OSCON there was RFID printed in the badges and then some of the major rooms you went through they would track attendees to see

40:15.480 --> 40:19.320
Which rooms are in how long you're in them kind of get heat maps of popular sessions and things like that now

40:19.320 --> 40:21.240
I have to clarify

40:21.240 --> 40:25.120
Josh R. Simmons from O'Reilly tweeted us and said your OSCON show had some inaccuracy

40:25.600 --> 40:31.600
Inaccuracies around RFID people could opt out and employers don't get the data. There's no reports that are sent to employers

40:31.600 --> 40:35.280
So I want to make that clarification for some of you were uncomfortable about the OSCON tracking

40:35.280 --> 40:40.440
They don't send reports to employers, and there was an option to opt out. I thought it was kind of a fascinating thing

40:40.440 --> 40:43.280
They were doing in the first place, but I just thought for those of you who are concerned about that

40:43.280 --> 40:45.760
We should make that clarification now

40:45.760 --> 40:50.240
That's really the only mistake you're gonna run into because you see when Noah and I go down to events like this

40:50.240 --> 40:52.160
We've been doing this for a while now

40:52.160 --> 40:56.480
Professional we are a well oiled machine West like we get down there. We're strutting our stuff

40:56.480 --> 41:00.080
What's up, Linux action show biggest podcast in the Linux world. We're here

41:00.080 --> 41:02.320
We're gonna record some interviews get out of the way

41:02.320 --> 41:08.640
And I tell you it all goes really well until you realize we've showed up an hour early and the Expo Hall hasn't even opened

41:08.640 --> 41:14.520
Yet when you told me you didn't have anything till 1.30. I thought I thought okay. Well, then we'll just go do interviews until 1.30

41:19.240 --> 41:21.920
No, it wasn't what I was thinking it's actually not what I communicated to

41:22.960 --> 41:26.760
You see what he communicated was I don't need to be there until 1.30

41:26.760 --> 41:31.200
I did, but I also I did specifically tell you the inner that the Expo Hall wasn't gonna be open till the afternoon

41:31.200 --> 41:35.680
I think by that time I think here's what I'd work out here's what here's my here's my mistake

41:35.680 --> 41:39.000
My mistake was expecting no it convey more than 15 seconds of information

41:40.480 --> 41:42.480
Important

41:45.200 --> 41:49.000
So I have to condense it down to 15 seconds and spit that out not true

41:49.000 --> 41:52.880
That's not true. That's not true. You find that I have to come up with interesting other things to say to Phil

41:54.160 --> 41:56.160
You do have to sell me. Yeah

41:56.160 --> 41:58.160
Okay, I'll keep that in mind for future

41:58.920 --> 42:00.800
We got that for we got that worked out

42:00.800 --> 42:04.200
But there was a little bit of it's actually kind of nice at OSCON. They have a media room set up

42:04.200 --> 42:06.720
So we were able to kill a little time in there. We got some things sorted out

42:06.720 --> 42:11.280
We got some bad stuff resolved and our first interview of the day was with one of the chairs of OSCON

42:11.280 --> 42:14.640
And I asked her like for people who are listening from a community standpoint

42:14.640 --> 42:20.520
What's the connection between O'Reilly and OSCON and can you give us a little information about how that all connects?

42:20.520 --> 42:28.280
Walking around here at OSCON and I ran into Rachel now Rachel is a very very interesting guest on the unplug show because she runs

42:28.280 --> 42:33.480
This whole thing puts it all together. I'm really excited to talk to her. So Rachel, welcome to Linux unplug happy to be here

42:33.480 --> 42:38.120
Thank you. So Rachel, I know that probably a lot of folks are somewhat familiar with OSCON

42:38.120 --> 42:40.120
But I don't know if they really are familiar with

42:40.640 --> 42:44.040
How O'Reilly is involved with OSCON because I think we all know O'Reilly

42:44.040 --> 42:47.600
So could you touch on just a little bit of O'Reilly and OSCON and how that is all connected?

42:47.600 --> 42:50.520
Absolutely, so O'Reilly has been around for about 38 years and

42:51.160 --> 42:53.560
OSCON has been around for this is the 17th one

42:53.560 --> 42:58.480
and so we've always really been a part of open source before it was even called open source and

42:59.000 --> 43:05.380
I believe we were part of coining that phrase and when we did that was something that we brought to OSCON. OSCON actually started as a

43:06.280 --> 43:10.560
Perl event and then as more and more people came to the open source community

43:10.560 --> 43:17.880
It became more of a developer event. And so O'Reilly has many many events at this point

43:18.480 --> 43:22.580
We have I think we have 18 per year, but we also we have books we have videos

43:23.440 --> 43:27.640
And you know, we distribute ebooks. So yeah

43:27.640 --> 43:33.640
I think you guys are very very well known for the ebooks and the books online and the animals of course are a very iconic

43:33.920 --> 43:38.100
Aspect to it. So I don't know though do people do people when they hear O'Reilly

43:38.100 --> 43:44.120
Do they think of that legacy in open source and how does OSCON help sort of familiarize people with that?

43:44.120 --> 43:47.640
I think they do think of the legacy. Like I said, so OSCON

43:48.400 --> 43:52.600
Has been around for a long time and you see a lot of people if not come back every year come back every couple

43:52.600 --> 43:55.080
Of years to check in with the community

43:55.680 --> 43:58.920
So I think that it's something that people have been looking at for a while

43:58.920 --> 44:04.160
I want to what I want to make sure OSCON is is that we're bringing in constantly bringing in new people

44:04.160 --> 44:09.360
So that they are a part of that legacy because even though open source has quote-unquote won

44:10.040 --> 44:13.760
There's a lot of work left to do because it has to do with how do you bring that into your business?

44:13.760 --> 44:15.840
How do you make that work? How do you make money from it?

44:15.840 --> 44:20.720
Well still being a good open source community member and you know, that's such an interesting aspect there, too

44:20.720 --> 44:25.040
Because it is exploding every year. It feels like the open source world has gotten bigger

44:25.040 --> 44:26.680
There's so many more technologies and you know

44:26.680 --> 44:32.080
We see really fascinating big huge companies like SAP are in here and how they leverage open source

44:32.080 --> 44:34.760
But one of the interesting things about OSCON for people that are

44:35.800 --> 44:37.880
Not here right now that is hard to capture

44:38.200 --> 44:41.440
Because we're on the floor all the time and you get an idea in a sense of the activity

44:41.440 --> 44:46.280
What's really hard to capture is there's some really incredible sessions going on and I know there's been some specific

44:46.720 --> 44:49.760
Retooling around some of that this year. Could you talk a little bit about that? Yeah, absolutely

44:49.760 --> 44:53.720
so we used to be set up by language and I think that was because

44:54.320 --> 44:57.920
Developers identified with a certain language at least more so than others

44:57.920 --> 45:03.840
And what we realized is that there's so many languages frameworks techniques all different open source pieces

45:04.120 --> 45:07.080
That there's now the right tool for the job

45:07.320 --> 45:13.440
So what we wanted to do instead was pick out what are the common problems that developers are having either in?

45:14.080 --> 45:21.120
Securing their software or scaling it or how do you take it mobile and giving them solutions and having those?

45:21.360 --> 45:25.760
solutions be able to be applied to different frameworks languages, so

45:25.760 --> 45:32.440
Absolutely, and there's also been some pretty like intensive sessions this year that really you're like you could come here and get really familiar with something

45:32.440 --> 45:37.680
What's the intent behind that? Well, we wanted to get exactly wanted to get a little bit more intense. We had

45:38.280 --> 45:43.240
Four two-day training courses one was on Swift another was on go

45:43.920 --> 45:47.440
Microservices is a big deal. We really wanted people to be able to come in

45:48.000 --> 45:50.200
Take two days not put it off any longer

45:50.200 --> 45:57.200
Focus focus be able to actually when they go back next week to work to actually solve a problem and give them those materials

45:57.200 --> 46:01.200
To solve that problem, so we had those we had 38 tutorials

46:01.200 --> 46:06.200
Which is like an amazing amount of tutorials and those were like three to six hours

46:06.200 --> 46:12.200
And then like you said the sessions where you're just sort of getting a taste of what something is now if I'm watching from afar

46:12.200 --> 46:16.200
Is there any kind of any kind of resources I can read up and get an idea of?

46:16.200 --> 46:21.200
What's coming up next year, so I know if I want to make it out here is there like a site I can watch or a feed to follow?

46:21.200 --> 46:23.200
That's a good question, so we have oscon.com

46:24.200 --> 46:29.200
And you can go there, and you can check out the the keynotes will be streaming or not streaming live anyway

46:29.200 --> 46:33.200
But they'll be there you can check them out, and then you can check out O'Reilly's radar

46:33.200 --> 46:36.200
And that's some you know I talked a little bit about what we were doing

46:36.200 --> 46:41.200
I'll talk about what I did see and honestly I want to talk to a bunch of people while I'm here to see what they did

46:41.200 --> 46:46.200
Like what they didn't like one of the things I'm thinking about for next year is making a track that's like the mind-blowing track

46:46.200 --> 46:50.200
Which is just like super advanced and like people can go in and be like I don't know what just happened

46:51.200 --> 46:56.200
Get known for being really hardcore in there. Yeah, that's great. I love to see what you guys gonna come up with Rachel

46:56.200 --> 46:59.200
Thank so much for coming on Linux unplugged. No problem is pleasure

47:00.200 --> 47:06.200
And that was interesting you know they did they decided as the conference gets bigger their solution to sort of

47:06.200 --> 47:12.200
Becoming less relevant is to get more hardcore and focus more on content. We'll see how that works as they move to Texas now this next clip

47:12.200 --> 47:14.200
I got here is called matrix

47:14.200 --> 47:20.200
And I don't know if your mess are you familiar with like stack which is like a collaboration tool for teams and stuff like that?

47:20.200 --> 47:23.200
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's really popular these days

47:23.200 --> 47:30.200
It's really tape taking off and there is an open source competitor that you can either use as a hosted service or host yourself called matrix

47:30.200 --> 47:36.200
It's an open source stack killer and it involves IRC chat web RTC

47:36.200 --> 47:41.200
Persistent rooms and project planning calendaring and integration with third-party services

47:41.200 --> 47:46.200
And they're saying stop using stack and try and try out matrix it might just solve your needs

47:46.200 --> 47:54.200
So we spent 12 years building set infrastructure and got quite depressed in the end because set was meant to be like this email

47:54.200 --> 48:02.200
But for open video except in practice nobody has sit your eyes on their business cards and the open Federation the open

48:02.200 --> 48:06.200
Interoperability thing just hasn't really quite taken off so we went and

48:07.200 --> 48:11.200
Wrote an alternative to set based on HTTP just a really simple HTTP API

48:11.200 --> 48:14.200
Or if I want to set up a video call somebody I do one hit

48:14.200 --> 48:20.200
With the offer of what media I want to talk and you do one hit back with the answer and that's it

48:20.200 --> 48:25.200
We're in a call. So none of the complexities of set with all the you know, it's a UDP. Is it TLS?

48:25.200 --> 48:28.200
Is it TCP? Is it this version? Is it that version?

48:28.200 --> 48:35.200
So it's quite old and very fragmented just doing it as an HTTP works a lot better and that's one of the things you can use

48:35.200 --> 48:40.200
With matrix except matrix isn't just about open video. You can also use it for instant messaging

48:40.200 --> 48:45.200
We've got the little drone sitting down there, which we're about to launch as the Internet of Things

48:45.200 --> 48:50.200
Where you can go and get the video off it via matrix, but you can also control it

48:50.200 --> 48:58.200
We went and hooked up people's cars to matrix so the car kind of sends out telemetry as little blobs of JSON into matrix

48:58.200 --> 49:00.200
And you can go and consume it anywhere else

49:00.200 --> 49:05.200
So basically matrix is a big open decentralized object database with PubSub schematics

49:05.200 --> 49:09.200
So that anybody can publish any random data they want and there could be a message or whatever

49:09.200 --> 49:15.200
And over here on the screen, am I seeing like a persistent group chat environment? Kind of looks like a bit like IRC and messaging

49:15.200 --> 49:20.200
Yeah, so this is one of the classic things you can do with matrix. Use it as a persistent group chat thing

49:20.200 --> 49:26.200
This is an angular environment and there are a couple of hundred chats going on there

49:26.200 --> 49:33.200
A lot of these are bridged into FreeNode. FreeNode have been very cool and let us actually bridge matrix into FreeNode or vice versa

49:33.200 --> 49:41.200
Here is another view of the same room, say, but a more Slack-like environment. This one is written in React

49:41.200 --> 49:49.200
So this is kind of like a team collaboration sort of version of it sitting on top of the matrix object database?

49:49.200 --> 49:55.200
And so I assume in this I could have text, image, video, audio, all those things in here?

49:55.200 --> 50:04.200
Yeah, so any JSON you like. You can hear these are just instant messages with people trying to do weird shit with UTF-8, but if we go back to this one

50:04.200 --> 50:10.200
If you double click on stuff like a message like test there, you can see it is just arbitrary JSON

50:10.200 --> 50:18.200
So it could be a M room message or if you were doing a video call here, it could be a bit uglier

50:18.200 --> 50:22.200
It is a M call invite and you have got the description of the media for that call there

50:22.200 --> 50:26.200
But it could be drone control, it could be car telemetry, whatever the hell

50:26.200 --> 50:29.200
And my program, my app just needs to be able to read this and know what to do with it?

50:29.200 --> 50:35.200
Yep, precisely. So we define some standard types like m.call. Anything that begins with m. is matrix and it is part of our spec

50:35.200 --> 50:45.200
But it is like Java namespace, so if you wanted to have a com.google.whateverthehell Google might use it for, then just feel free, go nuts, put data in

50:45.200 --> 50:51.200
So if I wanted to roll this out, what is my back-end structure look like? Is it a Linux server? What is it running on?

50:51.200 --> 50:59.200
So we are providing one reference server at the moment which is written in Python and Twisted and it is about 30,000 lines of code

50:59.200 --> 51:06.200
It is pretty beta but it works well enough to have rooms with like a thousand people in it and a couple of hundred servers participating

51:06.200 --> 51:11.200
And it runs on any OS that can support Python really

51:11.200 --> 51:20.200
Some of that is, it could be Debian, we have got some Dockerfiles, Susie images, Fedora images and even somebody made it run on Windows

51:20.200 --> 51:23.200
Very cool. I like that. Do you have any questions?

51:23.200 --> 51:34.200
So what does a customizability look like? If I wanted to specify, can I specify video parameters like the codecs I want to use or the size of resolution I want to send, that kind of thing?

51:34.200 --> 51:40.200
So what we do for the actual video on one of these calls, if I am going to put this on the right network, I leave them going to create a demo

51:40.200 --> 51:43.200
That is a great question because that is something we run into all the time

51:43.200 --> 51:48.200
We want to be able to specifically say 720p because we know we have the right bandwidth, the right environments, we built it for that

51:48.200 --> 51:55.200
But a lot of hangouts and Skype, a lot of the consumer solutions, they just automatically decide what they are going to give you and you have no say

51:55.200 --> 52:05.200
Right, so what we do is to slightly punt on the issue and we just use WebRTC which is built into the browser already and we use whatever it gives us

52:05.200 --> 52:11.200
We can, I think there is an idea of intents where you can say, or constraints where you can say how I want it 720p

52:11.200 --> 52:16.200
And if you are lucky then the browser and the camera and the planets will align and you will get what you asked for

52:16.200 --> 52:19.200
So the intent says if the system supports it, give me this?

52:19.200 --> 52:28.200
Yes, precisely, so Matrix is just the signaling, we are relying on whatever else is already hanging around like WebRTC to make that work

52:28.200 --> 52:34.200
Now if I go and try to quickly find Evil Matthew, here is my demo self and say hello there

52:34.200 --> 52:39.200
We are going to go and give Evil Matthew a video call I think, I like that

52:39.200 --> 52:41.200
Okay, so that is, sorry, I am Evil Matthew here

52:41.200 --> 52:43.200
Oh, I see, I see

52:43.200 --> 52:46.200
Oh, I like that, wait

52:46.200 --> 52:49.200
Then this is going and pulling open WebRTC

52:49.200 --> 52:51.200
Yeah, and it just puts it right there in line with the chat

52:51.200 --> 52:59.200
And we should have an inbound call, in fact I got it coming in, in fact that is the previous message coming in on my Apple Watch

52:59.200 --> 53:03.200
But if we go and accept it there, then hopefully

53:03.200 --> 53:11.200
Oh, interesting, so there must be an app running on your phone that is also getting the messages from the call, so you are getting push notifications to your phone too?

53:11.200 --> 53:17.200
Yeah, absolutely, so there we go, that is now just a typical WebRTC call, so it is a 640x480 and it is just a default that you get

53:17.200 --> 53:23.200
But as I say you can put constraints on it to try to get 720p and you can see that I am getting push notifications coming in here

53:23.200 --> 53:30.200
Also on the app from various different channels because we have got iOS and Android apps and about ten different clients

53:30.200 --> 53:36.200
Five of them are from the core team and the rest are from the community, so people have done command line clients using WeChat

53:36.200 --> 53:40.200
There is a Java desktop app, there is a Chrome app, all sorts

53:40.200 --> 53:46.200
If I am a company that was looking at something like Slack, could this be a replacement for that? Could I use this maybe in place of Slack?

53:46.200 --> 53:50.200
Potentially, so the big advantage is that you can run your own server

53:50.200 --> 53:55.200
All of the conversation history here gets replicated over the participating servers

53:55.200 --> 54:04.200
So I can run my own one, you can run your own one and if we are in the same room then no single server or entity or vendor like Slack for instance owns that conversation

54:04.200 --> 54:08.200
It is aggressively decentralized, a bit like Git or Blockchain or something like that

54:08.200 --> 54:10.200
So that is quite a compelling thing

54:10.200 --> 54:16.200
We have also got end-to-end encryption in it using an OTR like thing which is actually better than OTR

54:16.200 --> 54:22.200
And that again makes it kind of interesting because with Slack you have no choice but to just hand all your data over today

54:22.200 --> 54:25.200
Whereas here if you wanted to flip the bit and turn on end-to-end encryption you can

54:25.200 --> 54:30.200
And for the encryption implementation, how much of that is done out in the open? How much of that is open source or documented?

54:30.200 --> 54:32.200
It is all open source under the Apache license

54:32.200 --> 54:40.200
What we did was to take the Axolotl ratchet implementation or specification that Open Whisper Systems have written and released

54:40.200 --> 54:46.200
And it is what WhatsApp uses in TechSecure and we wrote our own clean room implementation of that spec

54:46.200 --> 54:52.200
And it is called OM, O-L-M, you can get it from GitHub, Apache licensed along with the rest of the Matrix code base

54:52.200 --> 54:57.200
Awesome, thank you very much for the information, I am definitely going to check that out because we have been looking at something kind of like that

54:57.200 --> 54:58.200
Appreciate it

54:58.200 --> 55:05.200
I like this more than the standard alternative to going with something proprietary like Slack and it is a neat kind of package all put together

55:05.200 --> 55:09.200
SkookieSprite, you seem kind of impressed by it during the playback, what do you think?

55:09.200 --> 55:14.200
Oh, I mean it sounds like a totally integrated free and open source

55:14.200 --> 55:22.200
I am big about that aspect of it, that means it is accessible, you can audit it, you know that like you said it is your own data

55:22.200 --> 55:28.200
Yeah and for the most part you know Slack is a pretty compelling product but when it is my company and it is like

55:28.200 --> 55:36.200
You know one of the things I think about with something like Slack is it seems like it could be a really good solution for 2015, 2016 and maybe even 2017

55:36.200 --> 55:43.200
Now what happens if Jupiter Broadcasting makes it 30 years, 35 years and I want to look back at sort of like the formative years of the company

55:43.200 --> 55:52.200
I would really, really, really regret having that data either A not available because that company is not around or in some sort of proprietary format that I can't get access to

55:52.200 --> 56:00.200
So having something like that, the collaborative details, where our company was at, owning that to me seems like a part of the company's history

56:00.200 --> 56:07.200
Definitely, you know in my office we used to have a custom back end chat client XMPP based

56:07.200 --> 56:15.200
We have been looking at, you know we are using Slack now but I know there are still some shareholders in the company who are concerned about data flowing outside of our company to someone else

56:15.200 --> 56:25.200
Before that we have been stuck using Pidgin and other XMPP clients so if there is something like this that has a new interface, has more abilities that might be big for a lot of enterprises

56:25.200 --> 56:32.200
It is called Matrix and of course that is a, boy as far as SEO goes that is pretty rough, I have even tried to get links for the show and I had a rough time

56:32.200 --> 56:34.200
I can't believe they got the dot org, that is kind of impressive

56:34.200 --> 56:39.200
Yeah exactly, so you can get it right now, matrix.org and go check it out

56:39.200 --> 56:48.200
So this next thing is, this is the last sort of like businessy sysadmy thing and then we are going to get into some really crazy great stuff

56:48.200 --> 56:59.200
This one though I want to talk about because there is this category that gets kicked around and I think a lot of people associate it with being a hipster, maybe the DevOps category

56:59.200 --> 57:07.200
And it is this one guy or gal and they have got to do one thing, they have got to build code and integrate it with servers and they have got to be able to scale

57:07.200 --> 57:18.200
And they have got to get to thousands of servers and the thing is, it sounds like I am making fun of people but this is an actual job that to me sounds like it would keep me up all night long

57:18.200 --> 57:27.200
Being responsible for thousands of servers when I really just want to create software, I don't really want to be a sysadmin, this sounds like the recipe for an ulcer

57:27.200 --> 57:38.200
And so there is an open source project out there called Mesosphere and Mesosphere, have you heard of this at all, Mesosphere is like a cluster management orchestration suite at a high level

57:38.200 --> 57:41.200
I was just looking at a tutorial the other day, it looks very interesting

57:41.200 --> 57:46.200
Really, so this is one of the people working on it, now I have got to warn you, he is not a public relations person

57:46.200 --> 57:54.200
This was a bit of rental space essentially or free space that GitHub gave out to some open source projects

57:54.200 --> 58:01.200
And so Wes I would be really curious to hear your insights after we play this, I get an idea of Mesosphere Apache cluster management

58:01.200 --> 58:07.200
With my chat in the little area where GitHub has given out space to certain open source projects that they like

58:07.200 --> 58:13.200
So my name is Michael Hausenblatt, I am leading DevOps relations at Mesosphere

58:13.200 --> 58:20.200
And what we have here is Apache Mesosphere, just a resource manager, a top level Apache project

58:20.200 --> 58:29.200
Takes a bunch of nodes in your cluster and abstracts that away making you as a developer who wants to develop

58:29.200 --> 58:36.200
So if I am a developer who is in that DevOps role and I have thousands of servers or hundreds of servers or tens of thousands of servers

58:36.200 --> 58:41.200
That is a massive task for one person to manage and this is trying to make it possible for one person to manage all of that

58:41.200 --> 58:46.200
That is right, and for a person like a developer who wants to write distributed applications

58:46.200 --> 58:50.200
It is really the kernel of a kind of distributed operating system and that is what we do

58:50.200 --> 58:55.200
Now I see here you have one of the key bullet points is that it is fault tolerant in battle test

58:55.200 --> 59:00.200
How does something like this not become a single point of failure that just takes somebody down for the day if it has issues

59:00.200 --> 59:06.200
Very good question, number of components like all of them, like the master and everything is fault tolerant

59:06.200 --> 59:11.200
So you always, whatever fails, everything will fail over to something that is on standby here

59:11.200 --> 59:13.200
So there is really no single point of failure

59:13.200 --> 59:16.200
And in the backend server is it Linux based?

59:16.200 --> 59:18.200
It is Linux based, yes

59:18.200 --> 59:24.200
And then what does that look like from a deployment standpoint, is it an appliance, is it a container, is it a software package I install?

59:24.200 --> 59:29.200
Essentially we have two versions, the community edition which is cloud only, so you can only deploy it in one of the public clouds

59:29.200 --> 59:32.200
The enterprise edition which you can also deploy on-prem

59:32.200 --> 59:35.200
And what is the on-premises one look like, is that more of a

59:35.200 --> 59:39.200
The enterprise edition that also comes with support and a bit of secret sauce

59:39.200 --> 59:47.200
So essentially the guys who used to do Mesos at Twitter and Airbnb taking that experience and productize that

59:47.200 --> 59:50.200
Taking infrastructures like that and fascinating, well thanks for the information

59:50.200 --> 59:51.200
Thank you

59:52.200 --> 59:56.200
So what was your impression when you were researching the product, or I guess the project I should say

59:56.200 --> 01:00:00.200
You know it seems like the Apache Mesos on steroids

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:06.200
Something that even further adds abstractions because the whole big idea here is being able to easily scale

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.200
And maybe not even have to think about it

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.200
It's like you just drag resources around kind of a thing

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.200
Yeah and you can kind of write as if it was all one big resource

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:19.200
Yeah, oh so it gives you tools at a development level

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:21.200
Right, or you can do that

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:26.200
Interesting, well very cool and so where do people, do you have any good recommendations people want to find out more about it

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.200
Anything you found very useful

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.200
You know it looks like there's even a digital ocean tutorial right here, an introduction to Mesosphere

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.200
Look at that, there it is, well there you go, that's actually probably

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.200
That's probably the best bet just as a starting point

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.200
They have technical writers that go through those

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.200
And nice diagrams too

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.200
So have you heard, yeah, cool look at that

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.200
I don't think I have a shot of your machine there, that's me

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.200
No I don't have a shot of your machine but you know what I will for next week

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.200
So have you heard of the company Fastmail before

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.200
Yeah I was just looking at their services the other day

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.200
Are you joking

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.200
I think I saw an advertiser for it and it was kind of interesting

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.200
Yeah are you kidding me right now

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.200
No I'm not, 100%

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:05.200
Yeah I actually, you know I kick around, you know, Jupiter Broadcasting's backend mail is powered by Google Apps

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.200
The usual hand wavy, yeah

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.200
So there's two ways I look at this, lazy practical Chris goes oh man this is great

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.200
I get like all of the stuff I'd want from like a collaboration software without having to run a collaboration software

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.200
And it's really great I just click a button, I can create new accounts for people

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.200
And the web mail is pretty good right

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.200
And the calendaring is great

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.200
And so that's practical Chris right

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.200
And then tinfoil hat Edward Snowden following Chris goes

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:35.200
Hey man, you know you're getting emails from people in Iran, from China, in Russia

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:40.200
And they're all landing in this Google inbox that anybody could just go we'd like to have access to Mr.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.200
And so like sometimes that's when it's like I have these two competing voices in my head

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.200
And they all, you know what they both agree on, they both argue with each other constantly

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.200
Except for every now and then they go you know you could check out Fastmail

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.200
And then I go oh really

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.200
And then I start, so then like Fastmail has been building up momentum

01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.200
And so I was walking around OSCON and I bumped into the Fastmail folks

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.200
And I thought gosh I've really been thinking about this

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.200
And I wonder how much of their infrastructure is Linux based

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.200
What is their participation in open source because

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.200
I was wondering exactly those same things when I was looking at their site

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:15.200
Right exactly and I'm thinking if I maybe make the switch I want to you know I want to vote with my wallet again

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.200
I mean I want to make the right choice and so I sat down sort of to vet Fastmail for myself

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.200
And vet Fastmail for Jupiter Broadcasting

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:28.200
Fastmail is email done right, really email, calendars and contacts done right these days

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:34.200
We do hosting for all of those for individuals or businesses

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:39.200
And we just do it really well, we have our own interface

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:44.200
Which is much faster and more powerful and more elegant than our competitors

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:50.200
And we also do a lot with open source software which is why we're here at OSCON this week

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:55.200
Very interesting, so somebody like me who's on Google Apps might want to find something maybe a little different

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.200
Maybe I'm not as comfortable with Google Apps as I used to be

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:04.200
And I love that you use open source, that would definitely play into my decision just as an open source advocate myself

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.200
How does open source play into Fastmail?

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:12.200
So the core IMAP server that we use to host everyone's email is Cyrus

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:15.200
Which is one of the two biggest open source IMAP servers

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.200
It was started by Carnegie Mellon University about 20 years ago now I think

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:26.200
And for at least the last 5 years, probably 10 years, Fastmail has been the biggest contributor to that project

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:32.200
My colleague Bron is probably the main developer and leads the project these days

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.200
We also have a couple of others now working full time on it

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.200
So we make huge contributions to that

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:42.200
We also have a huge number of open source Perl libraries that we've made available

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:46.200
That we built as part of our middleware which is built in Perl

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:52.200
And also more recently we have open sourced a couple of JavaScript libraries that we use to power our web interface

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.200
The most popular of which being the Squire rich text editor

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:03.200
Which is now getting quite a lot of attention, 3000 GitHub stars or so

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:09.200
So indulge me if you will on the backend, are we seeing Fastmail run on Linux servers? Is it on Windows boxes?

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.200
What's sort of the backend infrastructure look like? Is that open source too?

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.200
So yeah most of the backend stuff is open source

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:21.200
We run on Linux, we certainly don't run on Windows

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.200
I think there's one or two Windows machines in the office somewhere

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.200
Any Linux desktops in the office?

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.200
There are quite a few Linux desktops in the office

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:37.200
It's pretty much a split between Mac and Linux or Linux run on a Mac in some cases

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.200
And I think there's one guy using Windows because someone has to just to make sure it still works

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.200
You've got to blame somebody for the network spam

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:49.200
Well exactly, so the backend is mainly run on Linux

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:57.200
And I believe we publish most of the things we do, certainly anything that's interesting to our GitHub account

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:02.200
That includes our custom patches on Cyrus and various things like that

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.200
So check out the GitHub page for that stuff

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.200
Great well thank you very much for the information

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.200
Thank you

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.200
I love that, that was a great chat

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:13.200
It was cool to find out how much of their infrastructure actually uses Linux

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.200
Were you impressed now that somebody was looking up their services?

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.200
Yeah you know that definitely speaks to the organization where they're going, what they're based on

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.200
Also there's other great services out there like Colab and other things to check out as well

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.200
So it's a good time out there

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.200
And then we have our last interview

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.200
This one was a fun one because not only is he a listener of Linux Unplugged and the Linux Action Show

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:40.200
Which I've got to say, the Samsung booth was not going to get any attention by us this year

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:47.200
Except for this guy was here because last year they had a really nice passionate guy from Korea who didn't speak English

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.200
And the thing is, it's pretty hard to interview somebody who doesn't speak English

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:54.200
And so what they did this year is they doubled down on the amount of engineers

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:58.200
So they brought in a lot more engineers who are all from Korea

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:02.200
But they also brought in people who were familiar with the products and spoke English

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:06.200
And so what you got to see is people who were insanely passionate about the products

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.200
And one of the things that doesn't come across because this is an audio interview

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:14.200
Is we were, once he started talking, all of the engineers huddled around to listen to what he had to say

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.200
They all wanted to know, it was really intense

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.200
But what was great is because we were doing the audio interview, it was just a very natural

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.200
Hey let's walk up and take a look

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.200
And it just sort of, the conversation unfolded

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:29.200
And this is one of my favorite kind of, it just happened because I was recording exclusively for Linux Unplugged

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.200
Now I'm here at the Samsung booth and I saw a Tizen sign, a big Tizen sign here

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.200
And I was like, wow, look at this thing, I've got to take a look

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.200
And while I was noticing that, Noah noticed a very slick looking phone

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.200
What grabbed your attention about this phone, Noah?

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:44.200
Honestly, it looks like an iPhone but it's made by Samsung

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.200
That's the first thing that's coming to my mind

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.200
It looks like it's smaller, it's maybe an older one, right?

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.200
Right, yeah, yeah, older iPhone maybe

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:54.200
But it has the traditional Samsung things you'd expect

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.200
Like a home button on here and all the things

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.200
But it doesn't run Android

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.200
No, so when I turned it on, it actually, look at this Chris

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.200
When you turn this phone on, it actually, it looks almost like the Android unlocker

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.200
When I unlock it, it kind of, it resembles Android

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.200
A little cleaner UI maybe

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.200
Right, and the first thing that caught me were these applications down here

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.200
And then obviously the home screen

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.200
Oh I like that, I like the way it displays that

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.200
So I thought to help put all this together, maybe we could talk to an expert here

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:21.200
So Ben's here at the Samsung booth, hey Ben, welcome to Linux Unplugged

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.200
Hi there, it's nice to meet you guys

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.200
Hello, so can you tell us, what the heck is Noah holding here and what's different about this phone?

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.200
So that phone is the first phone that runs Tizen

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:34.200
Which Tizen is our own open source operating system that

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.200
It's basically just a Linux distribution that we've added a few APIs

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:44.200
To give you access to device functionality like sensors and your cell networks and things like that

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:49.200
It's really great because it lets you write applications in just straight C++

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.200
Just like a standard Linux application

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:56.200
You can also write apps using web native languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.200
So it kind of gets the best of both worlds

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:03.200
You've got the systems side of things that let you get really efficient C++ apps

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.200
But then you've also got the simplicity of your web native languages

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:12.200
So I've wondered, I notice Samsung obviously pretty well known for their Android devices

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.200
You might have noticed this too

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.200
And when I look at this device, not only does it feel like a pretty well built phone

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.200
Because it's a Samsung and they've got some experience with that

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.200
But the UI, especially in the notifications tray here

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.200
Reminds me a little bit of TouchWiz on my S6

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:32.200
And so where does Samsung see Tizen fitting in with something like the S6 and TouchWiz?

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:35.200
You could almost tell me this was a TouchWiz device

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.200
But then I noticed a few differences

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.200
Could I maybe see this on a US phone in the future?

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.200
Where does Samsung see it all fitting in?

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.200
Honestly I can't really answer questions about products like that

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.200
Because I'm not really privy to that information

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:53.200
I do know that we're trying to get Tizen on as many different types of devices as possible

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.200
I notice it's not just phones

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.200
Is this a DSLR here?

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.200
And then we've got a watch here too

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.200
Tell me about the DSLR widget

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:06.200
It's a pretty full featured camera that runs Tizen

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.200
Why Tizen on a camera?

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.200
Honestly I can't

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.200
You need an OS, a camera needs an OS right?

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.200
I mean they're pretty sophisticated I guess

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:18.200
I'll tell you, one of the great benefits of Tizen is it's better for

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.200
Since everything runs in C++

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.200
It's better for devices that have lower memory, lower CPU power

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.200
Which is why we also put it on our TVs

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.200
Because if you're trying to put something like Android

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.200
It's going to bog it down with all the overhead from Java

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.200
Yeah, Tizen's going to get a lot better performance

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.200
And so that's probably also why it's on the watches right?

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200
Yeah, that's correct

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.200
And so tell me about the process of that

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.200
When Samsung goes out there

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:44.200
Didn't they first try these with Android?

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.200
And then they decided to switch it to Tizen?

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.200
Was it performance?

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.200
Can you tell me a little bit why Tizen was there?

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.200
Because so many devices these days have Android Wear

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.200
As a consumer I almost expect Android Wear

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.200
So I would kind of wonder why Tizen

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.200
And there must be some advantages

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.200
Yeah, well if I'm not mistaken

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.200
I think we actually released Tizen watches

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:05.200
Pretty long before Android Wear even came out

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.200
But that was actually really where it started for us

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.200
And once again it's because on a watch

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:12.200
You're not going to have very much CPU power

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.200
You're not going to have a whole lot of memory

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:17.200
So you have to have an operating system that's pretty efficient to run on

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.200
And as a community member

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.200
Can I contribute to Tizen?

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.200
And could those changes eventually show up on a Samsung device?

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:27.200
Yeah, so Tizen 3.0 is a completely collaborative open source project

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:29.200
Anyone can pull it off of

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.200
I think we have it on GitHub

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.200
Actually no, I think it's a separate Git repo

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.200
But anyone can pull it down

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.200
And make contributions to it

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:38.200
And send it back upstream

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.200
All of these devices are actually based on Tizen 2.3

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.200
Which was developed internally by Samsung

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:45.200
And released as open source

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.200
So the changes wouldn't show up on these devices

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:53.200
But in the future we're hoping to get some more devices that run Tizen 3.0

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.200
Very, very neat

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.200
And so if I wanted to take a little look at some of this stuff

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.200
Maybe learn more about Tizen

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.200
Or learn about creating apps for it

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.200
Where do I go?

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.200
You can check out developer.tizen.org

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.200
And that's got all the information for

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:07.200
It's got an API for learning about

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.200
Or API documentation for learning about

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.200
All of the functionality that we've provided

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.200
Yeah, so that's good

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.200
Very good

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.200
Well, Ben, thank you very much

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.200
I've got to check out this Camera Resin Tizen

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.200
Are you playing with that right now?

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.200
Yeah, I am

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.200
So one of the things I noticed is

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:29.200
I'm not sure if this technically qualifies as a DSLR

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.200
Because it looks like there's just an LCD inside of here

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.200
But look at that

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.200
Yeah, exactly

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.200
If I can figure out how to get back to the plate

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.200
The picture is super sharp

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.200
So I turn the aperture down

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.200
Look at how much blur we have

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.200
Oh, it's touchscreen

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.200
We get all this blur in the background

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.200
And look at this right here

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.200
You've got a little pull-down menu right there

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.200
How slick is that?

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.200
Well, the thing I can see that would be advantageous about this is

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.200
Chris, is we can take these pictures

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.200
And then we can go and just upload them straight to Twitter

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.200
So you get all the benefits that you would expect

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.200
From a professional camera

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.200
So that's Wi-Fi now?

01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.200
With the advantage of a smartphone

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.200
Oh, I would assume so, yeah

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.200
Wow, check that out

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.200
Boy, welcome to the future

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.200
Share with Wi-Fi

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.200
That might be my next camera

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:05.200
A Linux running camera?

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.200
I've got to have that

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.200
It was pretty neat

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.200
And you know what?

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.200
It was really responsive

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.200
You would have thought it was a custom-built operating system

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.200
Just for that camera

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.200
It was super snappy

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.200
So to have all this kind of nice, slick UI and features

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.200
On a little camera like that was pretty cool

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:24.200
Has anyone else really embraced Tizen?

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:27.200
Because that seems like where it might be really interesting

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.200
Is to have a non-Android platform that other people could take

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.200
Yeah, I mean, it made sense on the watches, too

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.200
It was interesting

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.200
We'll see where it goes

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.200
I asked them, of course

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.200
They couldn't give me an answer on when we're going to get that stuff in the US

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.200
Of course

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.200
That would be too fun

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.200
That would be the key thing

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:42.200
That would really be the key thing

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.200
So that's Scratching the Surface

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.200
Of course, we have another two hours of OSCON coverage

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.200
In this week's episode of the Linux Action Show

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.200
Well, not really two hours

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.200
About 45 minutes, 50 minutes

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.200
In episode 375 of the Linux Action Show

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.200
OSCON 2015

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:58.200
And you can go check that out if you want even more

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.200
Also, in the show notes

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:02.200
Because I'm a good guy

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:07.200
I also posted a playlist of just the OSCON interviews from the Linux Action Show

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.200
If you don't want to watch the whole episode, you can watch

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.200
Tired of Chris

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200
You just want the OSCON business

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.200
You got it

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.200
There you go

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.200
Yeah, because it's all Noah in the interviews

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:17.200
All right, so we've got to talk about this Skunkworks project

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.200
In development deep inside the community from Las Vegas

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.200
But first, I want to talk about Linux Academy

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:28.200
The third sponsor and final sponsor right here on the Linux Unplugged program

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.200
I've been a Linux Academy customer for about a month before they became a sponsor

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:37.200
And when I decided to work with them and have them become sponsors

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.200
We said, my conversation started literally like this

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:47.200
I almost don't want you to be sponsors because this was my idea

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.200
I wanted to do this

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:51.200
Like if I knew everything I knew now

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.200
Almost 10 years into the Linux Action Show looking back

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:56.200
This is so brilliant

01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:00.200
Because you have to have the passion for Linux and open source to build a platform like this

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:01.200
And that I've got

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.200
But I don't have the connections to the education community and the development community

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.200
And that's what Linux Academy had

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:10.200
But it's so genius because it's exactly what we need as a community

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.200
It's like all of those big name online education sites you've heard

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.200
But specifically around Linux and open source

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.200
So instead of just like Linux and open source being a check box

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.200
And they're multi-category of things they cover

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:24.200
From everything from Adobe After Effects to replacing the oil in your truck

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.200
Like that's just for them it's a feature, right?

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.200
But for Linux Academy it's their life

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.200
It's their passion

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.200
So they came together as Linux enthusiasts and educators and developers

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.200
And they built the Linux Academy platform

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:36.200
And that was the missing piece

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.200
Is what we really really needed

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:41.200
Is somebody who's truly enthusiastic and creating incredible content

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.200
I remember when I was starting in Linux

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.200
There was like the Linux documentation project

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.200
And there was the Gen 2 Wiki

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.200
And all of these things were really good resources

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.200
But they were not legitimate resources that I could tell my employer about

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.200
That they could go towards my employment

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.200
Educational reimbursement

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.200
It could show up on my review

01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.200
There was team account support

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.200
Like it didn't meet any of those criterias

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.200
The best I had were books

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.200
It was horrible

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.200
LinuxAcademy.com

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.200
Go there and check them out

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.200
Go to Linux Academy right now

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.200
In fact, if you go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:15.200
You can get our 33% discount to really try them out for a little while

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200
Isn't that slick?

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.200
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.200
You have step-by-step video courses

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.200
Downloadable comprehensive study guides

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:25.200
They have a great system where you can choose from 7 plus Linux distributions

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.200
They'll automatically adjust the courseware and the virtual machines

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.200
They spin up for you on demand

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.200
You want to know about AWS

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.200
You want to know about Red Hat certification

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.200
Docker, virtualization

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.200
Just doing backups on a Linux rig

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.200
Building out an entire LAMP stack

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.200
Or maybe Android development on the Linux desktop

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.200
Linux Academy has courseware on it

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.200
You want to learn Ruby, Python, things like that

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.200
Anything that's an ecosystem around Linux and open source

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.200
Linux Academy has courseware on it because they love it

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.200
And they also have just introduced a new feature called Nuggets

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:53.200
Between 2 and 60 minute courses we just deep dive on a topic

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.200
Nice things too like IP tables

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:58.200
Or rsync backup or virtualization in VirtualBox

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.200
Headless virtualization under VirtualBox

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.200
And if you're ready to go get those Red Hat certified engineer certifications

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.200
The ones that are basically

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:09.200
What I remember when I was doing interviews

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.200
I would look at somebody's resume

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.200
And there's a few that would really stand out

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.200
The ones that I really respected

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.200
And definitely I would count the Red Hat certifications among them

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:22.200
Because you really have to actually earn that certification

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.200
It's no joke

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.200
It's a hands on kind of testing

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.200
Where you really have to work with the technology

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.200
And prove you can do it over and over again

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.200
And as an interviewer you know that

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.200
And it's a big deal that Linux Academy has some of the best courseware on the web on this

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.200
And you can go get it right now at a 33% discount

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.200
When you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.200
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.200
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.200
For sponsoring the unplugged program

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.200
Oh man I love the Red Hat certified stuff

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.200
They are really working overtime on that

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.200
Now I am excited to talk to Mr. Skookiesprite

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.200
It's been a while since he's been on the show

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.200
And I guess it is downtime he's been working on

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.200
I believe it's called the Radio Controller Project

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.200
Or something along those lines

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.200
Skookiesprite what is it and what's the name?

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.200
Radio Control Room Project

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.200
Control Room

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:10.200
Yeah RCRproject.com

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:13.200
Yeah okay so what is it?

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.200
It enables users to create

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.200
From their own local files

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:23.200
Autonomously self generating programmatic streaming radio

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.200
So like if I want to be a DJ

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.200
Like if I had a whole library of music

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.200
And I wanted to be a DJ for a weekend

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.200
Can I use this?

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.200
Yeah but what's even cooler

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.200
Okay so I got the idea because I have 56,000 MP3 files

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.200
All of them legitimately ripped from my own CD collection

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:43.200
Which I donated to the VA library

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.200
And a bunch of vinyl

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.200
So I'm thinking 56,000 MP3 files

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.200
How am I ever going to listen to them?

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:52.200
How am I ever going to even create playlists

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.200
For what I want to hear at any given time right?

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.200
Like are you following me there?

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.200
Yeah absolutely

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:03.200
Yeah okay so I thought well what if I had a way for

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.200
I like radio a lot

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.200
And what makes radio good

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.200
The thing that makes radio good is their programs

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200
You just turn it on

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:12.200
You turn it on and you don't have to think about it

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.200
It's just the music you love is playing

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.200
Exactly or at certain times

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:20.200
There are programs that are playing certain different types of music

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:23.200
So what if I could make a program that would just

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.200
Make all of these programs

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.200
Like radio programs

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:32.200
And stream them all as like one streaming radio thing

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.200
But it sounds like real radio

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:36.200
And this could be like running on my own server in my house

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.200
That I could hook up to internet

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.200
And it does like an ice cast stream in my phone

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.200
Yeah okay so where the rubber meets the road

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.200
Is ice cast and liquid soap

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.200
But what RCR adds to it

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.200
Is like basically the controller that sits on top of it

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.200
I've run it off of

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.200
Right now it runs off of one of my laptops

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.200
Which I use as my daily driver pretty much

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:03.200
And it spits it out to a digital ocean droplet

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.200
And anyone can listen to it

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:08.200
And the really exciting thing is tune in radio now

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:13.200
You can sign up with tune in radio for free

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:15.200
That's the other thing

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.200
I don't like Pandora and stuff

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.200
Where it's like oh well fine

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.200
We want to access your preferences

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.200
Plus you want to use your own library

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.200
Not Pandora's library

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.200
Absolutely and the other cool thing is

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.200
You can set up every aspect of the shows

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.200
You can decide when a show starts

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.200
The type of bumpers it has

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.200
The intros outros

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.200
It has back and outs

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.200
Now you're going to put me out of work

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.200
You're just automating my job now?

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.200
Pretty much that's what I kind of wanted to do

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.200
Okay cool

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.200
I was cutting straight for you Chris

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.200
So I'm gathering this is a closed source project

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.200
Released under a Microsoft license?

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.200
Absolutely no

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:59.200
No it's totally built on a free and open source stack

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.200
Like I said like you said liquid soap

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.200
And ice cast

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.200
And then this is built on top of it

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:09.200
And we're adding an HTML interface for it

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.200
Right now you configure your shows

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:14.200
By actual text files and stuff

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.200
Which is not that bad

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.200
Because there's a lot of stuff to configure

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.200
So could a person say like

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.200
In somebody in our chat room for example

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.200
Could they string together a few chapters

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.200
Of an old time radio series or an audio book

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:29.200
And kind of have like a weekly serial that broadcasts?

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.200
Yes absolutely

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.200
That's cool

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.200
The latest Unstable bill

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.200
Because like basically

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.200
The coolest thing about RCR

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.200
Is that it makes sure

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.200
It has several checks in terms of like what gets added

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.200
Okay here

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.200
So like when you create a show

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.200
You select from all of these different directories

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.200
Or all of these individual files

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.200
That you want to have played

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.200
And it actually has checks

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.200
That you can turn on or off

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:59.200
Like global freshness factor for instance

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.200
So only every six hours

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.200
Before any song repeats

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.200
Across any show

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.200
Et cetera et cetera et cetera

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.200
So it's designed to randomize

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.200
So that you hear stuff that you wouldn't normally

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.200
Hear if you were

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.200
That's pretty cool

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.200
And so the link to the project

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.200
Which you can also just find at rcrproject.com

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.200
We'll have a link in the show notes

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.200
And eventually

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.200
I'll just have this doing Linux Unplugged in the future

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:27.200
You won't even know

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.200
It'll just be powered by this thing

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.200
Linux Unplugged from a distance from Las Vegas

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.200
No that's the coolest thing is you get to be

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.200
The puppet master you get to create

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:37.200
Okay so the hardest thing about creating your own

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.200
Streaming radio station that doesn't suck

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.200
Is actually being there to create your own

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.200
Program to DJ in

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.200
I mean like hell who has the time

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.200
To DJ you know 24 hours of programming

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.200
A day well now you can without having

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.200
To be there boom boom

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.200
There you go now we're going to need a jobs

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.200
Program for all those DJs that are getting put out of work by

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.200
Scooby Sprite but it's cool in the name of

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.200
The source it's cool so check out

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.200
We'll have a link in the show notes if you guys

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.200
Want to check it out and that'll bring us towards the end

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.200
Of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:07.200
Wes I'm glad you could make it out even after the big move

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.200
Congrats to the new place

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.200
Well thank you sir pleasure to be here

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.200
The new digs in Seattle and big thanks to

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.200
The folks at OSCON who

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.200
Interviewed us and thanks to

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.200
Noah of course for making it out there with me

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.200
And you know I gotta say I really really

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.200
Enjoyed taking this

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.200
You know all of the interviews we did for Linux Unplugged

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.200
Were just on this little portable recorder

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.200
And I think it got some really great chats

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.200
Because it's more disarming

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.200
Than having a big video camera in your face

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.200
And I loved it was a good

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.200
It was a good fun opportunity for me to just

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.200
Focus on doing interviews for an audio only show

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.200
And I think it made for a much more enjoyable

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:43.200
OSCON for me so there's a

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.200
Lesson in that for all of us but I want to invite

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.200

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.200
Yeah Wimpy you got a lot of coverage didn't you

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.200
Oh boy I didn't

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.200
Realize honestly I thought

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:39.200
Like 20 comments

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.200
On my G Plus stream were

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.200
The size of it I had no idea yeah I was

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.200
Surprised when I saw the amount of coverage I got I was like

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.200
Wow this is an issue that resonates

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.200
With people OSCON

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:51.200
Secret sauce is in what's interesting is that

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.200
There's more

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.200
People saying

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.200
Don't remove it than there are people

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.200
Agreeing with removing it so

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.200
That's cause crazy people outnumber us

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.200
Yeah you know you know Wimpy

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.200
My only experience with

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.200
That is at a certain point

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:09.200
You gotta go with your gut

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.200
And despite oh yeah

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.200
I mean you know I'm getting feedback

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:15.200
Right now that would literally

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.200
Would literally be suicide for the show

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.200
If I followed it and I get it over and over again

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.200
And I've got a fresh batch of it today

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:23.200
There's an active thread in our subreddit

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.200
And it just

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:27.200
It really shows you how sometimes

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.200
The reason why you're the person making

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.200
The content is because you are willing

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.200
To take these risks

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.200
And so you know you can't

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:37.200
You gotta move forward

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.200
I think it's a beautiful thing to do because worst case

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.200
Is you can always put it back in the next release

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.200
So what if

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.200
It's already there yeah

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.200
If you could wave a magic wand and

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.200
Fix software center what would you do

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.200
Like you know

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.200
Other than removing it what's the

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.200
Magic wand fix for software center?

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:57.200
I wouldn't bring it to the ground

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.200
Are you asking me or is that a general question?

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.200
It's a general question

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:03.200
Yeah

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.200
Okay so one the

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.200
Developers having access to the

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.200
Paid section of the Ubuntu software center

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.200
And not having access to do

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.200
Anything at all on the

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.200
Open source thing that sucks

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.200
I don't understand what you're saying

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.200
If I create

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.200
If I put an app in the Ubuntu software center that is

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.200
Completely free

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.200
But it's on the paid section

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.200
I can control the source of the app and I can

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.200
Actually update it myself and I can do

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.200
Whatever I want I can change descriptions I can change

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.200
The photos and all that good stuff

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.200
If I have my app in the open source side of it

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.200
And I have absolutely zero

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.200
Control and I have to just

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.200
Beg and beg and beg for them to do anything

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.200
Rod and wasn't that the

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.200
Thing like they wouldn't update you went through

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.200
Several updates of your own project

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.200
And they wouldn't update it?

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:51.200
Yeah it took me a year to get my stuff updated

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.200
That's less of a Ubuntu software

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.200
I accept that's an issue

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.200
That's less of an Ubuntu software center issue

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.200
Having that split

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.200
Is irritating the fact that I

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.200
Can't control that is incredibly

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.200
Irritating but also

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.200
As an end user

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.200
The recommendation

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.200
System is pretty much

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:13.200
Useless because it's based on your

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.200
Account that you don't have yet

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:17.200
So then you'd have to create the account which the Ubuntu

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.200
One thing which then they announced that Ubuntu

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.200
One was going away but they really weren't taking

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.200
It away it was just the music

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:25.200
I know I just explained

01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:27.200
What I meant anyway it created

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.200
Confusion it created confusion

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:31.200
Because Ubuntu

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.200
One music is called Ubuntu One

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.200
And no one called it Ubuntu One music

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.200
It confused people so then now

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.200
There's actually people who do say that

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.200
It's gone and I've had to explain

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.200
To them no it's not it's still there

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.200
It's just confusing

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.200
We just wish that it was gone

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:49.200
No I actually

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:51.200
Explained anyway it doesn't matter

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.200
The point is though there is

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.200
A situation with

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:57.200
The listings

01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.200
Of what you have installed

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.200
Is

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.200
Only available when you're logged into your account

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.200
So you can't look to see

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.200
What you actually have installed on your

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.200
Computer in the software center unless

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.200
You have it logged in

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.200
That's people that have actually used it

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.200
Your complaints Rodden are all from complaints people

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.200
That have ever used it I think the first impression

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.200
It's also incredibly slow

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:21.200
That's what I'm aiming at

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.200
The search is incredibly awful

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.200
The search is absolutely terrible

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.200
The search is bad but hold on hold on

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:29.200
I'm asking this from the perspective of

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.200
Someone who's installing Ubuntu Mate

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:33.200
So someone who's installing Ubuntu Mate

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.200
They're going to be affected by the fact that this is missing

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.200
So those are people who are doing a clean install

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.200
Those are new users these are not people who've already

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.200
Got like hundreds of pounds spent

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.200
In the Ubuntu store so I'm saying from the perspective

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.200
Of someone who's experiencing

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.200
Ubuntu software center in

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.200
Something like Mate or any other desktop

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.200
For that matter what

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.200
Other than it being slow I appreciate it is slow

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.200
And I hear that quite a lot what

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.200
What else is wrong with the software

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.200
Center itself I'll tell you what

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.200
No I'll tell you the search actually

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:03.200
Moves itself based on different parts of

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.200
Where you are in the software center so if you actually

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.200
Do a search you go to a

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.200
You go to any of the

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.200
Items for the results you no longer

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.200
Have your search box you have to revert

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.200
Back to two previous pages

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.200
Before you find your search box again

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:19.200
Yeah that is awful

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:21.200
Here's what it is

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:23.200
And I think why I care is because

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.200
It's at a big picture

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.200
What the Linux desktop screws up

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:29.200
All the time it's like if we can't

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.200
Do it right let's not do it

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.200
At all because then it's just

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:35.200
Compared to what Mac and Windows

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.200
Is doing and so if we have

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.200
A software store it has

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.200
To be comparable to what

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.200
I understand it existed before the

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.200
Mac app store did and before the Windows 10

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:47.200
Software store did but now it also

01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:49.200
Exists in a world where those things do exist

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:51.200
And where a lot of people are coming from

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.200
Yeah and so I feel like

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.200
It sort of personifies that

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.200
Poor knockoff

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.200
Sort of

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.200
Reputation that the commenters on Engadget

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.200
Give Ubuntu all the time

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.200
Chris let me put you this way

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.200
I tried to get my now

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:09.200
Ex-girlfriend and no it was not because

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.200
The Ubuntu software store

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:13.200
But it was close

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.200
I tried to get her to

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.200
Jump onto Ubuntu and

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.200
I'm like oh well just look on

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.200
Whatever they have because I'm used to all these other

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.200
Distributions and she's like no but this doesn't work

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.200
She's looking for something that

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.200
Could manage her photos better

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.200
And there's no

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.200
Alternatives to is so much

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:33.200
Better that's where I think

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:35.200
Yeah you do exist in this world where

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:37.200
The software other competing

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:39.200
Things exist and yeah

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.200
It should have been fixed two years ago but

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:43.200
I think the web version is better what were you going to say?

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.200
They actually have their own

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.200
They have a better version that's their website

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.200
Appstabuntu.com

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.200
I know but that's how much ships with

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.200
The OS

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.200
Well it doesn't matter you go to it

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.200
Regardless and they can put a link in the

01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.200
Launcher that just opens that website

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.200
In a frame kind of thing

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.200
How about in a scope?

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.200
Yeah put it

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.200
Right up there in the dash

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.200
I made a video about ten months ago

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.200
Explaining why the USC versus

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.200
That website

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.200
Appstabuntu.com that is

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.200
Such a better solution

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:19.200
It was myself and Poppy and you

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.200
Rotten that were having a discussion a lot

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.200
Like this ten months ago that prompted

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.200
You to make that video

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:27.200
Because I had not heard of Appstabuntu.com

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:29.200
When we were

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:31.200
Oh yeah that's true

01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.200
I like Appstabuntu.com

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.200
The problem is that that's not

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.200
Maintained either because you'll find that

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.200
It's not perfect

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:41.200
I haven't got entries for the current versions

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:43.200
Right it's not perfect but the search

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.200
Results work

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.200
If it was faster

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.200
If it was faster

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.200
Had better search results and didn't

01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:53.200
Bother doing recommendations based on

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:55.200
Stuff it doesn't know about

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:57.200
You

01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:59.200
It's just

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:01.200
I would rather it be able to scan what I

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.200
Already have rather than

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.200
Require me to create an account

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:07.200
Log into the account

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.200
Give them permission to see my install

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.200
So if it just looks at your existing

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.200
Packages on your machine

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.200
Without going off to the cloud or anything like that

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.200
Right it just streamlined it and made it simpler

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.200
And some people might

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.200
Go oh well I don't want them to see

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.200
What I have installed it's like well it's local

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:25.200
Anyway it doesn't matter it's only telling

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.200
You what it sees

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:29.200
Here's a couple things right here's the really

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:31.200
Depressing thing is this is the same

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.200
Commentary that Matt and I have made

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:35.200
On the Linux action show for the last couple of years

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.200
You guys had this conversation as recent as 10

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:39.200
Months ago and I think the reason why

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.200
Wimpy's story got so much traction is

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:43.200
Because it's now just gotten into the general

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:45.200
Ubuntu community's mind that the software center

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:47.200
Is a total train wreck and that's

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.200
Why that story picked up momentum is because

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:51.200
It's just a general shared consensus

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.200
Now and Poppy I love you but

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.200
Like I gotta say like

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.200
Chris is totally right I remember when this show was

01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.200
Started that was when I started listening to it

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:01.200
We were still talking about it in my opinion

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:03.200
Just so you know whether you love me or hate me

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.200
Doesn't take away from the fact that

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.200
Software center sucks I can handle

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:09.200
Wimpy you are getting

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.200
Such a tiny

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.200
Percentage of the people that are following

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:15.200
This story commenting saying you shouldn't get rid

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.200
Of it because the amount of momentum

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.200
And distribution this story has got

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.200
Is so proportionally outweighing

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:23.200
The amount of comments you're getting about why it should

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.200
Be removed it's just really hard to see that

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.200
Until you've been through this cycle a few

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.200
Dozen times it's obvious just by the

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.200
By the sheer amount of momentum the story

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:33.200
Got that it is a shared consensus

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.200
By a lot of people it doesn't mean by everybody

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.200
But I'd say it's a majority

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.200
So

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.200
Poppy asked the question how

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.200
Would we I

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.200
Fix the Ubuntu software center

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:47.200
My answer to that is

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.200
Primarily I look to my immediate

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:51.200
Family and the close friends

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.200
Of mine that run Ubuntu Marte

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.200
That are not

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:57.200
Super technical computer users

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.200
They use it because it's familiar and they

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.200
Know how to get stuff done using it

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.200
They can use the Ubuntu

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.200
Software center just fine they're

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.200
They've been using some of them

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:09.200
Have been using Ubuntu for six

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.200
Years or more some have been using it

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.200
For a year 18 months

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.200
They see that as a perfectly

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.200
Usable tool so for them I

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.200
Don't need to change it but what you

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.200
Said Chris is absolutely right

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.200
The undercurrent of

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.200
Feeling about the Ubuntu software

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.200
Center is that it's not very

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.200
Good anymore and

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.200
You hear that enough times

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:33.200
And I'm in a position where

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.200
I can make a change hopefully for the better

01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.200
So this change

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.200
I'm ushering in by removing Ubuntu

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.200
Software center as the default installed

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.200
App store is

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:45.200
Because people that

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.200
Are familiar with the Ubuntu community

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.200
And have been a part of it for a long time

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.200
Generally seem to have

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:53.200
This collective feeling that the Ubuntu software

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.200
Is not that great and it should

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:57.200
Be replaced with something better and what I'm

01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.200
Providing is the choice

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.200
For those people to make

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.200
That decision so they can choose to stay

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.200
With the Ubuntu software center or

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:07.200
They can use app grid and potentially

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:09.200
A third way as well and we'll see if

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.200
That pans out in the future

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.200
It's giving the users the choice

01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:15.200
And for those of you that aren't familiar with

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.200
Ubuntu mate welcome it

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.200
Pops up on

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.200
First login you've probably seen these

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.200
Welcome screens from other distributions

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.200
So the ability

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.200
To click the software button and

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.200
See this option to install an app

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.200
Store is right there in front of

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:33.200
Every new install every

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.200
New user on the system

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.200
So it's not tucked away or

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.200
Hidden it's front and center

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.200
I think that's a good compromise

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.200
I like it

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:45.200
And it is a compromise

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:47.200
But we'll see whether

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:49.200
It's a good decision or not and maybe

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:51.200
Maybe for beta 1 or beta 2 we have

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:53.200
A change of policy but you know

01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:55.200
Ubuntu software centers future

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.200
Is maybe you should just keep

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.200
Alternating it like each

01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:01.200
Release just like rip it out put it back

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:03.200
Hey what could go wrong

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:05.200
I know that Ubuntu mate

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:07.200
Is sort of a throwback to how Ubuntu

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.200
Used to be but I'm not going to swap out

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:11.200
Major applications every cycle

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.200
Remember you know rhythm box

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.200
In f-spot out you remember

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.200
How it was I'm not doing that

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:35.200
Oh lord
