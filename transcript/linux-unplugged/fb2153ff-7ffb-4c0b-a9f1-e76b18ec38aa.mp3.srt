1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
This is CNN Breaking News.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,680
We're learning this now in the Jupiter Broadcasting Studios, Linux 5.8 is out.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,160
Wes, you're on the scene right now reporting outside Linus Torvalds' house.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
What are you learning?

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,160
Oh my, Chris!

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,880
We've got AMD GPU trusted memory zone, TMZ, support for encrypted video memory, also some

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,920
new user space patches for Mesa.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:35,240
Wes, I can't believe you let me get away with that.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,000
Hello friends and welcome into 365 of your weekly Linux talk show.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
My name is Chris.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
My name is Wes.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Wes, quite the show today.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,080
Not only are we going to make you an online audio pro with our favorite headsets, but

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,520
we're going to tell you why everybody's making a big deal out of BootHole, some other

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,720
community news and your feedback, as well as some follow-up stuff from a couple episodes

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,720
ago.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,160
It's a well-rounded episode and to help us sort through it all, Drew's joining us here.

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
Hello, Drew.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
Hello.

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
Hello.

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,480
I like that you brought your own chair today with all of those nice stickers and stuff

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
on it.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,480
This is a nice looking chair.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,880
You should leave this here.

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,640
I just really wasn't feeling the chairs that you provide, man.

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,120
They're just not good enough for my butt.

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
I understand.

28
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
I understand.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,480
You could make them out of just scraps and boxes, so I can appreciate that.

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,120
The people that really got the best chairs, that's our virtual lug.

31
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
Hello.

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
Hello.

34
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Salutation.

35
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Aloha.

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Howdy.

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Hello, everybody.

38
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,420
24 of you in there and we've been having a good pre-show hanging out on the live stream

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,080
now for, well, we were actually live for an hour and a half, but then we had a fantastic

40
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,760
Comcast outage, which brought us down for a bit.

41
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,840
We're limping along, making do, making possible.

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,440
Yeah, so there's stuff going on.

43
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
There's a lot going on.

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,320
Kernel 5.8 just landed, of course, everybody's already excited about what's going to be in

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
5.9.

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,680
5.9 will probably be what ends up in distributions like Fedora 33 and there's supposedly some

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,320
nice improvements for ButterFS in 5.9.

48
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,820
So we'll leave links to that stuff in the show notes, but let's follow up with some

49
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,920
of the RSI feedback that we got on the show.

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,280
I just want to do this briefly, won't become the RSI podcast, but I just wanted to say

51
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
thank you.

52
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,060
I heard from a lot of you who are also either just now learning to deal with this or have

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,060
some tips.

54
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,040
I got lots of gear suggestions, so I'll put a link to some of that in the show notes.

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,840
I expected a lot of you to just yell exercise, exercise, exercise at me, but instead I got

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,720
a little bit of that and a lot of gear.

57
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,000
David wrote and he says, hey Chris, sorry to hear you're battling repetitive stress

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,480
injury and I'm wondering if you're still using a mouse and have you considered a trackball?

59
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,880
Now he recommends one of them thumb trackballs, but I'll come back to that in a minute.

60
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,280
He says, I find that I need to take a break from time to time and also that I have to

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,560
keep the trackball clean about every three days, so consider that.

62
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Best wishes.

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
I love Linux unplugged and self-hosted.

64
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
Well, thanks David.

65
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,760
So David recommended the Logitech M570, which I actually have right here, M570 here in the

66
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,740
studio and it's a thumb trackball.

67
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,960
And I don't know if that's universally considered the best route to go for RSI.

68
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,920
I think something more like the Kingston trackball.

69
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,960
Now Wes, I don't know if you remember these.

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,120
I grew up with one of these.

71
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:23,320
My mom was a graphic artist since Photoshop 1.0 and as soon as these big trackball mouse

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,640
came out, it's like the size of a pool ball, like from playing pool, not like the swimming

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
pool.

74
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Yeah, much bigger than the thumb version here.

75
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Huge, Wes.

76
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
It's huge.

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
Like it takes your whole hand.

78
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,240
And so it seems to be the people like those Kingston style trackballs for RSI and Drew,

79
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,920
I think you recommended one of those too.

80
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Yeah.

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:48,000
The Kensington Slimblade and it has that gigantic pool ball right in the middle and four buttons

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
surrounding it.

83
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,720
You twist the ball to scroll up and scroll down.

84
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,120
I think it's much better with the thumb trackballs.

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,000
My thumb will get tired and will just kind of get fatigued and sore.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,320
But with this, you know, my wrist is nice and supported and I'm able to roll the ball

87
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,500
with my fingers.

88
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:15,440
So yeah, my RSI went considerably down to the point where it's pretty much gone.

89
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,640
I decided this time around, I think I'll have a variety of gear because I think one of the

90
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,000
things that helps is changing up what I'm using to work, like not using the same device

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,040
for eight hours a day, but moving between computers that have different MES.

92
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,440
And so one of the MES I got is the Logitech MX Vertical.

93
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,240
MX Vertical.

94
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
They claimed to have done a ton of research on this and it keeps your wrist in a better

95
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
position.

96
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
I've seen this in the show notes.

97
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
Oh yeah, I've seen these.

98
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Yeah.

99
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,960
It does charge over USB-C, which I'm kind of looking forward to, I think.

100
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,280
It has gotten a lot of positive comments from the audience.

101
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,780
It's a pretty wild looking mouse.

102
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,200
It's like, you know, it looks comfortable.

103
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,860
Just imagining using it, putting your hand in the shape that it is.

104
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,860
It seems, yeah.

105
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,860
All right.

106
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,860
I'm going to give it a go.

107
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,360
I know the big old huge trackballs.

108
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,720
I've used them, you know, as a kid.

109
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,160
I bet I could probably pick it back up again.

110
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,120
I also got wrist pads for the studio keyboards and the one upstairs and that's helped.

111
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,480
I'm trying not to buy a ton of stuff to fix this.

112
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,060
Like the real solution isn't buying stuff.

113
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,020
There's two other things I've done and I'm just kind of hitting pause after that and

114
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,200
seeing where things go.

115
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,240
And the other thing is it's something I've needed to do five years plus is I've decided

116
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,000
to replace my desk and I've ordered a standing desk.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh, look at you.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,040
Autonomous.ai has, I don't know why that's the name, but they have a bunch of cool standing

120
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
desks.

121
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
So I got one of those on the way.

122
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,160
Should be here middle of the month.

123
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,560
This is, I assume, one that you can switch between modes, adjust the height and yeah.

124
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,560
Oh yeah.

125
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Oh yeah.

126
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Oh yeah.

127
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,000
And I'm trying to take stretch breaks, trying to get up at least once an hour and move around

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,520
and stretch my wrists out and that has helped.

129
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,560
Additionally, and this is not medical advice, but this has just been something that I've

130
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,680
noted has helped is a couple of weeks ago I started trying to take these pill form CBD.

131
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,480
I'm not a medical doctor here, so don't follow my lead.

132
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,600
But over the last two weeks, I started with a couple of pills and now I'm on like four

133
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,560
of them and I'd say it's taken my pain from an eight to like a three and a half.

134
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,360
I was telling Wes, you know, over the years I've tried vitamins, I tried all these different

135
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,140
things and I always end up just stop taking them, but I have not missed a single night

136
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:31,480
of this because it really, I feel like between the stretching and the increased water consumption

137
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,200
and the breaks and these CBD things, it's helped a lot.

138
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,800
And you know, I don't get like, I'm not all like wacky stoned or anything from them.

139
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
It's right.

140
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,480
I mean, all of these are just like, you know, aims to help you work better, you know, be

141
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,680
able to continue to work.

142
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
I gotta be honest.

143
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,080
I wasn't planning to come on air and mention that I was trying CBD to help because it feels

144
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,200
embarrassing and makes it, it's very vulnerable for me to even admit that because a lot of

145
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,560
people will take that the wrong way.

146
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,880
But if it's something you've considered, I'm saying it's helped for me.

147
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,520
I did a very, very loose and fast kind of check on research.

148
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,280
Some stuff out there of course says that studies have been done that look like they have really

149
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,960
positive indicators, but you know, you gotta, you gotta follow your own medical doctor's

150
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,440
advice on that kind of stuff, not some podcasters advice.

151
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,840
But for me it's helped and a lot of this gear I've ordered hasn't arrived yet, but I'm hoping

152
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,760
combining it with the vertical mouse and, and trying to come up with a system of stretches

153
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,480
and breaks every morning, I hope we'll do it.

154
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Yeah.

155
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,920
It seems like you're just trying to get in some good habits, you know, just to support

156
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
things.

157
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Change the bad habits.

158
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,920
It's so easy cause you know, we have to, you have to be at the computer pretty much all

159
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,040
day to do work, to do show prep.

160
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,000
It's easy to not take that seriously.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,320
But if you were going to do, you know, some, some job where you needed to operate equipment

162
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,200
or you're training for a sport, well you use the right tools and I don't think it's any

163
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
different here.

164
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm an extreme computer user.

165
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,640
Not always for the best way.

166
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,200
Anyways, I just wanted to kind of put an end cap on that because we've been getting a lot

167
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,720
of feedback and I want to say thank you to everybody.

168
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,800
And please do continue to send it in.

169
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,600
That doesn't necessarily mean you have to stop, but it's been a couple of weeks since

170
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
we addressed it.

171
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
So I wanted to touch on that.

172
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,440
All right, Wes, let's get into what everybody really seems to be focusing on this week.

173
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:13,480
And that's boot hole, a rather nasty looking security exploit that involves our good friend

174
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,760
secure boot.

175
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,040
And there's a lots of explanations out there on the web.

176
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,000
We've consolidated some of them for you in the show notes.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,440
So absolutely do feel free to look further, but you found a really good one over on Debian's

178
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
website.

179
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,320
And the security team has written a very readable write up.

180
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
The readable write up.

181
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,240
Yeah, you know, I just really impressed because there's a lot going on.

182
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,600
You know, the first vulnerability here, there's actually multiple that was found.

183
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,120
There's a white paper out on that.

184
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,360
There's going to be a webinar, all the usual stuff you get when a big security firm finds

185
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
stuff.

186
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
But they didn't stop there.

187
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,640
You know, the researchers found this problem and kept going to actually turned up a number

188
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,960
of different problems all happening.

189
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,200
But if you remember things about secure boot, it was a big deal.

190
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
We talked about it here on the show.

191
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,500
You know, it's kind of a big kerfuffle in the Linux world as that was happening.

192
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,240
But I think we've kind of all forgot about what it is and, you know, why we care.

193
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,760
I got to be honest, that is true because I really rarely deal with it because I'm not

194
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,560
typically buying Windows machines now and trying to put Linux on them.

195
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,700
But my understanding was, is that ultimately Microsoft has to be involved in the signing

196
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,920
process.

197
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,640
And the way this works is only signed code is going to boot in a secure boot environment.

198
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,440
Yeah, you know, it's a way of helping secure the whole boot process of loading up your

199
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
computer.

200
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,160
If you imagine the old days, if you didn't have a BIOS password or anything like that

201
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,560
configured, you just walk over, plug in a USB drive and the firmware is happy to, you

202
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,560
know, just into dumb BIOS, just jumps over there, starts running the code and away you

203
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
go.

204
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,440
But in the UEFI world, we've got secure boot so that, you know, in theory, maybe you're

205
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,120
at a hotel and someone unscrupulous comes and wants to try to steal information off

206
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
your computer.

207
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,680
Well, with secure boot, you've got a chain of trust and you basically tell your firmware,

208
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,480
these are the keys of, you know, people I trust uses public key cryptography and then

209
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,340
it will only boot into stuff that's been signed by those keys.

210
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,240
So in theory, totally fine if you were paranoid about your devices and not that you need to

211
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,200
be paranoid, you know, in use by corporations, anyone who's trying to have secure devices,

212
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,540
you would roll that in the bootloader and only your stuff will run.

213
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,960
But of course, I mean, what, regular users?

214
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
They're not going to do this.

215
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,040
So by and large, the implementation and the most way we run into it is that Microsoft

216
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,920
worked out deals so that all the major manufacturers, well, they've enrolled Microsoft's key in

217
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
there.

218
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,040
Now, you could remove it and most firmwares allow you to do that, not on ARM, but, you

219
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
know, on x86.

220
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,760
But they ship it with Microsoft.

221
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Microsoft is shipped.

222
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,040
And that also means that, you know, in the Linux world, we were like, well, we don't

223
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,880
want to have to tell people to go turn secure boot off as the first step in how do you install

224
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Linux.

225
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,940
That's an awkward thing.

226
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,280
That's already a barrier to entry when we, you know, they already got this far.

227
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,400
They've figured out that they want to try Linux.

228
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,760
All that stuff is no good.

229
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,760
So many of the major distributions worked with Microsoft and got Microsoft to sign with

230
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,640
the Microsoft key, some of our boot infrastructure.

231
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,360
And that way you can just take, you know, your regular old Ubuntu ISO that's signed,

232
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,520
plug it into your new laptop that you picked up from Best Buy, not have to fuss around

233
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
with secure boot.

234
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,960
Essentially then in that case, transparent to the end user.

235
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Right.

236
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,840
So that's what was involved and really to respect the standard here, it's all about

237
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,280
maintaining that sequence of boot.

238
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:20,000
So the firmware is told to trust the keys and then it will only run stuff that's been

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,080
signed by those keys.

240
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,140
But everything after that needs to follow the same rules, right?

241
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,280
They have to have a system in place.

242
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,840
Doesn't have to be the same key necessarily, but that needs to have their own set to maintain

243
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
that security.

244
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,960
Otherwise, all of it's basically for nothing.

245
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,000
And that set has to be signed by a trusted set.

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Right.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,880
I mean, you've got to have trust at each layer so that you load a trusted bootloader, which

248
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,840
then loads the trusted operating system.

249
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,440
And then there's even some, you know, stuff that you have to think about in the OS level

250
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,680
and Linux has these where you lock down the kernel a little bit more so you would only

251
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,560
load signed kernel modules, for example.

252
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Right.

253
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,040
So there can be implications, especially for folks like in the Linux world who want to

254
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,820
go run a bunch of custom stuff.

255
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,600
But if you think about it as an average end user, this is just an added way that at least,

256
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,840
you know, this has been signed by, in theory, an organization you trust because you're running

257
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
their operating system.

258
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
All right.

259
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,680
So that's a secure boot recap and sort of the value it seems to provide.

260
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,300
And then what happened here is various vulnerabilities in grub, which meant that you could get arbitrary

261
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,920
command execution as a result of grub loading its config file.

262
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,480
And there's some other ones too, but that was the first one figured out.

263
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,680
It's a bug in grub itself.

264
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Right.

265
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,040
So it's parsing the config file, you know, does some bad stuff in memory and boom.

266
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,360
Now the person who maliciously, you know, modified that config file, they've got control

267
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,320
and it's running in a trusted way.

268
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,400
They can load unsigned code.

269
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Okay.

270
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,280
So this is, you know, this would be one way that you might see it is to install a root

271
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,600
kit that you wouldn't notice, you know, secure boot still on.

272
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,720
But because this happened, they were able to take over control of grub for a bit and

273
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,840
install whatever code they wanted.

274
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,480
So this could affect more than just Linux boxes because you could take a live environment

275
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,480
with this vulnerability, plug it into a Windows 10 workstation, a high security Windows 10

276
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,360
workstation, and essentially exploit secure boot.

277
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,400
Even though that machine never ran Linux, never used grub.

278
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,040
But if you just brought a vulnerable grub in a live environment, you could have at it,

279
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
right?

280
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,280
Interestingly, there were some issues found in Linux too.

281
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,060
Several not necessarily verified, at least from what Debian writes here, but possibly

282
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,000
could have interviewed to also allow secure boot bypass.

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,680
But our friend Jason Doenfeld from the WireGuard project, he managed to fix those.

284
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,640
This is kind of tricky to patch too, because unlike most normal security vulnerabilities

285
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,920
where you just sort of get the new grub or whatever, it doesn't have that flaw anymore.

286
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,140
Some versions that are signed still exist.

287
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,880
And so as part of mitigations, at some point you basically need to take out the old Microsoft

288
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,120
key and add in the new key infrastructure.

289
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,440
And anything aligned with boot updating these sorts of trusted components is tricky.

290
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,880
So is it basically a firmware update for these machines?

291
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Right.

292
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,160
At some point you probably will need firmware updates, things that fix the keys.

293
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,080
And then a whole bunch of components had updates too, right?

294
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,800
So like the FWPT infrastructure, because there's signed versions of those if you want to operate

295
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
in a signed way, right?

296
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,300
So you're going to do, there's also the shim that works that fits between EFI and grub,

297
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,620
new grubs that are out without this vulnerability that have to get re-signed.

298
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,700
For most of us, it's not a big deal.

299
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,660
You might not even have secure boot turned on for your computer.

300
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,360
But there's a lot of thought and infrastructure and planning and ceremony that is involved

301
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
in all of this.

302
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,460
And it's kind of just embarrassing that our, you know, obviously the Linux community takes

303
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,080
security seriously.

304
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,120
We've sort of had outside parties, in this case Microsoft, it's unfortunate we have to

305
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,040
have that arrangement, but we've sort of had to convince them that, look, we have a secure

306
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,120
stack too.

307
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,880
By trusting us, we're not going to let a bunch of your Windows machines get hacked.

308
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,680
And while I don't know that that's actually happened in the wild or that will happen,

309
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,800
it's just kind of embarrassing.

310
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,200
I am imagining a scenario where there's Windows machines out there that are no longer supported

311
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:54,240
by the OEM, be it HP or Lenovo or Dell or whoever it might be, and they'll never get

312
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,360
a firmware update.

313
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,360
The other tricky part, too, is once some of those changes happen, old install media that

314
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,120
you might have laying around, well, that won't work anymore because that was signed with

315
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,040
the old key that's no longer trusted.

316
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Oh, right.

317
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,640
So it's just somewhat tricky all around.

318
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,240
You don't have to freak out about it, eventually do these updates.

319
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,520
But, and we'll have an article linked over at ours from our friend Jim Salter kind of

320
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,880
breaking down some of the patches, some of the updates.

321
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,080
Some users have reported problems because, I mean, you know, anything happening, changing

322
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,720
up your boot is tricky.

323
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,720
So just maybe don't rush to apply those or at least do so in an environment with backups

324
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,200
and with time to troubleshoot.

325
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,520
Yeah, this has been a tricky one.

326
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,360
It has left some systems unbootable.

327
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,840
Jim did do a good job of covering that.

328
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,440
I just kind of imagine a parallel universe where the relationship between open source

329
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,640
and Microsoft isn't super cozy and we have serious egg on our face where a flaw in grub

330
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:51,060
plus some compounding problems in Linux led to essentially a bypass in the secure boot.

331
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,620
Not perfect like intentions or whatever.

332
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,720
Like I've never been a big fan of secure boot, so I'm not like crushed by this.

333
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,340
But it's embarrassing nonetheless.

334
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,360
It's still embarrassing.

335
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
It's not like the world ender, but it's embarrassing.

336
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,340
And I'm imagining a scenario where the relationship with Microsoft isn't quite as comfortable

337
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,400
as it is right now.

338
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,440
And Microsoft responds by just saying, we're not doing this anymore.

339
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,600
Or I mean, you could imagine there is some other vendor out there who suddenly, you know,

340
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,640
we have a relationship with a provider who, you know, we want to add this distros key

341
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
or whatever.

342
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,800
And it's just harder to make that case now.

343
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Yeah.

344
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,200
We should we should probably also point out that grub is used all over the place by tons

345
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
of people.

346
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,600
Probably another one of those projects that really deserves more appreciation and funding

347
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,360
than it gets because it's very useful and critical.

348
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,700
Yeah, I think that's an understatement.

349
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,800
And I think really well put.

350
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,560
So boot hole is really it's this ability to bypass this chain of trust and secure boot

351
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,200
and run untrusted code on any system with secure boot right now that hasn't been updated.

352
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Right.

353
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,120
If you've got a version of grub with this flaw and a computer that's trusting that version

354
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,880
of the Microsoft key, then, yep.

355
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,760
Once you've got grub loaded with a modified config file, you can run whatever you want.

356
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,200
All that work, all that signing, all that fuss for nothing.

357
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Shucks.

358
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Yeah.

359
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,520
So it's it is an interesting story and you can see why it's getting so much attention

360
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
right now.

361
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,480
And like Wes said, there will be more information in a in a like a video webinar webinar, thanks.

362
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,760
It hasn't happened yet, so we can't link it to it.

363
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,260
But keep an eye out for that, because by the time you're hearing this, it'll probably be

364
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,260
posted on YouTube.

365
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,260
Yeah.

366
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,920
Another one, too, where, you know, I'm sure at some point they'll have figured out some

367
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,420
of the problems with some of these updates and just go check your local distribution

368
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,960
for more info there.

369
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,140
Well, some interesting valve news has percolated up on the interwebs, and that is they've hired

370
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,220
a full time developer to work on open source graphics for Linux.

371
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,620
Senior developer Tony Wasirka has announced that he is going to be joining Valve to work

372
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,400
on the open source graphics for Linux as part of a general push on improving graphics.

373
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,680
I like to hear that.

374
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,720
Yeah, it seems maybe specifically he's trying to make an impact on the open source AMD GPU

375
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
driver project.

376
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,660
He's been a major contributor to the GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin in the past.

377
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,920
And you know, that really stands out.

378
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,480
That's for a long time there.

379
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,100
The blog has been one of my favorite things to check out just because, I mean, I don't

380
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,780
do graphics programming in that way at all, but workings of these consoles, the intricacies

381
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,860
of the graphic stack.

382
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,860
It's fascinating.

383
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
It's so awesome.

384
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,980
And there's a lot of challenges there, so this guy probably knows what he's doing.

385
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,100
I mean, the people that pull those projects off are like some of the elite of the elite,

386
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:37,340
and he maintained the GPU subsystem and implemented the Direct3D 11 rendering engine, which has

387
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,580
to be some of the hardest work there is for this.

388
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,580
Pretty neat.

389
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,700
I wonder if he's going to do some work on Proton and if the AMD graphics drivers aren't

390
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,420
just going to be seeing a whole bunch of improvements.

391
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,980
Some just landed in 5.8 that came out today, Linux kernel 5.8.

392
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:56,460
You've got Valve that's hiring a developer to work full time on Linux drivers, including

393
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,660
specifically calling out the AMD graphics stack.

394
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,940
You've got even more improvements coming to the AMD graphics stack in kernel 5.9.

395
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,940
Wow.

396
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,260
I think I need to build myself a new AMD gaming rig.

397
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,100
Yeah, I'll be interested to see where Valve takes this because last time Valve did some

398
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,500
of this, we ended up with Proton.

399
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
So we'll see.

400
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
That's the Valve news.

401
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,940
While we're kind of talking about gaming stuff, though, Nvidia is making some news that looks

402
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,900
like that deal that we hinted at recently about them snatching up the ARM division from

403
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,140
SoftBank is like looking real serious right now, looking close, like it's actually going

404
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,540
to happen.

405
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,620
And a principal analyst over at Trius Research said that if the merger goes through, it will

406
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,420
be a disaster.

407
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:42,100
This will defect from ARM and more ARM customers will start looking at RISC-V, to which I say,

408
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,100
yes, please.

409
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,100
All right.

410
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Maybe we're fine with this.

411
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,780
How do we feel about Nvidia snatching up ARM?

412
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,220
I don't feel good about this at all.

413
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,660
I think that what we're going to see here is people are going to get very, very concerned

414
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:05,700
very quickly about ARM being owned by a primary licensee.

415
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,100
I mean, it could be a history repeats itself kind of moment, like what happened with Intel

416
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,100
and x86.

417
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:18,700
I mean, because in the 80s, there were multiple 80s and early 90s, there were multiple sources

418
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,260
of x86 CPUs.

419
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,240
Today there's just AMD and Intel.

420
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,660
And that's only because they have each other at gunpoint, essentially.

421
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,240
And Nvidia is not a good player in the ecosystem.

422
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,800
They generally do not help contribute to the advancement and the development of standards

423
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:46,460
to support applications in gaming, as well as in professional GP GPU cases and things

424
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,940
like that.

425
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,060
After 10 years, CUDA is still a closed thing.

426
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,060
It seems like a clear move for ongoing licensing revenue, first of all, and maybe cornering

427
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,760
the market a bit more and a turning point for ARM as a platform, I think.

428
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,080
It will not change the current momentum around around ARM.

429
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,880
It just won't because one of the problems that the industry has is that they like to

430
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,500
capitulate to the strongest tech company.

431
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,360
And when you look at that with even in the hardware space, you know, people talk very

432
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,900
highly of Nvidia because their technology works, quote unquote, the best.

433
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:32,280
But that's largely due to a lot of work they've done on the backroom side, making everybody

434
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,780
like conform to their protocols, their standards, optimizing for their drivers and stuff like

435
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,980
that.

436
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,780
And it has shorted out all the competitors in the graphics space.

437
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:48,100
And I think the same thing would essentially happen with the CPU space with the ARM ecosystem.

438
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,700
But the thing is, nobody can peel back that investment.

439
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,780
And moving to risk five would be a recipe for disaster for most companies, because the

440
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:01,280
hardware industry, unlike the software one, operates on such tight margins that redoing

441
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,020
everything would take literally years to figure out the investment profile, much less try

442
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,300
to actually do it.

443
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
I think that's very true.

444
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,740
I think the existing momentum that people have invested in ARM isn't going to change.

445
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,740
It can't change.

446
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,700
The phone mobile ecosystem isn't going to change.

447
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:23,500
I think the turning point will be in considering ARM as a platform that you're safe to build

448
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
your business around.

449
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
I think that's a shift.

450
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,340
Once it changes again, once it changes hands like this again, something, I think, changes

451
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,340
in the way people perceive it.

452
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,140
I don't know if it's going to change really much in terms of how many Samsung phones ship

453
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,140
with an ARM processor.

454
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,420
I don't think that'll be affected one little bit.

455
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,540
But future projects, things people are tinkering with, I wonder.

456
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,300
I really don't feel very positive about any of it right now.

457
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:51,820
Part of me kind of just hopes Intel pulls out of this downward spin, and we just move

458
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,420
into an AMD Intel world.

459
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,820
I'd be OK with x86 for another couple of generations.

460
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,460
At least let me get to my 50s.

461
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,340
I just can't get that image of Linus making a certain symbol when referencing Nvidia out

462
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,340
of my head.

463
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
Yeah, there's that.

464
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
There's that, too.

465
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,340
I think there's that history there.

466
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,380
Maybe that might be informing a bit of my reaction to this news.

467
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,540
I think that's very likely.

468
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:17,700
Maybe if I was a RGB gamer and I had three Nvidia cards in my extreme Twitch gaming box,

469
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,100
I would feel differently about it.

470
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:24,780
But sitting here right now looking at the momentum around AMD graphics and AMD CPUs

471
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,260
and the challenges like we've covered just recently in our ARM episode, I'm not feeling

472
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,040
particularly great about it.

473
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,280
Something though that does make me smile is Pine's invitation to get some input on a physical

474
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,380
keyboard, a Nokia N900 style keyboard, if that invokes a certain image.

475
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,380
What?

476
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,540
Yeah, it's really kind of a neat idea of a little QWERTY keyboard that's totally portable

477
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,420
that would make an SSH session really practical on a mobile device.

478
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,460
And it can be integrated with a case where it slides up or down.

479
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,460
I think this is neat.

480
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,300
And they say they're in talks with a number of hardware vendors regarding this N900 style

481
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,900
slide-out keyboard design for the Pine phone.

482
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,820
It won't be thin enough, Chris.

483
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:09,040
Yeah, I'm really glad that they're not hung up on that at all in this because there are

484
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:15,500
so many of us out there that are perfectly happy throwing an extended battery pack on

485
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,700
their iPhone.

486
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,980
I haven't done it with this one, but iPhones in the past, I go get the big old fat battery

487
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,980
pack and it like triples the thickness and weight of the thing.

488
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,020
Or people are putting the pop sockets on the back.

489
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,020
You know, there's all...

490
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,020
It's not super minimal.

491
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,340
And actually, in a way, it's kind of perfect if you can pop it all off and then you have

492
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
a fairly thin...

493
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,180
I mean, you have the Pine phone right there.

494
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,420
That fits in the pocket just fine.

495
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,420
Totally fine.

496
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,300
It would be like having a Nexus in your pocket.

497
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,300
It's like the small Nexus size, like the Nexus 6-ish.

498
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,660
And your pocket's big, but it's not too big.

499
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,360
But then you can snap these accessories on that actually make it a functional device.

500
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,780
And as these things get more powerful, and as in the case of the Pine phone, the operating

501
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:58,300
systems are more sophisticated, I love seeing these kind of things.

502
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,380
And so I think it's early days, as a lot of this stuff is when we talk about this, but

503
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,700
they're looking for feedback and they have some suggested design ideas and they have

504
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,940
a form thread set up on it.

505
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,220
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

506
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,220
I could see it.

507
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,300
I could see it one day all kind of coming together.

508
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:16,580
It just makes me so excited that we've got, you know, manufacturing capability in a manufacturing

509
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,460
company that's interested in thinking outside the box, making some of these projects that,

510
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,900
okay, maybe they don't appeal to a wider audience, but then we don't need that.

511
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,100
We'll find out.

512
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Maybe they'll sell millions.

513
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,100
Maybe.

514
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,100
I don't know.

515
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,920
I mean, if you think about it, anybody that has infrastructure they need to maintain,

516
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,860
you could make the case at the price point for the Pine phone, if it is your day job

517
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,700
to keep systems online, you could make the case that you could have a daily driver that

518
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,740
is your Android or your iPhone, and then you've got this with you in the bag or in the pocket.

519
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,700
If you need to just bust something out, that's got a mobile data connection, that's got a

520
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,940
fully complex operating system with terminal and all that and a keyboard, people walk around

521
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,620
with Mac book and iPads all day.

522
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,020
Maybe us Linux users will do something similar, but just thousands of dollars cheaper would

523
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
be our style.

524
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
All right.

525
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:08,620
Well, a little bit of housekeeping here before we go on.

526
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:13,220
Join us next week live if you can, because we're doing another classic chat room attacks

527
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,640
episode.

528
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,440
We've come across the old JB device from the hardware archive, and we're going to give

529
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,260
it a full refurb, load it up with a modern OS, and then open it up to the chat room for

530
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,380
quote load testing and quote.

531
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,680
I love these.

532
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,500
So join us next week if you can, because you'll get a chance to punish one of our machines.

533
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
We need your help.

534
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Right.

535
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,880
And now if you don't know when we're live, you can get it converted to your local time

536
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,000
zone via robots at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar.

537
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,960
It's over at JB live dot TV noon Pacific, and you can just come on over.

538
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,020
We start the show up usually like the live stream usually starts 20 30 minutes before

539
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,160
the actual show.

540
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,860
We get music playing and we get on there, start chatting.

541
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,380
Sometimes like this week we started like 15 minutes late because we were goofing around.

542
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,180
You get to hang on all of that and then also get to help punish the system and name the

543
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,180
show.

544
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
Like a whole extra show.

545
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,180
It is.

546
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,460
So check us out over at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar for the time and JB

547
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,620
live dot TV is where it's streamed at.

548
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,300
And also a reminder for the luck lug.

549
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,360
I was hanging out in the luck lug this Sunday while I was out working on the storage bays

550
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,660
of lady jupes.

551
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,580
So I'm like, I'm carrying the phone in my pocket and I'm like spraying stuff and scratching

552
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,820
down rust stuff and painting over stuff and chatting with the luck lug about cellular

553
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,420
antennas and all the kind of stuff.

554
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,180
It was pretty good, pretty good couple hours with the chatting and I got a lot done, took

555
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
a break during some books.

556
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,900
I ran out of Rustoleum and then got back at it.

557
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
It was good.

558
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,900
So you can join us too.

559
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,980
The luck lug is on Sundays at noon Pacific and it's in the same mumble room we use for

560
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,980
the show.

561
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,980
We just do it up in the lobby.

562
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,780
So you just have to have the open source mumble software.

563
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,500
Pretty easy to have it for the phone too.

564
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,740
They have for the phone too.

565
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
Don't tell anybody though.

566
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,300
We don't tell people about that.

567
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
No.

568
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:06,140
All right, well this week we're going to tell you about our favorite headphones on Linux

569
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,400
for like meetings or joining the mumble room.

570
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,780
This would be, these would be great headphones potentially to jump into the luck lug on Sunday.

571
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,200
I also wanted something.

572
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
That's actually why I bought mine.

573
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,460
I bought mine specifically for the luck lug and then I wanted to start using them for

574
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:26,060
zoom meetings and whatnot and the requirements were something that works really well with

575
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,660
Linux and I think for you and I at least, we'll see where Drew falls down.

576
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,580
I think that's going to be an interesting one, but where for you and I, I think we both

577
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,580
wanted wireless.

578
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Right.

579
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,640
So you have the newer version of ones that I tried a couple, like maybe a year and a

580
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,420
half ago, the Jabra Elite Active 65Ts.

581
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,420
These are no bigger than AirPods.

582
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,420
Right.

583
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,420
That's it.

584
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,620
I mean then they're very much marketed as, you know, competitor Android version of the

585
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,620
AirPods.

586
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Although of course they'll work with iOS too.

587
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,620
Yeah, they're not bad.

588
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,460
You know, they, there are newer ones now.

589
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
There's also the 75T.

590
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,740
I don't know why they don't make the, you know, the version in between, but that's not

591
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,740
my business.

592
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,700
And we should probably say the price upfront, they're $120.

593
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,700
So they're cheaper than AirPods, but they're not like super economical.

594
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
Yeah.

595
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
You'll see them on sale sometimes.

596
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,820
Or actually I bought a refurbished pair just because, hey, why not?

597
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,660
Even though they might've been in somebody else's ear balls.

598
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,420
Well, and then I immediately dropped them on the floor and one of my dogs tried to chew

599
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,420
on it.

600
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,660
I was like, these are not, these are not necessarily pristine, but that's kind of the point is

601
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,900
that, you know, I've already gotten some nice audio equipment, nice headphones and nice

602
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
microphone.

603
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,100
And I just wanted something that was a little more convenient where, you know, maybe I'm

604
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,780
not the star of the show for this particular meeting, but I want to be able to get up,

605
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,380
walk to the kitchen, make myself a snack or go deal with the dogs barking at something.

606
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,380
They're not bad.

607
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,380
I was definitely inspired.

608
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:48,820
I think I'd seen you and some other folks I know with AirPods and that looked very convenient.

609
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Audio quality.

610
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,140
Well, you got to make sure you switch it, you know, into the high quality audio playback

611
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:59,540
mode, which I will say having used it both on a Mac and Linux sort of struck me as just

612
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,860
how these things go with Mac and Linux because on Mac it figures out if you're recording,

613
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,380
you know, it figures out like, oh, are you trying to talk?

614
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,860
Do you have an application that needs to, it needs an audio input?

615
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,860
Oh yeah.

616
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,860
Okay.

617
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,860
Well then you'll be in headset mode.

618
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,180
If not, then you'll just automatically switch to high quality playback mode.

619
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,320
Although sometimes it gets that wrong.

620
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
So it's perfect.

621
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Beautiful.

622
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
When it works.

623
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,420
On the Linux side, there may be ways to make it automatically switch.

624
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,100
I've not investigated that because you just go in pulse.

625
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,340
It's an option on the device, super simple, easy, and you can configure it yourself.

626
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
So I like that.

627
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,700
And I was actually kind of impressed.

628
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,280
They're a little bassy for my taste, but the audio quality just for playback, watching,

629
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,540
you know, watching a YouTube video at my desk or just listening to stuff.

630
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Totally fine.

631
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
Yeah.

632
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,540
For listening.

633
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Totally usable.

634
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,540
Yeah.

635
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
Where things fall down a little bit.

636
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
Come in Levi.

637
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
Come in Levi.

638
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,540
This is Charlie.

639
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,540
Repeat Levi.

640
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
Come in Levi.

641
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,540
This is Charlie.

642
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,540
I found the truth.

643
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,540
I found the truth.

644
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Okay.

645
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
I'd say that's phone quality.

646
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,540
That's it.

647
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
It's phone quality.

648
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,140
And it's definitely noticeable if, you know, you're switching from a different mic or honestly

649
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,140
these days, even just like the phone on my pixel three, the microphone built in, I mean,

650
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,300
to the, to the handset itself is better.

651
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,300
Is better.

652
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Yeah.

653
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
And that's a little embarrassing.

654
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,300
Yeah.

655
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,100
Although if you're, you know, for me and I think for you too, I wanted something that

656
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:20,500
was totally just like, I just got to chime in a couple of times in a, in a work meeting

657
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,100
and I'm not running the meeting.

658
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,260
I'm not talking a whole lot.

659
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,500
I'm doing a lot of, yeah, or I think so's or yeah, we can definitely look into that.

660
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Exactly.

661
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,700
And it does totally work for that, for something you just really easy to pop in.

662
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,520
So when you pop them in, does it auto connect or do you have to go into the Bluetooth settings

663
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,580
in like say Linux and connect them each time?

664
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,900
You know, it depends on the operating system and how you've configured it, of course.

665
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,860
But yeah, for the most part it just, it just automatically connects, no problem.

666
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,540
I did run into an issue and I think this might've just been an issue with the device itself

667
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,700
is I paired it from the same machine with the same Bluetooth hardware ID and everything,

668
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,220
but from two different distros.

669
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,760
And after that I had to keep repairing it with those though I was able to do like a

670
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,480
factory reset on it that fixed it, which makes me think it was a problem with just being

671
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,260
confused about all, you know, all these devices, which made me having repaired it a whole bunch

672
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,100
of times before I bothered to do that, made me suddenly have opinions.

673
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,720
I really actually kind of liked Gnome's Bluetooth settings more than I do in the plasma world.

674
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,660
I'm going to jump ahead to mine because mine is about accomplishing a lot of that and totally

675
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,940
avoiding Bluetooth, which I think is now the way to go.

676
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:33,340
I wasn't sure I was, these were recommended to me by the Luplug and I went with the Corsair

677
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,780
Void RGB Elite Wireless Gaming Headset.

678
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,780
That's a horrible name and RGB, I don't know about that.

679
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,660
It does have a logo on it that changes color.

680
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:50,460
But the thing that is fantastic about these is, now these are not earbuds, I will disclaim

681
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:56,060
they're full over ear headphones, but Wes, no Bluetooth, but they're still wireless.

682
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,060
How does that work?

683
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:03,300
Well, Wes, it's good old fashioned RF and I think they sound lovely.

684
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,180
Let me play you a little audio sample I recorded this morning here at the studio, just to give

685
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,900
you a sense of what it's like when you're outside a studio environment, you're just

686
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,420
in a, in like a working office environment.

687
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,820
Here's the audio quality.

688
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,360
Ah, the freedom of true mobility.

689
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:26,700
The Corsair Void RGB Elite Wireless Gaming Headset for the connoisseuring pup who likes

690
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,980
to game a little bit, but maybe also has a pup day job.

691
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,660
The Corsair Void RGB Elite Wireless Push Hard on the gaming angle, but I don't really see

692
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,660
it.

693
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,460
They're all black, nice design, very comfortable to wear, and everybody needs a good headset

694
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:47,380
and microphone from time to time with today's video calls and whatnots, and this certainly

695
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,740
seems to fit the bill.

696
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,660
I really like the way they feel on the head, not too tight, but they're not going anywhere.

697
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,520
If you got the zoomies, they're not flying off.

698
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,380
But additionally, they sound fantastic.

699
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,100
Music sounds incredible on these.

700
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:07,220
But let's talk about the real feature, RF wireless, true mobility.

701
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,220
I'm up.

702
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,220
I'm moving.

703
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
Let's do a live demo.

704
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,820
I'm in my studio office upstairs in the JB One studio, and I'm going to walk out into

705
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,380
the foyer and move about.

706
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:24,520
But now as I continue to move across the foyer, I'm into another office space, multiple walls

707
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,620
between us, yet we are still communicating.

708
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,800
But friends, let's be honest.

709
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,460
If you're an entrepreneurial pup, easy for me to say, and you're going in and out of

710
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,340
zoom meetings all day, like I find myself, you want something that lets you sneak away

711
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,620
for those important moments.

712
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,900
Well an RF wireless headset means if you've got to go potty during a meeting, no problem,

713
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:52,780
because one of the features that I absolutely love about the Corsair is the way the microphone

714
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,780
mutes.

715
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,220
You can push to mute.

716
00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:05,220
So when you're ready to flush, you can just simply push up on the microphone, notice,

717
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,420
and no one's the wiser that you were just flushing.

718
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,800
It has a nice little chime when it mutes and a nice little soft chime when it unmutes.

719
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,740
So you can sneak off and do nature's business without anybody knowing.

720
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,620
Ultimately, while the mobility is great and I can sit here and yack my face off while

721
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:29,300
walking around the studio, I think my favorite feature is how fricking easy it worked with

722
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Linux.

723
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,660
I'm going to throw this thing that right there was me throwing the box because it works so

724
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,660
damn good.

725
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,820
I plugged it in.

726
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:41,420
Linux sees everything, even the full name of the device, Corsair wireless gaming.

727
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,600
And it shows an analog connection and a digital connection.

728
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,780
So if you want to try messing around with that seven point one surround sound fake audio,

729
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,780
you can.

730
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,980
If you just want things to work, you just want a simple stereo audio device that's available

731
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,380
to both show up to pulse audio.

732
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,680
And I think that might be my favorite part.

733
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,500
Plug it in, turn it on, and it just goes.

734
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:10,760
And because the USB dongle is always persistent, Linux always sees my audio device.

735
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,300
Even if I don't necessarily need to hear sound, I don't want my headphones on.

736
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,300
It's still there.

737
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,500
So my settings aren't changing all the time.

738
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,100
The USB device is always there, even if I'm not using the headphones.

739
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,100
So if I have, say, like something start playing and I want to hear it, I just grab the headphones,

740
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,420
turn them on, and everything's already going.

741
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,780
No settings to change, no Bluetooth device to connect, none of that fussy stuff.

742
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,780
It's just always on.

743
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,140
It's always working because it's a physical USB device that's the actual sound card.

744
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,580
And then it does all the RF magic for you.

745
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,980
I think these are keepers.

746
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,500
These are going to be my go to headsets, gaming or not.

747
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,140
I really got to say, the thing that I love about them is that the device is always on.

748
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,740
It's always there because I leave the dongle plugged in 24-7.

749
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,660
So there's essentially the pulse audio.

750
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,820
The sound device is always there.

751
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,820
It's always there.

752
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,440
No crazy change in a default, no switcheroo.

753
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,460
It's none the wiser if the headphones are on or off.

754
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,500
So I can just have my sound device always available, and then I just flip them on.

755
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,120
The other thing I like about it, and you could hear a little bit there in the clip, is because

756
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:16,620
it's analog, it actually tends to degrade a little bit more elegantly.

757
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,380
When I'm walking to the other room, you can start to hear a few pops and drops, and there's

758
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,900
actually a channel switch pop in there towards the very end of that clip.

759
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:31,100
So you have those analog drawbacks, but at the same time, it means instead of my cutting

760
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,500
out audio, you just sort of get slightly degraded.

761
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
Continuous degradation.

762
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Yeah.

763
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:43,060
And I do really like the fact that when you flip up the microphone, the little blue light

764
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,180
on the microphone turns off and has a really soft little tone in the headset that it plays

765
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,180
to let you know.

766
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,180
You stop.

767
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
Yeah.

768
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,180
So if you've got to take a potty break, no big deal.

769
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,180
It's right there.

770
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,180
You just flip it right up.

771
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,420
You don't have to embarrass yourself.

772
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,420
And it's comfortable.

773
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,620
I can wear it all day long if I need to.

774
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,740
It is also slightly cheaper because it's not fancy earbuds, right?

775
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,740
It's a big over-ear.

776
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,740
Yeah.

777
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,740
What are we talking about here?

778
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,740
$99.99.

779
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,740
Oh.

780
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,740
Yeah.

781
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,380
So I would probably, I've got to imagine I'll use these for five years, and I would buy

782
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:15,220
these same, these, when it comes to headphones, if you find the right headphones, I try to

783
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,220
buy the same one.

784
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,220
I know it works.

785
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,220
Yeah.

786
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,220
Why change it?

787
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,220
These are my go-tos now.

788
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,220
I hope they don't drop them.

789
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,260
I did think you sounded pretty good, although maybe a little congested.

790
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,260
Yeah.

791
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
Is that, you think, the microphone?

792
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,260
Yeah.

793
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,940
I mean, it was just a couple hours ago.

794
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,220
It's a small capsule, so I would imagine it's, but it's not awful.

795
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,860
I think it's a step up from yours.

796
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,860
Oh, definitely.

797
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,100
If you're doing a lot of the talking, or you want to sound really professional, I don't

798
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,060
think it's adequate enough, and I bet you that's where Drew could probably help us out

799
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,060
a little bit.

800
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,060
Yeah.

801
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:50,500
My impression is that it wasn't a full range signal that it's pushing through, so you're

802
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,900
definitely missing some frequencies in like the high mids.

803
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,640
They're just gone.

804
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:01,860
So that's why you sound so nasally is because you're not getting your full voice.

805
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:06,260
Now one thing that I will say is that in the pro audio world, when you see people walking

806
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,060
around with like wireless mics on stage and stuff like that, they're all RF.

807
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:16,900
So this is using technology that is tried and true in the pro audio space, which is

808
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,940
great.

809
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,180
You know, RF is also going to go through walls a lot better than Bluetooth, as you demonstrated.

810
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,820
It's a great technology for audio.

811
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,100
I highly, highly recommend RF if you're going to go wireless.

812
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,540
You know, Bluetooth is fine for super short range stuff, especially if you have like a

813
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:39,820
good strong connection, but it's not going to beat RF for straight audio.

814
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,820
Yeah.

815
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:46,100
And then also you don't have all of the Bluetooth pairing trickery or management that you have

816
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,340
to do with it either.

817
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
Just plug it in and go.

818
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,100
Do you do anything below a professional grade microphone?

819
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,140
Does Drew go out and buy a cheap headset microphone ever?

820
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,140
No.

821
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:04,100
Well, for this, I actually did dig out my old collarbone set like Logitech.

822
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,100
It's an old one.

823
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:10,380
They don't even sell it anymore, Bluetooth headset that I used to use on mobile back

824
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,860
when I would have to go visit clients and stuff and, you know, be working on computers

825
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,920
and answer a call.

826
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,240
So I had, you know, this hands-free thing and I wanted to see how well it would work

827
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,620
on Linux connecting over Bluetooth.

828
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,820
I did get it paired.

829
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,740
They're just fine and playback worked fine.

830
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:33,340
The audio quality was great, but the input didn't work.

831
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,820
I could select it in Pulse and as soon as I hit record, the application that was trying

832
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,700
to record would just freeze up and I tried this out in multiple different applications

833
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,900
that record straight from Pulse Audio.

834
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,460
Every single one of them had the same issue.

835
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,740
Just hit record, boom, it's done.

836
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,120
The application is no longer responding.

837
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,120
So total fail on recording for that.

838
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,580
So the microphone did not work and I don't really think it's a Bluetooth issue.

839
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,100
I think it's a headset issue.

840
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,420
I think it's just too old because I've had issues with it on the phone recently too.

841
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:14,480
Last time I tried it, I had to, you know, stop using it and go straight to the handset.

842
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,420
These days for me, I've got a professional mic in my booth and at my desk and I've got

843
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:24,420
professional grade headphones in my booth and at my desk.

844
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:30,180
So yeah, you do have noticed what reason do I have to have yet another headset just for

845
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,860
hands free wireless, blah, blah, blah.

846
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,860
I don't.

847
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,860
So no.

848
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,220
Well, and it's something you were saying in the pre-show and I think it's worth considering.

849
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:43,340
One option is to just buy one microphone by and buy it once and get a good one and use

850
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,540
it for everything.

851
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,580
I specifically was looking for something that I could get up and walk around with because

852
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,580
I mean just so many of these now and I'm trying not to sit there at my desk all day.

853
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,740
But I like that point that you made.

854
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,700
And there are, we'll link to some microphones that are quote unquote professional grade

855
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,720
that are like a hundred dollars that are a good starting point.

856
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,720
You know, it's funny.

857
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,900
That's basically what I've ended up doing is for calls that I want slightly better audio,

858
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,820
but I'm still not having to talk all the time is I just plug in my USB mic at my desk and

859
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,900
then I switch the headphones to just high quality playback mode so I can still go get

860
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,380
up, you know, refresh my beverage.

861
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,260
I just have to sit at my desk if I actually want to talk, but I sound great.

862
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,460
I will try to remember to put a link to the USB microphone that I like.

863
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,180
They're all in the same range and we'll put a link to a professional grade mic that starts

864
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,140
about around a hundred dollars and then links to these headsets.

865
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,740
I really liked this Corsair for just using my computer as well.

866
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:37,900
I actually edited the audio for it on there just to hear what it sounded like and I thought

867
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,540
it did a pretty decent representation.

868
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,540
Oh, that's great.

869
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,260
I then listened on my studio monitor speakers where there was a difference, but you know,

870
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,780
in terms of just like enjoying music and playing video games, these headsets are really good.

871
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,780
I really liked it.

872
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,940
So, and the sound was better than I expected.

873
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,940
So I like it.

874
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,600
It seems like a kind of a sweet spot and you know, just usable.

875
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,700
You can use it for multiple purposes, comfortable, sounds good, and a good audio quality on

876
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,700
long recording.

877
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,820
Boy, listen though.

878
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:08,500
Like what is really sticking with me is the beauty of these RF devices is it's a USB audio

879
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,540
interface that's detected by Linux and it's always there and it just works.

880
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,260
No pairing, no Bluetooth involved at all, just works.

881
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:19,660
Well, you know, I had to learn in this experimenting that I guess we've switched and now the Bluetooth,

882
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,560
the main Bluetooth implementation is done in Pulse and not in Allset.

883
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,580
You can still set that up if you want, but of course I was planning to record with Jack

884
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,100
and things got more complicated than I want.

885
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,580
So I've been down in the bowels pulling around with Pulse Audio loopback devices and virtual

886
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:39,380
syncs trying to get what's a simple, you know, simple mix situation and Jack going in Pulse

887
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:43,860
Audio so that I can play music while using my Bluetooth speakers on a Zoom call and it's

888
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,020
been way more direct than I anticipated.

889
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,960
So tell me a little bit about that because I think ultimately are you saying you could

890
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,820
send music into the Zoom call?

891
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,820
Yeah.

892
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,820
You're sending systems.

893
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:57,020
You know, playback a YouTube video and then have that and my mic go into the Zoom call

894
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,020
as me.

895
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,020
All in Pulse?

896
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,020
No Jack audio?

897
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,460
No Jack audio because again, I would have had to figure out some routing between Pulse

898
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,460
and Jack.

899
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,460
Right.

900
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,460
Pulse can do this?

901
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,460
Pulse can do this.

902
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,460
What's the secret sauce there?

903
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:12,340
Well, you kind of have to bust out the command line and start loading Pulse modules yourself.

904
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,740
That's not too hard.

905
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,820
Zoom makes it a little more complicated too in particular.

906
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,180
So you can basically make these virtual syncs, which is kind of what it sounds like, a place

907
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,420
to send audio that doesn't have to be a real device, and then you can use loopbacks to

908
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,420
connect them.

909
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,440
I'll have linked to a nice blog post that was written up with the intention of recording

910
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,600
from a video game while you were talking.

911
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
That works fine.

912
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,260
In their case, they were playing it back through a Google meeting, you know, of RTC in the

913
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:36,780
browser and that's not as picky about what it treats as a microphone.

914
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,680
But Zoom wants to see some kind of thing that isn't virtual anyway.

915
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:47,220
So I was able to find a great Stack Overflow write-up that actually uses an audio cleanup

916
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,220
filter inside Pulse to get rid of echoes that Zoom accepts.

917
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,980
So it sets up another layer of abstraction that basically tricks Zoom into thinking that

918
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,980
you're sending it from a real stuff, but it totally works.

919
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,300
I'm surprised to hear that Zoom even has any facilities to detect virtual audio devices

920
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,740
on Linux and then choose which ones it accepts and which ones it doesn't.

921
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,220
That seems like more work than I would expect.

922
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,580
It lists it, but won't let you choose it, and if you change it in Bavu Control, it just

923
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,580
changes it right back.

924
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,580
Oh, yeah.

925
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,580
It's a...

926
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,580
Really?

927
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,580
Uh-huh.

928
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,580
I was surprised to see that.

929
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,580
They've put thought into this.

930
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,580
They don't want you using it this way, I don't think.

931
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,580
No.

932
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,580
That's interesting.

933
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,660
But you could use the same trick, I guess, to do only Pulse audio routing to, say, take

934
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,340
a video game capture and send it to OBS for streaming.

935
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,340
Yep.

936
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,780
And the guides are really nicely done.

937
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,780
The one aimed at video games has a neat diagram and a sort of method you can apply to work

938
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,780
out.

939
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,260
Like, you list all your devices, you circle ones that are actually hardware, you draw

940
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,260
some arrows between them, and then connect all the arrows.

941
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,900
You basically open Bavu Control and assign, like, okay, this goes to this virtual sync,

942
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,080
this one goes here, and at the end, your audio routes correctly.

943
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,420
And so, ultimately, Zoom is pointing at virtual devices that you could change what's going

944
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,420
to them at any time.

945
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,860
So you could switch out microphones or whatever you want and never have to change Zoom.

946
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,020
Yeah, and then Bavu Control is just a mixer console where you can, you know, slide things

947
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,020
for the virtual stuff.

948
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,940
So you can either lower your mic or you could lower the mix, you know, the one that has

949
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,940
both of them.

950
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,140
Yeah, it worked surprisingly well.

951
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,420
I kept wanting to play back sound clips when I was in the meeting with friends, right?

952
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,420
Of course, who doesn't?

953
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,980
And I was just playing them on my phone in front of the microphone because I didn't have

954
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,980
a better solution.

955
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,660
And I just kept thinking to myself, like, in Jack, this would be so simple.

956
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,740
You know, I already have it all set up.

957
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:33,500
So I was just neat to see that Pulse is more capable than we give it credit for, even if

958
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,180
the ergonomics are terrible.

959
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:40,860
Yeah, I'd love to hear others' audio tricks or solutions they've had to come up with for

960
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,020
more virtual calls that everybody is doing.

961
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,220
Telegram is probably the best place for it.

962
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,220
Jupiterbroadcasting.com.com.

963
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,500
Join the group there and chat with us about your audio hackery.

964
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,060
So how long did it take you to wire all that up?

965
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,100
I mean, that was definitely...

966
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,540
I was very distracted for the first hour of that call, let's just say.

967
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,540
You're doing a dirty call.

968
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,700
Well, I wanted the reveal, you know, where it just like comes out as me.

969
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,940
Because you can share audio in Zoom, but then it shares to everyone and only the host, you

970
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,740
know, they can configure who can do that.

971
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,340
No rules for me.

972
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,340
Nobody ever...

973
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,820
Who wants a soundboard, right?

974
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,780
So we have some feedback from Marvin, and he points out about a neat little tool in

975
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,860
MX Linux that I don't think we've ever shared with the audience.

976
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,180
And it seemed worth talking about.

977
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:31,420
He says, hey guys, recently you mentioned the snapshot capability of Fedora and how

978
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,860
it nearly protects against OS killing disasters.

979
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:38,820
Well, there's no facility for that yet, but there could be one day.

980
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,420
OpenSUSE works to have that and so is Ubuntu with CFS.

981
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:46,900
He says, I think your listeners would benefit to know that MX Linux also has a snapshot

982
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,500
feature sort of like this.

983
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:54,340
With MX Linux, an ISO of the complete installation can be made on demand.

984
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,580
In the event of any trouble, your system can be reinstalled exactly as it was at the time

985
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,580
of making the ISO.

986
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,260
This saves a ton of time.

987
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:06,420
And all the customizations and software that I did are instantly available again.

988
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:10,340
I think it's just one of these awesome features that are making MX Linux so popular today.

989
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,500
You know, it's really interesting.

990
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,060
I find myself thinking to myself, gosh, I would hate to have to do that, like just not

991
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,800
wanting to do it that way.

992
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,740
But at the same time, that seems great for just a consumer.

993
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:25,100
And you know, here's a simple backup step you can do, save this on a flash drive that

994
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,980
you know, or two of them that you store in a drawer and somewhere else, now you've got

995
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,980
your backups.

996
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,600
You know, what I used to do for family is I would give them a Linux box.

997
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,400
And then essentially something kind of like this.

998
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,440
And it's first it was I would tape a CD in a sleeve to the inside of their PC case.

999
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,060
And then towards the end, it was I'd tape the thumb drive inside the case.

1000
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:50,200
And then in case of emergency, you break the seal and you restore.

1001
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,420
And so you could easily accomplish that with this feature.

1002
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:58,880
And I really like that because that's sort of the my Hail Mary remote tech support solution

1003
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,660
back in the day was break the seal, reload the machine.

1004
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,220
And I knew because I had made that custom snapshot that it would get them back to a

1005
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,340
state where I could remote support them.

1006
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,340
You could do that with this.

1007
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,820
It'd be a pretty good way to go.

1008
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,900
He says also, he threw this in at the end.

1009
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,940
He says there's so much to like about Fedora, I agree.

1010
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,260
But DNF is a total deal breaker.

1011
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,260
It's so slow.

1012
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,460
They just can't stand it.

1013
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,420
They need to work on that before anything else, in my opinion, he says, glad you made

1014
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,420
it home safely.

1015
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,260
Keep up the good work, Marvin, them fighting words about DNF.

1016
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,260
I love it.

1017
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,260
It's slow because it's sound.

1018
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,260
All right.

1019
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,060
It's doing a good job of updating your system.

1020
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,300
I'll tell you what.

1021
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,180
It's slow because it gets it right.

1022
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:43,620
And if you want to see you want to see painfully slow, check out brew on Mac OS.

1023
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,780
However, I'll also add this.

1024
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,660
We always talk about how fast Pac-Man is and yay in those tools.

1025
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:53,800
But when you stop and pay attention to how many frickin questions by default the arch

1026
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,440
tools ask you, obviously you can configure them or flag them so they don't.

1027
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:03,720
But by default, like you're getting 20 questions before you install like five packages on some

1028
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,720
of these things.

1029
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,060
And so if you think about the actual time it takes, I think DNF may not be so bad and

1030
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:13,940
probably would have fared better when you upgraded that box, not in a team accession

1031
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,700
the other the other week.

1032
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,700
Probably would have.

1033
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,900
And then also there was I was doing an update upstairs just the other day when gnome crashed

1034
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,900
on me.

1035
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,900
Right.

1036
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,900
And I ended up reloading my machine.

1037
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,900
I've had some bad luck recently, Wes.

1038
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,460
I'm just going to skip updates for a while.

1039
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,580
I'm just going to just let things take more snapshots.

1040
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,060
I'll just let them sit, I think.

1041
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,060
Well, you know me.

1042
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,060
That's not true at all.

1043
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,580
In fact, I come in on the weekends and I update machines.

1044
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,580
I just something about it.

1045
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,780
I love fresh, free software.

1046
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,500
I always have.

1047
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,740
And it's kind of like, you know, something you cross off the list.

1048
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:47,060
Oh, yeah, I updated all my machines today.

1049
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:49,540
It does feel like I'm taking care of stuff.

1050
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,740
I'm doing my maintenance.

1051
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:55,500
I'm I'm being a good custodian, if you will, of my systems.

1052
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,820
Well, that brings us to the end of today's unplugged.

1053
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:03,060
We'd love to have you join us live next week for that live punishment test because we need

1054
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,160
as much traffic as our little Comcast connection will handle.

1055
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,940
We actually got pretty far last time, so it has fared fairly well.

1056
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,400
Did you know this show is on Twitter for new release announcements and other things at

1057
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,400
Linux Unplugged.

1058
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,160
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1059
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,740
I'm at Chris Lass.

1060
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,740
He's at Westpane.

1061
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:20,740
Right.

1062
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,740
Or is it at Noble?

1063
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,740
I can't remember.

1064
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,740
It's at Westpane.

1065
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,740
Why don't I remember that?

1066
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,740
I should just have it on a sticky right here.

1067
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,740
Really?

1068
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,740
Really?

1069
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,740
I could just put it on a sticky.

1070
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,020
Remember, Wes is at Westpane.

1071
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,020
Or you just ask me.

1072
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,020
Could do that.

1073
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,620
It could just be a bit that we do now at this point.

1074
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,620
Who really knows?

1075
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,620
But I do know this.

1076
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,620
I'll see you next Tuesday.

1077
00:51:36,620 --> 00:52:00,020
Bye.

1078
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:20,780
Now, I definitely saw in the chat room while we were talking about MX Linux's ISO restore

1079
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:26,900
mode that several people were mentioning other distros like Puppy do this as well.

1080
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,400
So what's a what's a pretty well-known tool?

1081
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,380
Is there one that all these distros are using or they all roll it themselves?

1082
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:38,800
So the Mandrake family had Drac Snapshot, which evolved into its own tool called Make

1083
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,840
Live CD, which became My Live CD.

1084
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,800
The current descendant of the Mandrake family that still uses this is PC Linux OS.

1085
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,140
So you can respin from a PC Linux OS system.

1086
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:54,780
You can respin the whole system as an ISO that you can then use somewhere else.

1087
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,880
So that one exists there.

1088
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,680
And of course, Puppy Linux has its own tool.

1089
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:03,280
The problem with making one that's generic is that since every distro does their plumbing

1090
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,700
layers a little bit differently, well, every distro family, that is, of course, yeah, every

1091
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,500
distro family does their plumbing layers a little differently.

1092
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,580
These tools generally cannot be shared.

1093
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,020
I still just really like using my friend Clonezilla.

1094
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,800
Clonezilla is just recently been updated back in May.

1095
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,620
It's still a project is still going strong.

1096
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:27,300
And it is like my universal like go to for when I for when I receive a review machine,

1097
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,860
I try to do a Clonezilla.

1098
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,860
Right.

1099
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:36,580
Also, with regards to DNF speed or whatever, DNF is getting rewritten into C++ for DNF

1100
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,780
version five, which is coming hopefully this fall.

1101
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,260
Boy, Fedora is going to be getting to be a spicy meatball.

1102
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,260
I tell you what.

1103
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,260
Why not in Rust?

1104
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,260
Oh, no.

1105
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:59,940
No, no, no.
