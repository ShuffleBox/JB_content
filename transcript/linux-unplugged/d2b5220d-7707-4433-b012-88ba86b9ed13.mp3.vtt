WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.960
The case for open source in all of the things researchers have found the code in Volkswagens

00:05.960 --> 00:10.840
that was used to cheat emissions tests and it's pretty sophisticated stuff.

00:10.840 --> 00:16.840
They would monitor all kinds of conditions like the position of the tire, how fast the

00:16.840 --> 00:20.040
engine was having, how hard the engine was having to work to move the tires, how fast

00:20.040 --> 00:26.000
they would spin and it was all tucked away under something very innocuous, just something

00:26.000 --> 00:29.160
really simple called acoustic condition.

00:29.160 --> 00:33.480
Yeah, a little specific piece of code that was just labeled acoustic condition which

00:33.480 --> 00:38.500
was originally started as just a way to control the sounds that the engine makes but it later

00:38.500 --> 00:42.520
became a euphemism for conditions occurring during the emissions test and the code allowed

00:42.520 --> 00:47.960
for as many 10 different profiles, as many as 10 different profiles for different potential

00:47.960 --> 00:48.960
tests.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.440
When the computer would determine the car was undergoing a test, it activated the emissions

00:51.440 --> 00:57.160
curbing system which reduced the amount of nitrogen oxide that was emitted.

00:57.160 --> 01:03.940
I found that kind of interesting because there was, it turns out, also a less sophisticated

01:03.940 --> 01:08.000
version that Fiat was implementing and this one didn't have to worry about like the position

01:08.000 --> 01:13.340
of the tire or how hard it was to spin the wheel, the car's onboard computer just simply

01:13.340 --> 01:18.200
turned on emission curbing software for the first 26 minutes and 40 seconds of the engine

01:18.200 --> 01:19.200
start.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.200
Nice, yeah.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.520
So every time you started your engine, it just ran a little worse for the first 26 minutes

01:22.520 --> 01:23.520
and 40 seconds.

01:23.520 --> 01:24.520
If you were driving somewhere far, then you know.

01:24.520 --> 01:28.040
Yeah, and then that would cover most emissions tests by that point.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.760
Most of them don't run longer than that and so you're out.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.460
Researchers noted that for both Volkswagen and for Fiat, the vehicle's engine control

01:34.460 --> 01:40.280
unit is manufactured by an automotive component giant, Robert Bosch.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.840
Oh, of course.

01:41.840 --> 01:48.680
Yeah, Bosch and car manufacturers are then under their own choice, they can then enable

01:48.680 --> 01:55.240
the code by entering certain parameters into the emissions control unit.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.600
This is why we need open source for all of the things because, you know, our buddy Chase

01:58.600 --> 02:00.120
got bit by this directly.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.120
Did he?

02:01.120 --> 02:02.120
Yeah.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.120
I didn't realize that.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.240
He had to give back his Volkswagen diesel and he's now driving a Ford.

02:07.240 --> 02:24.240
This is Linux Unplugged episode 198 from May 23rd, 2017.

02:24.240 --> 02:28.920
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that might just be planning a barbecue

02:28.920 --> 02:30.080
for its birthday.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.080
My name is Chris.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.600
My name is Wes and I'm hungry for burgers.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.600
Hello, Wes.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.600
Oh, I know.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.600
I know.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.880
You're the one that dropped the word ribs.

02:38.880 --> 02:39.880
Just saying.

02:39.880 --> 02:40.880
You might have to own that one, Wes.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.920
You might have to own those barbecue ribs.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.880
Coming up though on this week's episode, we're not there yet.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.040
We're not yet to episode 200.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.600
No, we're going to talk about some of our favorite open source projects, one that I

02:49.600 --> 02:51.720
bet you have been looking for.

02:51.720 --> 02:55.640
If you've ever considered getting a Chromecast and want to integrate it with your Linux box,

02:55.640 --> 02:59.920
we'll talk about that, which I am particularly excited about because I have a Chromecast

02:59.920 --> 03:02.560
sitting around needing to get a little more useful.

03:02.560 --> 03:06.360
If you want to update some Logitech hardware under Linux, which I do, we have some good

03:06.360 --> 03:07.520
news for you.

03:07.520 --> 03:12.420
Big updates from Solus, a new version of Nextcloud is in the house and Joss will be here to talk

03:12.420 --> 03:13.760
about it with us.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.400
And then the magic device tool, I mentioned it a little bit last week.

03:17.400 --> 03:21.040
It promises to make my Nexus 5 usable.

03:21.040 --> 03:25.320
We'll talk with Marius, the gentleman who created the magic device tool, a simple and

03:25.320 --> 03:29.940
feature rich tool to install or replace operating systems on a lot of common phones.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.840
It's really slick.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.520
And then also, we'll tell you a little bit about our barbecue plans, a little bit of

03:34.520 --> 03:38.280
news that's going on, and of course, all of the wonderful discussions.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.720
But one of the things I need to do right off the top because I neglected to do it last

03:41.720 --> 03:45.480
week right now, prepare yourselves.

03:45.480 --> 03:46.640
We're going to bring in that Mumble Room.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.440
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:48.440 --> 03:49.440
Hello.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.440
Hello.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.440
Hello.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.440
Hello.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.440
Hello.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.440
Dear friends.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
Hey, you know what?

03:55.440 --> 03:59.320
That intro right there, that whole show, powered by the new open source caster soundboard,

03:59.320 --> 04:00.320
how great was that?

04:00.320 --> 04:02.480
Hey, you know what?

04:02.480 --> 04:04.960
That ding right there, also powered by the open source soundboard.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.960
100% digital ding.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.940
It is so awesome.

04:09.940 --> 04:14.420
If you haven't checked it out yet, you should go to github.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

04:14.420 --> 04:16.440
and check out caster soundboard.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.400
Now with new art graphics, like look at that icon right there.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.400
You see that duck?

04:20.400 --> 04:21.400
Yeah.

04:21.400 --> 04:22.400
Look at that cute little duck.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.400
Albert made us that.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.820
That tells, that's the system-wide ducking.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.240
You hit that and it ducks all the audio.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.240
Awesome.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.820
Brings it down to 33%.

04:28.820 --> 04:29.960
Such a cool piece of software.

04:29.960 --> 04:34.620
A legitimately competitive piece of software that was created by our community and it's

04:34.620 --> 04:35.620
just so awesome.

04:35.620 --> 04:36.620
And it's come so far so fast.

04:36.620 --> 04:37.620
Yeah.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.620
And we're using it in production now on all the shows.

04:39.620 --> 04:40.800
It's pretty neat.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.480
And you guys can go check it out if you want.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.880
Now we'll talk about, we've got a bunch of stuff to talk about today.

04:44.880 --> 04:45.920
That's not really it.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.240
But why don't we talk about something else that's up on github?

04:49.240 --> 04:57.240
MK, so Mik maybe, Chromecast, MK Chromecast, which allows Mac and Linux machines to send

04:57.240 --> 05:02.680
audio and video to Google Cast devices and also Sonos devices.

05:02.680 --> 05:06.720
Which not particularly appealing to me but I bet is to some people.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.600
You can find more at MKChromecast.com.

05:10.600 --> 05:14.860
And it's a program that lets you cast your audio or your Linux audio, whichever, it's

05:14.860 --> 05:17.440
Mac or Linux, I don't think it works on Windows.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.240
And it can also send video files.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.240
Nice.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.260
Super nice, over the land.

05:23.260 --> 05:30.480
If you've ever had like, in fact it was like a, it must have been like Christmas or Thanksgiving

05:30.480 --> 05:32.960
or Halloween, some recent major holiday event.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.120
We had all these videos on my computer and I wanted to play it for the family on the

05:36.120 --> 05:37.120
television.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.360
And I ended up installing all these crazy Chrome extensions to try to make it work and

05:41.360 --> 05:42.360
they were super rickety.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.560
You have to pay a bunch.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.560
Yeah, yeah.

05:45.560 --> 05:50.360
This is just using FFmpeg and AVConf on the back end.

05:50.360 --> 05:56.400
I think it's spinning up a Node.js instance and then it's using some MP3 codec encoding

05:56.400 --> 05:57.520
to send it to this thing.

05:57.520 --> 06:02.120
But at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter because it's allowing you to stream

06:02.120 --> 06:03.120
high end audio.

06:03.120 --> 06:08.560
You can do 24 bit, 96 kilohertz, high resolution audio using this thing.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.480
And the other thing that's really nice about it is it integrates in on either the Mac OS

06:12.480 --> 06:17.400
menu bar or if you're on Gnome or the Plasma desktop, it can also integrate with the desktop

06:17.400 --> 06:18.400
there too.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.560
So you get a little like a little Chromecast icon.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.560
Look at that.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.560
That is slick.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.560
Yeah.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.840
How fantastic would this be, right?

06:26.840 --> 06:30.160
Now Sweetlo, you were going to mention CastNow.

06:30.160 --> 06:39.080
Yeah I'm assuming that this MK Chromecast program works similar to how CastNow works.

06:39.080 --> 06:45.560
I've ran CastNow a couple of times before and it did the job in that, mostly during

06:45.560 --> 06:50.000
times when I was having issues with something like YouTube or something.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.960
One thing CastNow can do that this can't, I'm not positive, is I think CastNow supports

06:54.960 --> 07:00.960
torrents directly, but CastNow is command line only, whereas this integrates with the

07:00.960 --> 07:03.340
menu bar on your desktop and stuff, which some people would prefer.

07:03.340 --> 07:07.000
And it looks like CastNow isn't super, I mean there are some people making commits to it,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.600
but on the read me there it talks about how the guy's kind of moved on, he's using DLNA.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.560
So I know I'd use CastNow in the past too, so it's interesting to see another contender.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
Yeah.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.440
You know like Sweetlo says, I know I've run into times where certain content providers

07:17.440 --> 07:18.880
are like, why are you not working?

07:18.880 --> 07:22.840
I could just download the file, play it on the TV, so hey, there you go.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.040
Well and there is some legitimate use for Chromecast like in the workspace too.

07:26.040 --> 07:29.780
So if you could throw a Chromecast on a television in a conference room and now you can send

07:29.780 --> 07:33.620
stuff to it from your Linux box, that could be some money.

07:33.620 --> 07:37.140
So it's MK Chromecast, it's only $100.

07:37.140 --> 07:42.240
So you just go there, you give them your username, if you don't have an account, create one,

07:42.240 --> 07:45.680
give them your shipping address, make sure you have a U.S. credit card, they only take

07:45.680 --> 07:46.680
U.S. credit card.

07:46.680 --> 07:52.360
Yeah, maybe you're social, and then it's only $100, what, I'm sorry, what?

07:52.360 --> 07:57.480
Oh, this is not the Mac Action Show, uh-huh, okay, oh it's free, okay, uh-huh, okay.

07:57.480 --> 08:01.880
I'm sorry, it uses something called the open source, and it's free, it's totally free,

08:01.880 --> 08:02.880
100%, who knew?

08:02.880 --> 08:03.880
Can we trust that?

08:03.880 --> 08:04.880
Who knew?

08:04.880 --> 08:08.360
I wouldn't, but you know what, I guess if you want to take your own risk.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.720
You come back next week with a paid version and maybe we'll talk.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.760
I'm just telling you, man, I'm just telling you.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.080
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.080
That is not us.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.240
So I like to mess with my hardware peripherals.

08:19.240 --> 08:23.000
I have a bunch, right now in front of me, I have a bunch of Logitech hardware, and one

08:23.000 --> 08:26.600
of the things that's great about Logitech is they have these unifying receivers.

08:26.600 --> 08:30.920
You put one USB, little itty bitty USB receiver, and you can have your mouse and your keyboard

08:30.920 --> 08:32.560
using one receiver.

08:32.560 --> 08:35.620
Well, guess what?

08:35.620 --> 08:38.480
There is a vulnerability, in fact a whole suite of vulnerabilities, and when you put

08:38.480 --> 08:40.960
them all together, it even has a great name called MouseJack.

08:40.960 --> 08:44.520
It uses a whole bunch of different stuff, vulnerabilities that are targeted, the low

08:44.520 --> 08:49.200
level wireless protocol that's used by the unifying devices, they can do things like

08:49.200 --> 08:53.960
pair new devices without prompting the user, they can inject keystrokes, they can inject

08:53.960 --> 08:57.760
raw HID commands with about $15 of hardware.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.140
You could be 50 meters away in doing this.

09:00.140 --> 09:04.960
So that typical imagine sitting in a cafe scenario is, of course, it's very scary.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.920
I have a little mouse I take with me everywhere.

09:06.920 --> 09:07.920
Yeah, me too.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.600
That's what I'm all about.

09:09.600 --> 09:15.560
These Logitech MX Anywheres are the best little laptop meese on the market, and so I have

09:15.560 --> 09:18.360
these unifying receivers everywhere.

09:18.360 --> 09:22.680
So Logitech Bastille Security worked with them, and Logitech acknowledged they had a

09:22.680 --> 09:26.300
problem, and it took them a couple of releases, but after a couple of releases, they have

09:26.300 --> 09:27.800
some updates that fix it.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.280
It took them a few weeks, but they got it.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.280
They fixed it.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.480
The issue is solved, unless you're running Linux.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.840
So they call up Logitech, and they're like, okay, here's what we're thinking about doing.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.820
The cat's out of the bag on this whole mouse jack thing.

09:39.820 --> 09:44.460
So we now know how we can randomly flash firmware onto your proprietary hardware.

09:44.460 --> 09:49.640
If you gave us a little bit of official documentation, I bet you we could flash that secure firmware

09:49.640 --> 09:56.200
onto these receivers using FW upload, which is a standard Linux utility.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.680
It took a couple of weeks, and they rewrote the previously reverse-engineered plug-in

10:00.680 --> 10:02.320
for FW upload.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.680
The new documentation from Logitech came in, so they knew exactly what they were supposed

10:05.680 --> 10:08.320
to do, how everything was supposed to match up, byte by byte.

10:08.320 --> 10:13.920
They compared it with the Windows update version, and they were able to push this new firmware.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.840
You could actually test it, too, right now.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.240
If you'd like to test it, you need to get the new version of FW upload, because you

10:19.240 --> 10:25.160
have to be able to talk to the hardware, so you need version 0.9.2-2, which is in Fedora

10:25.160 --> 10:29.560
26 right now, and you can get it from Koji or for Fedora.

10:29.560 --> 10:33.320
If you scroll just down a little bit there, doesn't it sure look nice in that GNOME software

10:33.320 --> 10:35.160
that you just have that little update?

10:35.160 --> 10:36.160
This is the idea, right?

10:36.160 --> 10:41.520
They can then use this down the road via GNOME software update to update firmware like this.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.040
That's brilliant, I think.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.920
It shows you how everything... You've got to be thinking about the update life cycle

10:46.920 --> 10:48.700
on everything now.

10:48.700 --> 10:52.160
We're so used to talking about... We're about to talk about an update to Nextcloud.

10:52.160 --> 10:56.200
We're used to talking about an update to our GNOME desktop, but there's even bootloader

10:56.200 --> 10:59.360
code on these little receivers that the documentation-

10:59.360 --> 11:03.360
Turtles all the way down, and the turtles run horrible, ancient software.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.760
Yes, very well put.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.160
It is turtles all the way down.

11:07.160 --> 11:13.440
That's why we always are looking for a little refreshing cup of tea, or maybe a nice, relaxing

11:13.440 --> 11:15.960
bowl of soup.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.920
We got a little plasma in the soup this time.

11:17.920 --> 11:24.840
Yeah, so Ikea has a rare blog post over at the Solus site, and it looks like, ladies

11:24.840 --> 11:30.320
and gentlemen, prepare yourselves for the shocker of a lifetime, but it's early days,

11:30.320 --> 11:37.740
but the plasma desktop is coming to Solus, and I actually think this is a great combination.

11:37.740 --> 11:41.040
That's why I wanted to put it in here, because I think Solus is a great distribution, and

11:41.040 --> 11:46.880
I think this could be one of the great plasma distributions if they work on it.

11:46.880 --> 11:51.660
So right now, it's not officially supported, but they have Peter.

11:51.660 --> 11:53.560
He's working on the project.

11:53.560 --> 11:58.520
He's been maintaining plasma packages and KDE dependencies for a while, because it turns

11:58.520 --> 12:03.640
out things like KDE and Live, Corita, K3b are pretty popular among Solus users, so they're

12:03.640 --> 12:07.240
already packing in all of the dependencies for that anyways, and they're packaging...

12:07.240 --> 12:08.520
So it wasn't that much further to just...

12:08.520 --> 12:09.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:09.960 --> 12:14.900
So the way Ikea writes this is, he says, Peter's ambition is to eventually support a full plasma

12:14.900 --> 12:20.680
stack on Solus, and if you want to help him get there, you can help him evolve it, so

12:20.680 --> 12:26.340
you can get involved, work with Peter, help Peter report bugs, things like that.

12:26.340 --> 12:29.000
So do you think this would be something that you're interested in?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.840
Are you doing it over here now?

12:30.840 --> 12:31.840
Is this Solus here?

12:31.840 --> 12:32.840
No, I just wanted you to...

12:32.840 --> 12:33.840
Yeah.

12:33.840 --> 12:34.840
Okay.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.840
Maybe.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.840
I would consider it.

12:37.840 --> 12:44.560
I would definitely kick the tires, and Ikea here has laid out to who's now working on

12:44.560 --> 12:45.560
the different desktops.

12:45.560 --> 12:50.080
Josh is working on GnomeShell, Ikea's working on Budgie, Peter on KDE Plasma, Justin on

12:50.080 --> 12:51.080
Mate.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.080
It's a nice insight into how the projects...

12:52.080 --> 12:53.080
Yeah.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.080
What they're each kind of focusing on.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.080
Yeah.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.080
Good for them.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.080
Yeah.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.080
So if you asked about it, I'm excited to see where they take Budgie.

12:58.080 --> 13:02.400
I think it's great to have another distribution where Plasma could eventually become a tier

13:02.400 --> 13:04.320
one citizen.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.040
Patreon.com slash Solus if you want to help them.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.580
I think this would be a great way, even if you're not running Solus, but you like what

13:09.580 --> 13:11.240
they're doing.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.880
I really like the idea that there's a project out there that's making a really modern distro,

13:14.880 --> 13:19.280
and they're not being religious about what desktop you have to use, and they're playing

13:19.280 --> 13:20.680
well with others too.

13:20.680 --> 13:25.880
Patreon.com slash Solus, and keep up the great work, guys.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.480
I'll probably be checking it out.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.480
I'll probably check it out.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.480
I bet you will.

13:29.480 --> 13:33.400
So NextCloud12 is out, and Joss is here to chat with us about it.

13:33.400 --> 13:37.160
So before we go there, before we get any further, let's take a moment and thank our first sponsor

13:37.160 --> 13:38.160
this week, Linux Academy.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.160
Oh, yeah.

13:39.160 --> 13:43.600
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, a platform where you can learn more about Linux and all

13:43.600 --> 13:45.680
of the technology around Linux.

13:45.680 --> 13:50.560
I think this is a resource that if you would have told Chris from 10 years ago existed,

13:50.560 --> 13:52.080
he would have been delighted.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.880
When I first started working with Linux, I actually just went and got a bunch of books,

13:55.880 --> 13:59.360
and then I tried to find community college courses, and it was always hit and miss on

13:59.360 --> 14:03.400
how good the instructor was going to be, and I would try to figure out what courseware

14:03.400 --> 14:08.160
would be the best investment of my time, and there was really no oversight or way to figure

14:08.160 --> 14:12.240
it all out, especially for somebody who's busy and had a lot going on.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.860
Linux Academy checks all those boxes and more.

14:14.860 --> 14:17.640
So it's built by people that are incredibly passionate about Linux.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.840
They have full-time instructors available when you need them.

14:20.840 --> 14:29.120
They're continually investing in content to make Linux Academy more valuable.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.320
They have hands-on labs and exercises.

14:31.320 --> 14:34.220
They have in-depth cert training if that's the route you want to go.

14:34.220 --> 14:35.920
You get unlimited access to the courses.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.400
They spin up the servers on demand when you need them.

14:38.400 --> 14:43.440
They're even doing deep dives into things like AWS and Azure and all that kind of stuff.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.880
Man, it is a new world, and Linux Academy is going to help you meet it head on.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.440
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

14:49.440 --> 14:53.400
You go there, you sign up for a free seven-day trial, try them all out, get a little idea

14:53.400 --> 14:59.800
of how it works, wrap your head around it a bit, enjoy, and if you have any questions,

14:59.800 --> 15:01.960
take advantage of that instructor mentoring.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.300
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.720
Sign up for a free seven-day trial and support the show, and a big thank you to Linux Academy

15:07.720 --> 15:09.560
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

15:09.560 --> 15:14.680
See, I think at that point, you'd have to work hard to not learn something.

15:14.680 --> 15:20.600
Ah, man, you would really have to not want to learn, which would sort of defeat the purpose.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.280
Why are you doing that?

15:22.280 --> 15:23.440
So Joss joins us again.

15:23.440 --> 15:25.160
Hey Joss, welcome back to the show, sir.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.160
Good to have you.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.920
Hey guys, nice to be here again.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.240
Thanks for inviting me.

15:30.240 --> 15:36.000
Now we have a new Nextcloud on our hands, and it looks like it's going global scale

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
this time.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Congrats.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah, you like that, huh?

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I do, I do, I do like that.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.720
There's also a couple other features in there that are actually more applicable directly

15:44.720 --> 15:50.200
to me, like writable public links, improvements to the audio video chat.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.200
But Joss, you're the expert.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.640
Where do you think we should start on the new release?

15:53.640 --> 15:57.920
Well, let's start, indeed, about the smaller features.

15:57.920 --> 16:01.240
Well, I mean, next to global scale, everything looks small.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.560
That's kind of the point of it.

16:02.560 --> 16:06.160
But yeah, I think the collaboration features that you mentioned, like that you can send

16:06.160 --> 16:11.760
a public link to someone with like a Collabora file, you know, a docx or something, and then

16:11.760 --> 16:13.320
they can add it together with you.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.480
They don't need an account.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.480
That's really nice.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.480
Very nice.

16:16.480 --> 16:22.400
So it's essentially a very easy drop in replacement for Google Docs, because the end user you're

16:22.400 --> 16:24.200
just sending a link to, they just click it and they're in.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.280
They don't have to worry about what the software is.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.160
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.160
Our Office 365.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.880
I mean, that's kind of officially what we're going after.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.480
I mean, a lot of the other features, you see the same thing.

16:35.480 --> 16:40.080
I mean, obviously, on top of that, you have all the control things, you know, that you

16:40.080 --> 16:45.040
can say, okay, file access control, you can only you can limit, you know, access to files

16:45.040 --> 16:51.840
from certain IP ranges or certain file types, you can say like, yeah, people in the HR department

16:51.840 --> 16:58.640
when they share an Excel sheet via public link, you know, that is not accessible from

16:58.640 --> 17:02.720
outside of the company, internal network, stuff like that.

17:02.720 --> 17:06.320
You know, so you can put these these policies on top of it, which you can't really do with

17:06.320 --> 17:10.560
most of the other solutions, because it just, well, they're not self hosted, they they're

17:10.560 --> 17:14.320
not built to give you that kind of control as an administrator.

17:14.320 --> 17:15.320
Sure.

17:15.320 --> 17:21.120
And what what are the what are the when you say the big changes for like the global scale,

17:21.120 --> 17:24.400
what does that really translate to what is what are the real technical changes happening

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
behind the scenes?

17:25.400 --> 17:30.640
Yeah, so global scale, let me introduce it quickly for those who haven't seen it or seen

17:30.640 --> 17:31.640
our video.

17:31.640 --> 17:37.080
So the idea behind global scale is to transform the architecture of Nextcloud.

17:37.080 --> 17:42.520
So Nextcloud, when Frank started this seven, eight years ago, it started as a standard

17:42.520 --> 17:43.520
web app.

17:43.520 --> 17:48.600
So in a web application, you can scale by just throwing more hardware at it at least

17:48.600 --> 17:50.200
to a certain degree.

17:50.200 --> 17:56.040
So with Nextcloud, you can you have an application server, Nextcloud itself, and then you have

17:56.040 --> 18:01.960
database and storage and user directory like LDAP, and you connect it to those three.

18:01.960 --> 18:05.040
And Nextcloud itself scales almost without limits.

18:05.040 --> 18:11.080
If you want twice as many users, you just put down two Nextcloud servers.

18:11.080 --> 18:14.800
But the thing is, they both need to connect to the same database and same storage and

18:14.800 --> 18:16.460
the same user directory.

18:16.460 --> 18:21.280
So at a certain scale, and I mean, you're talking about 10, 20, 30,000 users is all

18:21.280 --> 18:27.360
quite doable, but if you get above 50,000, you really need to buy very expensive enterprise

18:27.360 --> 18:34.720
storage, very expensive enterprise databases, it gets very pricey and slow at some point.

18:34.720 --> 18:38.760
So that's what we want to fix.

18:38.760 --> 18:43.880
So that's also what makes it more than interesting for really big solutions.

18:43.880 --> 18:52.200
So global scale, the goal was to scale beyond 100 million users, like seriously huge installation

18:52.200 --> 18:54.000
should be possible.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.060
And the second goal was to lower the costs.

18:56.060 --> 19:03.480
As I said, you get really high storage and database costs at the high end at large installations.

19:03.480 --> 19:08.240
And the third was actually something a lot of people have been asking for, which is to

19:08.240 --> 19:13.400
be able to say about the data that's on your Nextcloud, to be able to kind of split it

19:13.400 --> 19:19.120
up and to say, look, I want this data to physically stay in San Francisco and this data to physically

19:19.120 --> 19:20.600
stay in Germany.

19:20.600 --> 19:25.840
Now you kind of could do that with Nextcloud 11 and 10 and other older releases by using

19:25.840 --> 19:31.440
federation and you would simply have two servers and then the users would have to log in to

19:31.440 --> 19:35.300
one or the other and then they could share with each other because they were connected

19:35.300 --> 19:36.400
via federation.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.680
That's kind of nice.

19:37.680 --> 19:43.200
We still have multiple places to log in and what if an employee moves from the US to Europe?

19:43.200 --> 19:47.560
You know, like you have to close their account and then create a new account, move their

19:47.560 --> 19:49.640
data, all their shares will be gone.

19:49.640 --> 19:50.640
That's kind of uncool.

19:50.640 --> 19:55.760
So it wouldn't act like one instance, a little bit, but not really.

19:55.760 --> 20:01.000
So this is what global scale is about, to make these three things different.

20:01.000 --> 20:08.300
And it does that by splitting up indeed what federation did, except that it adds a couple

20:08.300 --> 20:12.520
of components on top of that to make it act like a single instance.

20:12.520 --> 20:16.840
So, you get the global site selector.

20:16.840 --> 20:21.840
It's simply a server that when you log in, you go to cloud.nextcloud.com.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.280
It's what I do every day, right?

20:23.280 --> 20:25.160
That's our internal cloud.

20:25.160 --> 20:29.360
And from there it automatically redirects you to the node where your data is.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.400
So in my case it would be in Germany.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.400
And what is doing that?

20:32.400 --> 20:33.440
What's doing that redirection?

20:33.440 --> 20:37.400
Is there some global master login database that knows where to send people?

20:37.400 --> 20:38.400
Yeah.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.920
So that's the global site selector itself.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.480
It knows where you are.

20:41.480 --> 20:48.600
The global site selector, is this a new piece of server software that Nextcloud is publishing?

20:48.600 --> 20:49.600
Yes.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.600
Correct.

20:50.600 --> 20:58.960
It's a new separate, we actually implemented it, I have to see how it was implemented.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.840
Give me a second.

21:01.840 --> 21:02.840
Interesting though.

21:02.840 --> 21:07.680
Because a number of things was done as an app and I would have to look up the details

21:07.680 --> 21:08.680
there.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.760
But it's a separate server component.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.600
It's a separate thing that you have to run.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.080
And that's where the users log in and then it redirects them.

21:16.080 --> 21:21.000
And the user sets a cookie so that they don't have to go over this server every single time,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
right?

21:22.000 --> 21:26.320
Because your client logs in every 30 seconds and that would mean with 100 million users

21:26.320 --> 21:31.920
you got 300 million connections every 30 seconds.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.380
That's a little crazy.

21:34.380 --> 21:39.120
So they remember what the node was, but as a user you don't notice that.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.120
It's not that your URL changes.

21:41.120 --> 21:44.080
You just go to cloud.nextcloud.com.

21:44.080 --> 21:49.080
So you're in one place, but in the underlying there you're actually connected to a local

21:49.080 --> 21:50.080
data center.

21:50.080 --> 21:53.880
If local data switch fast, it's under control of the local sys admins.

21:53.880 --> 21:58.920
They can say this data has to stay here or there and you know, it's all transparent for

21:58.920 --> 21:59.920
you.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.080
So that's one component.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.880
And there are two more.

22:03.880 --> 22:09.880
So the second component, that would be the lookup server.

22:09.880 --> 22:14.080
So the lookup server, it knows where you are.

22:14.080 --> 22:20.360
It's actually the global site selector that keeps a database with the node.

22:20.360 --> 22:23.440
But the lookup server knows where you physically are.

22:23.440 --> 22:27.600
It also knows your user sharing ID.

22:27.600 --> 22:32.440
And when you migrate between nodes and your sharing ID changes too, then the lookup server

22:32.440 --> 22:37.600
will keep a list of those so that if somebody connects is looking for an old share ID, then

22:37.600 --> 22:39.880
the lookup server will redirect that to the new one.

22:39.880 --> 22:44.280
So the lookup server is all about sharing.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.960
Even if you would switch between, for example, providers, but I'll get to that a little bit

22:48.960 --> 22:52.920
later, but lookup server is really important also for normal users.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.880
Like this is not only relevant for a hundred million user deployment, but also for smaller

22:56.880 --> 22:57.880
ones.

22:57.880 --> 22:58.880
I'll get to that.

22:58.880 --> 23:03.520
So it also stores information about you, like the quality of service metrics, like your

23:03.520 --> 23:07.240
storage and quota settings, your reliability class.

23:07.240 --> 23:11.080
Maybe you want your data replicated at least three times.

23:11.080 --> 23:15.760
Maybe you're a VIP and you need always to be on SSD, stuff like that.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.080
That's all in the lookup server.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.080
Interesting.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.960
And then the third part is the balancer.

23:20.960 --> 23:25.740
And the balancer also runs on a dedicated machine and it monitors all the nodes.

23:25.740 --> 23:32.160
So in Nextcloud 10 you might remember we introduced the monitoring app, which gives you either

23:32.160 --> 23:38.560
via the web interface or via an API information about the CPU load, the memory load, the number

23:38.560 --> 23:42.040
of shares, the number of users, all this kind of information.

23:42.040 --> 23:48.480
Now this actually fits with the balancer because it takes that data and it keeps track of it.

23:48.480 --> 23:54.120
And when it sees that the node is overloaded, it can actually initiate a migration of user

23:54.120 --> 23:57.840
accounts from one node to another.

23:57.840 --> 24:03.520
Or if it asks the lookup server where a user is, then it says, oh, this user just moved

24:03.520 --> 24:08.200
from the US to Europe, let's migrate the user from the US data center to the Europe data

24:08.200 --> 24:12.340
center and bang, the balancer makes that happen.

24:12.340 --> 24:17.080
Or maybe you need to be moved on SSD because you bought an upgrade from your server provider

24:17.080 --> 24:20.360
and you need faster data transfer.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.560
So the balancer will make sure that you get on SSDs.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.920
So this is the kind of stuff that the balancer does.

24:25.920 --> 24:30.680
That is, that sounds super high end and fancy for enterprises, sounds like it's probably

24:30.680 --> 24:32.120
be amazing for a lot of...

24:32.120 --> 24:33.120
Flexible too, yeah.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.120
Yeah.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.000
And probably very useful for a lot of state installations.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.280
Is there benefits that the home user or smaller, you know, small office user will also glean

24:41.280 --> 24:42.280
from any of this?

24:42.280 --> 24:44.680
Yeah, so that's a cool thing.

24:44.680 --> 24:47.360
There are a number of elements where this helps normal users.

24:47.360 --> 24:51.560
Now first of all, of course, the ability to migrate between servers, imagine you're at

24:51.560 --> 24:54.260
one service provider and you don't like them.

24:54.260 --> 24:57.120
You can migrate to another with all your data, with everything.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.400
I mean, that's really cool.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.560
This is something we're working on, by the way, I have to give a little caveat here.

25:02.560 --> 25:04.680
So global scale isn't done yet.

25:04.680 --> 25:05.840
We have a couple of pieces.

25:05.840 --> 25:12.680
We have, for example, the lookup server, we have the global site selector, the lookup

25:12.680 --> 25:15.720
server still needs more work, but it's already up and running.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.360
We're using this already.

25:17.360 --> 25:21.000
The balancer still needs to be done.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.040
We've started working on the migration, but at the moment this is only doing the data

25:25.040 --> 25:26.040
of the users.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.040
So it's not doing a lot yet.

25:27.040 --> 25:31.120
Josh, speaking of the global server, if I'm, you know, I'm Justin Trudeau and I want to

25:31.120 --> 25:37.280
move the entire Canadian government over to Nextcloud, can I run my own global server?

25:37.280 --> 25:39.480
Or is that something that's only hosted by Nextcloud?

25:39.480 --> 25:41.160
How does that particular part work?

25:41.160 --> 25:43.560
No, this is part of your own installation.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.080
So all these pieces are fully open source.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.080
They're in our GitHub.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.880
And the idea is that, well, we would probably need to help a customer to set all this stuff

25:49.880 --> 25:54.440
up, especially if you're big like the Canadian government, but you would run all these components

25:54.440 --> 25:59.560
as part of your infrastructure and that would then be one massive Nextcloud system that

25:59.560 --> 26:02.400
consists of nodes in every major city, for example.

26:02.400 --> 26:08.260
So everybody has fast access, but at the same time, you know, it's cheap because you're

26:08.260 --> 26:12.760
on all these small, you know, like two machines or something, you know, we're thinking that

26:12.760 --> 26:17.440
nodes would have two to maybe six machines and that's all commodity hardware.

26:17.440 --> 26:22.000
So that's way cheaper than this really high end storage stuff that you currently need.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.700
So are you guys going to put feelers out with companies to see if they want to become like

26:26.700 --> 26:29.240
a Nextcloud provider?

26:29.240 --> 26:33.120
So there is already like a few dozen Nextcloud providers and some of the bigger ones will

26:33.120 --> 26:34.920
definitely be interested in this.

26:34.920 --> 26:39.520
And this is also something that might be interesting for service providers, like for telephone

26:39.520 --> 26:45.760
providers, for example, telecom, mobile, photo phone, those guys might be interested in this

26:45.760 --> 26:48.200
as well to provide this to their customers.

26:48.200 --> 26:52.160
Because until now, you know, with own cloud and now Nextcloud, you couldn't really do

26:52.160 --> 26:57.160
this because you couldn't get 50 million, 10 million users on a single system, right?

26:57.160 --> 27:00.120
I mean, that wouldn't really work well.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.600
And with global scale, you can actually do this now.

27:03.600 --> 27:06.840
So that's really a nice step forward.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.920
Another nice thing, because you were asking about what this does for home users, another

27:09.920 --> 27:15.880
nice thing is this lookup server, because we already had a lookup server, a more limited

27:15.880 --> 27:16.880
lookup server.

27:16.880 --> 27:23.000
And the idea of the lookup server was always to allow you to store your federated cloud

27:23.000 --> 27:28.400
ID and maybe some personal data that you choose, for example, your Twitter account, so that

27:28.400 --> 27:33.280
people could look up what your federated cloud ID is, so they can share with you, it's like

27:33.280 --> 27:35.840
an email address, they could look it up on the lookup server.

27:35.840 --> 27:40.600
They say, oh, I know this guy's, you know, I know Chris Lust, that's his Twitter account,

27:40.600 --> 27:45.160
you know, you look it up, and then you get your federated cloud sharing ID, and then

27:45.160 --> 27:46.600
they can share files with you.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.600
That's cool.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.600
Yeah.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.600
Huh.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.640
So this is all in beta right now, yes?

27:51.640 --> 27:53.280
It's all still kind of...

27:53.280 --> 27:55.640
Yeah, beta is a good term for it.

27:55.640 --> 27:59.280
I mean, we're putting all the pieces together now.

27:59.280 --> 28:03.080
But we want the people to talk about this, to help us test it, you know, to get involved

28:03.080 --> 28:04.800
with this, to give feedback on it.

28:04.800 --> 28:08.680
And the core Nextcloud 12 release is out and solid, sounds like a lot of folks are already

28:08.680 --> 28:10.240
jumping on and doing the upgrade.

28:10.240 --> 28:13.680
Oh, yeah, it's totally, it's really cool, actually.

28:13.680 --> 28:18.760
I tweeted earlier today, you know, it's so nice to see so many people say, like, yeah,

28:18.760 --> 28:22.400
you know, we're upgraded, and it was totally smooth, as I've gotten used to.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.400
That's great.

28:23.400 --> 28:27.640
Now, you might remember in the old days, it wasn't always like that.

28:27.640 --> 28:31.560
And I haven't seen a single person complain about upgrades yet, except one person was

28:31.560 --> 28:37.000
really angry on the forums because an upgrade from beta 1 to beta 2 didn't work well.

28:37.000 --> 28:42.600
Now, I personally take it as a compliment that the only fault you can find is in a pre-release

28:42.600 --> 28:43.600
version.

28:43.600 --> 28:49.240
You know, so yeah, this is really nice to see that we really managed to get the update

28:49.240 --> 28:50.960
and upgrade issues under control.

28:50.960 --> 28:56.600
I gotta say, I really like seeing, as far as security goes, I like seeing rate limiting

28:56.600 --> 29:00.360
in there, which is kind of nice for developers to be able to specify, like, yeah, certain

29:00.360 --> 29:03.440
rate limits based on IP range and time periods.

29:03.440 --> 29:08.040
And looks like some improvements to two-factor authentication, support for other authentication

29:08.040 --> 29:11.320
mechanisms like OpenID and OAuth 2 and Kerberos.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.960
That's all pretty solid stuff, Joss.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.080
Yeah, it's full of really cool features.

29:15.080 --> 29:19.240
I mean, you have a lot of functions, like the guest app, you know, you can create a

29:19.240 --> 29:25.720
temporary restricted account to a customer or a friend or a partner to share data with.

29:25.720 --> 29:29.240
You have an app that can, well, we're working on a backup app now.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.760
A lot of users will probably be very happy to hear that.

29:31.760 --> 29:35.680
It's Frank himself who started to code that together at the last Hack Week.

29:35.680 --> 29:36.680
Awesome.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.400
So that's really, really cool.

29:38.400 --> 29:43.440
And then we have the Circles app, which is, it's like user defined groups, you know, you

29:43.440 --> 29:48.380
can create your own groups of people that you share with a lot.

29:48.380 --> 29:53.880
And one thing that its developer is already working on is to make it then possible to

29:53.880 --> 29:57.200
also just share your mood, you know, like a status update.

29:57.200 --> 30:02.800
And at that point, then people who would follow you as part of a circle, because people can

30:02.800 --> 30:06.280
join circles and leave circles, they can see status updates.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.840
I mean, you all know where this is going, right?

30:08.840 --> 30:09.840
That's really cool stuff.

30:09.840 --> 30:10.840
Huh.

30:10.840 --> 30:11.840
Interesting.

30:11.840 --> 30:12.840
Interesting.

30:12.840 --> 30:13.840
That'll be something to watch for.

30:13.840 --> 30:14.840
See where that develops.

30:14.840 --> 30:18.880
Boy, I mean, you guys don't have enough things you're taking on?

30:18.880 --> 30:19.880
No kidding.

30:19.880 --> 30:23.700
Yeah, the thing is, we have all the pieces already, right?

30:23.700 --> 30:25.040
We have this federation.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.840
This just kind of piggies back on it.

30:26.840 --> 30:31.700
Like with Nexlot 12, one of the little changes to federation that comes together with other

30:31.700 --> 30:35.160
stuff is that we are now federating activities.

30:35.160 --> 30:41.080
So if you federate a file, you share a file from one Nexlot server to another server,

30:41.080 --> 30:45.840
and then on the other server it gets changed by the recipient, then you will see that in

30:45.840 --> 30:47.120
your activity feed now.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.120
Oh yeah.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.120
Wow, that's cool.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.120
Yeah.

30:50.120 --> 30:54.720
And once we have this like metadata sharing between servers in place, well, it's completely

30:54.720 --> 30:55.720
trivial.

30:55.720 --> 31:01.360
It's just a small number of lines of code to also share non-file related events, which

31:01.360 --> 31:03.640
would be like Moot, right?

31:03.640 --> 31:06.980
It's actually quite a simple thing to just inject something else in there.

31:06.980 --> 31:10.960
So we're building this infrastructure and we're just using it.

31:10.960 --> 31:11.960
Yeah.

31:11.960 --> 31:12.960
Yeah.

31:12.960 --> 31:16.640
And actually, as you were talking, I was thinking that very thing, and it just seems to all

31:16.640 --> 31:17.640
make sense.

31:17.640 --> 31:18.920
It seems like a good direction to go.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.720
And it seems like functionality that will make sharing between Nexcloud servers even

31:22.720 --> 31:23.720
easier.

31:23.720 --> 31:27.680
Yeah, I mean, Nexcloud is like a core part of the lifeblood of my system.

31:27.680 --> 31:33.260
It could be like the utility of file sharing and collaboration that now different vendors

31:33.260 --> 31:37.320
could provide and you as a user could move between, it sounds like, with pretty...

31:37.320 --> 31:38.320
Yeah.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.320
So vendor lock-in, right?

31:39.320 --> 31:40.320
Yeah.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.320
We just kind of kill vendor lock-in with this stuff.

31:41.320 --> 31:42.320
Exactly.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.320
Yeah.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.320
Provider lock-in.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.320
Yeah.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.320
That's really interesting.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.320
Well...

31:47.320 --> 31:48.320
Yeah, yeah.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.320
This is really quite awesome.

31:49.320 --> 31:50.320
Another thing that I don't want to...

31:50.320 --> 31:54.280
Yeah, I want to make sure we don't miss it, is the audio and video calls, right?

31:54.280 --> 32:00.520
We introduced this as kind of a tech preview in 11, and in 12, it's becoming really solid.

32:00.520 --> 32:05.040
We use it now internally for our company calls every week, and it's working really, really

32:05.040 --> 32:06.800
well.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.360
And you can now share your screen, so screen sharing is built in.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.880
That's kind of the one big feature.

32:12.880 --> 32:17.360
But there's one other feature that we're working on, which is already part of the server side,

32:17.360 --> 32:20.200
but it's not yet published in the client, it's coming.

32:20.200 --> 32:23.160
This is push notifications.

32:23.160 --> 32:29.280
So on your cloud, you can call somebody, and then they'll actually get that call on their

32:29.280 --> 32:35.160
phone real time as a push notification, so you can actually really use it to replace

32:35.160 --> 32:39.080
WhatsApp or Signal or whatever you're using to call people, right?

32:39.080 --> 32:41.840
It's peer-to-peer, private, yeah, that's all there.

32:41.840 --> 32:45.880
So we're working on integrating that in the clients.

32:45.880 --> 32:51.880
And one of the things that we want to do in time is also to federate these calls.

32:51.880 --> 32:56.040
So you have one server, and you can call a user on another server.

32:56.040 --> 33:00.240
Combine it with a lookup server, and suddenly you have a completely decentralized audio-video

33:00.240 --> 33:03.640
call system from Nextcloud servers all over the world.

33:03.640 --> 33:09.120
So we've gone from documents and simple files all the way to a full, crazy, enterprise-ready

33:09.120 --> 33:10.120
VoIP system.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.120
This is a wild ride.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.120
Yeah, and screen sharing, too.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.120
That's pretty cool.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.240
Yeah, the cool thing is people ask for this, right?

33:15.240 --> 33:23.120
I mean, in 2005, 2010, you know, you would share files and have them on multiple servers

33:23.120 --> 33:26.480
or multiple devices, you know, your phone, your desktop.

33:26.480 --> 33:27.480
That was awesome.

33:27.480 --> 33:33.760
But, you know, if you receive a file from someone, it's shared by them, what's missing

33:33.760 --> 33:34.760
is context.

33:34.760 --> 33:38.840
You know, normally you would have sent an email and you would say, hey, I need you to

33:38.840 --> 33:39.840
review this.

33:39.840 --> 33:46.560
But if you share it via Dropbox or Nextcloud, you miss context, so we added commands.

33:46.560 --> 33:51.000
But then, you know, you see in a command that somebody says, well, this file, this is completely

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
stupid.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.880
And then you want to call, right?

33:53.880 --> 33:56.600
You don't want to have a whole yelling session in the chat.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.120
That doesn't work.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.960
So we need to be able to call.

33:59.960 --> 34:04.520
And then, you know, you say, okay, let's just make this document right together.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.600
You want to have a collaborative editing solution.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.360
We got that, too.

34:08.360 --> 34:12.760
So this is kind of a natural progression that you start to need all these pieces coming

34:12.760 --> 34:13.760
together.

34:13.760 --> 34:14.760
Yeah.

34:14.760 --> 34:19.520
Yeah, and you can see some of the areas that we're using other tools, maybe commercial

34:19.520 --> 34:25.480
tools at that, that are getting really popular right now that can do some of this stuff.

34:25.480 --> 34:29.800
But there's not a big gap where if you just add a few more of these things to Nextcloud,

34:29.800 --> 34:33.280
it can do all of the stuff those can do and a lot more.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.280
And it's much, much, much more under user's control.

34:36.280 --> 34:38.920
You could obviously take advantage of the fact that it's open source.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.600
I mean, it's all the stuff with monitoring and the management options.

34:41.600 --> 34:42.600
Yeah.

34:42.600 --> 34:43.600
With the recent features, too.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.600
Yeah.

34:44.600 --> 34:45.600
I mean, what really, really exciting stuff.

34:45.600 --> 34:46.600
Yes.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.600
Thank you for coming on the show.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.440
And hey, my pleasure, guys.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.960
It's always nice to present what we're doing to you guys.

34:51.960 --> 34:53.240
I mean, it's exciting stuff.

34:53.240 --> 34:58.360
And I'm always glad that you guys see it for what it's worth and like it.

34:58.360 --> 35:03.440
So I got to tell you, too, it's obvious you guys are hustling over there, too.

35:03.440 --> 35:08.640
So really, a lot of respect, too, for how hard you guys are working.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.720
If I'm picking up just even half of what you're putting down, it seems like you guys have

35:11.720 --> 35:16.200
got a real vision on something you can go after and something that you're actually already

35:16.200 --> 35:17.200
executing on.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.200
Yeah.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.520
I mean, they started seven years, seven and a half years ago.

35:21.520 --> 35:25.320
And on one hand, it's the same vision, and on the other hand, it has evolved since then.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.320
Right?

35:26.320 --> 35:28.920
I mean, it started just to give people a way to control their data.

35:28.920 --> 35:35.720
Well, OK, now we add collaboration and communication to it, but it's still the key is the same.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.480
And the approach is the same, right?

35:37.480 --> 35:45.080
Super easy to use, super like try to make it reliable first before you add the whole

35:45.080 --> 35:46.080
kitchen sink to it.

35:46.080 --> 35:50.600
I mean, these things have always been what we did, and then we keep doing that.

35:50.600 --> 35:51.600
And it's working.

35:51.600 --> 35:52.600
People love it.

35:52.600 --> 35:58.520
It is essentially a visioning of how this technology could be used if it worked out

35:58.520 --> 36:00.120
the way we all wanted it to work out.

36:00.120 --> 36:04.600
Instead of having these things locked off with vendor lock-in and cloud lock-in, it's

36:04.600 --> 36:05.600
the opposite of that.

36:05.600 --> 36:09.640
It's the ideal version of how we could have done this, and it's really nice to see.

36:09.640 --> 36:14.000
Not only, by the way, is all this technical stuff impressive, but the UI is looking great,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.480
performance is looking great, security is getting better all the time, too.

36:16.480 --> 36:18.520
So it's really kind of just firing on all cylinders.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.360
And guys, check out all of the info about the new release.

36:21.360 --> 36:25.160
We have it all in the show notes, Nextcloud 12.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.840
There's links to blog posts and all of that stuff.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.480
Yos, is there anything else you want to toss in before we roll?

36:30.480 --> 36:35.520
Yeah, somebody on the chat is just pointing out that I should really say something, not

36:35.520 --> 36:38.480
an incur image I just shared.

36:38.480 --> 36:46.040
So one big annoyance of a lot of sys admins that would upgrade Nextcloud and before, obviously,

36:46.040 --> 36:49.400
is that you have to re-enable the apps always.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.760
We fixed it.

36:50.760 --> 36:56.320
So if you have PHP 7 and you upgrade your Nextcloud, you don't need to re-enable apps.

36:56.320 --> 36:59.760
Nextcloud will automatically check if they are compatible.

36:59.760 --> 37:04.240
If not, it will try to update them from the app store, and after that, re-enable them

37:04.240 --> 37:05.240
again.

37:05.240 --> 37:06.240
Hallelujah.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.240
Brilliant.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.240
Very nice.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.240
That's great.

37:09.240 --> 37:10.240
Yeah.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.240
That's those little things that make a big difference.

37:11.240 --> 37:16.360
On the other hand, the fact that this was kind of one of the major issues that people

37:16.360 --> 37:19.920
still had with Nextcloud does tell you how far we've come.

37:19.920 --> 37:20.920
That's true.

37:20.920 --> 37:21.920
It's a good problem.

37:21.920 --> 37:22.920
If that's your problem, it's a good one to have.

37:22.920 --> 37:23.920
All right, thank you.

37:23.920 --> 37:24.920
Thank you, Yos.

37:24.920 --> 37:25.920
Thank you very, very much.

37:25.920 --> 37:26.920
Thank you for having me.

37:26.920 --> 37:27.920
Bye, guys.

37:27.920 --> 37:28.920
Have a good show.

37:28.920 --> 37:29.920
Thank you, sir.

37:29.920 --> 37:32.520
We're going to talk a little bit about the magic device tool here in just a moment, and

37:32.520 --> 37:34.920
I couldn't think of a better time to mention Ting.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.540
Two things that would go great together, like peanut butter and jelly, or peanut butter

37:38.540 --> 37:39.680
and chocolate.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.280
Ting is a smarter way to do mobile.

37:42.280 --> 37:46.500
It's how we'd have to do mobile today if we just all of a sudden had mobile service.

37:46.500 --> 37:49.920
If everything was equal and the carriers had to compete fairly.

37:49.920 --> 37:50.920
You're dreaming.

37:50.920 --> 37:51.920
I know.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.200
But this is how it would work.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.400
It would be $6 for your line.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.340
You just pay for your line, and then it would just be your usage.

37:58.340 --> 37:59.340
Just whatever you use.

37:59.340 --> 38:01.440
That's how the market would work.

38:01.440 --> 38:06.320
There'd be no contracts or agreements, no early termination fees.

38:06.320 --> 38:11.400
You just buy the device, you choose if you want CDMA or GSM, and you'd pay for what you

38:11.400 --> 38:12.400
use.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.400
That's Ting.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.400
That's how Ting does it.

38:14.400 --> 38:15.400
It's a smarter way to do mobile.

38:15.400 --> 38:19.100
One of the things I love about it is there are months where I am antisocial, and I really

38:19.100 --> 38:20.480
do not pay much.

38:20.480 --> 38:24.480
There's some months, maybe like Linux Fest Northwest month.

38:24.480 --> 38:31.040
I might have a $45 bill that month, and then the month after that, because I am so done

38:31.040 --> 38:33.920
talking to people, I might have a $20 bill.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.060
It's really nice.

38:35.060 --> 38:39.460
At the end of the year, I end up saving like $2,000 compared to my other service plans

38:39.460 --> 38:41.000
I had before I switched.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
It's incredible.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.520
Linux.ting.com is where you go to save $25 off a device, or if you have a device that

38:46.520 --> 38:50.120
works with Ting, $25 in service credit.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.120
What?

38:51.120 --> 38:56.600
The average bill is just $23 per line, so if you get $25 in service credit, it's going

38:56.600 --> 38:59.160
to pay for more than your first month of service.

38:59.160 --> 39:03.080
That's crazy, because not only do they have nationwide coverage, no contracts, it's paid

39:03.080 --> 39:07.680
for what you use, and they have a great dashboard, but they also have fantastic customer service

39:07.680 --> 39:09.180
and a great range of devices.

39:09.180 --> 39:13.180
From ones you can bring yourself, pick up from the Play Store, or buy, they even will

39:13.180 --> 39:16.680
help you find one if you contact their customer service.

39:16.680 --> 39:22.640
I got to say, probably the best ever customer service experience I've ever had was when

39:22.640 --> 39:23.640
I've called Ting.

39:23.640 --> 39:27.480
They also have a little giveaway going on right now.

39:27.480 --> 39:32.840
If you describe your home screen in a haiku, the home screen of your phone, they're doing

39:32.840 --> 39:33.840
a giveaway.

39:33.840 --> 39:38.240
Ting credit, maybe a Moto G5, things like that, you can find out details at the Ting

39:38.240 --> 39:39.240
blog.

39:39.240 --> 39:40.240
Just do me a favor.

39:40.240 --> 39:43.680
First, go to linux.ting.com, and then head out from there.

39:43.680 --> 39:44.680
Check it out.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.680
See how much you might save.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.360
That's such a better way to do mobile.

39:48.360 --> 39:53.600
It's really, really, really fantastic for $6 a month to have a couple of GSM or CDMA

39:53.600 --> 39:56.200
lines that you can activate devices for testing.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.060
It's a great way to test devices.

39:58.060 --> 40:02.840
It's a handy way to keep something connected, like say a tablet that you use with your drone

40:02.840 --> 40:03.840
or something like that.

40:03.840 --> 40:04.840
I just love it.

40:04.840 --> 40:07.040
It's so handy, all the different ways.

40:07.040 --> 40:12.560
Linux.ting.com, and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

40:12.560 --> 40:18.320
Now, Marius joins us from way over across the world, where he is way, way... Let me

40:18.320 --> 40:19.320
look.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.360
I thought I had the clock up here, but I think it's like 11 o'clock, 11 PM.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.360
Yikes.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.360
Thanks for staying up.

40:23.360 --> 40:24.360
Yeah.

40:24.360 --> 40:25.360
Yeah.

40:25.360 --> 40:26.360
Marius, welcome.

40:26.360 --> 40:27.360
Is it Marius?

40:27.360 --> 40:28.360
Am I saying your name right?

40:28.360 --> 40:29.360
Make sure I don't mess it up too long.

40:29.360 --> 40:30.360
You can say Marius or Marius.

40:30.360 --> 40:31.360
That's fine.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.360
Thank you for having me.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.360
All right.

40:33.360 --> 40:34.360
All right.

40:34.360 --> 40:35.360
I'm sure they couldn't make it last week.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.360
No problem.

40:36.360 --> 40:37.360
No problem.

40:37.360 --> 40:40.640
It gave me a chance to mess around with Magic Device Tool, which I was pleasantly surprised

40:40.640 --> 40:46.480
to see that all of the dependencies are in the AUR, and it's also a very easy snap to

40:46.480 --> 40:47.480
install.

40:47.480 --> 40:51.800
And if you have Ubuntu, it's just a couple of app commands away to get all the essential

40:51.800 --> 40:57.080
files and dependencies you need to be able to flash any of the more recent BQ Aquarius

40:57.080 --> 41:03.280
devices we've talked about, like the E5 or the M10, the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 7 2013,

41:03.280 --> 41:07.880
Samsung Nexus 10, the OnePlus One, the Fairphone 2, any of these devices.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.000
Of course, I have the Nexus 5.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.080
You have made a tool that essentially makes these devices relevant again.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.680
I mean, it really does.

41:16.680 --> 41:20.560
And I just I wanted to bring you on just for a little bit to talk about how the hell are

41:20.560 --> 41:23.760
you doing this and how can we help you do it more?

41:23.760 --> 41:25.240
So let's start with the first one.

41:25.240 --> 41:26.560
How are you doing this Blackmagic?

41:26.560 --> 41:33.140
How are you hacking my phone and replacing the very secure and safe image on there with

41:33.140 --> 41:38.000
Cyanogen or Lineage or Maroo or even that there Ubuntu Touch?

41:38.000 --> 41:40.840
What Blackmagic are you using, sir?

41:40.840 --> 41:44.800
So I have to tell you a bit of a story back then from the history of Magic Device Tool.

41:44.800 --> 41:50.600
When we started it back in or when I started it back in July 2016, I had like all of this,

41:50.600 --> 41:54.820
all of the Ubuntu Touch devices that were out there back in the time.

41:54.820 --> 41:57.720
And yeah, I wanted to make it easy to flash Ubuntu on it.

41:57.720 --> 42:02.960
And but I also was one of the guys who got really annoyed by Ubuntu after a short time

42:02.960 --> 42:08.680
and wanted to get back on the Synergy Mod or on Lineage, no Lineage came later, but still.

42:08.680 --> 42:13.840
And yeah, I was tired of doing all the fastboot and ADB commands and I was like, okay, you're

42:13.840 --> 42:17.840
going to write a script which is going to do all of this automatically.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.760
And then I added a few other devices and then it kind of exploded.

42:20.760 --> 42:25.160
And now I'm sitting here with, let me count, I think over 10 devices sitting on my desk

42:25.160 --> 42:26.160
at the moment.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.160
All of them are charging.

42:27.160 --> 42:32.320
And I basically after every new release of whatever ROM I have to check if the update

42:32.320 --> 42:35.440
is still working and if it's still compatible with magic device to it.

42:35.440 --> 42:36.800
So it's a constant process.

42:36.800 --> 42:40.600
So I imagine you probably have a few micro USB cables around your house.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.600
Yeah, I would say too many.

42:43.600 --> 42:46.720
Well, it's pretty cool tool.

42:46.720 --> 42:54.520
And I kind of wanted to pick your brain a little bit about how people are using it today.

42:54.520 --> 42:59.760
Because it seems to me that I found out about it because I was reading a thread on Lineage

42:59.760 --> 43:00.760
OS.

43:00.760 --> 43:05.720
I had heard of it obviously before, but it came back up on my radar when I was reading

43:05.720 --> 43:07.240
a thread about Lineage OS.

43:07.240 --> 43:11.040
Seems to me there's a lot of folks that want to use this to flash Lineage OS on their device.

43:11.040 --> 43:16.680
So how is it being used today versus how it was originally envisioned?

43:16.680 --> 43:20.360
Well back when we started it, it was obviously mostly used for flashing Ubuntu on it or

43:20.360 --> 43:22.640
making backups or some of the other functions.

43:22.640 --> 43:29.600
But yeah, thanks to the recent news by Canonical, many of the former Ubuntu people now got back

43:29.600 --> 43:34.600
on the telegram chat and started asking questions about how they could get back on to Lineage

43:34.600 --> 43:36.600
or to AOSP.

43:36.600 --> 43:42.920
And yeah, unfortunately I can't really track how many of the watch functions are mostly

43:42.920 --> 43:43.920
get used.

43:43.920 --> 43:46.320
I can only see the current download numbers from the snap.

43:46.320 --> 43:50.440
But I think it's mostly Lineage OS in the last few months.

43:50.440 --> 43:54.720
So you know, what are the things that I would say if I had my critical hat on is I would

43:54.720 --> 43:58.880
say things like there's only a very small fraction of the user base that's ever going

43:58.880 --> 44:04.560
to want to install Lineage OS or Maru, which also looks very cool, or Ubuntu Touch.

44:04.560 --> 44:08.320
This is just something that only nerds want to do.

44:08.320 --> 44:11.320
Marius, what are your thoughts on that?

44:11.320 --> 44:15.400
And what are your thoughts on sort of working on something that's sort of on the fringe

44:15.400 --> 44:16.400
like this?

44:16.400 --> 44:20.760
Do you think it's an uphill battle or do you find a purpose in it?

44:20.760 --> 44:26.760
Well, it basically makes my life much easier because sometimes I'm just switching devices

44:26.760 --> 44:31.800
because thanks to the Ubuntu Project I have so many things on my desk and sometime or

44:31.800 --> 44:35.840
someday I just pick up the Nexus 4 or the Nexus 7 and decide that that's going to be

44:35.840 --> 44:37.960
my daily phone or tablet for that week.

44:37.960 --> 44:40.240
Yeah, it's still usable and relevant.

44:40.240 --> 44:41.920
It absolutely is, yeah.

44:41.920 --> 44:47.600
And we've also recently added other ROMs to it like Maru OS and what's it called, Phoenix

44:47.600 --> 44:51.760
OS, which is a bit like Remix OS but for more devices.

44:51.760 --> 44:58.720
And yeah, it's basically just, well, if other people wouldn't say that they're using it

44:58.720 --> 45:03.000
and we just recently passed 10,000 downloads from the Snap Store from Edge Device to it

45:03.000 --> 45:08.640
so people are clearly using it, I also would have just bought it for myself, which is basically

45:08.640 --> 45:09.640
how it started.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.800
Yeah, that's totally understandable.

45:11.800 --> 45:17.380
So I really found it valuable because I'm like, I have this Nexus 5 here.

45:17.380 --> 45:20.120
My kids would love to have another device to play around on.

45:20.120 --> 45:25.200
Why not flash it with Lineage or Maru or just play around with Sailfish again?

45:25.200 --> 45:29.400
Make the device totally relevant again and make it usable and the performance is surprisingly

45:29.400 --> 45:30.400
good.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.400
It's totally usable.

45:31.400 --> 45:34.520
And a lot of these devices you have otherwise, I mean, my mom has a Nexus 5.

45:34.520 --> 45:39.480
She bought it six months ago so it was otherwise brand new still and it works fine for her

45:39.480 --> 45:42.760
but I want her to have some, I might even want to customize it more.

45:42.760 --> 45:48.480
I think also, like you were talking about, sure, there's some niche aspect to this but

45:48.480 --> 45:52.680
this tool really bridges the gap for like, if you were even considering trying it, suddenly

45:52.680 --> 45:54.780
you have to become like kind of an Android expert.

45:54.780 --> 45:56.280
Not so if you have something like this.

45:56.280 --> 45:57.280
That's why I really liked it.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.280
Yeah, it really didn't exist before.

45:58.280 --> 46:02.840
I had no interest in like all the other stuff you'd have to learn but just to try it really

46:02.840 --> 46:06.760
quick on an old Nexus 5 I had sitting around, it was the perfect level of resistance.

46:06.760 --> 46:10.320
It was okay, I could manage to make this work, especially because all the stuff I needed

46:10.320 --> 46:11.320
was in the AUR too.

46:11.320 --> 46:12.320
Yes.

46:12.320 --> 46:13.320
It made it pretty nice.

46:13.320 --> 46:15.480
Marius, can we talk a little bit about the Snap process?

46:15.480 --> 46:18.320
Is that something you were involved in and what's your impression been so far?

46:18.320 --> 46:25.200
Well, I think we've moved, to have to start with, the magic device tool was a few months

46:25.200 --> 46:31.360
before still adjust a batch script which we had to start manually and then I think it

46:31.360 --> 46:37.400
was like four months ago, Canonical started promoting the Snapcraft tool.

46:37.400 --> 46:41.000
So basically just this little one command line tool which makes it easy to create your

46:41.000 --> 46:46.200
snaps and to upload them to the store and I was thinking with it for I think one evening

46:46.200 --> 46:51.920
and the end result that I got was almost perfectly working and then we refined it and so it's

46:51.920 --> 46:52.920
very easy.

46:52.920 --> 46:56.040
Every change that we are pushing to the Git repository gets automatically picked up by

46:56.040 --> 46:59.160
the Launchpad servers which are then going to build the Snap and then re-uploading them

46:59.160 --> 47:03.000
to the store so I basically just have to commit to the Git repository and then everything

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
gets done automatically.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.480
It all just happens after that.

47:05.480 --> 47:11.440
That is the way of the future, I swear, that's so great.

47:11.440 --> 47:20.720
If I could just interject, what Marius is using, if you go to build.snapcraft.io, you

47:20.720 --> 47:28.560
can connect your GitHub repository to our build farm which in turn is connected to the

47:28.560 --> 47:29.560
store.

47:29.560 --> 47:36.000
So every time there's a commit in GitHub, the Snap is built on all of the architectures

47:36.000 --> 47:41.080
in the build farm, so that's all of the ARM architectures and all of the Intel architectures

47:41.080 --> 47:45.440
and some of the more exotic ones if you choose them and then gets published into the Edge

47:45.440 --> 47:53.080
channel in the store and this is how Rekai hooked up Castor Soundboard to the Snap store.

47:53.080 --> 47:54.080
That is great.

47:54.080 --> 47:57.880
So Castor Soundboard is going to be a Snap.

47:57.880 --> 47:58.880
That's good.

47:58.880 --> 47:59.880
Beautiful.

47:59.880 --> 48:00.880
That is really cool.

48:00.880 --> 48:05.160
And you mentioned earlier, I was listening, you said AIF doesn't play when you were doing

48:05.160 --> 48:08.280
things and you had to convert it in Sound Converter.

48:08.280 --> 48:14.720
So I've updated the Snap to add the necessary codecs so AIF works in the Snap.

48:14.720 --> 48:15.720
True gentleman.

48:15.720 --> 48:16.720
A true gentleman.

48:16.720 --> 48:17.720
This is pretty great.

48:17.720 --> 48:21.600
I love seeing this stuff come together as these Snap packages.

48:21.600 --> 48:25.000
There was another, oh yeah, Visual Studio Code was announced this week as a Snap package.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
That's right.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Yes, it was.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
So that's this.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.460
It's a pretty interesting range from a very high-end GUI application to a command line

48:32.460 --> 48:38.320
tool that will flash a smartphone to a Visual Studio Code editing tool.

48:38.320 --> 48:41.480
Wow, that's a big range.

48:41.480 --> 48:42.880
So Mariusz, where do you go next?

48:42.880 --> 48:48.520
I know one of the top questions people always ask is, what do I got to do to get this XYZ

48:48.520 --> 48:49.520
hardware supported?

48:49.520 --> 48:50.520
Exactly.

48:50.520 --> 48:53.040
So where do you guys go next in terms of the project and in terms of hardware support?

48:53.040 --> 48:57.600
Well, as I said, most of the emails that I'm getting like 10 or 15 emails per day which

48:57.600 --> 49:04.800
is like, please support device X and I have to reply, no, it's not meting the requirements

49:04.800 --> 49:07.280
of our guidelines that we have set up.

49:07.280 --> 49:10.960
But still, what we are going to do next is, I definitely have to mention this because

49:10.960 --> 49:14.600
Max was also listening to this live, was just messaging me.

49:14.600 --> 49:18.540
He basically rewrote the whole tool and he's a friend of mine, he's working on a community

49:18.540 --> 49:23.200
project that I'm involved with and he basically completely rewrote the magic device tool and

49:23.200 --> 49:29.840
the new release that will come out I hope next month will feature a completely QT GUI

49:29.840 --> 49:33.880
so it will no longer be, well, it can still be a command line tool but it will also come

49:33.880 --> 49:39.840
with a GUI soon and we will maybe refine the process of how to add new devices and make

49:39.840 --> 49:44.660
it a bit more modular so that other people can contribute to it which is already happening

49:44.660 --> 49:47.360
but I think we can do better on that front.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.480
Yeah, it seems like there's more interest now than ever.

49:50.480 --> 49:51.480
Yeah, absolutely.

49:51.480 --> 49:55.760
There you go, and if you guys want to check it out, we have links in the show notes.

49:55.760 --> 49:59.040
If you just Google magic device tool though, it's like the first thing that comes up.

49:59.040 --> 50:00.360
Oh, Wimpy, you wanted to jump in.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.600
Maybe let me plug one thing real quick.

50:02.600 --> 50:07.080
We also have got a Telegram group which is basically an update and support channel and

50:07.080 --> 50:10.480
where you can ask questions and it's magicdevice tool.com slash Telegram.

50:10.480 --> 50:11.480
Oh, easy peasy.

50:11.480 --> 50:12.480
So easy.

50:12.480 --> 50:13.480
Yeah.

50:13.480 --> 50:15.920
Yeah, magicdevice tool.com slash Telegram.

50:15.920 --> 50:16.920
Exactly.

50:16.920 --> 50:19.880
Now, Wimpy, you wanted to jump in on something, go ahead.

50:19.880 --> 50:23.680
I was just looking at the store statistics and I was bowled over.

50:23.680 --> 50:26.480
Do you realize how many installs you've had, Mariusz?

50:26.480 --> 50:27.480
I know.

50:27.480 --> 50:29.280
We've recently passed 10,000 downloads.

50:29.280 --> 50:31.360
Yeah, over 10,000 snap installs.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.360
That's awesome.

50:32.360 --> 50:33.360
I'm one of them.

50:33.360 --> 50:36.320
I have no idea who these people are but I'm glad to have found that the thing that I produce

50:36.320 --> 50:37.320
is useful.

50:37.320 --> 50:40.640
Well, you know, I really think it's just about anybody who's not on Ubuntu that wants magic

50:40.640 --> 50:41.640
device tool.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.360
That could be, yeah.

50:43.360 --> 50:47.480
I think that's really what it is because the first thing I thought of was, well, I could

50:47.480 --> 50:51.640
try getting these, I could try these things in the AUR or I'll just go grab the snap.

50:51.640 --> 50:52.760
And that's what I did.

50:52.760 --> 50:54.880
So I would imagine there's probably a lot of other people there too.

50:54.880 --> 50:55.880
It's super handy.

50:55.880 --> 50:56.880
It really is.

50:56.880 --> 50:57.880
Yeah.

50:57.880 --> 50:58.880
I love it.

50:58.880 --> 51:02.280
Maybe let me add real quick to the point that Wimpy had before.

51:02.280 --> 51:06.760
I'm definitely, I wouldn't consider myself to be a coder or a developer at all.

51:06.760 --> 51:11.200
But still, with the batch scripts and the SnapCraft things that I did behind the scenes

51:11.200 --> 51:16.600
and with the SnapCraft Builders tool that is also up on Git, it was really, really easy

51:16.600 --> 51:21.360
for me to snap it in just one evening or two to make it completely run in like two days.

51:21.360 --> 51:24.840
And definitely for the non-developer kind of you, it's really awesome.

51:24.840 --> 51:25.840
Awesome.

51:25.840 --> 51:26.840
That's a great field report.

51:26.840 --> 51:27.840
Yeah, that is.

51:27.840 --> 51:28.840
Thank you.

51:28.840 --> 51:29.840
Thank you, Mariusz.

51:29.840 --> 51:30.840
Thank you very much.

51:30.840 --> 51:31.840
Mariusz, I was curious, what's your daily driver?

51:31.840 --> 51:32.840
Is it a Linux desktop?

51:32.840 --> 51:33.840
Is it Unity?

51:33.840 --> 51:35.760
Is it an Ubuntu system?

51:35.760 --> 51:36.760
I'm still on Unity.

51:36.760 --> 51:37.760
Yeah.

51:37.760 --> 51:38.760
I'm currently using 16.04.

51:38.760 --> 51:40.600
Hashtag no judgment here.

51:40.600 --> 51:42.280
This is a no judgment zone.

51:42.280 --> 51:43.280
You're welcome to use...

51:43.280 --> 51:44.280
At least today.

51:44.280 --> 51:45.280
Yeah.

51:45.280 --> 51:48.760
I wouldn't call him out, but Terz in the chat room is totally using Windows right now and

51:48.760 --> 51:50.080
it's no judgment zone.

51:50.080 --> 51:51.200
You're using Unity.

51:51.200 --> 51:52.200
Wes over here is using...

51:52.200 --> 51:53.200
What are you using?

51:53.200 --> 51:54.200
Budgie?

51:54.200 --> 51:55.200
I forgot what you're using.

51:55.200 --> 51:56.640
It was Budgie for a while right now.

51:56.640 --> 51:57.640
It's Gnome.

51:57.640 --> 51:58.640
Oh, yeah.

51:58.640 --> 51:59.640
Okay.

51:59.640 --> 52:00.640
That's what I'm on too.

52:00.640 --> 52:01.640
I'm on Gnome.

52:01.640 --> 52:04.200
I'm on Gnome and I have some thoughts on that, but I want to let Minimac jump in with Mariusz

52:04.200 --> 52:05.200
before we move on.

52:05.200 --> 52:06.200
Minimac, go ahead.

52:06.200 --> 52:07.200
Yeah, Mariusz.

52:07.200 --> 52:11.640
And do you touch the partitions of the phone when you're flashing the images?

52:11.640 --> 52:16.000
Do you change the partition tables or does it always stay the same?

52:16.000 --> 52:20.960
Well, I'm technically not changing the partition tables or the formats itself, but sometimes

52:20.960 --> 52:21.960
I have to...

52:21.960 --> 52:25.380
If I have to flash, for example, Sailfish on it, then I have to preformat the system

52:25.380 --> 52:28.440
image, but I'm not changing anything about the partition layouts.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.640
I'm just formatting the partition itself.

52:30.640 --> 52:31.640
Okay.

52:31.640 --> 52:32.640
Thanks.

52:32.640 --> 52:33.640
So it'll stay the same.

52:33.640 --> 52:34.640
You're welcome.

52:34.640 --> 52:35.640
Yeah, that's a great question, Minimac.

52:35.640 --> 52:36.640
Thank you for asking it.

52:36.640 --> 52:37.640
All right.

52:37.640 --> 52:39.340
Well, so Mariusz, keep up the fantastic work.

52:39.340 --> 52:44.020
Thank you for staying up late, and if there's other developments down the road that happened

52:44.020 --> 52:47.960
that you want to share with the class, you are welcome to join our virtual Lug on a Tuesday

52:47.960 --> 52:49.880
and share with us.

52:49.880 --> 52:52.120
Or if you just can't sleep that night, we'll be here.

52:52.120 --> 52:53.120
We'll keep a chair out for you.

52:53.120 --> 52:54.120
Thanks for having me, guys.

52:54.120 --> 52:55.120
All right.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.120
Very good.

52:56.120 --> 52:58.080
So I do want to talk a little bit about Gnome.

52:58.080 --> 52:59.080
Not a lot.

52:59.080 --> 53:00.080
I know.

53:00.080 --> 53:01.080
I won't...

53:01.080 --> 53:02.080
You know what?

53:02.080 --> 53:03.080
I know.

53:03.080 --> 53:04.080
Just a hint.

53:04.080 --> 53:05.080
I'm just warning you.

53:05.080 --> 53:06.080
I'm just warning you.

53:06.080 --> 53:07.080
I know not all of you are big Gnome fans, so first, let's talk about DigitalOcean.

53:07.080 --> 53:08.260
Then if you don't want to talk about Gnome, you can leave.

53:08.260 --> 53:10.520
But first, let me tell you about DigitalOcean, because I know that's really what you tuned

53:10.520 --> 53:11.520
in for.

53:11.520 --> 53:12.520
It's what I tuned in for.

53:12.520 --> 53:15.520
DigitalOcean is my go-to platform now for when I need infrastructure.

53:15.520 --> 53:20.040
Essentially, if I need a Linux rig and it doesn't need a screen hooked up directly to

53:20.040 --> 53:23.160
it all the time, I'm pretty much just default DigitalOcean.

53:23.160 --> 53:24.160
I'm default DO.

53:24.160 --> 53:25.160
Oh!

53:25.160 --> 53:26.160
Default DO.

53:26.160 --> 53:27.160
DigitalOcean.com.

53:27.160 --> 53:28.160
Go there.

53:28.160 --> 53:29.160
Create an account.

53:29.160 --> 53:30.160
So sign up.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.160
I know I'm asking a lot, but trust me.

53:31.160 --> 53:32.160
You're going to use it.

53:32.160 --> 53:35.100
Create an account, and then apply our promo code.

53:35.100 --> 53:38.320
It's like taking gasoline and putting it on top of your barbecue.

53:38.320 --> 53:40.040
It makes everything taste better.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.120
DO Unplugged.

53:41.120 --> 53:44.400
One word, lowercase, and then it makes that fire go like crazy.

53:44.400 --> 53:46.600
Plus, it's like a barbecue in the cloud.

53:46.600 --> 53:47.600
Yeah.

53:47.600 --> 53:48.600
Yeah.

53:48.600 --> 53:49.600
Oh, shoot.

53:49.600 --> 53:50.600
We've got to talk about our barbecue coming up.

53:50.600 --> 53:51.600
Yeah, that's true.

53:51.600 --> 53:52.600
I forgot about that, too.

53:52.600 --> 53:53.600
It's not in the cloud.

53:53.600 --> 53:54.600
Go back to it.

53:54.600 --> 53:56.360
No, but first, before we get talking about barbecue, let's talk about cooking in the

53:56.360 --> 53:57.360
cloud.

53:57.360 --> 53:58.360
DigitalOcean.com.

53:58.360 --> 54:03.160
Use the promo code DO Unplugged, SSDs throughout so you get really fast disk I.O., 40 gigabit

54:03.160 --> 54:06.440
e-connections to the hypervisor so your network performance is great.

54:06.440 --> 54:10.160
Linux is the host operating system, KVM for the virtualizer.

54:10.160 --> 54:17.080
You can do huge rigs, super, super high-end rigs, crazy, crazy, monstrous, monstrous high-end

54:17.080 --> 54:22.600
rigs, rigs that would make 64 kilobytes of RAM Bill Gates' mind explode with the insanity

54:22.600 --> 54:24.000
in their size.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.720
And they also have a CDN system built in, monitoring.

54:27.720 --> 54:29.560
They have been integrating more and more features.

54:29.560 --> 54:34.880
My favorite one is block storage, and then, like the cherry on top, they have the best

54:34.880 --> 54:36.680
damn documentation on the web.

54:36.680 --> 54:40.840
Check it out at DigitalOcean.com, create an account, use our promo code DO Unplugged,

54:40.840 --> 54:46.840
get deployed in seconds, enjoy that SSD performance, work with teams, have a little block storage

54:46.840 --> 54:52.200
when you need a little extra storage, and deploy a pre-built open source application.

54:52.200 --> 54:57.880
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DO Unplugged, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

54:57.880 --> 55:00.820
the shenanigans that is the Unplugged program.

55:00.820 --> 55:03.560
So Mr. West, we're almost at 200 episodes of the Unplugged program.

55:03.560 --> 55:04.560
That is crazy.

55:04.560 --> 55:06.920
And I've been trying to think of what we should do.

55:06.920 --> 55:07.920
What should we do?

55:07.920 --> 55:08.920
What should we do?

55:08.920 --> 55:09.920
Because I'd love to do something.

55:09.920 --> 55:13.160
And one thing that turned out, oh, now iQIYI shows up.

55:13.160 --> 55:14.160
Now iQIYI shows up.

55:14.160 --> 55:15.160
See how that...

55:15.160 --> 55:16.160
He heard us talking about him.

55:16.160 --> 55:17.160
Yeah, that's true.

55:17.160 --> 55:21.700
But I think there was some sort of transmission delay, because we were talking about his fantastic

55:21.700 --> 55:23.920
blog post a while ago.

55:23.920 --> 55:24.920
Anyways...

55:24.920 --> 55:25.920
The iQIYI signal, it's on the fritz.

55:25.920 --> 55:26.920
Come on.

55:26.920 --> 55:30.320
I think there was some fog or something that delayed it.

55:30.320 --> 55:35.840
So I don't know how long ago it was, but we did a barbecue, and Wes showed up.

55:35.840 --> 55:40.040
And basically, we made out during the bar... No, oh geez, that was somebody else.

55:40.040 --> 55:41.480
You weren't supposed to say it.

55:41.480 --> 55:42.480
I know.

55:42.480 --> 55:47.000
But anyways, Wes showed up for the barbecue, and things just went from there, and now here

55:47.000 --> 55:48.680
he is doing a show.

55:48.680 --> 55:50.280
And that was pretty fun.

55:50.280 --> 55:53.640
I don't think that's going to happen this time, but I still thought we could kind of

55:53.640 --> 55:57.320
have a tradition where, when the show has milestones, we have a community meetup.

55:57.320 --> 55:58.320
I love that idea.

55:58.320 --> 56:01.240
Like, you know, we have these extra chairs here in the studio.

56:01.240 --> 56:02.320
It's perfect now.

56:02.320 --> 56:05.120
So even if a couple of... Even if only a couple of people could make it, because it's

56:05.120 --> 56:08.640
the middle of the weekday, but even if only a couple of people could make it up here in

56:08.640 --> 56:12.360
Podunk Arlington, they could be sitting in these big, comfy, red chairs, and they could

56:12.360 --> 56:15.560
be part of our lug right here in the studio doing the show with us.

56:15.560 --> 56:18.820
That could be just a super awesome way to celebrate 200.

56:18.820 --> 56:21.200
But I feel like we need to give people a few weeks more heads up.

56:21.200 --> 56:22.520
Yeah, I think so too.

56:22.520 --> 56:27.780
So we were thinking it's possible around the 4th of July, because we will have an Unplugged

56:27.780 --> 56:30.880
program on the 4th of July.

56:30.880 --> 56:35.460
And I was planning to go to Montana for the 4th of July, but Noah ruins everything.

56:35.460 --> 56:36.460
That guy.

56:36.460 --> 56:37.460
Totally Noah's fault.

56:37.460 --> 56:40.000
So I think instead we could have a barbecue.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.240
That might be a lot of fun.

56:41.240 --> 56:46.840
It's going to be, well, it'll be a few weeks after our 200th episode, but it seems like

56:46.840 --> 56:47.840
a pretty good opportunity.

56:47.840 --> 56:51.320
Maybe that's more fair too, because what if 200, what if it goes terribly, or the internet

56:51.320 --> 56:52.320
dies?

56:52.320 --> 56:57.520
So it's better to have past 200, we've proved that we did it, and then we can all celebrate.

56:57.520 --> 56:59.760
Yeah, that would be probably the best.

56:59.760 --> 57:02.000
So that's sort of our tentative plan.

57:02.000 --> 57:06.480
So there you go, Ike, you got your heads up and I travel out here now.

57:06.480 --> 57:07.960
All the burgers you can eat.

57:07.960 --> 57:10.040
No, that's true, yeah.

57:10.040 --> 57:13.840
But if you do want to come out for our 200th birthday and celebrate on the 4th of July,

57:13.840 --> 57:17.760
which will be weeks and weeks after, because we're only like two weeks away, it's going

57:17.760 --> 57:21.720
to be literally a month after our 200th episode, but it'll be fun.

57:21.720 --> 57:26.480
It seems like because it could be a good chance people might have the day off from work, and

57:26.480 --> 57:30.280
it turns out my boss never lets me have the day off, so I'll be here, and might as well

57:30.280 --> 57:31.280
be cooking.

57:31.280 --> 57:32.280
Yeah, exactly.

57:32.280 --> 57:37.160
And we could fit a couple people in here, plus we have the TV in the living room hooked

57:37.160 --> 57:43.080
up, so you could watch from the living room, you could watch the show live, and so even

57:43.080 --> 57:45.880
if you couldn't make, even if you can't fit in the studio, we'd have room for you in the

57:45.880 --> 57:50.380
living room to watch the show, and you basically would get fed by us.

57:50.380 --> 57:51.380
Seems like a pretty good deal.

57:51.380 --> 57:52.380
It seems great.

57:52.380 --> 57:53.440
Seems like a pretty good deal.

57:53.440 --> 57:54.860
So we'll have more details.

57:54.860 --> 57:58.920
If you would be interested, contact me at ChrisLAS, and we're thinking on the 4th of

57:58.920 --> 58:03.440
July to celebrate the 200th episode of the Unplugged program.

58:03.440 --> 58:08.160
Yeah, my boss is a bozo.

58:08.160 --> 58:09.160
That's true.

58:09.160 --> 58:10.160
Yeah, he's a real jerk.

58:10.160 --> 58:11.760
He's a real jerk.

58:11.760 --> 58:16.080
So I wanted to discuss, just with anybody in the Mumble Room that maybe has a little

58:16.080 --> 58:20.560
experience, and I thought maybe I'd start with Wimpy, because I suspect maybe he's played

58:20.560 --> 58:24.920
around with this, maybe under Matei.

58:24.920 --> 58:27.960
I'm not really an expert on the plumbing of Gnome.

58:27.960 --> 58:34.240
My basic understanding is you have the Gnome shell, which then uses Mutter in the current

58:34.240 --> 58:40.340
configuration to do essentially the compositing, and Mutter talks to X.

58:40.340 --> 58:45.840
And in the Wayland setup, if I'm understanding this correctly, Mutter takes on more of the

58:45.840 --> 58:48.680
X server roles.

58:48.680 --> 58:52.800
It does the mouse tracking, all the stuff that the X server would traditionally do.

58:52.800 --> 58:57.080
And I don't know where these problems lie, but I've been recently having... I'm going

58:57.080 --> 58:59.720
to talk more about it on User Air, because I'm doing a deep dive right now.

58:59.720 --> 59:05.200
So tune into User Air this week, where I'm chasing bug reports, and I'm doing all this

59:05.200 --> 59:06.200
stuff.

59:06.200 --> 59:07.200
So I'll have a full report later.

59:07.200 --> 59:08.360
But I've been noticing.

59:08.360 --> 59:12.620
I wanted to just check in with the virtual log, and I wanted to check in with you, Wes.

59:12.620 --> 59:18.520
Is it just me, or if your system's been up for a couple of weeks, does Gnome 3 start

59:18.520 --> 59:21.600
to slow down to a crawl over time?

59:21.600 --> 59:23.040
Has anybody else noticed this?

59:23.040 --> 59:28.560
I have not, but I don't have any systems that are up that long that have a desktop that

59:28.560 --> 59:31.680
don't get rebooted or suspended.

59:31.680 --> 59:36.080
So I don't know if I have that exact use case.

59:36.080 --> 59:39.560
But I've seen it here happen at the studio, so I can definitely confirm that it's happening.

59:39.560 --> 59:40.560
Yeah.

59:40.560 --> 59:43.820
Actually, earlier in the show today, we just had Gnome 3 crash on us, and we had to stop

59:43.820 --> 59:46.800
recording and start again, because we weren't sure if we lost part of the recording.

59:46.800 --> 59:47.800
That's no good.

59:47.800 --> 59:50.560
We could lose audio on the stream while Gnome 3 crashed for some reason.

59:50.560 --> 59:53.680
Wimpy, have you played around at all with benchmarking Gnome or looked at the performance

59:53.680 --> 59:56.600
of this stuff?

59:56.600 --> 59:59.200
Not a great deal, no.

59:59.200 --> 01:00:06.840
I have done some work to integrate MUTTA with MATE to see how that works.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:15.680
And aside from key bindings not passing through, and what was the other?

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:22.120
The alt-tab and alt-grave implementation just doesn't work the same as you would expect.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.680
So it works, but I've not done any serious profiling.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:32.680
I am at the moment doing some power profiling on the different compositors to see what the

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:38.240
additional power draw is on the different compositors, but I have not concluded that

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.240
yet.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.240
OK.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.080
Yeah, that's a whole other aspect of it, too, is when you do have a system like this,

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:49.040
what kind of difference do the different compositors make on the CPU or GPU usage and the power

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.040
draw that they have?

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:55.520
That's a fascinating conversation, probably for a future show.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.960
This is something I'm wondering about because I did not notice this under Plasma.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.280
So just a little background for those of you who don't catch every episode is for weeks

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.840
and months, essentially since the last release of the Plasma desktop, I've been running the

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.080
Plasma desktop on my main workstation.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.960
This is a machine that I leave on 24-7.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.720
I've even recently started leaving the monitors on at lower brightness, so that way I can

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.800
literally just... I walk in the room, I sit down, I start working immediately, and...

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.600
The studio's always on.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.320
The Plasma desktop never ran into this issue, at least not that I noticed.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.040
I probably never made it more than two months without rebooting, because I usually just

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.260
decide, OK, it's time to get a new kernel.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:39.720
But I definitely am noticing it within a couple of weeks, really, even a week on GNOME, and

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.360
on all of the machines in the studio that we've switched over to Linux that are running

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.360
GNOME are exhibiting these symptoms.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.360
Really?

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.920
So it's something I'm trying to dig into.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.960
It's not just a one-off on one machine.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.920
I can't swap out mutter, right?

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:54.920
That's not something I can just... I can't just do that.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.320
I can't swap out mutter for kwin or something.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.320
Back in GNOME 2 days, you could do some crazy shit like that, but I don't think you can

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.320
do that with GNOME Shell.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:06.840
So anyways, if anybody has any more information on it, I would like your help, tweet me at

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:11.640
chrislas or check out the new subreddit, linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.040
Sounds like Ikey's got a take on it, too.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.680
I was reading his take in the chatroom, which is pretty interesting.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.080
And that's what some of the bug reports that I've been digging into have been saying, too,

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.080
Ikey.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.080
If you want to participate in our chatroom, we do this show live on Tuesdays at 2 p.m.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.920
over at jblive.tv.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.200
You can get it converted to your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendars.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.040
Like Marius there, he has to sit there and do the time math.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.600
We were chatting about it this morning.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.800
I got you, Marius says, I hate time zones, and I'm like, I totally know what you mean.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.800
We solved that already.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.320
We have these robots on standby at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.120
It will convert it to your local time.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.880
If you think you could make the 4th of July work, which I know is a little crazy, but

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.360
if you think you could make it work, let me know.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.640
I don't know for sure we're going to do it, but I think it's like a 90% lock.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:59.200
And if we got a few people saying they'd be down, I mean, you and I are going to be here

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.200
anyways.

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.200
Yeah, we will.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:04.040
We should probably, regardless if people show up or not, have that barbecue going on the

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040
4th of July.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:09.360
So I almost feel like it's all lined up perfectly, so we should just do it.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.360
I think it's a lock.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.360
I think I'm going to say it's a lock.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.960
Yeah, if we don't barbecue on the 4th of July, then what are we doing?

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:14.960
I know.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.960
I think I'm going to say it's a lock.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.600
And basically, if you guys want to show up while Wes and I are cooking out and the beard's

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600
here eating our burgers.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600
Then please do.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.600
It's one of your few opportunities to see the beard in person doing his thing.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.600
Yeah.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.080
Now that means I'll have to tell people how to get here and all that.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.080
We'll have all that information.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.080
But yeah, okay.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.080
All right.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.080
I think we're going to call it a lock.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.160
Wimpy, I'll expect you here, of course, obviously, I'm sure you'll fly out.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.680
Marius, I'm sure you'll fly out.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.720
Ike, I expect you guys all to make it here.

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.720
Should be no problem.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.320
I'm sure everybody in the mumble room will just make it.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.400
I mean, you know, it should be no problem at all.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400
What was the date?

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400
The 4th of July, right?

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.400
America Day.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.200
Don't you want to come out for America Day?

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.400
No, I might be in the area the week after that.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.840
You know, Ike, if you make it, we'll have a wet t-shirt contest.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.840
We might...

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.840
Oh, really, Wimpy?

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:56.840
Which is possible.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:57.840
Hmm.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.840
Well, yeah.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.960
If you're in the area, let me know, I'd make a trip out to see you.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:06.600
If you'd like to make a trip out to see us, go to jupitabroadcasting.com and grab a new

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.200
episode, usually Tuesday evenings, Wednesday morning, depending on your neck of the woods.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.240
Don't forget we have the RSS feeds over there.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.880
I did mention it, but I'll just say it again, linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.040
That's where you go to get involved in the conversation after the show and jupitabroadcasting.com

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.560
slash contact if you want to send us your feedback.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.800
And Wes, are you ready for me to fire off the end of the show music with Caster Soundboard?

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.200
There it is.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.200
That's it, right there.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.200
That's so awesome, dude.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.200
Now the show's ending.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.200
You have such power.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.200
That is incredible.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.200
And I touched it right there.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.940
It's a touch screen, and I'm watching it play across Caster Soundboard.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:42.200
Now available as a Snap.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:43.260
It's amazing.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:44.260
So great.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:45.720
Listen, we have a new show out, User Air.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.720
Go check it out.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:51.200
And Linux Action News, linuxactionnews.com and User Air at jupitabroadcasting.com.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.120
Two great shows with more Linux content.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.440
User Air, a little raunchier.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.640
It's more for an adult audience.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.600
Linux Action News, of course, is your hardcore take.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.600
Super hardcore.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.600
Really rough.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.600
So hardcore.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.600
It's OK.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.600
No, it's not that at all.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.600
All right.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.600
Thank you for joining us.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.600
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.600
Say goodbye, Wes.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.600
Goodbye.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:32.760
Bye, everybody.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:55.240
What are the chances that the week that you don't have to record TechSnap, we're done

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.240
super early?

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.240
How does this happen?

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.240
Yeah.

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:02.040
We got thrown off a little bit, I think, when Dome crashed.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:09.920
So Ike, we really crapped on how ridiculous it is that you're shipping the plasma desktop

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.280
about how everybody in your project is going to burn out because of the diffusion of resources

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:19.480
and time and the chaotic state that the project must be finding itself in as a result of the

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:24.560
fragmentation of your desktop focus.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.560
Did not say any of that.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560
Fair question.

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.560
Did not say any of that.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.560
Did not.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.560
No.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.560
I actually just think it's really cool.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.560
And sounds like Peter's a cool dude.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560
Yeah.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.560
That's pretty much what we said.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.560
Accurate.

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.560
I will confirm.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.560
I don't know, though.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:41.080
I thought that was pretty good for coming off.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:45.640
Let's see what kind of armchair bullshit internet criticism could I come up with if I just randomly

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:46.640
...

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.640
Let's troll as a service.

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.640
Thank you, Mumble Room.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:50.640
You guys were great.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.640
Marius, it was great to speak with you.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.640
Yeah.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.640
That was awesome.

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.640
Anytime, Chris.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.640
Give me your phone, Chris.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:00.040
It won't be bricked.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.040
Just flash away.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040
Oh, I'm just kidding.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.040
I got it.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.040
See, I got him a little bit.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.040
I got him a little bit.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.040
That's good.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:07.040
All right.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.040
JBtitles.com.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040
JBtitles.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040
JBtitles.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.040
JBtitles.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:19.040
We covered your blog post about Plasma and all that.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.040
Plasma.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.040
Jeez.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.040
Bitcoin is $2,200 right now.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.040
$2,200.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.040
That's crazy.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.880
Did anybody else hear anything about Japan using Bitcoin or something about Japan making

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.880
it more official?

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:32.880
Yep.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:33.880
Yep.

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:34.880
We're going to talk a little bit about it in user error.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:35.880
It's a good question.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:36.880
Sweet.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.880
Yes.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.880
Yes.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.880
Yes.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:40.880
I can't buy things fast enough at the moment.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:41.880
The rate that Bitcoin keeps going up in value.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.440
It's gone up $400 in like six days or something.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:51.920
Have you had any problem with the transaction fees being too low and your purchases not

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:56.320
getting verified in time?

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.960
I had a huge problem with that.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:58.960
I thought I was crazy.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:07:59.960
Yeah.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.600
I had a problem with it too.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:09.680
So I'd say half my transactions are Bitcoin transactions and half are transferring Bitcoin

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.440
to fiat currency and then using that to fund the purchase.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:20.720
I had to do like a dollar something fee just to make sure it would go through.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.720
I tried 50 cents.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.720
I tried 60 cents.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.720
I tried 70 cents.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.880
I did them like, okay, a dollar?

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.880
What the hell?

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.280
It's just I think the network is super busy right now.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.840
There you go, Ike.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.520
There you go, boy.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.520
Is this-

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.520
Yeah.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.520
What is this?

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:37.520
Western Union?

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:44.200
Well, someone suggested in the Ubuntu podcast telegram group that how much an effect WannaCry

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:50.840
Bitcoin purchases are having on the price of Bitcoin at the moment, which was an interesting

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:51.840
point of view.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.840
Ubuntupodcast.org.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.420
They're still recording, so I'm going to put that in here right now.

01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:00.920
After this show is over, what you should do is go get Ubuntupodcast.org.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:01.920
Right away.

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:07.880
Then download Linux Action News and then download Ask Noah and then download User Air and then

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:26.960
if you're missing Ike, download Late Night Linux.
