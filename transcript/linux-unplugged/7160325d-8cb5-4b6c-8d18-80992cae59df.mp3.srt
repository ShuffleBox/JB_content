1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
I'm somehow full of admiration that you take

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,560
thousands of miles with the car just to go to a Linux fest.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,880
Well, and to visit Linux Academy, too.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,160
Well, I don't know.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,720
Sometimes I actually feel like I'm insane.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,840
But at other times, there is something really good for me

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,800
because I spend so much time on the computer.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,160
And I'm always working on the internet

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,720
that to then be very, very much disconnected

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
for long periods of time and driving down the road

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,160
does do something good for me psychologically, I think.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,040
It's sort of a rebalancing thing for me.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,840
I will be right back.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,880
I'm going to get a beverage.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,200
Grab one for me, too.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,400
Absolutely.

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,640
So we were coming down into Texas last night.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,760
We hadn't quite made it yet.

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,120
We were still in New Mexico.

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,520
And it was about 100 degrees out.

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,160
And I got the high temperature alarm on one of my rear tires.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,240
So I have four rear tires, two sets of Duallys in the back.

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,640
And one of them got to 124 degrees, which is pretty high.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,880
It's not super crazy high, but that's pretty dang high.

25
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,040
And so that was the first time during this trip

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,920
where we pulled over and just sat for a while

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,440
while our tires cooled down.

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,120
And it was towards the end of the night, too.

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,720
So by the time we got back on the road,

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,120
the sun was setting, and it dropped about 80 degrees.

31
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,200
And the tires stayed fine for the rest of the trip.

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,560
But there was a moment there where I went, oh, crap.

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,360
And the thing that was wild about it

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,440
is just 45 seconds before I passed a Class A RV

35
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,360
on the side of the road with a blown tire.

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,840
Their tire, something had gone wrong, and their tire blew out.

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,480
And then not even a minute later,

38
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,000
my alarm goes off for one of my tires.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,400
And I was like, I'm not even going to mess around with this.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,120
So I pulled over on the side of the highway.

41
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,440
Lots of big trucks going by because it was a real big

42
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
commercial corridor.

43
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,440
So they're shaking the whole RV as they go by.

44
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,120
And we just sat there for about 40 minutes

45
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,920
while the tire cooled down.

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,200
That was the first moment where I was like,

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,440
maybe this is a little stupid.

48
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,560
This is a little dumb.

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,840
Maybe I shouldn't be doing this because it's always

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,720
a bigger push than you expect.

51
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,880
But at the end of it, I get to go down there.

52
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,240
I get to hang out with audience members,

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,080
and I get to go do Linux stuff.

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,720
And then I just get to go home.

55
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,520
And I just live in Austin for about a week.

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,360
And then that's kind of a unique opportunity.

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,840
So how could I say no?

58
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,320
All ready, all ready.

59
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,200
Did you get that beer?

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,320
Yes, I did.

61
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,480
I'm ready to go.

62
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,640
Well, let's start the show.

63
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:41,560
This is Linux Unplugged episode 252 for June 5, 2018.

64
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,480
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,600
that's definitely the hot box sauna edition.

66
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,680
My name is Chris.

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,760
My name is Wes.

68
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,040
Hello, Wes.

69
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm chatting to you from Plainview, Texas this week.

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,880
And we have got a huge show.

71
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,720
Microsoft helped this week by buying GitHub.

72
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,600
We'll talk about Microsoft's $7.5 billion acquisition

73
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
of GitHub.

74
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,560
We'll talk about Nat Friedman, who he is,

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,920
and why you might want to know more

76
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,840
about him in the next few months.

77
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,520
And then we're going to talk about what happens to Adam now

78
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,160
that Google, or no, I mean Microsoft owns GitHub, which

79
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,080
owns Adam, which competes with Visual Studio Code.

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,760
It's a mess.

81
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,920
We'll talk about that.

82
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,720
And then we'll get into some project news,

83
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,080
including some news around KWin, the Linux

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,760
subsystem that's going to be on Chromebooks,

85
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,360
and something big for Nextcloud.

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,560
It's a huge, huge moment today for Nextcloud.

87
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,680
We'll tell you about that.

88
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,800
And then the most app picks we've ever had on the show.

89
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,480
It's an app pick blowout.

90
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,000
We've got so many app picks, you're

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,880
going to need tabs for days.

92
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,080
There's probably something in here for everybody.

93
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,760
And then, at the end of the show,

94
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,640
after we let all of this soak for a bit,

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,920
after we marinate in Microsoft's purchase,

96
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,320
now that Microsoft is going to own Electron,

97
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,080
how can Microsoft make it better?

98
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
What could they do?

99
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,600
Let's just say things work out, and they

100
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,160
are able to steward Electron into a direction that

101
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,040
improves it for everyone.

102
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,080
That could happen.

103
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,160
We'll have to wait and see.

104
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,680
And I'll get the Mumble Room suggestions, my suggestions,

105
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,080
and Wes's suggestions.

106
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,200
So that way, we can maybe, maybe come up

107
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,840
with something good out of all of this.

108
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,400
Because Electron is getting a lot of deployment

109
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,920
on Linux desktops these days, and now Microsoft owns it.

110
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,720
So I think that's definitely worth discussing.

111
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,560
But before we go any further, let's bring in that Mumble Room.

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

113
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,760
What's up?

114
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,680
Oh, hey.

115
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,360
Hey, oh.

116
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,960
Oh, hey, indeed.

117
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,360
Well, what's up is that it's like 100 degrees in this room

118
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
right now.

119
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,160
That's what's up.

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,200
That was expected.

121
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,840
We won't complain too much.

122
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,400
Wes, I don't know really where to start.

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,360
I'm not quite ready to get into the GitHub stuff

124
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,720
yet, because it's just such a big story.

125
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,120
I feel like it's a big story.

126
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,160
We should warm up with something.

127
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,800
Like, you and I do this on the TechSnap program

128
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,560
as we have these warm-up stories to kind of get us rolling.

129
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,920
And I've kind of set one aside this week that's

130
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,800
not super Linux-specific, but it is kind of mind-blowing

131
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,880
where all this stuff is going.

132
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,080
And the core tech runs on Linux.

133
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,400
It's from Facebook.

134
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,120
And it's their FAIR system, which

135
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,000
is the Facebook AI Research.

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,440
And their scientists yesterday unveiled a neural network

137
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,600
capable of translating music from one style and genre

138
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,240
and a set of instruments to another.

139
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,320
So you take something that starts out with like Bach.

140
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,800
And it's one of his symphonies.

141
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,960
And it's symphonies.

142
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,280
And he's playing.

143
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,920
And the AI can translate that into a song played

144
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,160
on a piano in the style of Beethoven, for example.

145
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
So you can actually just, in a way,

146
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,480
translate the music from one set of instruments and styles

147
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,360
to another.

148
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,840
And FAIR becomes the first AI research team

149
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,080
to create a unsupervised learning method

150
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,120
to actually do all of this.

151
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Their results are kind of mind-blowing.

152
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,080
And they're sort of patting themselves

153
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,640
on the back this week because it's huge for the AI industry.

154
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,040
If you think about it, it's something

155
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,400
that a music professional could probably do fairly competently.

156
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,440
But now you have AI doing it.

157
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,520
And their approach involves a complex method

158
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,680
of auto-encoding that allows the network to process audio

159
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
from inputs it's never been trained on.

160
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,640
Rather than trying to match pitch or memorize notes,

161
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,120
this unsupervised learning method

162
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,280
uses high-level semantic interpretation.

163
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,760
I guess another way to put this is you could say it's listening

164
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,200
and it plays it by ear.

165
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,400
Right, exactly.

166
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,560
It's kind of crazy in that respect.

167
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,920
That's kind of one of the fun aspects of some of these AI

168
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,560
projects is just where they interface

169
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,520
with things that are traditionally so human,

170
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,600
like art, and how we interpret that,

171
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,640
and then trying to reason about how they, you know,

172
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,360
to quote unquote, understand it.

173
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
Giving computers the ability to see and the ability to hear

174
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
and then make decisions based on that is the fundamentals.

175
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,160
And they're very excited about the progress they're making.

176
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,440
I, on the other hand, am a little apprehensive,

177
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,160
just like I am with Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub

178
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,840
for 7.5 Billy.

179
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,880
Now, that's in stock, so it's maybe less impressive.

180
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,760
No, that's still, that's, yep, just checked.

181
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,160
Still impressive, still absolutely impressive.

182
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,480
And today is the day after, the day

183
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,880
after we got the official news.

184
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,120
It was brewing all weekend.

185
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,960
They announced it yesterday, Monday, Tuesday, the 5th

186
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,160
of June, 2018, is the second day after this announcement.

187
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,760
And we've already learned new details

188
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,520
that we didn't know yesterday.

189
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,360
So the first thing is that they, I think,

190
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,160
the biggest thing that we learned today

191
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,080
is that Google was hot on the tail for this.

192
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,960
There was a bidding war between Microsoft and Google

193
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,240
for GitHub.

194
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,720
So think about that for a second.

195
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,240
Just that information right there, Wes,

196
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
how would you feel if yesterday was announced

197
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,080
Google bought GitHub?

198
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,920
You know, I don't know.

199
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,320
It's kind of complicated.

200
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,160
Both are sort of gray areas.

201
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,880
I might actually be happier with Microsoft buying them.

202
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,040
That feels weird to say, but if someone had to,

203
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,560
it could have been worse, I think.

204
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,400
No.

205
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,160
I can even give you the reason why Microsoft or anybody wants

206
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,960
it.

207
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,240
And it's to do with search for code references.

208
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,960
Microsoft, a couple of years ago,

209
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,120
you guys reported in here, I think,

210
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,600
a tool that allowed you to search for actual solution

211
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,880
snippets.

212
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,560
And Microsoft wants that.

213
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,640
And Google wants that, too.

214
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,120
It also gives developers for their infrastructure,

215
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,800
which is looking for developers.

216
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,760
Looking for developers, so those are the reasons.

217
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,640
I don't think anybody would have been a better buyer

218
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,960
than anybody else.

219
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,240
They are all terrible because the reasons they want it is.

220
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,960
No, seriously, I think GitHub, if a foundation was made out

221
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,120
of it, it would be great.

222
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,320
But somebody buying it, there's nobody

223
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,600
that's going to buy a business which

224
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,000
is founded on selling storage.

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
That's what GitHub is.

226
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
So, Dar, what do you think, though?

227
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,560
If you were going to have to pick between Microsoft

228
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,640
or Google, as far as open source projects go,

229
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,600
which one are you more comfortable with?

230
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,280
I would say Google, I guess.

231
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,800
And the reason for that would have

232
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,440
been just because Google at least has a legitimate reason.

233
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,800
Also, aside from demining your code as data,

234
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,400
reason, which is code.google.com failed.

235
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,280
It was terrible.

236
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,480
It closed.

237
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,640
So they need a replacement.

238
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
It wouldn't make sense.

239
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,920
Microsoft, they kind of have this whole tooling.

240
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
They're going to change GitHub.

241
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,320
It's going to be worse.

242
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,160
Yes, it would be cool if it was a foundation,

243
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,960
but that was never going to happen.

244
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,320
They've always been maybe not actually making

245
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,200
a bunch of money, but attempting to be a for-profit company.

246
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,240
GitHub is convenient.

247
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,680
I have no love lost.

248
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,360
So it really just seems more like business to me

249
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,440
than anything else.

250
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,520
And maybe it means we reevaluate it.

251
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,280
But that's exactly.

252
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,680
Google would have probably kept this convenient

253
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,120
if they only bought it for the code.google replacement thing,

254
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,160
because that's what they had with code.google.

255
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,680
It was just sitting there, and people could use it.

256
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,480
It was a back burner that they didn't mind.

257
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,720
Yeah, that also means it wasted away.

258
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,680
I think Microsoft will probably be a much more active

259
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,280
and probably better steward.

260
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,040
They have been doing a lot of Git things.

261
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,760
I think they actually care about Git.

262
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,720
There's obviously other reasons for this acquisition,

263
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,680
but their developers are already using it.

264
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,480
They're one of the largest open source contributors

265
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,880
on the platform, so I think it's in their own interest

266
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,560
to actually make it work pretty well.

267
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,080
What that actually means is now you're

268
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,760
going to be filled with Microsoft products all over,

269
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,640
and Git will change to accommodate the Microsoft tool

270
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,400
chain, which means that if you love GitHub right now,

271
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,120
it might not be as pretty in that future

272
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,800
when it's connecting with all of the tools you don't use.

273
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,120
I think that's definitely a likely possibility for sure.

274
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,760
So Nat Friedman, who's going to be running it,

275
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,000
said that they're going to remain an independent entity,

276
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,800
sort of like how LinkedIn has.

277
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,440
We'll see if that's going to be true.

278
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,640
Even find that there's another problem

279
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,120
with this whole situation, which these big corporations are

280
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,680
compliancy.

281
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,600
They're full compliant.

282
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,400
And remember the takedowns that GitHub had?

283
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,440
Expect more of those.

284
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,160
Oh, and by the way, in the future,

285
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
we probably don't need certain governments

286
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,800
to develop Stuxnet.

287
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,400
They can just inject in normal daily software

288
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,280
because they have control of the repos

289
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,560
and who gets to see the code in the first place.

290
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,280
So you're building from source?

291
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,120
Who cares?

292
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,400
So I think what we have here is grounds for serious concern.

293
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,440
But we don't have anything that's

294
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,880
even going to really change for probably another six

295
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,560
months or so.

296
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,320
The deal isn't finished until, at best, the end of the year.

297
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
And then at the end of the year, Nat Friedman takes over.

298
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,960
And he's been an open source since the 90s.

299
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,280
He writes on his blog, he says, I

300
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,120
was blown away to discover a free operating system that

301
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,960
came with an editor, a compiler, and a debugger.

302
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,560
All of the tools you need to be a developer and all

303
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,200
of the source code, it was an incredible opportunity

304
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,280
for a teenager in a small town in Virginia

305
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,200
to learn from the best developers in the world,

306
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,120
he goes on to say.

307
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,960
I spent 15 years working with Linux

308
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,000
and founded a couple of open source companies.

309
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,600
My first commit to GitHub was in 2009

310
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,320
when GitHub was just a year old.

311
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,840
Two years ago, I joined Microsoft

312
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,480
when it acquired Xamarin, a developer-focused company

313
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,120
that I started with Miguel Atacaza.

314
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,800
And he goes on to write about how GitHub will operate

315
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,560
independently as a community platform and a business.

316
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
GitHub will retain its developer-first values,

317
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,160
distinctive spirit, and open extensibility.

318
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,360
And he says, we're going to support any language license

319
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,240
tool, platform, or cloud.

320
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,880
And they're going to retain their product philosophy

321
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,480
as well.

322
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,040
Now, he's not going to run the place until the deal is over.

323
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,600
But you've got to give them some credit here.

324
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,240
They've made a lot of inroads with.NET Core,

325
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,480
with Visual Studio Code, with a lot of the other projects

326
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,000
they have up on GitHub that we don't even mention very often.

327
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,200
Plus, the Windows source code is up on GitHub.

328
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
And a lot of people have reached out to me

329
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,400
that work at Microsoft and said, we just use Git a lot

330
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,040
internally.

331
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,680
If they screw up Git, we're going to just go ballistic.

332
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,200
So there could be a potential for a new dynamic here,

333
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,720
a new Microsoft that we've witnessed sort of change

334
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,280
and evolve over the years.

335
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,760
And when Satya Nadella took over and the tone changed,

336
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,400
I was the biggest skeptic of all of it.

337
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,840
I thought, this is just marketing.

338
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,200
You know, a company doesn't just change on a dime

339
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,520
when you change out the CEO.

340
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,800
They have deep, deep, deep cultural beliefs.

341
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,640
But then over the years, we've learned

342
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,840
that there was a lot of internal layoffs, and retooling,

343
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,200
and refocusing.

344
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,920
And I ended up talking to individuals

345
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,040
that were fresh out of college that were brought in

346
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,680
that were using Linux at Microsoft.

347
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,840
It's possible they're not going to screw this up.

348
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,800
I think we have to also consider that.

349
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,640
Both things are possible.

350
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,480
Only one way to tell where we will just have to wait and see.

351
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,720
I guess.

352
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,560
I guess so.

353
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,320
My recommendation, still clone all your repositories,

354
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,800
keep a local backup, rely less on GitHub,

355
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,160
and hope for the best.

356
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,040
Yeah.

357
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,480
That's exactly what I did.

358
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,840
Yeah, and I think you're seeing a lot of people

359
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,720
this week say that.

360
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,920
I think a lot of people are saying,

361
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,840
oh, all right, I'm out of here.

362
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,560
I'm on GitLab.

363
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm out.

364
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,920
And although PFSense just announced that they're

365
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,680
moving some stuff to GitHub, as a lot of people

366
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,920
are leaving, a few folks, like I know Michael Dominic has

367
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,320
considered this on Coder Radio, and now PFSense,

368
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,040
are moving over to GitHub to essentially,

369
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,520
from what I kind of read from this,

370
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,080
is to outsource GDPR compliance.

371
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,760
To just say, all right, well, they're handling those things,

372
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
and so now we're compliant.

373
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,240
In fact, it's the number one reason

374
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,320
PFSense lists on their blog.

375
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,200
They say, we don't have to worry about storing

376
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,520
any personal information about contributors,

377
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,640
and contributors don't have to worry about creating

378
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,280
an account with limited use cases.

379
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,840
That's the number one reason is GDPR compliance.

380
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,000
And then they talk about a bunch of other things

381
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,920
that people always talk about when they go to GitHub.

382
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,400
Yeah.

383
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,480
Well, I think that plays into it, right?

384
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,800
Where I think of GitHub a lot, kind of like YouTube,

385
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,440
where it might not be your favorite place.

386
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,360
It might not be where you wish that you had to find stuff,

387
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
but it just has that social component.

388
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,640
So yeah, people, either you're an open source developer

389
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,680
or a personal user, and you should already

390
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,680
take advantage of the decentralized nature of Git

391
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,760
and have your own local clones, or push things up

392
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,280
to multiple, or run your own.

393
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,200
There's so many options.

394
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,640
Or if you're a business, then it just kind of makes sense,

395
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,920
and it doesn't matter because that's a separate world,

396
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,640
and that's a private business agreement.

397
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,400
Yeah.

398
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,480
So are you a user of Atom?

399
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,640
I can't remember your text editor of choice.

400
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,840
Well, I kind of use all the things that rotates.

401
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,160
I have used Atom a little bit.

402
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,280
I don't use it all the time.

403
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,800
Yeah.

404
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,480
So that's been the big speculation is, well,

405
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,440
what happens with Atom?

406
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,640
Because you have, as they say in the corporate world,

407
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,360
redundancies here between Atom and Visual Studio Code.

408
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,080
Well, one of the core developers to Atom

409
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,400
tweeted, I actually don't know where he posted this.

410
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,120
I think it was actually on Discord.

411
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,400
Just to let everyone know, I've been given assurances

412
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,200
that Atom remains key to GitHub.

413
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,000
Our product roadmap is set, and the team

414
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,200
will continue all of their work.

415
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,280
So Atom continues on.

416
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,760
So you're going to have VS Code and Atom sort of duked out,

417
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
both based on Electron, both kind

418
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,880
of the same fundamental technologies trying

419
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,280
to accomplish the same thing.

420
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,440
They do feel slightly more redundant now,

421
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,360
but I suppose it's a large enough organization if there

422
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,560
really are this separate that it's sort of, you know?

423
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
They don't necessarily care about that too much,

424
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,680
as long as it doesn't suck up a huge amount of GitHub's energy.

425
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,440
Yeah.

426
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,280
I think both you and I follow Ben Thompson on SirTekary.

427
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,520
I think you follow him, too.

428
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,480
I can't remember.

429
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,120
Yeah.

430
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,200
And I've liked his recent takes on the shutdown of some

431
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,280
of the Windows teams at Microsoft and whatnot.

432
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,200
So I'll link in the show notes at linuxunplug.com slash 252.

433
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,120
Is that where we're at?

434
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
That's where we're at.

435
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,360
Um, so I'll link the whole thing in there

436
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
because it's super long, and I'm just

437
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,000
going to read you one of the last paragraphs.

438
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,320
But he says, what Microsoft wants from their purchase

439
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,520
from GitHub is fuzzy.

440
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,360
They want to be developers' friends in large part

441
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,520
because it has no other option.

442
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,280
In the long run, particularly as Windows continues to fade,

443
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,360
the company will be ever more invested

444
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,120
in a world with no gatekeepers, where developer tools and clouds

445
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,760
win by being better on merits, not

446
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,360
by being able to leverage users.

447
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,240
Do you agree with that?

448
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,840
You know, at least partly, I do think it will be.

449
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,960
It is fuzzy, and Windows has sort of to fade.

450
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,040
So it does kind of feel like a play there, too,

451
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,760
of we want to be relevant.

452
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,200
We want to be in these worlds.

453
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,320
And I think there's probably also a lot of tech startups

454
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,720
or other companies with a lot of MacBooks in there,

455
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,880
or maybe even Linux laptops that just don't have

456
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
that much of a relationship with Microsoft

457
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,320
unless they're using some of their tools.

458
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,920
So the further they can spread that,

459
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,400
it's more mind share and maybe a backdoor sales account

460
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,920
for the enterprise section, too.

461
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,160
So remember the prediction of Linux distribution

462
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,040
from Microsoft with the desktop environment, Windows desktop

463
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,640
environment?

464
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,600
Like in the past, they have, look,

465
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,760
the guy that is going to be managing

466
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,360
is a guy that came from Xamarin.

467
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,720
Exactly the point.

468
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Microsoft is not acquiring companies

469
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,600
on the exclusive merits of the products that they have,

470
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,840
but oftentimes because of the human resources

471
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,200
without having to signal the market that they're

472
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,720
hiring for such positions.

473
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,760
Because you can't lie on the job advertisement

474
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,560
what the skills are required, and you

475
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,040
indicate what you're going to be working with.

476
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,440
Now GitHub is a team that deals a lot with Linux,

477
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,840
deals a lot with cloud, deals a lot of making good APIs,

478
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,240
and that just goes straight into the vision of making

479
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,880
that Linux distribution.

480
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,240
I would love to see it, just because it

481
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,960
would be such a massive disruption.

482
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,800
So I kind of hope you're right.

483
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,920
I kind of agree with Ben Thompson here.

484
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,480
I think this is what we are watching

485
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,800
as Microsoft continue to try to carve out

486
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,360
a new area of relevancy before they're really bleeding.

487
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,480
And I think they're being pretty clever about the way

488
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:52,880
they're doing it.

489
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,520
While they still have a great strong Windows customer base

490
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,240
and they still have plenty of dominance in the market,

491
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,120
they're moving into this new area.

492
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,680
And that's how I see the GitHub purchase playing

493
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
into all of that.

494
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,240
As far as the speculation about what's

495
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,840
going to happen to it, as far as deploy on Azure buttons

496
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,720
or integration with Azure, I'm sure some of that

497
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,960
is going to come eventually.

498
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,000
I want to table the Electron discussion,

499
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,800
though, because I think that, almost outside of all of this,

500
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,880
imagine for a moment if Microsoft had just come along

501
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,560
and bought the whole Electron technology stack.

502
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,120
Now, of course, it's MIT licensed and all that.

503
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,160
But we're going to talk about it for a moment,

504
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,520
just zooming out from GitHub and just talking about Electron.

505
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,320
But save that.

506
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,060
We'll talk about that later in the show.

507
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,040
But before we're still talking about GitHub,

508
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,600
let's talk about GitLab.

509
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
Now, a lot of the audience members

510
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,220
have either tweeted me, or they've

511
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,880
been talking to the Telegram groups, or on Coda Radio,

512
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,960
they emailed in a bunch.

513
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,400
And people are trying out GitLab like crazy.

514
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,800
And I think that's been the number one response I've seen

515
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,560
is, oh, OK, I'm moving to GitLab.

516
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,120
And GitLab, if you're not familiar with,

517
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,240
it is an open source core style business.

518
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,840
So GitLab itself is open source.

519
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,240
You can go install in the Linux box for free.

520
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,200
It's Git compatible.

521
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,040
It's pretty great.

522
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,320
Wes, you must have played around with it before, I'm sure.

523
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,160
Yeah, absolutely.

524
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,640
I'm a user of their free service as well.

525
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,720
So I have code both on GitHub and GitLab.

526
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,760
They've been doing a ton of stuff with their CI CD tooling.

527
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,600
They have some neat sort of continuous integration

528
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,400
just baked right in, as well as integration with Kubernetes

529
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,520
and other things.

530
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,900
There is still the fear, of course,

531
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,360
that as they've evolved to the open core model,

532
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,500
more and more things are not in that core.

533
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,360
Sometimes things that you get on GitHub

534
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,840
or some of the other platforms where you might want fancy

535
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,680
or merge support, that sort of thing.

536
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,040
So how much does it get you?

537
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,960
Yes, it's open source.

538
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,520
Yes, that's important.

539
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,000
It's also just nice, maybe if you care less about that

540
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,920
or if you feel that it's not as genuine,

541
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,040
it's also just nice to have another player that is

542
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,800
plausibly competing against GitHub.

543
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,720
And it's easy to move between them, yes?

544
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,400
Fairly so.

545
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
There's definitely differences.

546
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,440
But if you're not super tied into all the feature

547
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,320
sets of one side or the other, if you're just

548
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,120
using it for storing a repository and cloning it

549
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,160
and sharing it, then yeah, it's pretty easy.

550
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,800
Yeah, I think probably the biggest advantage,

551
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,240
it sounds like, to GitLab is that you can self-host it.

552
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,080
And this whole event is a reminder

553
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,680
of the massive centralization we're

554
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,800
seeing in the tech industry.

555
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,400
Now one of the top five tech companies now owns GitHub.

556
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,400
And I'm a believer of the narrative

557
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,000
that this was going to happen eventually.

558
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,280
If Google was going after them, too,

559
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,760
that just sort of doubles down on that narrative.

560
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,480
A lot of people online have been saying that GitHub should

561
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,600
have remained independent.

562
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,080
That's what made them great.

563
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,480
And I've been arguing this was always going to happen.

564
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,960
GitHub has had leadership issues for a while.

565
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,160
They've had money issues.

566
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,760
They've just sort of been primed for purchase

567
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,920
for a little bit now.

568
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,280
Yeah, right.

569
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,960
I mean, it ties back in.

570
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,640
They're a business.

571
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,400
They're just going to have to operate that way, whatever

572
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,720
the community wants, regardless.

573
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,760
And since self-hosting is such a big component of why people

574
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,080
are moving to GitLab, let's talk about Digital Ocean

575
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,480
for a moment, our sponsor, do.co slash unplugged.

576
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,280
You can get a $100 credit when you go there for 60 days

577
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,040
when you sign up with a new account.

578
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,680
This is a way for you to deploy GitLab in seconds.

579
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,440
I'll link you in the show notes to a one-click deployment

580
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,040
of GitLab and to a guide where you can build it yourself

581
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,880
from the ground up.

582
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,360
So whichever approach you like, you

583
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,280
can get started with this $100 credit.

584
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,960
And you can experiment with moving over.

585
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,120
And if it works for you, just keep it in production.

586
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,400
My favorite system that would be way more than you'd

587
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,160
need for something like this is $0.03 an hour.

588
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,160
You could probably get by with the $5 a month rig.

589
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,080
And with a $100 credit, that's going to go with a nicer rig.

590
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,400
Because you can just really play around with Digital Ocean.

591
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,200
They have all SSD systems.

592
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,640
They have data centers all over the world.

593
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,920
They have a great interface to manage all of this

594
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,320
and a really clear, easy, well-documented API

595
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,000
that there's tons of good open source applications already

596
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,720
built for.

597
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,120
So they bring all of that together with that dashboard,

598
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,640
with these one-click deployments,

599
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,320
and that documentation.

600
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,640
And you get the $100 credit when you go to do.co slash unplugged.

601
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,560
You can deploy lots of different distributions

602
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,080
if you want to build the system yourself.

603
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,480
You can attach block storage when

604
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,720
you need to add more storage.

605
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,720
They have a 99.99% uptime SLA.

606
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,920
They have Cloud Firewall so you can block traffic

607
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,400
at the network level before they even touch your rig,

608
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,280
which is brilliant.

609
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,600
That's how it should all work.

610
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,680
And they have monitoring and alerting built into.

611
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,240
So you can check on the metrics, get

612
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,840
alerted if something goes down.

613
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,800
And with global data centers, if you have people

614
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,960
that you're working with in a team around the world,

615
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,600
you can put something in their area that's super fast.

616
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,280
And with those enterprise SSDs, you know it will be.

617
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,900
So if you're ready to get started, go to do.co slash

618
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,400
unplugged.

619
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,320
Take advantage of our $100 credit.

620
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,560
Why not try out GitLab for a bit?

621
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,400
So I'll have in the show notes the how

622
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,920
to use GitLab one-click install image to manage your Git

623
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,720
repositories, or also the step-by-step,

624
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,480
build it all the way up from the system up.

625
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,680
Because they just have fantastic documentation.

626
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,600
do.co slash unplugged.

627
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
Big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged

628
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,360
program.

629
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,920
So let's talk about the K-Win maintainer

630
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,400
that we often mention on this show stepping down,

631
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,200
Martin, who I think is a brilliant individual.

632
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,500
And he announced on the K-Win development,

633
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,840
or I'm sorry, the plasma development mailing list,

634
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,640
that he is stepping away from the maintainer position.

635
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,960
And he has several reasons in here that some of it

636
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,800
seem to be personal opinions, and some of it

637
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,640
seem to be experiences that he's had.

638
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,080
And they kind of come down to maybe the design group

639
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,840
sort of running away with the decision process.

640
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,560
He says, I really dislike the development Katie is taking,

641
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,480
where usability is the goal.

642
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,120
But we don't stop to see if something

643
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,920
is long-term maintainable.

644
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,760
After we develop it, can we actually support it

645
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,600
for a while?

646
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,200
When we started Plasma 5, the fundamentals of the project

647
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,040
were focus on the basics and only what we can maintain.

648
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,800
And we've moved away from that, he says.

649
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,540
And I don't know if that's true or not.

650
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,320
That's his opinion.

651
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,240
But he would seem to be in a position

652
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,760
to make that determination.

653
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,260
He says, for the usability project,

654
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,200
my wish is not to take every user request as a mission.

655
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,160
Instead, evaluate whether it makes sense for the project.

656
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,160
Perhaps also consult the domain experts

657
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,840
prior to writing patches.

658
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,240
It's way more difficult to say no to a change

659
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,040
if the patch is already there.

660
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,760
And when I read through his entire post here,

661
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,600
what I kind of took away from this

662
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,960
is there was some decisions around the log-in manager

663
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,360
and some borders and a no-border discussion

664
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,000
that he was left out of, for whatever reason.

665
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,520
Maybe it was a place he doesn't lurk or whatever.

666
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,600
And the design group created patches.

667
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,560
And it created a bunch of momentum.

668
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,520
And it was essentially the decision was made.

669
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,720
And then when it got in front of him and he realized,

670
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,400
well, wait a minute, we have serious technical implementation

671
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,360
issues with this.

672
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,960
Why wasn't anybody consulted about this?

673
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,760
It was too late.

674
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,400
And then it becomes sort of a political fight

675
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,160
because you have somebody who's got a precious baby that now

676
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,200
they're trying to get born.

677
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,320
And then you have somebody coming along

678
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,560
and popping their bubble.

679
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,600
So it creates a lot of feelings, I guess you could say.

680
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,040
I think so, yeah, right?

681
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,200
I mean, on both sides, right?

682
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,500
When you work really hard on things, you care about it.

683
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,800
And there's not always a right answer.

684
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,000
Yeah, exactly.

685
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,720
Because as a recent Plasma user, I've

686
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,880
been so happy with it that I hate to see anything like this.

687
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,880
But some of this does kind of strike me as true.

688
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,720
He says, we should strive for satisfying 90% of the user

689
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,240
base and not everyone.

690
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,400
Currently, we try to satisfy everyone.

691
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,320
This is a road to failure, in my opinion.

692
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,920
We're on the road to KDE 3's configuration nightmare

693
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,600
and creating an unmaintainable monster.

694
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,440
And I could kind of see that perspective

695
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,520
because I've been advocating now for about a year and a half

696
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
that we need to just forget the idea

697
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,720
that we're trying to find the new Linux user.

698
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,440
There is no such thing as the person who

699
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,160
is unfamiliar with how computers work

700
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,280
and is also buying a Linux computer

701
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,000
or building a Linux PC.

702
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
These two things do not exist.

703
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,720
They may get a Chromebook and may eventually one day

704
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,960
run Linux apps.

705
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,080
But we've always tried to design our desktop environments

706
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,160
and our applications for new users, for new users.

707
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,880
Well, the new users that are coming to Linux

708
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,400
are technical experts.

709
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,720
They're system engineers.

710
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,440
They're software developers.

711
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,760
They're enthusiasts who love hardware.

712
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,920
They're people who love to mess around with source code

713
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,400
and write free software.

714
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,520
It's people who know how to mess with computers.

715
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,480
And what his point is, and I kind of click with it,

716
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,320
is that perhaps Plasma has gotten on this usability kick

717
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,760
because of the years and years of Plasma's too hard to use,

718
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,120
too much configuration, and now they've run away with it.

719
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Do you think there's something to this, Wes?

720
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,520
I know you don't use Plasma a ton,

721
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
but you've been using it more and more.

722
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,200
Yeah, I have been using it more and more.

723
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,320
I can see maybe a soft trend.

724
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,080
I don't know if it's as bad as this.

725
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,480
I just don't follow it that closely.

726
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,080
But I do think it's a legitimate concern, especially

727
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,440
for a large, long-lived open source project

728
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,080
where there's not necessarily one very careful,

729
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,400
curating, benevolent dictator sort of situation.

730
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,440
You really do need to only add things that you can maintain.

731
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,080
And as we've seen, as we're talking about with Gnome,

732
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,960
if you're not careful, if you do build on unsolid foundations

733
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,440
or add things that are going to increase your debt

734
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,040
and make things harder and less agile down the road,

735
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,640
it takes a long time to undo that.

736
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,320
Yeah, and hopefully Martin sticks around

737
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,400
because I've always really respected his technical opinion.

738
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,880
And he's always been willing to go to the mat

739
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,600
to defend what he thinks is the right decision technically.

740
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,560
He's also a really, he's just a good communicator.

741
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,640
And I think he's given us a lot of really interesting views

742
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,480
into what's going on behind the scenes of plasma development.

743
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,960
Yeah, and I'll link to his full post

744
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,880
because when you read it, you really

745
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,960
take away somebody who cares about the project.

746
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,640
And he's not like rage quitting and going away.

747
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,320
He's like, I'm still going to stick around

748
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,600
and maybe write a few patches and help out here and there

749
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
and answer some questions.

750
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,400
But I'm just not really enjoying the maintainer aspect anymore.

751
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,440
And you've got to respect that, too,

752
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,360
because you could just see someone after all these years

753
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,200
just saying, that's it, I'm out.

754
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,960
I rage quit.

755
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,360
And he's like, no, I'm going to stick around.

756
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,040
I'll still be part of the community.

757
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,680
So I respect that, too.

758
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,160
Now, I did just mention that Linux on Chromebooks thing

759
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,880
there.

760
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,680
Well, you know already, everybody's

761
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,160
been talking about how the fancy Pixelbook,

762
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,800
if you get in the dev channel, is

763
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
going to be running Linux apps like either now

764
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,200
or very, very soon.

765
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,640
But we weren't really clear on some of the lower end,

766
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,760
quote unquote, lower end, even ARM-based Chromebooks

767
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,520
until today.

768
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,760
The Samsung Chromebook Plus is getting Linux support

769
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,680
as spotted by users once again on Reddit.

770
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,640
If you have the Samsung Chromebook Plus

771
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,240
and you opt into the developer-only build of Chrome

772
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,360
OS and enable things that are labeled as beta

773
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,560
and then use the terminal, you can apt-get software.

774
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,600
And you can run Linux apps on this ARM-based Samsung

775
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,800
Chromebook Plus, which you can pick up used for like $300,

776
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,280
I think.

777
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:55,960
Wow, really?

778
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,040
Somewhere around there.

779
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,360
Yeah, so it's not the cheapest.

780
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,320
But it is an ARM Chromebook, which so far, this

781
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,160
has been limited to the x86 line,

782
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,800
or I guess you should say x64 line of Pixelbooks.

783
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,840
It's 2018, Chris.

784
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,560
It's 2018.

785
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,880
I know.

786
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,560
I got tweeted about that.

787
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,280
Stop saying x86, Chris.

788
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
I'm like, you know what?

789
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,040
He's probably right.

790
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,040
I could say i686, but I think I'll try to say x64.

791
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,640
So it was limited to the Chromebook Pixelbook before.

792
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,280
But now we have an ARM version of a Chromebook

793
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,560
that more average mortals can buy and afford.

794
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,640
You can get it off Amazon right now.

795
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,320
And it's probably not going to be the same range as an x64

796
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,320
Pixelbook, but it's still going to be a bunch of apps.

797
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,760
And it immediately is turning that thing

798
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,480
into a much more useful tool.

799
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,240
Yeah, that was what I thought, too, right?

800
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,320
Suddenly, I wasn't really interested in Chromebooks

801
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,840
before, maybe for other people in my life, but not for me.

802
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,400
But now, maybe like as a travel laptop,

803
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,780
or you just need something spare while your main machine,

804
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,400
you're switching machines, or getting something repaired,

805
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,560
or just something to throw in your bag

806
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,480
and not have to worry about, not have to futz with.

807
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,280
Once you've got it, if you have a terminal,

808
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,520
and you have Chrome, and then whatever other Linux apps

809
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,960
you need to get your job done, perfect.

810
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,640
Yeah, you and I have talked about this arrangement

811
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,880
in the past, where you've got a lower end, front end laptop,

812
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,440
and then back at home, or in the office, or in my case,

813
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,440
the studio, you've got a much more powerful machine

814
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,680
that you remote into and do the actual work on.

815
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,520
And that's what I've been doing for this whole road trip.

816
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,680
I'm on an XPS 13, which is like three revisions old now,

817
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,880
or four revisions old now, I don't even know anymore.

818
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,480
And the real work is all being done back in the studio.

819
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,920
Like when we render video, or encode audio,

820
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,520
I'm executing those jobs on six core machines in the studio,

821
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,600
and not on my little two core XPS 13 here.

822
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,840
And it is time for me to replace this thing,

823
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,340
because I busted the side and stuff,

824
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,920
so it's kind of falling apart, and God,

825
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,400
is it super hot right now too, it's really warm.

826
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,400
It's funny, like everything's hot around me.

827
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,680
The microphone is hot to touch, like mics don't heat up,

828
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,120
but this one is hot to touch, everything's super hot.

829
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,640
So if I were like burn through my XPS 13 on this road trip,

830
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,400
which is kind of falling apart on me at this point,

831
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,000
because I dropped it, I almost could make it work

832
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,760
on a Chromebook, I could almost do it.

833
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,480
I could almost do this whole road trip.

834
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,760
I couldn't do unfilter, or this show,

835
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,400
but I could do almost all of,

836
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,320
I don't know, maybe I'll do unfilter on a Chromebook

837
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,780
if I had just a couple of Linux apps.

838
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,560
I mean, it's getting really serious if you do big tasks

839
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,340
on more remote high-end systems, or on a server.

840
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,360
There's also maybe like a weird,

841
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,240
I wouldn't have thought this,

842
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,600
but maybe there's a nice aspect too about like,

843
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,360
if you spend all the time configuring the studio machine,

844
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,720
you get that just how you need it,

845
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,920
and then if you can just pick this up

846
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,960
and not have to do much, not install an OS,

847
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,960
not customize Plasma, which sometimes is nice,

848
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,880
but if you just use the machine while you're traveling,

849
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,720
or not every day, it's kind of just like you can buy it

850
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,960
from a store, you get maybe the security

851
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,880
where some of the other things are easier, or simpler,

852
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,640
or just managed for you, and that's kind of convenient.

853
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,680
If you travel a lot, that kind of flexibility is,

854
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
I'll talk about it more in a second,

855
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,000
but you know, I'm going to Linux Academy

856
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,840
to help them move their broadcast system

857
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,740
from a Mac to Linux, and one of the things

858
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,640
that I talked about is, I said, when we get a PC,

859
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,160
let's get something that's Linux compatible,

860
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,200
but keep in mind, one of the advantages now

861
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,940
that we are gaining by moving from a Mac to Linux

862
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,680
is we now have general availability of PC hardware,

863
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,440
so when you go somewhere for a live Linux Academy event,

864
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,700
like when you fly to Denver for an event,

865
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,320
or you fly to California for an event,

866
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,440
and you get there and your PCs died

867
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,580
because something got rattled on the flight,

868
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,760
or you ship it and they screw it up,

869
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,440
because that happens every other event to us,

870
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,040
literally, it's so bad that we try to carry

871
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,120
all of the equipment in the RV whenever possible,

872
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,200
because when we ship it, it just constantly gets damaged,

873
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,120
even with serious Pelican cases, real packing,

874
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,040
I mean, Noah really knows what he's doing with this stuff,

875
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,840
and it still gets damaged, and so I said to him,

876
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,680
I said, the biggest advantage you have now

877
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,660
is you can go into a store, and if it's got

878
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,200
the right components, you can buy it right there,

879
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,720
take it back to your hotel room,

880
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,980
load Kubuntu on this thing, and within two hours,

881
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,900
it's broadcast ready, because it's this

882
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,320
general availability of hardware,

883
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,520
and that's what I also dig about the Chromebooks.

884
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,480
If you could make that workflow work,

885
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,860
you know, if I burned out a Chromebook

886
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,560
sitting here right now, or I dropped it

887
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,760
and it really got damaged, or if I was on a flight

888
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,280
and it got damaged or lost, I could just replace

889
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,120
that machine, it would be an expense,

890
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,760
but it would be a manageable expense,

891
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,880
and I would be right back up and working.

892
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,040
So I really, I think this is one of those events

893
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,060
that it's like the big bang, like it starts somewhere,

894
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,960
and you're like, oh, that looked like a little explosion

895
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,080
over there, and over time, it expands

896
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,200
into this massive sea change.

897
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,040
I think it could go that direction.

898
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,060
I don't think it's gonna be like a smartphone revolutionary,

899
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,160
but I think it's gonna change the way

900
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,640
a lot of people work on computers.

901
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,920
In two years, we'll just be quietly talking away

902
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,160
on Chromebooks and not have a second thought about it.

903
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,560
Speaking of two years, today, Nextcloud

904
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,440
is celebrating its second birthday.

905
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,200
732 days later, they say they've shown

906
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,560
their ability to execute on their vision.

907
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,400
Nextcloud is widely recognized as the most innovative,

908
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,760
forward-looking projects in the open source world,

909
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,240
pushing boundaries in the areas of security, collaboration,

910
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,440
and communication.

911
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,080
Their company's grown to more than 40 people,

912
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,120
and one of the things they're most proud of

913
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,800
is when they started out with Nextcloud,

914
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,040
they promised to make upgrades work,

915
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,480
and they think this area's really stood out,

916
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,240
and they've kept that promise, and within a week

917
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,000
of Nextcloud 13, over 10,000 servers

918
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,400
had already successfully upgraded

919
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,920
to the current version, and they also

920
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,080
say they're proud of their security insights.

921
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,440
They've started a bug bounty program,

922
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,600
and in the two years, they've paid out $8,000

923
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,080
to security researchers with over 100 reports

924
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,320
that they've closed as a result.

925
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,840
It's a pretty cool milestone, and I've

926
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,560
been using it more and more.

927
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,200
Since Fedora 28 came out, actually,

928
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,520
I sort of doubled down on my Nextcloud usage

929
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,520
and had it going in the background as a test.

930
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,320
So it's a really neat project, and when

931
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,400
you have a need for it, it can fit that niche really well.

932
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,240
You're making me think, though, maybe I should give Nextcloud.

933
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,000
I tried it back, I guess, about two years ago

934
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,800
when they were first Nextcloud.

935
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,760
I haven't run it for a while, though, so these features

936
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,840
are looking pretty nice.

937
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,400
I say it is worth a go, and now that you

938
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,720
can throw it up in a container in just a few minutes,

939
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,480
an official container from them, I think it's kind of worth it.

940
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,840
Yeah, that lowers the barrier to entry considerably.

941
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,840
So I am here in Texas, sweating in a way

942
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,520
that I have not sweated very many times in my entire life.

943
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,640
It is unbelievably hot.

944
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,400
It's about 101 degrees where I'm sitting.

945
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,960
And because it's Texas, it's Plainsview, Texas,

946
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,360
there's really no trees to be had.

947
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,320
We just made it into Texas this morning, actually.

948
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,200
And we decided on the way down to our current spot

949
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,880
to maybe go get some dog food for Levi

950
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,320
because we were running low.

951
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,880
And that was a bad decision, Wes.

952
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,920
Oh, no, why?

953
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,720
Well, I'm trying to get here to do the show,

954
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,600
and I've got to get connectivity tested,

955
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,040
so we've got to feed Levi, though.

956
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,520
Got to get food for Levi.

957
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,160
We don't want him hungry.

958
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,760
No.

959
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,040
So as I'm pulling off the ramp, it's too small.

960
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,160
The lanes are too narrow.

961
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,120
My rig doesn't fit in them, so I'm kind of in a lane and a half.

962
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,920
And I'm pulling off the off ramp,

963
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,200
and my back two doolies on the passenger side

964
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,760
go over a little curb, just a little curb.

965
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,920
Just a little one, sure.

966
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,280
And it tosses jupes really bad.

967
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,560
It's like if a massive wave were to just crash up

968
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,920
along the side of a boat because it's just this huge shift.

969
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,880
Like, whoa, the whole rig leans all the way to the driver's side.

970
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,320
And that's when the new upgraded suspension kicked in,

971
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,320
as if we were intentionally testing it.

972
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,160
See, we have these new sway bars.

973
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,080
And the way sway bars kind of work

974
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,480
is the amount of force that's applied into them

975
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,960
is then applied backwards to sort of correct the sway,

976
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,360
if that makes any sense.

977
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,440
And they really did their job.

978
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,840
I mean, we swung back up real quick, right back into place.

979
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,480
And much better than before the upgrades,

980
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,840
we would have swayed back and forth like a boat,

981
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,200
like swash, swashed right to left, boom,

982
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,400
which is really hard to drive.

983
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,280
It was really bad because it's a 25,000 pound RV

984
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,960
on top of a suspension system.

985
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,200
But the upgrades really helped that.

986
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,840
They resolved this.

987
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,360
There was no swaying back and forth.

988
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,240
It was right back up to the top.

989
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,120
But in that swing back to the right position,

990
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,080
because the amount of force that gets applied to the sway bars

991
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,240
is also then used to sway back, it sprung us back

992
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,360
like we came out of a pinball spring.

993
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,520
And everything dumped on the passenger side of the RV,

994
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,880
which is where our kitchen and our bathroom is.

995
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,480
Everything came out of the fridge.

996
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,360
It came out of all of the cupboards.

997
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,680
All of our food came out, all of our bathroom stuff

998
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,640
like vitamins that were in little pill jars,

999
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,960
Q-tips everywhere, the Tums bottle exploded.

1000
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,040
It was just everywhere.

1001
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,080
Beard oil went spilling.

1002
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,440
It was the worst incident we've ever had on the road.

1003
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,720
And it was thankfully recoverable

1004
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,400
because it's all in a contained space.

1005
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,560
All the slides are in, and it's not a very big rig.

1006
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,440
So all I had to do was get us into some shade

1007
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,040
because it's 101 degrees outside,

1008
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,240
and it's just bacon when you stop moving.

1009
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,520
And so I found some shade alongside the pet store building.

1010
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,080
And for about 20 minutes, we just sat there

1011
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,360
and had to clean up all the stuff,

1012
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,040
but it all back away, throw a bunch of stuff,

1013
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,520
stuff that got broke.

1014
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,320
So that was a bit of a bummer.

1015
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,200
Was there any like liquids that spilled all over

1016
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,040
or anything like that?

1017
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,880
Oh yeah.

1018
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,560
The beard oil spilled, some water spilled.

1019
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,440
Yeah, it's okay.

1020
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,080
It happens, you know, sometimes.

1021
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,080
The important part, did Levi get his food?

1022
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,920
And did he like it?

1023
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,760
Did he like it?

1024
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,600
Yes, yes, all those things.

1025
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,920
And he got to walk around the pet store too,

1026
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,760
which he liked quite a bit.

1027
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,600
Oh, perfect.

1028
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,760
Yeah, yeah.

1029
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,480
But now back, we were back on the road,

1030
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,320
heading down towards Texas Linux Fest,

1031
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,960
and we've reached Plainview,

1032
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,600
which might be the actual hometown of Levi.

1033
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,680
Plainview is on his paperwork.

1034
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,160
So we may be in Levi's hometown right now.

1035
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,920
And then he made his way up to Washington

1036
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,280
where we got him from a rescue.

1037
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,560
And we're in this little RV park called the hitching post.

1038
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
I'm going somewhere with this story.

1039
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
And when we got here,

1040
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,160
we were a little rattled from that whole shakeup.

1041
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,880
We'd already cleaned up, we were rattled.

1042
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,680
When we got here, we talked to the manager, Karen,

1043
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,920
and we said, we'd like to buy a night

1044
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,040
so we can just park and hook up

1045
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,160
and get some air conditioning because we're dying.

1046
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,040
And I'd like to have power to do the show and whatnot.

1047
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,120
And Karen said, well, you're just working?

1048
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,040
Yeah, yeah, we'll just be here for about five hours or so.

1049
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,760
She says, you know, just go find a spot and park.

1050
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,600
You can just, don't worry about paying.

1051
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,440
You can just stay there for free.

1052
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,280
Wow.

1053
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,040
Yeah, so we have 50 amps of power, great cell reception.

1054
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,160
I can see the cell towers from here.

1055
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,960
And 50 amps so we can run both air conditioners

1056
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,400
when I'm not recording.

1057
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,000
And we got running water for a little bit.

1058
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,040
Well, we just sit here and kind of recharge.

1059
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,200
And then we have about nine and a half more hours of driving.

1060
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,680
And then I'll be in Austin for Texas Linux Fest.

1061
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,760
That is so exciting, wow.

1062
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,080
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna try to drive more at night

1063
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,480
for these last couple of days because it's so hot out

1064
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,600
that it drops to about 80 degrees at night

1065
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,080
and the roads cool down, so your tires cool down

1066
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,920
and all that kind of stuff.

1067
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
So gonna be doing some nighttime driving

1068
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,560
for the next couple of days.

1069
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,840
After the show, we're gonna hit the road

1070
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,960
and try to put in about five hours tonight if we can.

1071
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,760
It's the last grind, Wes.

1072
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,720
It's just a grind at this point.

1073
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,160
Nothing can stop you now.

1074
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,720
And hopefully you'll meet additional really nice Texans

1075
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,640
who are just doing you all kinds of favors.

1076
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,440
You know, we've already got a good group going.

1077
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,360
If you're gonna be in the area,

1078
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,040
jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Texas for our Telegram group,

1079
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,560
we've got a really good group going.

1080
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,840
And then also, the other reason I'm going down to Texas

1081
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,720
is for Linux Academy.

1082
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,520
Linux Academy has just been growing like crazy.

1083
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,960
And as they've brought in more people

1084
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,040
and they've done live productions,

1085
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,120
they have some productions where they have eight remote hosts,

1086
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,720
which is just mind-blowing, complicated kind of stuff.

1087
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,440
And as they've brought production people on,

1088
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,880
of course, they're trained on how to do all the stuff

1089
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,720
on the Mac.

1090
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,840
And they're trying to go back and write these ships

1091
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,680
as they've expanded and try to get everybody back

1092
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,400
on the Linux bandwagon.

1093
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,560
What's really, really awesome is I've been chatting

1094
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,800
with a couple of individuals down there

1095
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,720
and they're totally on board.

1096
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,960
Like, there's no resistance.

1097
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,800
They're all about it.

1098
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,480
They think this is gonna be great and they wanna do it.

1099
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,200
And so we started chatting and they said,

1100
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,160
yeah, could you come down here and help us move

1101
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,680
from macOS Wirecast to Kubuntu OBS, exactly what we've done

1102
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,640
for Jupiter Broadcasting.

1103
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,920
So I would love to.

1104
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,880
So after Texas Linux Fest, I'm going up to Keller

1105
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,160
and I'm gonna hang out at the Linux Academy for a bit.

1106
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,320
I'll be parked in their lot, boondocking there,

1107
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,560
doing shows and converting their broadcast systems

1108
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,960
over to Linux.

1109
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,280
And I think it's gonna be a ton of fun.

1110
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,760
It's gonna be super hot.

1111
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,480
But so that's like phase two of my trip.

1112
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,800
And then phase three will be the drive home,

1113
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,800
getting back up into Washington where I can't really,

1114
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,840
I can't even imagine it's like 65 degrees right now.

1115
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,600
It sounds so wonderful.

1116
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,560
But let's talk about Linux Academy before we keep going.

1117
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,040
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1118
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,240
Go there to sign up for a free seven day trial

1119
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,880
and you can support the show.

1120
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,120
Linux Academy is going to be at Texas Linux Fest.

1121
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,000
In fact, if you go to their blog,

1122
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,920
they've posted their track, their schedules for Friday

1123
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,560
and Saturday and some information about how you can meet

1124
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,400
up with them and if you want to find me,

1125
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,800
a lot of my time at Texas Linux Fest is going to be

1126
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,000
at the Linux Academy booth.

1127
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,560
So that's sort of your surefire way to find me

1128
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,240
on the weekend if you're not in our telegram group.

1129
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,440
So check out Linux Academy.

1130
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,080
It's a platform to learn more about Linux

1131
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,320
and they're a company that's super passionate about it.

1132
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,760
They really started because they wanted to spread

1133
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,480
the word about Linux and Jupiter Broadcasting

1134
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,040
had already started a podcast network about Linux.

1135
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,960
Really, and they're like, well, how else can we do this?

1136
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,640
They got together with educators

1137
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,040
and they got together with developers

1138
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,200
and they created this platform that's just been growing

1139
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,480
and growing and gotten a ton of industry reception,

1140
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,400
like just super well-received, really well-respected.

1141
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,600
It's a name on the resume that matters

1142
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,400
and they have public profiles where you can demonstrate

1143
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,240
to potential hires or clients the things

1144
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,840
you've accomplished at Linux Academy.

1145
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,760
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

1146
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,520
get a seven day free trial and try out those hands-on labs.

1147
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,360
And if you want to know more about their Linux Fest

1148
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,160
Texas plans, well, then you can go over to their blog,

1149
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,480
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1150
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,160
Okay, we have an inappropriate amount of apps.

1151
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,360
We have a disproportionate amount of app picks.

1152
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,600
People have been wanting app picks

1153
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,840
and holy crap, do we have some good ones.

1154
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,080
And I kind of have like a mix in here

1155
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,360
and Wes threw some in here and it's just, it's great.

1156
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,560
So let's start with ones that were put together

1157
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,960
by the one and only Martin Wimpress, Mr. Wimpy.

1158
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,640
So the first one is a snap that he put together,

1159
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,680
which is steam for windows, soaked in wine

1160
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,840
and all snapped up.

1161
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,680
So it's the windows version of wine

1162
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,840
or it's wine with the windows version of steam

1163
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,680
all ready to go.

1164
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,320
You install the single snap and it's steam for windows

1165
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,280
for Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian and all the other major

1166
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,480
Linux distributions that can run snap.

1167
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,400
So that's pretty great.

1168
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,280
Now the companion part to this snap

1169
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,040
is Trackmania Nations Forever,

1170
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,840
which has been soaked in wine and snapped for Linux.

1171
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,880
This is a racing game that might,

1172
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,360
if you saw it, it would look like a higher resolution,

1173
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,120
better looking version of Mario Kart.

1174
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,080
And it's a lot of fun

1175
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,760
and it's now available as a snap as well.

1176
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,400
I got kind of a gaming thing going a little bit this week.

1177
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,280
It's not all games,

1178
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,320
just a little bit of a gaming thing going this week

1179
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,440
because I just had an itch

1180
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,120
and Wimpy happened to put these together

1181
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,520
and I thought this whole idea is worth talking about

1182
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,520
where they've taken wine and they've taken steam

1183
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,360
and now a game and like you can,

1184
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,760
you can kind of build it all together like Lego blocks.

1185
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,000
Isn't that kind of neat?

1186
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,480
We're living in the future.

1187
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,840
This used to be so hard to do.

1188
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,320
You sort of had to know all the pieces

1189
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,200
that you needed to wire together.

1190
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,920
Just getting wine working right sometimes can be difficult.

1191
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,000
So all you need is snap and you probably already have it.

1192
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,160
If you are on the snap pipe train, then wow.

1193
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,000
Yeah.

1194
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,160
Okay, so this is the last gaming thing I have.

1195
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
Everything else is all serious stuff,

1196
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,840
but I wanted to mention Overload.

1197
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,280
It's on steam and gog.com.

1198
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,200
It's a $30 game.

1199
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,960
So right there up front, this isn't free.

1200
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,960
There's nothing about it that is open source,

1201
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:24,560
but this is a remake from the original creators

1202
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,640
of the classic game of Descent.

1203
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,520
It is Descent for 2018.

1204
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,640
Overload combines intense action

1205
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,600
with awesome graphics and effects

1206
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,360
to create the ultimate zero gravity shooter.

1207
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,080
So you're flying around in this cool little spaceship,

1208
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,440
flying through like mines and tunnels.

1209
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,520
It features an awesome single player story campaign.

1210
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,720
It has a survival mode, which is a lot of fun.

1211
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:51,440
They've brought online multiplayer and just for wimpy,

1212
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,920
they've also put VR support into it,

1213
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,960
as well as a bunch of customizations and stuff

1214
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,280
that were never really possible with the original game.

1215
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,840
I don't know if any of you guys ever played Descent.

1216
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,560
This is one of my all time favorite games growing up.

1217
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,280
Played this with my dad a whole bunch on the computer.

1218
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,740
It was one of the classics and now it's been reborn, Wes.

1219
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,560
Interesting, I have not played it, but it's reborn.

1220
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,200
I might just have to give it a go after the show.

1221
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,000
While you're just leaving away on the road,

1222
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,920
I'll be having a wonderful time gaming.

1223
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,720
GOG.com and it's also on Steam.

1224
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,160
I like it on GOG just because you can download the binary

1225
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,000
and you don't have to be logging in Steam.

1226
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,820
It's so easy.

1227
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,840
Yeah, nothing like that.

1228
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,400
All right, Geeta, I think is how you say this.

1229
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,200
It's get with a cup of tea.

1230
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,520
A painless, self-hosted git service.

1231
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,840
It's a community managed fork of GOGGS?

1232
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,320
What's, I'm assuming it's something written in GO,

1233
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,960
but do you know what GOGGS is, Wes?

1234
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,160
A painless, self-hosted git service.

1235
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,640
What, well then that's perfect.

1236
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,200
Yeah, this is something a little simpler

1237
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,560
than GitLab is kind of what I grokked, am I correct?

1238
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,400
Yeah, yeah, it's not so fully featured.

1239
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,720
It doesn't have all those enterprise things

1240
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,840
and a paid plan that you can get with support and all that,

1241
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,320
but if you just need somewhere to stick some code

1242
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,780
and file issues and manage releases and pull requests,

1243
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,620
it's got it.

1244
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,840
Yeah, that's kind of cool.

1245
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:10,840
At git.io, G-I-T-T.io, or I have a link in the show notes.

1246
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,080
And then this is the one you found this week

1247
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,800
and I'm like, oh man, I want this.

1248
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,400
Already I want to just mess with this.

1249
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,640
I don't have a chance while I'm on the road,

1250
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,900
but this looks really good.

1251
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,260
PulseAudio DLNA, a lightweight streaming server,

1252
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,560
which brings DLNA and universal plug and play

1253
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:31,560
and Chromecast support to PulseAudio on Linux.

1254
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,040
So once you get it all set up,

1255
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,000
it just detects the DLNA device or the Chromecast

1256
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,120
and they show up as a PulseAudio device

1257
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,760
that you can just set your output to.

1258
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,720
Or because PulseAudio is kind of cool these days,

1259
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,800
you could load Puva control and you could just say like,

1260
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,120
take Spotify and just send Spotify to the Chromecast.

1261
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,600
This was a great find, Wes.

1262
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,680
I know, it's actually super useful.

1263
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,800
I'm using it right now in case I need to get up.

1264
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,360
I've got my Chromecast loaded up with it.

1265
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,800
I've got you on it so I can get up, walk around the room,

1266
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,360
go grab another drink and still keep up with the show.

1267
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,500
That's how you did it.

1268
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,600
I noticed in the pre-show that when you got back

1269
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,440
with the beer, you knew what we were saying.

1270
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,280
You're using this right now?

1271
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,880
That's right, my secret is out.

1272
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,880
You clever dog, you clever dog.

1273
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,480
Yeah, so behind the scenes over the last few weeks,

1274
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,240
Wes built out a great little home studio

1275
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,000
that he can broadcast from while I'm on the road

1276
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,920
because why have him drive all the way up to the studio

1277
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,960
while I'm gone?

1278
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,360
Why, I mean, that's just, first of all,

1279
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,540
he's been doing that for so long,

1280
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,200
it's time to just take a break from doing that

1281
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,240
to begin with, but second of all,

1282
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,400
like when I'm not there, what's the point?

1283
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,360
Nobody's gonna be barbecuing.

1284
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,960
Yeah, the main attraction is gone.

1285
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,360
Yeah, so this is really cool.

1286
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,360
So I love how you're sort of making this space

1287
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,040
into like the ultimate Wes Payne broadcast setup

1288
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,440
because this little piece here,

1289
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,640
for people who don't really do shows

1290
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,600
that are live like this,

1291
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,640
like there's no stopping once this show starts.

1292
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,720
And so every now and then, you know, you gotta get up,

1293
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,400
you gotta get another beer, you gotta take a leak.

1294
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,120
Sometimes Chris is running his mouth for a bit.

1295
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,060
But you don't know what he says

1296
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,520
if you put down the headphones.

1297
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,960
So, but you did it right

1298
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,420
because I don't hear it in the background at all.

1299
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,680
So you gotta turn down enough

1300
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,420
where it's not getting picked up.

1301
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,360
So, well done.

1302
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,200
Thank you, sir.

1303
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,040
Is there much of a delay?

1304
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,400
No, it hasn't been too bad.

1305
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,840
I haven't tested anything that's like super synced up,

1306
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,660
right, for this use case.

1307
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,680
It just needs to be, you know, within a couple seconds.

1308
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,160
Yeah, and if you're doing something like music,

1309
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,960
you know, like Spotify or your local music library,

1310
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,920
you don't even care about any kind of latency.

1311
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,040
It's great for that.

1312
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,120
So again, it's PulseAudio, DLNA,

1313
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,120
and we'll have a link at linuxunplug.com slash 252.

1314
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,800
All right, now while we're in the terminal,

1315
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,680
let's take a look at WTF.

1316
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,540
Yep, WTF, a personal information dashboard for your terminal.

1317
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:44,200
And it is everything you would want from like a,

1318
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,080
like a, remember Google start page, their IG start page?

1319
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,200
Yeah, it's everything you'd want

1320
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,960
from like one of those old classic web portal pages

1321
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,520
where it gives you your calendar, your to-dos,

1322
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,480
last time you've chatted with your friends,

1323
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,240
in this case, some local log files, mail,

1324
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,640
recent GitHub check-ins, things like wifi status.

1325
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,600
This is a heads-up terminal-based dashboard

1326
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,680
that is like an overview of a lot of little things

1327
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,940
that you would want to check on from time to time,

1328
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,040
not all the time, but are very important.

1329
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,880
That's sort of how they describe themselves.

1330
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,920
So they have examples in here of like your to-dos

1331
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,620
and recent chats and all the kind of things

1332
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,440
you might want to just be able to take a glance at.

1333
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,600
It's just a, it's just honestly, guys,

1334
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,840
it's a badass looking terminal app, is really what it is.

1335
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,760
It's just a badass looking terminal app.

1336
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,560
And if you want something up on your screen,

1337
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,240
that looks awesome on your virtual desktop

1338
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,080
that you can switch over to super quick,

1339
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,320
I'm gonna say this is one of them.

1340
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,480
Yeah, if you have like an extra monitor

1341
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,880
that you just don't know what to do with,

1342
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,880
and you have a lot of things going in the terminal,

1343
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,200
you might as well just have this running.

1344
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,800
Yeah, yeah, so there you go.

1345
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,040
So Steam, Steam, Soaked in Wine,

1346
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:52,080
Trackmania Nations Forever, which is snapped up with Wine,

1347
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,160
Overload on GOG, Git T, which is a simpler GitLab

1348
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,760
alternative, GitHub alternative, PulseAudio DLNA,

1349
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,560
Lightweight Streaming Server, which brings DLNA

1350
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,440
and Universal Plug and Play and Chromecast support

1351
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,120
to PulseAudio and WTF, a personal information dashboard

1352
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,360
for your terminal.

1353
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,520
That's a strong list of, I don't think,

1354
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,600
I mean, that's more app picks than we really have any right

1355
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,840
put in a show, so go get links to all of those.

1356
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,280
Over in the show notes, now I did say I wanted to talk

1357
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,680
about the bigger question about what happens

1358
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,480
with Microsoft now owning Electron and the fact that

1359
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,080
really any major application that is an industry application

1360
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,920
that's come to Linux recently has pretty much

1361
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,040
been an Electron.

1362
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,440
Looking at you, Slack, and looking at you, Skype,

1363
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,240
and a whole bunch of others that are all based on Electron

1364
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,200
that we've talked about a lot on this show,

1365
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,000
Mailspring, and many more, IRC Cloud.

1366
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,280
Boy, I just got a whole bunch of Electron apps

1367
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,120
stuck in my throat, because it's like I have tons of them

1368
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,480
on my desktop or something.

1369
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,160
So before we go any further, I want to take a moment

1370
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,440
and I want to thank Ting.

1371
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,400
Ting's making this entire show possible right now,

1372
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,040
linux.ting.com.

1373
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,680
They are a mobile provider that makes sense.

1374
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,880
It's simple, you just pay for what you use.

1375
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,320
It's smarter than unlimited.

1376
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,160
You use less, you pay less.

1377
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,480
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

1378
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,160
And the reason why is it's $6 a month for your line,

1379
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,360
and then your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

1380
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,080
Whatever you use, that's what you pay for.

1381
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,760
They have nationwide coverage.

1382
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,760
They have CDMA and GSM.

1383
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,480
So yesterday, I was doing Koda Radio from the road,

1384
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,040
and I was on their CDMA network.

1385
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,000
It was just the better network in that area.

1386
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I was kind of surprised.

1387
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,400
I thought it was going to be GSM.

1388
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,920
Today, where I'm at, I'm within throwing distance

1389
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:33,160
of a GSM tower, I'm getting unbelievable, unbelievable

1390
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,560
performance on their GSM network today.

1391
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,840
30 millisecond ping, which is great for a cellular connection.

1392
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:45,440
21 megabits down, 22 megabits up is what my Ting GSM connection

1393
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,160
is today.

1394
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,600
They are so perfect for somebody like me,

1395
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,560
because I don't really need my Ting data for almost any time

1396
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,960
during the year, except for moments like this.

1397
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,200
Then I can pick between their GSM or CDMA network.

1398
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,560
So you just pay for what you use.

1399
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,800
They have a great control panel to manage all of it.

1400
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,840
And they have a bunch of devices you can buy or bring directly.

1401
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,240
And they have a review up right now

1402
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,960
on their blog of the Moto G6, which is a sweet looking phone.

1403
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,800
It's $249 if you buy it from Ting directly.

1404
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:22,040
But if you go to linux.ting.com, you get it for like $224.

1405
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,920
This is a killer Moto phone.

1406
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,680
They have a review on their blog right now.

1407
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,440
Just a couple of things that stood out to me.

1408
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,760
It's got the headphone jack.

1409
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,360
It's got a 3,000 milliamp battery and turbo charging,

1410
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,600
so it charges in super quick minutes.

1411
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,440
It has a really nice 5.7 inch screen.

1412
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,040
It's got a 2.1, which is 18 by 9.

1413
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,160
I don't know the math on that.

1414
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:41,640
It's weird.

1415
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:45,080
Aspect ratio, nice, fast processor.

1416
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,360
And you have the ability to hook up

1417
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,920
Moto mods to this thing, too.

1418
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,040
It's a really cool looking phone.

1419
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,000
They have a review up on their blog.

1420
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,840
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

1421
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,640
You can bring a device, and you can get $25 in service credit

1422
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,200
or you can pick up a device.

1423
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,480
I, if I was searching for a phone right now,

1424
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,600
would seriously look at that Moto G6.

1425
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,320
For $224 when you go to linux.ting.com,

1426
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,200
that's a great deal, linux.ting.com.

1427
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,640
So how can Microsoft improve or evolve Electron?

1428
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,800
Now that they own GitHub and GitHub owns Electron,

1429
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,720
it's now a Microsoft product.

1430
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,880
And I have a couple of ideas on things

1431
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,200
that they could do to make Electron better,

1432
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,760
specifically for Linux, too.

1433
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,360
But I doubt those things will happen,

1434
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,400
but I might mention them as well.

1435
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,040
And I don't know about you, Wes.

1436
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,640
Did you have some before I jump off?

1437
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,880
Like, I don't want to just run with them,

1438
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,760
because I want to hear some of your ideas, too.

1439
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,260
But what do you think Microsoft could

1440
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,680
do to just improve upon Electron or maybe even just evolve it,

1441
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,280
like just reasonably make it better?

1442
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,200
That's a good question.

1443
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,960
There's a lot of potentials here.

1444
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,280
I think they do have a lot of experience at this,

1445
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,560
especially having built Visual Studio Code.

1446
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,040
I feel like they probably have some good opinions about what

1447
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,120
their limitations that they see with Electron

1448
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,320
is, and I will just say Visual Studio Code, it's a good editor.

1449
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,000
It's snappy.

1450
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,860
It may not be for everyone.

1451
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,240
I don't actually use it that much,

1452
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,680
but every time I have used it, it's

1453
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,000
been a really nice experience.

1454
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,760
So I think they're in a good place

1455
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,820
to just take care of it, to provide maintenance,

1456
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:13,400
to just generally improve it even in its current form.

1457
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,560
Some things I would like to see is

1458
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,800
there have been a couple of vulnerabilities in the past,

1459
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,440
so I think maybe a tighter eye on security,

1460
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:25,680
and just make it more minimal, as few resources as it can use.

1461
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,000
Find some clever ways to just make it less impact,

1462
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,960
because if we're all going to run like 10 of these

1463
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,880
all the time, I would like it to be a little skinnier.

1464
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,800
Maybe something more radical also

1465
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,920
is a huge amount of the appeal, right,

1466
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,280
is that you get to use technologies

1467
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,480
you're already familiar with.

1468
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,120
You get to use JavaScript, HTML, CSS,

1469
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,720
and so if you're already doing that,

1470
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,120
you're already building a web app.

1471
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,560
There's some other competing technologies in that space,

1472
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,680
things like React Native comes to mind in particular.

1473
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,600
So if they were able to keep some

1474
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,560
of the easy workflow of doing that,

1475
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,440
but then actually render more native components,

1476
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,360
that could be a huge win.

1477
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,880
So that's sort of in the lines of what I was kind of thinking

1478
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,160
they could do to it.

1479
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,560
And I could see this going a couple of different ways.

1480
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,140
I could see them changing it so that way you

1481
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,200
could have a modular back end, so it's not just Chromium.

1482
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,020
I mean, this is Microsoft after all.

1483
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,920
Maybe they'd make it so that way you could run Edge as a back

1484
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,400
end.

1485
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400
Electron on Edge, yeah.

1486
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,440
Or maybe if it's modular, it could also

1487
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,120
support the Gecko engine or whatever

1488
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,000
Mozilla's engine is now.

1489
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,400
Because if they make it an interface or something

1490
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,480
like that, that could be kind of cool.

1491
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,960
You could even have maybe even some open source,

1492
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,960
other just smaller engines that maybe they're lighter weight,

1493
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,440
they're more purpose built that could make it safer.

1494
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,160
Because it's such a large attack vector.

1495
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:49,960
Yeah, exactly.

1496
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,020
You could just do minimal if you don't

1497
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,520
need all the fancy features or some

1498
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,840
of the performance of things like that if you could just

1499
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,880
have something smaller.

1500
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,600
Yeah.

1501
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:02,200
Or what about even maybe being able to use

1502
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,960
a different language altogether than, say, JavaScript?

1503
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,600
Maybe something, I mean, you could

1504
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,800
see how they could maybe do.NET Core, of course.

1505
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,960
But maybe it could also be something else,

1506
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,880
like, I don't know, my favorite Rust.

1507
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,640
That could be kind of a really big improvement is change

1508
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,140
some of the tooling that you're using

1509
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,040
to build these apps that are maybe a little safer tooling.

1510
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,640
I think multiple browser back ends,

1511
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,160
if you could decouple it somehow from Node and JS,

1512
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,600
I think that would be worthwhile.

1513
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,800
And I'm sure they'll come up with all kinds of other things

1514
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,380
that could potentially happen to it.

1515
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,940
But if anything dramatic happened,

1516
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:41,160
at the end of the day, it's an MIT licensed project.

1517
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:45,360
It could just, we could have free Electron or something.

1518
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,120
So there's not a big risk.

1519
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,320
Like, there kind of is with GitHub here,

1520
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,640
or like there was with Skype.

1521
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,640
Like, Skype is now a really different product

1522
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,640
than Skype was before Microsoft bought it.

1523
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,080
Yeah, right.

1524
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,660
But yeah, we don't have to worry about it.

1525
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,840
If they take Electron in a way that we don't like,

1526
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,480
well, we kind of don't like it already.

1527
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,640
And it's open source, so we can keep the version

1528
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,760
that we do tolerate.

1529
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,800
Yeah, I'd like to know the audience's ideas too,

1530
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,400
linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1531
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,160
There's probably a lot of ways you can improve Electron,

1532
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,920
including I would love to see lighter weight backends

1533
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,560
and things like that, or even just more secure backends.

1534
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,880
But it's sort of the bigger, I feel

1535
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,960
like it's a bigger story for me personally,

1536
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,640
that they now control Electron.

1537
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,920
I'm not a GitHub user, really.

1538
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,180
I mean, obviously I have a GitHub account.

1539
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,880
We have some Jupyter broadcasting projects on there.

1540
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,880
But it's not part of my daily workflow.

1541
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,120
But Electron apps are part of my daily workflow.

1542
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:36,680
Like, significant changes there, for the better

1543
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,400
or for the worse, would directly impact my daily workflow.

1544
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,480
So it is one aspect of this purchase

1545
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,760
that I'm watching a little bit closer.

1546
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,640
And I'm a little spooked that so few people

1547
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,080
are kind of talking about it.

1548
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,480
I know it's only day two and stuff.

1549
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,160
But it seems like it should be at least a larger conversation.

1550
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,960
But everybody's so busy freaking out.

1551
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,080
And I think they're still in shock.

1552
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:56,720
Yeah.

1553
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,800
If I could write up a prescription though,

1554
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,440
I think you've made some good points.

1555
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,880
And I think I would say modular backend,

1556
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,160
so that way Mozilla could maybe write a backend.

1557
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,120
And the open source desktops could perhaps

1558
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,000
write a backend.

1559
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,080
WebKit could, instead of having Chromium,

1560
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,080
it could be like a smaller, tinier WebKit backend,

1561
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,320
perhaps, something like that.

1562
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,760
Yeah, anything to streamline it.

1563
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,320
MumbleRoom, do you guys have any suggestions

1564
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,160
on what could be done to improve Electron by Microsoft?

1565
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,840
Or maybe how they'll mess it up too?

1566
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,360
I mean, that's also open.

1567
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,920
Improvements to Electron?

1568
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,120
It's almost a joke.

1569
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,600
You don't think it's possible?

1570
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,240
That's why?

1571
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,160
I mean, just kill Electron in the first place, please.

1572
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,320
Yeah, maybe.

1573
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,080
Well, maybe we'll see an exodus there too.

1574
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,200
As people are trying to exit out of GitHub,

1575
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,640
maybe we'll see an exodus out of Electron.

1576
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,720
Doubt it, though.

1577
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,480
It seems like the momentum is already pretty strong there.

1578
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,040
All right.

1579
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,120
Well, I think that's just about everything

1580
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,320
we have for today's episode.

1581
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,600
Another on the road edition of the show,

1582
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,440
which was much easier than last week.

1583
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,080
So much easier.

1584
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,840
Our magical, unnamed, officially unnamed editor

1585
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,800
did unbelievable work last week.

1586
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,120
Like, really just top notch.

1587
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,920
Yeah, if you heard the live show at all

1588
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,600
and then caught the download, it didn't maybe

1589
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,400
sound as good as it could have because I was

1590
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,560
in a loud, echoey, tiny hotel room.

1591
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:17,480
But it was a remarkable recovery based really

1592
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,640
all on the skills of our unnamed, very, very good

1593
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,120
editor.

1594
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,720
So thank you to whoever that may be who has yet to be named.

1595
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,520
You know who you are, and we are grateful.

1596
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,640
He's done a really good job on last week's episode.

1597
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,920
Anyways, thank you, everyone, for tuning in this week's episode

1598
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,920
of the Unplugged program.

1599
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,480
We'd love to have you join us live.

1600
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,240
We tend to do these shows right here on a Tuesday.

1601
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,000
It's kind of a Linux sandwich, because you've

1602
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,600
got Ask Noah, who comes in right as we're kind of wrapping up.

1603
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,220
And the mumble room keeps rolling into that show.

1604
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:43,960
The chat room keeps rolling into that show.

1605
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,360
And then he starts taking calls.

1606
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,520
And then who knows what happens.

1607
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,640
I suppose that's up to you.

1608
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,240
So you can hang out with us, and then you

1609
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,480
get a little Noah afterwards, sort of like your dessert,

1610
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,880
your brown bear dessert, brown sugar.

1611
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,560
So I would love to have you join us.

1612
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:59,720
Go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact

1613
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,760
to send us your feedback.

1614
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,300
I'm trying to remember all my URLs before we get out of here.

1615
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,880
Go to linuxunplugged.tv to watch it live.

1616
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,520
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for where you can

1617
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,920
get it converted to your local time.

1618
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,920
You managed it.

1619
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,880
I know.

1620
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,320
You know, Wes, it's because of you.

1621
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,960
It's because of you, holding the fort down over there

1622
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,160
in Seattle, keeping it real.

1623
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,960
I've got all my clocks set to West time right now.

1624
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,480
So that way, you can keep me straight.

1625
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,700
But thank you so much for tuning this week's episode

1626
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,120
of the Unplugged program.

1627
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,160
We'll see you right back here next week.

1628
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:37,760
And we'll see you soon.

1629
01:02:37,760 --> 01:03:04,380
What about a way where you could, I didn't think about this in the show, but if you could

1630
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:09,080
use the same backend for apps where the security made sense or you trusted it, so you could

1631
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,480
just have less copies of all that stuff running.

1632
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,480
Oh, interesting.

1633
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,480
So it's like a shared backend, is what you mean?

1634
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,480
Yeah.

1635
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,240
Closer to just tabs in a browser, but maybe with some of the same integrations that we

1636
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,240
like from Electron.

1637
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,240
You'd have to be careful.

1638
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,280
I don't know if it's feasible, but worth a shot.

1639
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,880
Seems like it would reduce RAM usage too.

1640
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,880
Yeah, exactly.

1641
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:26,880
Yeah.

1642
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,880
All right, JBtitles.com, let's name this thing and then I can turn on my air conditioning

1643
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,880
and peel myself out of my chair.

1644
01:03:34,880 --> 01:04:02,880
Oh, Texas.
