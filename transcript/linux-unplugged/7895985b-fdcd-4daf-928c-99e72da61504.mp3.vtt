WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.620
let's see should we do a tech story of the of the week before we get into any

00:04.620 --> 00:11.420
Linux stuff hmm let's see here let's see here scanning scanning jiffy launches a

00:11.420 --> 00:16.900
new gif maker tool hey hey big news everybody hey I use that today she's

00:16.900 --> 00:22.380
really dude did she really listen listen it's integrated into Facebook Messenger

00:22.380 --> 00:28.440
and my mom sent me a gift so I had to send something and the value of this is

00:28.440 --> 00:37.800
negative. This is Linux Unplugged episode 207 for July 25th 2017

00:46.660 --> 00:51.860
Welcome to Linux Unplugged with your host freshly back from Montana my name is

00:51.860 --> 00:55.780
Chris Mr. West is actually in route I think he's battling some sort of

00:55.780 --> 01:00.780
five-headed monster in Seattle traffic but back from last week because you

01:00.780 --> 01:05.420
demanded more beard is Mr. Rekai himself hello beard hey guys hey so you'll be

01:05.420 --> 01:09.620
sitting in for with with us at least for a little while especially it's kind of

01:09.620 --> 01:14.540
perfect since apparently we can only fit two hosts and then one has to pop out

01:14.540 --> 01:20.420
anyways we got a really really fun show I a new season is upon me after years

01:20.420 --> 01:25.220
and years of running arch I'm beginning a new journey I'm distro hopping for the

01:25.220 --> 01:29.980
first time in years we'll talk about where I've landed initially and the kind

01:29.980 --> 01:33.740
of things I'm getting into new release it's really great so much works got into

01:33.740 --> 01:38.220
it kick the tires we're talking about it just a little bit on the show also huge

01:38.220 --> 01:42.980
news today breaking as we go on air we'll cover that fedoras got some big

01:42.980 --> 01:46.740
news we kind of hinted at it when we talked last what two weeks ago about

01:46.740 --> 01:51.020
fedora 26 guess wasn't last week mm-hmm then there's a vulnerability that's

01:51.020 --> 01:54.980
actually a problem with Windows MSI files still manages to screw up your

01:54.980 --> 01:58.600
Linux box still but yeah yeah it's it's actually kind of adorable it's not a big

01:58.600 --> 02:01.300
deal but we're still gonna talk about it then we're gonna talk about what they

02:01.300 --> 02:05.540
say is the most beautiful Linux distribution ever no other distro is

02:05.540 --> 02:11.500
more beautiful and it's based on the plasma desktop I'm in yeah yeah so we'll

02:11.500 --> 02:16.860
be talking about that plus adapting gnome for ADHD users like myself it's

02:16.860 --> 02:21.740
true I have to admit it you may have noticed it yourself and of course my my

02:21.740 --> 02:25.940
just my I was gonna say my perilous journey but I hope at the other end of

02:25.940 --> 02:31.180
it will be a golden rainbow as I switch from arch I'll tell you why I'm what I'm

02:31.180 --> 02:34.500
going to but before we go any further I've missed him you probably miss him by

02:34.500 --> 02:41.420
now it's our virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room hello

02:41.420 --> 02:44.540
everybody good to see you in there good to hear from all of you music to my

02:44.540 --> 02:50.460
ears yeah good group in there too good to see everybody so I got I gotta say

02:50.460 --> 02:52.580
right now even though he's not here I just want to say at the top of the show

02:52.580 --> 02:56.980
before I forget thank you to Wes for filling in and thank you to the beard

02:56.980 --> 03:03.500
for stopping by and and people like you I'm not exactly sure why turns out when

03:03.500 --> 03:06.740
we get you off the show the show just gets better I think they just like you

03:06.740 --> 03:09.860
in general we put you on user and they like you we put you on Linux unplugged

03:09.860 --> 03:14.780
and they like you so that's okay I'll launch like 15 shows maybe they can tell

03:14.780 --> 03:18.020
maybe they can tell the impressiveness of the beard through the podcast like

03:18.020 --> 03:21.640
you know maybe it like shows up on like something adds a certain warmth to the

03:21.640 --> 03:24.940
broad that's what it is dude so anyways thank you guys for filling it how did it

03:24.940 --> 03:28.580
go did it go okay pretty smooth did the soundboard machine crash on you guys no

03:28.580 --> 03:31.940
because when I got back like the soundboard stuff was all reset I think I

03:31.940 --> 03:35.780
might have restarted the app okay well I managed to restore the soundboard files

03:35.780 --> 03:39.900
and it's just fine like hmm I wonder what happened but yeah otherwise place

03:39.900 --> 03:43.500
was in pretty good shape I gotta say shows went out on time the trains kept

03:43.500 --> 03:49.420
running I'm just gonna take off more often good in fact I just posted about

03:49.420 --> 03:55.060
what two three hours ago the Montana fix it is the vlog post of my trip to

03:55.060 --> 04:00.060
Montana ended up going down there with Noah and his family and had a great time

04:00.060 --> 04:03.140
and hit a technical snafu which of course no one I had to spring into

04:03.140 --> 04:07.380
action to solve so that sort of ended up in the vlog too unexpectedly it's pretty

04:07.380 --> 04:10.780
I think it's a pretty good vlog I think it sets the bar now for the vlog it's

04:10.780 --> 04:14.020
vlog 48 the Montana fix you can just find it over at Jupiter broadcasting

04:14.020 --> 04:18.940
comm and while we're doing kind of admin II stuff here at the top of the show

04:18.940 --> 04:22.940
probably worth mentioning that we've announced the winner of the XPS 13

04:22.940 --> 04:29.420
developer edition sweepstakes in user air 18 indie there's some other big

04:29.420 --> 04:35.260
announcements in there there are user air 18 and I begin the conversation it's

04:35.260 --> 04:39.900
a really good conversation we have mr. chase Nunes stopped by and he gives us

04:39.900 --> 04:44.260
his perspective of somebody who watches Linux from afar and we talk about some

04:44.260 --> 04:48.380
I think compelling Linux II stuff in that episode like really good good yeah

04:48.380 --> 04:51.380
I really enjoyed having chase on there yeah me too and it was like the

04:51.380 --> 04:55.940
conversation was great because you and I we have our long held positions on some

04:55.940 --> 04:59.420
of these topics and Chase is coming at it with a fresh eye and because he's

04:59.420 --> 05:02.020
dabbled with a certain amount of understanding so it makes for a really

05:02.020 --> 05:05.820
interesting he's a noob that knows things yeah he's an informed a noob

05:05.820 --> 05:10.180
exactly and without bias so it brings a fresh interesting perspective to it so

05:10.180 --> 05:15.500
that's user air 18 plus the winner of the XPS 13 sweepstakes which is pretty

05:15.500 --> 05:18.660
cool all right so you let's start with the big news that I was teasing this is

05:18.660 --> 05:23.340
what really is it's it's like tangently Linux related definitely affects us

05:23.340 --> 05:28.700
Linux users and it's the big news from Adobe today as we go on air that they

05:28.700 --> 05:34.020
are and announcing the end of life for the flash player I don't get like crazy

05:34.020 --> 05:37.420
excited it's 2020 isn't this like the third time they've announced that though

05:37.420 --> 05:41.940
feels like it is this one though has a different weight to it so they're first

05:41.940 --> 05:45.660
of all they're being specific they say specifically we will stop updating and

05:45.660 --> 05:49.620
distributing the flash player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators

05:49.620 --> 05:53.980
to migrate any existing flash content to new open formats like they mentioned

05:53.980 --> 05:58.740
HTML 5 and WebGL earlier Adobe will continue to support flash on a number

05:58.740 --> 06:02.960
of major OS's and browsers that currently support flash content through

06:02.960 --> 06:06.540
the planned end of life this will include issuing regular security patches

06:06.540 --> 06:10.020
maintaining OS's brow and browser compatibility and adding feature

06:10.020 --> 06:13.780
capabilities as needed now there was a there was a line here that they said

06:13.780 --> 06:19.300
Adobe will continue to support flash on a number of major OS's and browsers so

06:19.300 --> 06:23.860
I was like is Linux in that list and it is it is it is it is actually it is

06:23.860 --> 06:28.260
actually in that list Linux x86 is in that list so we will continue to get

06:28.260 --> 06:36.620
updates 32 and I think just 60 the real question is is the ending of Adobe

06:36.620 --> 06:40.860
handling that also going to be the end of like pepper flash because that's

06:40.860 --> 06:46.660
handled by Google mm-hmm well so the chromium blog announced I went so I

06:46.660 --> 06:48.980
went a little digging I was like well what's WebKit got to say what's

06:48.980 --> 06:51.740
chromium got to say and what's Mozilla I haven't I haven't seen any post from

06:51.740 --> 06:55.460
Mozilla yet but I did get a couple from chromium and WebKit and so they sort of

06:55.460 --> 06:59.980
they have like a nice guy sort of like yay flash is dead they're like flash

06:59.980 --> 07:04.300
really helped pioneer our rich web experience also it's an 80% usage

07:04.300 --> 07:10.300
decline dropping like a rock well that's that's still not quite answering pepper

07:10.300 --> 07:14.820
flash though because chromium did flash through the native stuff right pepper

07:14.820 --> 07:19.300
flashes Google I don't know I so it sounds like they're going to continue to

07:19.300 --> 07:22.860
Chrome will increasingly require here's what here's what they say so chrome

07:22.860 --> 07:26.100
itself this is of course on the chromium blog so it's a little confusing but

07:26.100 --> 07:31.020
chrome itself will increasingly require explicit permission from users to run

07:31.020 --> 07:37.100
flash content until it is completely removed at the end of 2020 that makes

07:37.100 --> 07:41.460
sense so that's at least the chrome story of course I actually already ran

07:41.460 --> 07:45.420
into that where I couldn't figure out why a website wouldn't work but it turned

07:45.420 --> 07:50.060
out that flash was disabled in that website by default oh and the chrome do

07:50.060 --> 07:55.820
that for you yes but it also didn't tell me that I needed to allow it so I had to

07:55.820 --> 07:59.980
go digging to find the setting so Safari's been starting to do that too I

07:59.980 --> 08:05.060
believe and so WebKit sort of where Google had like this really really nice

08:05.060 --> 08:11.460
sort of flash has helped enrich the web for years WebKit had more of a dance on

08:11.460 --> 08:14.220
its grave kind of approach it's interesting to see the different tones

08:14.220 --> 08:19.640
and in the projects and in fact they sort of promote the fact that they've

08:19.640 --> 08:25.020
essentially been pushing this direction since 2010 and highlight the fact that

08:25.020 --> 08:28.940
they've been making flash harder and harder to use in WebKit essentially

08:28.940 --> 08:31.820
well really they've been they've been pushing this direction since they

08:31.820 --> 08:37.340
launched the iPhone yeah yeah without flash mm-hmm yeah they actually kind of

08:37.340 --> 08:41.140
call that out here they say they say Apple users have have experienced the

08:41.140 --> 08:45.580
web without flash for some time iPhone iPad and iPod touch have never supported

08:45.580 --> 08:50.860
flash for the Mac the transition from flash began in 2010 when flash no longer

08:50.860 --> 08:56.420
was pre-installed today if users install flash it remains off by default Safari

08:56.420 --> 09:02.060
requires explicit approval on each website before running the flash plug-in

09:02.060 --> 09:07.260
interesting so what do you think of him then yeah well so what do you think

09:07.260 --> 09:12.660
poppy I think it's surprising it took this long it's sad that there's loads of

09:12.660 --> 09:17.700
little games and stuff that won't work and any more but yeah goodbye good

09:17.700 --> 09:23.420
riddance agreed hmm bashful fruit you have a comment about 2007 as in this

09:23.420 --> 09:28.780
should have happened in 2007 pretty much I mean they were in denial for three

09:28.780 --> 09:32.100
years it sounds like I mean you could already see the writing on the wall and

09:32.100 --> 09:35.540
the way it sparked up in the developer community at the beginning yeah although

09:35.540 --> 09:40.940
you know you talk to folks and they'll tell you that flash is still best at X

09:40.940 --> 09:46.300
and you know like it's true nothing fully replaces its entire set of

09:46.300 --> 09:50.860
capabilities and and it seems to be the most capable live stream player like

09:50.860 --> 09:53.140
we've played around with a lot with that what are your thoughts on that because I

09:53.140 --> 09:57.340
know you know I think it's mostly able to be replaced now yeah stuff like video

09:57.340 --> 10:01.020
JS and right you know kind of stuff yeah but that's what that's like in the last

10:01.020 --> 10:05.300
how long has that been good a year a year or two yeah yeah oh you think too

10:05.300 --> 10:09.260
maybe a year yeah yeah so to me it's like it's we're getting there but

10:09.260 --> 10:13.020
there's still areas there's still like parts of it that aren't quite there yet

10:13.020 --> 10:16.180
but I think with the announcement of the end of flash that it's gonna accelerate

10:16.180 --> 10:22.980
those those things that are missing mm-hmm also the the announcement of DRM

10:22.980 --> 10:29.460
for HTML 5 although that upsets a lot of people will probably probably helped

10:29.460 --> 10:34.700
right I sure this in interesting that is a silver lining I suppose because that

10:34.700 --> 10:38.620
was the one big thing for live streaming that was missing is the ability to do

10:38.620 --> 10:42.180
DRM yeah yeah I suppose you could put that way

10:42.180 --> 10:46.140
bashful robot you think it's gonna be like IP v6 well yeah no one's really

10:46.140 --> 10:49.340
gonna touch it until they have to or until there's a better alternative which

10:49.340 --> 10:53.020
you know everyone mentioned it's taken this long and maybe it's because there

10:53.020 --> 10:56.660
isn't something there but until you have to do it no one's gonna do it it's extra

10:56.660 --> 11:01.140
work it's debt I don't agree like most of the the major things that have used

11:01.140 --> 11:06.220
flash have already transitioned to HTML 5 like YouTube and Twitch they're they're

11:06.220 --> 11:11.660
massive and they didn't have to switch to HTML 5 but they did one twitch still

11:11.660 --> 11:15.380
is heavily in flash this is why we're gonna transition Jupiter broadcasting

11:15.380 --> 11:18.580
over to silver light it's an obvious direction of the future right I mean

11:18.580 --> 11:25.740
silver lights really the streaming platform a choice for users you know

11:25.740 --> 11:31.380
what I hate is frickin dependency hell hate it and I'm gonna be honest it's one

11:31.380 --> 11:35.580
of the reasons I was initially drawn to Debian is because the app get command

11:35.580 --> 11:40.100
would figure out tons this is back and this is back before yum and DNF where

11:40.100 --> 11:44.060
you would just go raw dog and rpm onto a redhat box and then go figure out all

11:44.060 --> 11:48.720
the dependencies yourself and use rpm just it was awful and now you just use

11:48.720 --> 11:54.460
Docker well yeah and Debian went a step further but it's still one system

11:54.460 --> 11:57.780
there's things like the depend specifically on other things you know

11:57.780 --> 12:02.220
you could use Apache and PHP for example here and when we talked last don't I

12:02.220 --> 12:06.820
can't do that I gotta remember when we talked two weeks ago about fedora 26 we

12:06.820 --> 12:11.180
discussed a little bit with Matthew Miller a bolt Ron which as the name kind

12:11.180 --> 12:15.540
of sounds is kind of like bolt on it's it's a modular server system that

12:15.540 --> 12:19.700
they're working where you could have individual components of fedora be

12:19.700 --> 12:24.340
replaced or upgraded without causing this crazy-ass dependency help and I

12:24.340 --> 12:28.580
wasn't quite sure how this worked but Langdon white did a post over at fedora

12:28.580 --> 12:31.900
magazine org that gives us some of the technical details of how fedora is

12:31.900 --> 12:36.700
going to be pulling this off so the fedora modularity working group yes

12:36.700 --> 12:40.540
there is such a thing has an objective and the objective is to generically work

12:40.540 --> 12:44.340
towards modularity its crux is to allow users to safely access the right

12:44.340 --> 12:49.500
versions of what they want so imagine some hotshot web developer needs a very

12:49.500 --> 12:55.060
specific version of whatever they use Ruby on rails I don't I you know I you

12:55.060 --> 12:58.700
can you can imagine your own scenario the working group took the requirement

12:58.700 --> 13:02.260
that they they they took on the requirement to impact fedora infrastructure

13:02.260 --> 13:06.740
user base and package community as little as possible the group also wanted

13:06.740 --> 13:12.220
to increase the quality and reliability of fedora itself the distribution and

13:12.220 --> 13:15.660
drastically increase the automation and speed of delivery I think this is one

13:15.660 --> 13:19.100
of the reasons why rawhide is getting to a more usable point too as a result the

13:19.100 --> 13:22.500
group didn't treat this as a greenfield experiment sort of like how butter fs

13:22.500 --> 13:27.580
was created instead they took a rational approach that took years towards working

13:27.580 --> 13:31.060
towards something like you know I mean they instead of taking like that kind of

13:31.060 --> 13:33.340
which is like a more rational approach instead of working for years they took a

13:33.340 --> 13:36.980
more rational approach and they just tried to keep the tool sets pretty

13:36.980 --> 13:40.860
minimal and implement them as they need and then make slight adjustments to

13:40.860 --> 13:45.340
existing systems and that eventually in totality provides something new the

13:45.340 --> 13:50.060
result is a package set that can be sort of thought of as virtualized separate

13:50.060 --> 13:55.780
repositories that's how they're doing this so this is in other words the

13:55.780 --> 13:59.940
client tooling treats the traditional flat repo as if it was a set of repos

13:59.940 --> 14:07.060
that are only enabled when you want that version of a component virtualizing out

14:07.060 --> 14:13.180
the repos is I think and package set is pretty smart and so bolt on or bolt Ron

14:13.180 --> 14:19.340
sorry is sort of this NF is this this effort this initiative and they have

14:19.340 --> 14:24.580
stuff ready to try right now and they're looking for feedback I think this to me

14:24.580 --> 14:30.340
is a pretty important part of if you if you're going to use the package

14:30.340 --> 14:34.540
management system to deliver software this is what has to be fixed if you're

14:34.540 --> 14:38.740
if you're good if you're not using Docker or flat pack or snaps and you

14:38.740 --> 14:43.020
want to deliver software to a server distribution or something like that this

14:43.020 --> 14:48.980
is what you got to fix but I kind of feel like it might be it's sort of like

14:48.980 --> 14:53.980
fixing the barn door after the cows have gotten home speaking of the barn door

14:53.980 --> 15:01.220
mr. West pain is joining us hello hello so we were just going over bolt Ron the

15:01.220 --> 15:04.420
modular server preview of fedora it's getting out there and they're asking

15:04.420 --> 15:07.080
people to try it out right now the whole idea is you know they're gonna do

15:07.080 --> 15:11.340
virtualized repositories and package set so you can overlay like very specific

15:11.340 --> 15:15.460
things and upgrade individual components without dragging the entire OS of

15:15.460 --> 15:18.300
dependencies with you I love it I gotta say like we when we talked about it on

15:18.300 --> 15:22.960
the earlier show I was excited but after having read about it a little bit in

15:22.960 --> 15:28.340
between I'm this seems like it's gonna be great I kind of tried it yet but I

15:28.340 --> 15:31.020
kind of want to pick wimpy's brain but I'm gonna ask you first right on since

15:31.020 --> 15:38.540
you just sat down isn't this kind of solving last year's problem isn't kind

15:38.540 --> 15:44.420
of the future snaps and flat packs for this kind of thing or Docker even

15:44.420 --> 15:50.660
possibly um but I some of those seem like they they fit different use cases

15:50.660 --> 15:53.940
this kind of excited me in a way that kind of more reminded me of things like

15:53.940 --> 15:59.380
Nix OS and where does it give some more flexibility on the you know the open

15:59.380 --> 16:04.980
source sort of how we craft the bulk of our packages and I mean maybe we'll go

16:04.980 --> 16:08.700
to a place where everything is in a snap and that such but it seems like that

16:08.700 --> 16:11.820
it's certainly going to take a long time and is in many ways kind of a drastic

16:11.820 --> 16:16.460
shift in other ways not but this seems like it's a little bit more you know it

16:16.460 --> 16:20.260
would let me maybe much more easily install three different versions of Ruby

16:20.260 --> 16:23.340
or something right exactly but without like having a snap for each one which

16:23.340 --> 16:27.700
would maybe break more of my you know current deployment strategies okay all

16:27.700 --> 16:30.780
right so that's good that's good I like that that's okay now you got me

16:30.780 --> 16:34.740
reconsidering I kind of wanted to so mr. wimpy I believe is a pretty big fan of a

16:34.740 --> 16:38.940
universal package formats like snap and I'm wondering if you think there's space

16:38.940 --> 16:44.780
for both like major reinnovation in how the underlying OS handles packages for

16:44.780 --> 16:49.860
software delivery and universal package formats on top of that that's a lot

16:49.860 --> 16:59.860
of questions I think I think Voltron is probably a result of the fact that

16:59.860 --> 17:06.940
Flatpak is not ideally suited for distributing command-line applications

17:06.940 --> 17:12.820
languages and services and things like that so I think it's it's not competing

17:12.820 --> 17:16.380
with Flatpak in that regard it's complementing what what Flatpak offers

17:16.380 --> 17:19.780
hmm okay fair enough anybody else want to jump in on the mobile room before we

17:19.780 --> 17:25.380
move on I I look at it as in the back of my mind I run this fantasy scenario

17:25.380 --> 17:28.700
where Chris last runs Fedora for a year and he runs it on the desktop and on the

17:28.700 --> 17:33.020
server this guy's crazy obviously not real Chris last cuz that'd be crazy but

17:33.020 --> 17:36.020
if he was gonna do it this would probably be a something like this and a

17:36.020 --> 17:40.820
Fedora OS trees stuff would probably be a good way to pull it off yeah I if you

17:40.820 --> 17:43.740
want to read more about it and try it out you can find a link to the Fedora

17:43.740 --> 17:50.140
magazine in the show notes so there was a vulnerability going around that uses

17:50.140 --> 17:57.020
Windows MSI files to exploit the Linux desktop well what that seems crazy see

17:57.020 --> 17:59.860
this is what happens when a boon to switches to gnome if they hadn't no I'm

17:59.860 --> 18:03.340
kidding yeah right so it's called bad taste and this is this is so funny I

18:03.340 --> 18:05.860
want to talk about it obviously you know if you don't know if you've noticed but

18:05.860 --> 18:08.300
I'm not covering on vulnerabilities as much these days because by the time we

18:08.300 --> 18:11.980
talk about it it's old news everybody knows there's been the disclosure and

18:11.980 --> 18:17.580
everybody but this is a fun one so this is a vulnerability that actually resides

18:17.580 --> 18:24.660
in Nautilus gnome files but it's exploited by MSI files so it's kind of

18:24.660 --> 18:29.580
funny the third-party thumbnail er that's bundled in with gnome files tries

18:29.580 --> 18:38.300
to look into an MSI file and extract out like a thumbnail and somebody was poking

18:38.300 --> 18:41.540
around and discovered that they could hide malicious VB scripts inside the

18:41.540 --> 18:46.540
names of MSI files when the user accesses a folder on his or her computer

18:46.540 --> 18:50.060
where the malicious MSI files just saved you don't even click on it it's just you

18:50.060 --> 18:55.700
go to that folder so maybe you know yeah somebody downloads something I heard a

18:55.700 --> 18:59.420
story recently about somebody's mom or aunt that was trying to watch streaming

18:59.420 --> 19:02.760
movies and kept downloading exe's and if it weren't for on being on Linux they

19:02.760 --> 19:06.460
would have been infected oh yeah so you can have these things just show up in

19:06.460 --> 19:08.780
your downloads folder when you don't even expect it especially for average

19:08.780 --> 19:11.860
users so the gnome files would try to automatically parse that file to

19:11.860 --> 19:15.260
extract an icon from its contents and they would display that in your window

19:15.260 --> 19:19.180
but the problem is once you parse that MSI file looking for the icon the

19:19.180 --> 19:25.140
thumbnail er script also reads the file name and executes the code found within

19:27.140 --> 19:32.920
there you go so it's there's little tricks you can do right now like you go

19:32.920 --> 19:37.700
to new thing the user share thumbnail er's file if you want but I think that

19:37.700 --> 19:41.580
was just that was our that was the funny exploit of the week MSI files that are

19:41.580 --> 19:44.860
screwing over gnome files users that's I mean yeah you'd see that you'd be like

19:44.860 --> 19:48.260
well whatever okay that I don't even have to scan that now everybody proceed

19:48.260 --> 19:52.500
to be scared freak out and I've seen a number of these kind of things though

19:52.500 --> 19:57.220
where specifically different file types that we're trying to create previews

19:57.220 --> 20:03.060
from or sound or window it happens to Windows too we are not alone but it does

20:03.060 --> 20:07.540
seem to be the act of parsing a file but I you know I suppose anytime when you

20:07.540 --> 20:12.180
have an a program executing code and it's taking input if you're not super

20:12.180 --> 20:15.420
careful about the sanity of that input it's just something like you know how

20:15.420 --> 20:19.580
they'll mark downloaded files sometimes or you know don't let you run down but

20:19.580 --> 20:23.340
even if the file isn't marked executable because the Nautilus thumbnail

20:23.340 --> 20:27.340
I was proposing is like you do we need like some you know in the metadata on

20:27.340 --> 20:29.900
this file that we need to specify something that the system then like

20:29.900 --> 20:34.420
don't thumbnail don't preview don't don't interact with unless approved I

20:34.420 --> 20:37.980
mean a really obvious stupid hack would be just disabled thumb nailing on the

20:37.980 --> 20:47.460
quote-unquote downloads folder containerized thumbnail generation you

20:47.460 --> 20:51.180
know that's actually the route it would go to like a whole fake file system

20:51.180 --> 20:55.420
would mount up a Linux system would be spawned X would be started your browser

20:55.420 --> 20:59.500
be executed the file be downloaded man that sounds very Apple II yeah that's

20:59.500 --> 21:05.820
pretty much an Apple would do and it might just work oh man that is so there

21:05.820 --> 21:09.620
you go that is your cyber attack of the week everybody you could just use

21:09.620 --> 21:15.940
dolphin oh or sonar I'm sure we also be a or the command line yeah just use LS

21:15.940 --> 21:21.620
because those inferior ones aren't capable of generating thumbnails that's

21:21.620 --> 21:25.020
true I guess it could it could happen there too although I have not seen this

21:25.020 --> 21:29.260
story for dolphin I don't you know what I don't I don't ever have my

21:29.260 --> 21:32.940
directory in big icon view anyways I'm always list view I need as much

21:32.940 --> 21:36.820
information in there yeah totally that's how I roll that is how you know if you

21:36.820 --> 21:40.220
if you're like me if you like a lot of information you might like ting huh go

21:40.220 --> 21:43.740
to Linux dot ting comm they give you all the information you need right there in

21:43.740 --> 21:46.540
their dashboard they hide nothing from you one of the things that made it

21:46.540 --> 21:49.740
really simple for me with our business account is I can name the lines in the

21:49.740 --> 21:53.180
web interface and then on our bill reporting everywhere throughout the UI

21:53.180 --> 21:56.420
and the apps on the phones those nicknames show up and when you have

21:56.420 --> 22:01.540
multiple lines and why wouldn't you it's six dollars for a line so it makes

22:01.540 --> 22:05.340
giving phones out to staff and family members economical especially if you

22:05.340 --> 22:09.420
already have a CDMA or GSM device to check their BYOD page then it's just

22:09.420 --> 22:13.020
your usage it's six dollars for the line whatever uncle Sam's cut is and then

22:13.020 --> 22:17.240
your usage it's brilliant so if you got like the beard over there on the Wi-Fi I

22:17.240 --> 22:21.060
mean like that's forget he pays for me that's like that's very true actually

22:21.060 --> 22:24.980
and if I didn't have like beard labeled and I know I just look at that I see

22:24.980 --> 22:28.540
beard never uses hardly any data like you know maybe makes a couple of calls

22:28.540 --> 22:33.180
it's not a big deal it's not a big deal and I love that about ting because it's

22:33.180 --> 22:38.020
approachable for small businesses it's perfect for families and it scales to

22:38.020 --> 22:42.300
large businesses you can get started by going to Linux dot ting comm take $25

22:42.300 --> 22:47.820
off a device or save $25 if you bring one check out their Twitter page to at

22:47.820 --> 22:54.540
ting FTW they're doing a giveaway right now of the moto e4s and $250

22:54.540 --> 22:59.100
in credit which would last a really long time since the average bills $23 a line

22:59.100 --> 23:05.740
when you add everything up also great deal right now on the moto g5 plus this

23:05.740 --> 23:09.900
is a CDMA and GSM phone so it's really nice on ting since they have both

23:09.900 --> 23:13.380
networks you can pick what works better two hundred and seventy four dollars you

23:13.380 --> 23:17.700
can get it unlocked it's new it's a great Android like they just made like

23:17.700 --> 23:22.100
small tweaks to Android they're generally good and it's a solid well

23:22.100 --> 23:27.740
built phone from Motorola for $274 no contract nor the termination fee you can

23:27.740 --> 23:31.500
get started by going to linux.ting.com to get it at that price or bring your

23:31.500 --> 23:36.260
own device linux.ting.com thanks to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

23:36.260 --> 23:42.660
damn that's a good URL mm-hmm linux.ting.com so I was looking at the

23:42.660 --> 23:47.300
world's most beautiful Linux distribution ever staring at it really

23:47.300 --> 23:49.680
it's a little uncomfortable about it this is one of those things where I've

23:49.680 --> 23:51.980
never heard anybody say it out loud before so now I'm gonna be the first

23:51.980 --> 23:55.140
guy to say it out loud I'm gonna sound like a jerk or you'll be the taste

23:55.140 --> 24:01.660
maker for this I hope so I think it's nitrex what do you think nitrex n-i-t-r-u-x

24:01.660 --> 24:05.580
nitrex nitrex nitrex anybody in the mumble room checked out nitrex the

24:05.580 --> 24:10.300
world's most beautiful Linux to distribution ever that's apparently

24:10.300 --> 24:15.180
according to this review they say it's a Linux distribution focused on design it

24:15.180 --> 24:20.900
introduces the Nomad desktop which is built on top of KDE Plasma 5 and cute

24:20.900 --> 24:27.380
it's based on Ubuntu actually Ubuntu 17.10 to be in specific and it is

24:27.380 --> 24:31.980
obviously because of that still under development although they say it's close

24:31.980 --> 24:35.380
enough this is a quote from the devs it's close enough to a rolling release

24:35.380 --> 24:40.460
model I am

24:42.460 --> 24:47.900
that's that's no that isn't that no that is using the beta of Ubuntu does not

24:47.900 --> 24:51.380
make it does not make a rolling release that is not how that works that's not

24:51.380 --> 24:55.980
the math I agree okay all right we don't need to we don't need to go okay so it

24:55.980 --> 24:59.660
does say I mean you're like focused on portable universal app format really

24:59.660 --> 25:02.940
you're gonna disagree and say that using the beta is like I mean if you go from

25:02.940 --> 25:07.180
beta to beta to beta like some sort of hooker then yeah it's are they saying

25:07.180 --> 25:13.180
they're not doing that because you know when they say they're using the beta

25:13.180 --> 25:19.260
they could just be moving to the next beta when they have the the freeze man

25:19.260 --> 25:22.940
that sounds like the kind of desktop I want to roll but then I don't get why

25:22.940 --> 25:28.220
they just wouldn't be using Debian unstable as their base yeah yeah that's

25:28.220 --> 25:32.740
well because a bunch of does a lot of hard work that's why they got those

25:32.740 --> 25:36.460
repos man they have you seen how fast those repos are I'd love to re-host you

25:36.460 --> 25:39.500
those repo I'd love to just reuse those repos are you over here crapping on

25:39.500 --> 25:46.100
Debian now ouch I just it's funny how many distros are coming up based on 1710

25:46.100 --> 25:50.700
when 1804 is clearly around the corner and and aren't you excited so clearly

25:50.700 --> 25:53.540
the better way to go one thing I noticed about this is they're saying it's a

25:53.540 --> 25:57.140
reincarnation of the old district I didn't even know they had yeah they had

25:57.140 --> 26:01.740
an old one based on 1510 back in the day oh yeah they stopped development because

26:01.740 --> 26:06.300
of a problem with system D and network manager they gave up I don't mean to

26:06.300 --> 26:09.500
laugh at them because you know because they were using beta for that they were using system

26:09.500 --> 26:12.580
they were using system during the system D transition they were you on the beta

26:12.580 --> 26:15.820
huh which was like you mean they were on the rolling release is that what you

26:15.820 --> 26:19.260
know they were on they were on the they're they're rolling beta ish thing

26:19.260 --> 26:26.140
that was like right before the transition happened so it just started

26:26.140 --> 26:29.620
it was boy that was a bad time I say they were beta testers yeah only they're

26:29.620 --> 26:32.700
trying to build a distro at the same time it's kind of confusing to have an

26:32.700 --> 26:38.380
ex.org which is like almost nix or an ex OS org it's really simple to be fair to

26:38.380 --> 26:41.660
be fair even people that just normally use their desktops have problems with

26:41.660 --> 26:46.980
network manager I feel like what this really is and they're not saying it is I

26:46.980 --> 26:51.420
think it's neon I think it's repackaged neon with a nice theme because they say

26:51.420 --> 26:57.300
the current version of nitrix is based on the dev branch of Ubuntu on top of

26:57.300 --> 27:02.460
that we're getting continuous updates to plasma provided by neon devs for which

27:02.460 --> 27:06.220
we enabled both git repositories and finally our homebrewed software like

27:06.220 --> 27:10.380
nomad desktop all right you know what I mean I think it's I think it's it's if

27:10.380 --> 27:14.100
you are a cute fan and you like the plasma desktop are looking for maybe a

27:14.100 --> 27:17.180
different take on it it might be worth the look I mean we're having some fun

27:17.180 --> 27:21.020
here but you know maybe something it's a hybrid concept maybe something that's

27:21.020 --> 27:27.660
lighter than full KDE but isn't LXQT that's not finished yet well I mean it's

27:27.660 --> 27:31.980
how I'm saying it's lighter when it adds more stuff and also you KDE plasma is

27:31.980 --> 27:36.820
not heavy at all so that's oh there's a separation between plasma and the rest

27:36.820 --> 27:41.980
of KDE now is my point so yeah cuz KDE is a community in a project not plasma

27:41.980 --> 27:46.500
well so it's sort of like why I sit around and fantasize about what the

27:46.500 --> 27:51.420
budgie desktop might be once Aiki stops fixing absolutely everything else in the

27:51.420 --> 27:55.780
distro and focuses on the new I want my new desktop damn it well I I hear budgies

27:55.780 --> 28:00.220
complete Chris well no it turns out that there as when a distro grows there's

28:00.220 --> 28:03.740
there are things that legitimately need to be replaced and so I understand you

28:03.740 --> 28:07.140
know some fine plumbing is being done but I do fantasize about it about a

28:07.140 --> 28:12.140
desktop that Aiki and team have worked on that is cute based but not plasma 5

28:12.140 --> 28:18.900
itself but still uses kwin and GTK apps look like first-class citizens it just

28:18.900 --> 28:22.500
seems like a perfect world and this actually looking at the screenshots I

28:22.500 --> 28:27.500
gotta say it's pretty it kind of very flashy website I actually used nitrates

28:27.500 --> 28:32.540
a little bit oh give me the new version oh yeah tell me what you think it is

28:32.540 --> 28:35.180
interesting you know and those things that they're doing there the

28:35.180 --> 28:38.060
customizations they're doing are kind of interesting like one of the most

28:38.060 --> 28:41.900
annoying things for plasma for me is the notification structure because it

28:41.900 --> 28:46.780
doesn't keep track of a history of notifications anymore and that is

28:46.780 --> 28:50.700
incredibly irritating and has been for over a year for me and to the point

28:50.700 --> 28:55.020
where there's like a telegram group for it and there's big bug threads for it

28:55.020 --> 28:59.020
and all this other stuff anyway they built their own solution to that and I

28:59.020 --> 29:03.500
think they did it pretty well it's there's some bugs in it is in the

29:03.500 --> 29:07.140
structure because they kind of built all their system tray everything that's like

29:07.140 --> 29:11.780
a system tray widget would go into this new system tray they built so their

29:11.780 --> 29:16.140
notifications are stored into that so that it's pretty cool overall but it

29:16.140 --> 29:25.340
feels like a like a Mac elementary style like menu launcher and then then Mac

29:25.340 --> 29:28.740
everything else so they have like global menu and if the dock installed by

29:28.740 --> 29:32.860
default and things like that so it's interesting concepts and I do like the

29:32.860 --> 29:38.100
fact that they have they've built some cool stuff one of the things that I

29:38.100 --> 29:45.900
wish that plasma distros had was a more cute based graphical firewall

29:45.900 --> 29:52.020
and they built one for their nomad thing it's called the nomad firewall and it's

29:52.020 --> 29:58.560
basically a system settings module that is front-end GUI for ufw interested you

29:58.560 --> 30:03.820
know do you have you happen to seen what the licenses for that that particular

30:03.820 --> 30:09.500
one I haven't looked at that no but they seem to be gpl3 on everything I've seen

30:09.500 --> 30:17.740
boy it's I'm still kind of trying to figure out where this this is nice but

30:17.740 --> 30:21.620
yeah without with the world that has Alex cute what do you think would be with

30:21.620 --> 30:26.900
the world that has Alex cute where does this fit I'm not sure where that this

30:26.900 --> 30:32.180
fits in it I can't tell enough from the website as to what it is exactly yeah it

30:32.180 --> 30:37.060
seems like when if it's if it's something on top of neon or kabuto or

30:37.060 --> 30:41.260
whatever does seem to be their own custom desktop I don't want to say it's

30:41.260 --> 30:44.700
an entire environment but it's not a stiff it's not the typical plasma shell

30:44.700 --> 30:49.740
I will yeah I will say that at least from what they showed their their

30:49.740 --> 30:55.180
settings interface looks way better than Katie I think it is the Katie one it is

30:55.180 --> 30:58.340
the same I think it is it's just different yeah they the icons are way

30:58.340 --> 31:01.980
clear and then they're the borders between each segment are more I guess

31:01.980 --> 31:08.020
it's just more clearly defined yeah the borders are more defined the hover

31:08.020 --> 31:12.260
effect isn't doesn't it doesn't have that same margin padding structure so it

31:12.260 --> 31:15.740
looks awkward but like there's certain things about it that are really cool and

31:15.740 --> 31:18.820
there's other parts that it looked like they there it's not finished yet and it

31:18.820 --> 31:23.780
is it looks looks like it's on a beta so there's this the interesting thing about

31:23.780 --> 31:28.620
it is it feels like an enthusiast that doesn't want to edit anything that wants

31:28.620 --> 31:34.300
a Mac approach so like you can start with this Mac approach and then customize

31:34.300 --> 31:37.300
it however you want because it does seem to be built on plasma I looked at the

31:37.300 --> 31:40.780
widgets and they're all very they they all seem to be plasma widgets so it

31:40.780 --> 31:44.220
looks like they took plasma and then like made modifications to plasma itself

31:44.220 --> 31:48.660
and then also installed the latte dock and some other things so oh and the the

31:48.660 --> 31:53.900
menu that's in nitrix is as a custom menu they built is a custom applet so

31:53.900 --> 31:57.300
that they are doing some modifications to plasma but it does feel like plasma

31:57.300 --> 32:03.900
and it seems like they're doing an Ubuntu like rolling beta thing with the

32:03.900 --> 32:08.820
neon packages on top of it which is kind of interesting and also to me kind of

32:08.820 --> 32:14.200
scary to me because the those packages are made for the 1604 release of the

32:14.200 --> 32:20.140
stack so it's kind of you know that could be a problem you know if any of

32:20.140 --> 32:24.060
you looked at Alex cute seriously I was like actually this I was just gonna say

32:24.060 --> 32:27.060
this story is making me want to give it another go cuz it's been it's been since

32:27.060 --> 32:29.980
it was in it was earlier in an early stage of development since I looked at

32:29.980 --> 32:33.940
it I haven't looked at it you've got an LXQ expert in the chat room at the

32:33.940 --> 32:37.660
moment I was actually gonna suggest that maybe Simon should chime in it's you

32:37.660 --> 32:40.920
know from from his perspective of somebody who works with Alex cute what

32:40.920 --> 32:44.820
he thinks about this distro and Simon could can I throw a random tech question

32:44.820 --> 32:51.260
at you too I is Kaywin in LXQ does that part of and how can you explain that to

32:51.260 --> 32:56.820
is that like advice if I set up LXQ on my system can I use Kaywin as a

32:56.820 --> 33:02.900
back-end window manager or whatever I believe you can I've done it in a VM

33:02.900 --> 33:07.500
just to test but I mainly use it with open box in fact I'm running Alex cute

33:07.500 --> 33:13.100
on my system right now with open box that's right yeah so yeah I can use

33:13.100 --> 33:16.780
Kaywin on the back ends like I said I played around with it in a VM the main

33:16.780 --> 33:20.980
reason why why somebody would want to use Kaywin with Alex cute is for Wayland

33:20.980 --> 33:25.580
support and the only reason why why yeah the only reason why Alex cute hasn't

33:25.580 --> 33:31.340
gone to 1.0 yet is Alex cute 1.0 is Wayland complete that's why that that

33:31.340 --> 33:37.540
hasn't gone to 1.0 and we don't have any we don't have an ETA for you know I've

33:37.540 --> 33:40.940
recently been doing some upstream Alex cute development and we don't have an

33:40.940 --> 33:46.780
ETA for 1.0 but I know they're gonna do what was it that is I think it was 0.12

33:46.780 --> 33:51.380
they're gonna do upstream within the next month or two okay okay well I guess

33:51.380 --> 33:54.060
I'd put this out there to the audience if anybody's tried nitrix and wants to

33:54.060 --> 33:57.620
write in and tell us what it's like mm-hmm no I it's like for me though I

33:57.620 --> 34:00.580
like I think my time would probably be spent better with Alex cute you know

34:00.580 --> 34:04.780
this I don't really want to bring it up again but this approach is kind of the

34:04.780 --> 34:10.260
approach I was talking about when we were talking about pop OS I feel like

34:10.260 --> 34:13.220
this is an approach that makes more sense they're doing significant

34:13.220 --> 34:16.500
customization but they're basing it on top of the right distribution instead of

34:16.500 --> 34:20.660
spinning it off into its own thing yeah from what I can tell I don't know if

34:20.660 --> 34:24.300
it's a if it's a fork of plasma or if it's just something that sits on top of

34:24.300 --> 34:27.180
plasma with some themes that's I haven't been able to tell that from looking at

34:27.180 --> 34:30.820
the website I based on what I've experienced it looks like it's just

34:30.820 --> 34:34.340
sitting on top yeah that's my guess too by looking at it it is the difference

34:34.340 --> 34:37.620
there's the things I've used on it it just seemed like it's on top but there's

34:37.620 --> 34:40.740
there are there are things that are customized that are not plasma at all

34:40.740 --> 34:45.260
but it seems like they've they they changed it looks like they're just

34:45.260 --> 34:49.300
replacing applets I wouldn't necessarily compare it with

34:49.300 --> 34:54.700
neon because neon is is like plasma on top of the LTS Ubuntu and they're

34:54.700 --> 34:59.500
trying to do I believe like a whole different experience with this and like

34:59.500 --> 35:03.760
I said neon is just from what I can tell it's a it's a plasma testing ground

35:03.760 --> 35:08.620
right I think the reason the only reason the neon thing comes up is that they say

35:08.620 --> 35:14.800
specifically that they use neon packages okay gotcha so it's an it's an

35:14.800 --> 35:19.420
interesting the desktop but they're doing things that are cool that they're

35:19.420 --> 35:23.340
basing on an existing distro with some existing packages already built for them

35:23.340 --> 35:27.980
then just making modifications but at the same time they are using a beta

35:27.980 --> 35:33.540
release of a distro that's that's a weird it's if you're gonna provide a

35:33.540 --> 35:37.860
package that's like all set up for you out of the box why would you base it on

35:37.860 --> 35:42.260
a rolling beta thing that and then that that's sort of something I don't know why

35:42.260 --> 35:45.220
would they do why would they not do it on you you know why would they not wait

35:45.220 --> 35:51.140
for 1804 or why not 1704 I mean I'm just curious to see why if there's something

35:51.140 --> 35:56.500
new in 1710 that they that they need or something along those lines there is one

35:56.500 --> 35:59.740
more thing I wanted to point out that it's really cool that they have a they

35:59.740 --> 36:03.480
built a custom module for system D inside of system settings so you can

36:03.480 --> 36:06.460
make all your modifications to system D straight in the system setting so that's

36:06.460 --> 36:11.660
pretty cool that's pretty nice all right so we got to put it I got to put the

36:11.660 --> 36:15.820
call out there to see what people think I I'm tempted tempted but I got a

36:15.820 --> 36:19.980
greater story to tell today and I'm already on a journey I can't I can't

36:19.980 --> 36:23.360
deviate now otherwise I might give it a look myself this is where the community

36:23.360 --> 36:30.220
can help you guys give me a hard time about slackwear last week actually was

36:30.220 --> 36:32.600
thinking about taking a slackwear challenge you should I was thinking

36:32.600 --> 36:36.060
about it it's just I'm really on a journey right now like I'm like on a I'm

36:36.060 --> 36:42.100
on a path to a new distro for our production equipment is that and all my

36:42.100 --> 36:47.740
all my systems upstairs my laptop and so I'm on a journey of a process of

36:47.740 --> 36:50.620
elimination right now and I don't want to I don't want to get too distracted

36:50.620 --> 36:54.420
you know Chris cuz I can distro hop for days girls last time people told you to

36:54.420 --> 36:58.460
take a journey you ended up switching the entire studio to that distro so

36:58.460 --> 37:01.180
maybe you should take another journey well see this is the thing this is why

37:01.180 --> 37:04.780
I'm taking it slowly and methodically so I'll tell you more about it later but

37:04.780 --> 37:08.060
first stretch your middle fingers out for a moment because it may be time to

37:08.060 --> 37:12.180
point them once again in NVIDIA's general direction I don't maybe you guys

37:12.180 --> 37:16.660
can talk me down from the ledge here but an NVIDIA developer who works on the

37:16.660 --> 37:22.740
Linux graphic side so Aaron you shout out to Aaron Platner I think is I think

37:22.740 --> 37:28.780
that's his name thank you for your hard work and now please accept this accept

37:28.780 --> 37:34.280
this plea from your humble Linux podcast please consider supporting x wayland it

37:34.280 --> 37:37.940
appears right now that NVIDIA has no plans to support applications running

37:37.940 --> 37:41.900
under x wayland with the NVIDIA proprietary graphics driver which to me

37:41.900 --> 37:46.460
seems like a bad thing since that's pretty much almost anything that's using

37:46.460 --> 37:50.660
the proprietary driver today and it's not like we're gonna get games rebuilt

37:50.660 --> 37:56.260
with Wayland support tomorrow and I just the amount of applications that would be

37:56.260 --> 38:01.580
f'd in the a you might say seems great unless I'm misunderstanding the dramatic

38:01.580 --> 38:05.420
impact this is going to have well doesn't that mean that Alex QT 1.0 won't

38:05.420 --> 38:10.700
work on NVIDIA as long as you're in under Wayland with k-win right I don't

38:10.700 --> 38:13.660
know because it's no because that would be innate no because that'd be talking

38:13.660 --> 38:17.980
way anything that communicates Wayland will be good anything that's talking X

38:17.980 --> 38:21.860
anything is talking through X Wayland that's sort of X translation

38:21.860 --> 38:27.720
translation compatibility layer it seems like and this is oh man check out

38:27.720 --> 38:35.540
architect oh every single time we talk about this oh everybody always brings up

38:35.540 --> 38:40.740
AMD you know I actually think that NVIDIA position is a good position

38:40.740 --> 38:46.460
because at some point you need to just make a hard break and stop supporting

38:46.460 --> 38:50.700
legacy stuff all of the games that have ever been written ever well then you can

38:50.700 --> 38:54.420
just go run them on X maybe one of my misunderstanding here this I guess yeah I

38:54.420 --> 38:58.540
guess I mean so the thing is right it's like if they're not doing this thing but

38:58.540 --> 39:03.900
no one's making any Linux gamer uninstall their X server I think X is

39:03.900 --> 39:06.780
gonna be abandoned at some point anyway so those games will eventually not work

39:06.780 --> 39:11.780
anyway well I don't know I mean well I'm sure are we that X isn't gonna be

39:11.780 --> 39:15.260
around for another 10 I'm sure something still be around I'm just saying like

39:15.260 --> 39:18.700
eventually if the argument is the things that are gonna be that currently

39:18.700 --> 39:21.660
available are not gonna be available like well that will happen eventually

39:21.660 --> 39:26.860
anyway I'm sure there'll be one distro just like didn't de novo that does that

39:26.860 --> 39:31.100
doesn't use a system D that'll continue to use X until the end of time but I

39:31.100 --> 39:35.780
think it's pretty clear that the future is Wayland well the chat room and

39:35.780 --> 39:38.020
everybody listening right now shutting up their podcast player will tell you

39:38.020 --> 39:43.740
the future is AMD and open-source drivers the problem is there are millions

39:43.740 --> 39:47.340
of GTX cards already bought and paid for and one of the reasons people like to

39:47.340 --> 39:50.740
use Linux is because they get value out of their existing hardware and now all

39:50.740 --> 39:53.980
of a sudden we're gonna come along and say hey welcome to Linux go get an AMD card

39:53.980 --> 39:59.060
I don't think that's gonna work so I appreciate that maybe AMD has a better

39:59.060 --> 40:03.020
path forward driver wise but it's it's like that's like telling people have

40:03.020 --> 40:06.180
battery life issues to switch to Cyanogen mod or whatever also just

40:06.180 --> 40:10.240
because the Nvidia proprietary drivers won't support X-Wayland doesn't mean

40:10.240 --> 40:14.340
that something like Novio won't that's that's fair oh by the way a real-time

40:14.340 --> 40:17.620
update here in the show Simon just chiming in saying the next version of

40:17.620 --> 40:23.060
LXQt release will have nice things like high DPI support that's really great and

40:23.060 --> 40:26.900
tons of more polishing including compatibility with the latest Qt that is

40:26.900 --> 40:32.200
awesome I I will be checking that out so what do you think bashful fruit is there

40:32.200 --> 40:38.880
gonna be like a groundswell to fix this problem I don't necessarily think it'll

40:38.880 --> 40:41.700
be a groundswell is more of making a smart ass client that someone will just

40:41.700 --> 40:44.860
fork it and go back because they didn't want to keep go to the new one well

40:44.860 --> 40:51.820
rumor has it the Debian project is working on rootless X right so maybe we

40:51.820 --> 40:56.300
just solved the problem of X's security issues and you could be sitting there

40:56.300 --> 40:59.500
running Wayland all day long and then when it comes time to game you just

40:59.500 --> 41:03.620
launched rootless X somehow and switch over to a different different terminal

41:03.620 --> 41:08.980
exactly I mean that's that's a hack but it would seems like would something

41:08.980 --> 41:14.500
prevent you from running Wayland and a rootless X server on another console at

41:14.500 --> 41:19.300
the same time I actually don't know that one technically seems like that would be

41:19.300 --> 41:24.940
a plausible fix yeah becomes almost compliance like in some ways I just

41:24.940 --> 41:29.420
can't really understand can anybody I mean so is it are we doing all of this

41:29.420 --> 41:33.460
work I mean if we set the security stuff aside are we doing all of this so that

41:33.460 --> 41:36.780
way we have tear-free flash video because I just I'm gonna just mention

41:36.780 --> 41:40.020
we're gonna be flashing gonna be dead before we're all using Wayland that's my

41:40.020 --> 41:44.500
prediction that's for sure I think it's more tear-free anything GPU accelerated

41:44.500 --> 41:50.380
ever yeah I get tear I get tearing it is hard though I will say I mean like

41:50.380 --> 41:55.180
especially when we were you know niche to begin with and then after like 20

41:55.180 --> 41:57.940
years of X we're like yeah all right people are kind of supporting us now

41:57.940 --> 42:04.700
great mm-hmm so it's probably gonna be a long time huh so anyways I guess you

42:04.700 --> 42:11.940
know it's not time to get the pitchforks yet because it seems like the the Wayland

42:11.940 --> 42:16.820
the big switch to Wayland I don't know I think 2020 would be optimistic I just I

42:16.820 --> 42:21.180
just don't see it at this point yeah I would say five years probably yeah and

42:21.180 --> 42:24.700
so it this might be a non-issue there might be other ways to run these

42:24.700 --> 42:28.020
applications there may be some sort of compatibility layer that has a stable

42:28.020 --> 42:31.780
API set created by a company that's experienced in this area that works in

42:31.780 --> 42:36.460
open-source who knows who knows there may be other solutions to this problem

42:36.460 --> 42:40.900
maybe in video will become open source at some point who knows maybe mark

42:40.900 --> 42:46.020
shuttleworth can sit down with Aaron Platner over at Nvidia and espouse the

42:46.020 --> 42:54.180
great benefits of mirror and it'll just get we'll just get this ball rolling so

42:54.180 --> 42:58.820
wimpy I'm glad you are here sir because for about an hour and a half before the

42:58.820 --> 43:03.940
show I got to play around with the latest alpha of Ubuntu Mate 1710 holy

43:03.940 --> 43:09.820
smokes holy smokes and I have a couple questions couple couple grave concerns

43:09.820 --> 43:16.100
and a few observations so that I am very very much looking forward to talking to

43:16.100 --> 43:21.140
because holy cow what a release there may be some patreon leaks involved I

43:21.140 --> 43:25.580
mean it's it's some good stuff I know prepare your bodies prepare your minds

43:25.580 --> 43:29.060
West have you ever been into a candle store that's like super strong with

43:29.060 --> 43:32.620
smells yeah and you know how they have those jars of coffee and you sniff that

43:32.620 --> 43:37.100
jar of coffee and it resets the palate digital ocean comm go over to digital

43:37.100 --> 43:41.620

then you apply that promo code deal unplugged and you get a $10 credit it's

43:49.100 --> 43:52.860
like digital oceans like here here's a credit card with ten dollars on it go

43:52.860 --> 43:57.020
cray now that's nice because they have a five dollar a month rig which you could

43:57.020 --> 44:02.580
run two months for absolutely free or go the even more like sophisticated on top

44:02.580 --> 44:08.020
of it route and do their hourly yeah so great I'm even I don't even know what

44:08.020 --> 44:11.300
the like lower prices are cuz like three cents an hour like I'm like that's

44:11.300 --> 44:15.700
better that's fine that's I've literally only need it for a couple of hours that

44:15.700 --> 44:21.780
is it's so fast it's so so stinking fast it was a actually a topic of

44:21.780 --> 44:26.500
conversation recently just how how stinking fast there their systems are

44:26.500 --> 44:32.340
because first of all it's SSDs throughout everything and it's massively

44:32.340 --> 44:36.060
taken advantage of I'll just put it that way then they have Linux as the host

44:36.060 --> 44:40.420
system we all love that KVM for the virtualizer 40 gigabit networks to

44:40.420 --> 44:43.980
ensure uptime and throughput highly available block storage you can get your

44:43.980 --> 44:48.620
systems deployed in seconds the entire stack or just a base system monitoring

44:48.620 --> 44:52.220
alerting so you can collect metrics and monitor performance and get alerts so

44:52.220 --> 44:55.500
you can look like a ten-person team even when you're one or two people the

44:55.500 --> 44:58.460
pre-built open source apps to are done right it's not like magic config scripts

44:58.460 --> 45:02.340
that don't make any sense it's like if you hired a really good sysadmin you

45:02.340 --> 45:06.220
went in there and he built a system and then they took an image of it I wonder I

45:06.220 --> 45:09.900
wonder and then you top that all off with a really great documentation

45:09.900 --> 45:14.860
incredibly straightforward pricing dashboard they even offer images for

45:14.860 --> 45:20.900
those crazy BSD folks yeah I know I know they even they have the audacity to work

45:20.900 --> 45:24.500
with the projects upstream to can you imagine such a thing that's insane

45:24.500 --> 45:28.480
providing free hosting for many in the open source community and giving API so

45:28.480 --> 45:31.860
you can tie stuff directly into your workflow I won't be having it Rekai

45:31.860 --> 45:37.100
that's crazy talk digital ocean calm use the promo code do unplugged and a big

45:37.100 --> 45:40.740
thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplug program and thanks

45:40.740 --> 45:45.420
to you out in the audience for using do unplugged when you do sign up apply to

45:45.420 --> 45:49.300
your account do unplugged man it is super useful I was on a network over the

45:49.300 --> 45:53.460
weekend that was not so friendly for a little bit so I had to do some you know

45:53.460 --> 45:56.740
tunneling over DNS what was that was perfect I didn't want to mess with the

45:56.740 --> 46:03.380
servers I already had new do droplet boom back online yep yep yep so there is

46:03.380 --> 46:10.100
there's a lot to cover in Ubuntu land these days and so you could say thank

46:10.100 --> 46:12.820
you if you if you're not an Ubuntu fan because I could have made this entire

46:12.820 --> 46:17.860
show about it so I'm saving really the best right now and I want to talk about

46:17.860 --> 46:21.700
Ubuntu Mate 1710 they're actually I think a new alpha release just came out

46:21.700 --> 46:26.300
today I'm I'm being sneaky on patreon two days two oh oh in two days oh okay the

46:26.300 --> 46:30.540
paint the patrons got the release notes early access but the download it's gonna

46:30.540 --> 46:38.860
be on Thursday oh teasing teasing wow so this is a huge release the the I would

46:38.860 --> 46:42.460
say the number one thing that stood out to me when I tried it is how tight the

46:42.460 --> 46:47.380
the mutiny tweak option is when you run the Ubuntu or the Mate tweak and you go

46:47.380 --> 46:51.580
into the different layouts and you choose mutiny I mean it it really looked

46:51.580 --> 46:55.900
like unity 7 with after I made a few small tweaks and I turned on compass I

46:55.900 --> 47:00.460
was pretty much I was pretty much it back in unity 7 so it that was the map

47:00.460 --> 47:04.940
that was the mode that I played around with with this new release the most I

47:04.940 --> 47:08.820
think my favorite feature wimpy and I didn't even notice it until I went to do

47:08.820 --> 47:13.700
it was the complete super key support which I didn't realize how much that

47:13.700 --> 47:17.140
have bugged me until I tapped it and it worked and I went oh yeah that used to

47:17.140 --> 47:22.000
be a problem yeah oh that's that's huge for me too wow that yeah and and me you

47:22.000 --> 47:25.980
know that's not there by accident right but it's funny though because it's one

47:25.980 --> 47:28.780
of those things where it's not just touching one project to make that work

47:28.780 --> 47:33.500
right yeah I mean there are so many people that have been involved in making

47:33.500 --> 47:40.820
that happen so in earlier releases the Marte menu which used to be called the

47:40.820 --> 47:45.980
advanced menu in Marte tweak had super key support but it was like super key

47:45.980 --> 47:51.620
support in a lot of the smaller desktop environments and launches in that you

47:51.620 --> 47:57.140
could press super to open a menu but it swallowed the super key so if you had

47:57.140 --> 48:02.460
any other key bindings that used the super key they just didn't work out so

48:02.460 --> 48:09.660
Aiki obviously cooked up Budgie and then he Budgie the brisk menu for Marte yeah

48:09.660 --> 48:15.180
and we I added a goal in there to add super key support and somebody from the

48:15.180 --> 48:19.660
community stepped in Victor Carra I think his name is or Carra I'm sorry

48:19.660 --> 48:24.940
Victor if I've butchered your name and he actually landed the fixes in brisk to

48:24.940 --> 48:31.100
make it work but then he went around and started adding the same patches to the

48:31.100 --> 48:35.340
Marte menu and when he started doing that he realized that the underlying

48:35.340 --> 48:39.380
libraries weren't implemented properly and Marte settings demon wasn't doing

48:39.380 --> 48:44.060
the right thing and Marte doc applet wasn't doing the right thing so he has

48:44.060 --> 48:50.420
been laying down patches all over the place so that super key works but more

48:50.420 --> 48:56.060
importantly if you've got other key bindings they work as well and it sounds

48:56.060 --> 49:00.100
like such a simple thing but it's been a heap of work and I'm I'm really indebted

49:00.100 --> 49:07.300
to him because he's turned Marte from a thing that had kind of janky super key

49:07.300 --> 49:11.420
support to to real first-class super key support and it makes a huge difference

49:11.420 --> 49:16.780
to the way I use my computer now because I just mash super key type enter and I

49:16.780 --> 49:20.380
am off I think there's several more systems that will now be on this next

49:20.380 --> 49:23.920
release I think is a direct result I can't tell you to me it's like if for

49:23.920 --> 49:28.140
some reason it's muscle memory smash super key ter enter and that has to be

49:28.140 --> 49:33.380
smashed you know delicate nothing it's I'd command this thing okay so I know

49:33.380 --> 49:37.780
something else has been getting polished really for several releases is the

49:37.780 --> 49:41.100
heads-up display which was one of the really kind of cool features when I was

49:41.100 --> 49:45.660
using unity heavily I drifted away from using it but I do remember during my

49:45.660 --> 49:49.380
heyday of using unity 7 the HUD was handy and for those of you that aren't

49:49.380 --> 49:56.420
familiar I I think at least in the unity world essentially it was this tool that

49:56.420 --> 50:00.540
you could execute with a keyboard command and like alt super or whatever

50:00.540 --> 50:03.460
whatever I can't remember what the command was and I think just all okay

50:03.460 --> 50:07.300
alt and I think it talked D bus and it would read all of the menus on an

50:07.300 --> 50:11.140
application over D bus and then it would expose them as a command like so you

50:11.140 --> 50:16.580
could type in if you wanted to do file export you could just type in export

50:16.580 --> 50:18.940
into the HUD and it would just pull it up instead of having to dig around so

50:18.940 --> 50:23.540
you didn't have to take your hand off the keyboard to use the menus mm-hmm is

50:23.540 --> 50:27.300
it would be am I getting this right and is that what's coming or at least

50:27.300 --> 50:32.700
getting even better in Matei yeah so we we started that journey in Ubuntu Mate

50:32.700 --> 50:39.060
1610 and it was not ready so we we pulled it and in this cycle it's now

50:39.060 --> 50:45.420
ready for use so this works hand-in-glove with the global menus that have also

50:45.420 --> 50:50.700
been reworked and it means that yes just as you've described you can open your

50:50.700 --> 50:54.060
application and in in Ubuntu Mate it's a slightly different keyboard

50:54.060 --> 51:00.500
combination it's super alt to activate the HUD although Victor is determined he

51:00.500 --> 51:06.860
tells me to make the necessary changes throughout the various places so that

51:06.860 --> 51:11.220
you could activate it with just alt as well so he's he's like a dog with a bone

51:11.220 --> 51:15.080
at this at the moment chasing these issues down but this is a really

51:15.080 --> 51:19.060
powerful feature and it's one that I really valued what I obviously been

51:19.060 --> 51:24.180
using unity for quite a while on a day-to-day basis and have recently

51:24.180 --> 51:28.580
switched back to Marte on my main machine and one of the features I loved

51:28.580 --> 51:34.020
was the HUD particularly like editing podcasts and you're in audacity and you

51:34.020 --> 51:38.420
want to find the appropriate effects and filters using the HUD makes actually

51:38.420 --> 51:42.580
digging out those effects and filters really fast oh yeah and also in things

51:42.580 --> 51:46.940
like libre office and GIMP where you know image processing things are

51:46.940 --> 51:51.700
scattered to the four corners of the UI you know it's really useful for just

51:51.700 --> 51:55.540
quickly accessing stuff so I love that yeah yeah me too in fact I was just

51:55.540 --> 51:57.660
sitting here thinking about how handy that is when I'm on air cuz it makes

51:57.660 --> 52:02.380
things so friggin quick also improvements to indicator support which

52:02.380 --> 52:05.620
is something that seems like it's a lot of work on every release what is there

52:05.620 --> 52:12.180
still work to be done on indicators no we're done now this congrats yeah that

52:12.180 --> 52:16.580
is good just in time to really I mean this is yeah this is looking like one of

52:16.580 --> 52:19.980
those releases where if I was if I was really if I was really a big fan of

52:19.980 --> 52:24.620
unity and I wanted a home to move to that reminded me a lot of it and that

52:24.620 --> 52:29.020
workflow with the mate tweak tool you just it's like one drop down away you

52:29.020 --> 52:34.700
choose mutiny and also I turned on compass is my compositor and it it

52:34.700 --> 52:39.340
really felt a lot like home because we have a I was doing an AB test cuz I have

52:39.340 --> 52:43.180
a unity 7 system right here that I'm running mumble on to talk to you guys

52:43.180 --> 52:48.020
and so I ran it on the system right next to it my main presenter machine and was

52:48.020 --> 52:54.380
doing sort of an AB and it's it's pretty great it's close yeah it'll get closer

52:54.380 --> 52:58.460
in time as well but it's it's done without sacrificing some of the more

52:58.460 --> 53:03.660
traditional things about about a bunta mate that I liked so I it was a really

53:03.660 --> 53:06.620
it was a pretty salt I have to ask you that would be grave concern over this

53:06.620 --> 53:12.460
one grave concern okay Firefox 50 what is going on here can you just somebody I

53:12.460 --> 53:16.900
mean this is one of these 54 is out now this is one of those things who it could

53:16.900 --> 53:21.740
who it canonicals in charge of this this is just this this is what happens in the

53:21.740 --> 53:25.100
in the dev cycle you'll find that packages that are being revved you know

53:25.100 --> 53:34.460
regularly in the in the released it is your fault I tease I tease I install

53:34.460 --> 53:38.900
chrome immediately anyway so it's fine as does everyone else yeah yeah that

53:38.900 --> 53:45.860
software but yeah okay well that's what you know you're that user are you oh the

53:45.860 --> 53:49.980
best browser ever I was gonna give it a go but it was it was it was so old I was

53:49.980 --> 53:53.780
like why does this feel so slow like Firefox has gotten fat oh oh that's what

53:53.780 --> 53:56.340
so then I just you know what here's my tip for you

53:56.340 --> 54:02.260
Ubuntu dash but a dash welcome space tack be you hit that right boom software

54:02.260 --> 54:05.820
boutique flies right open cue up a couple of things and you go to the main

54:05.820 --> 54:09.300
screen the new I like that cue animation that it does there's like there's like

54:09.300 --> 54:15.020
a yeah there's like it's just tops it really is like I I opened up I knew I

54:15.020 --> 54:19.700
went in there I saw the internet section there was chromium there was a brave did

54:19.700 --> 54:23.620
fail to install a live bug report there but I figure that probably that'll

54:23.620 --> 54:28.020
probably work later on I do want to give brave ago mm-hmm and then and then I use

54:28.020 --> 54:33.500
that a lot now really are you liking it yeah I it's the only browser I use on my

54:33.500 --> 54:38.780
phone and I'm using it about 50% of the time on my desktop now huh all right I'm

54:38.780 --> 54:41.900
gonna give it a go come back to there's anybody to some that they remove ads

54:41.900 --> 54:47.860
from specific websites and put their own ads in no I like that feature why

54:47.860 --> 54:52.620
because it removes all of the privacy invading ads and replaces them with

54:52.620 --> 54:58.900
sanitized versions hmm so people don't worry about the privacy guarding you

54:58.900 --> 55:03.260
know capabilities getting rid of all sorts of stuff that's buried in pages

55:03.260 --> 55:06.940
that you you really don't want so there's no need for things like privacy

55:06.940 --> 55:11.740
badger and stuff like that yeah but then there's all of the idea that the ads

55:11.740 --> 55:15.100
being put in are their ads and not the people who you're going to the website

55:15.100 --> 55:18.620
for and they don't get anything for it yeah I've signed up to their scheme to

55:18.620 --> 55:27.740
pay pay back the money to the sites that I want to support right hmm yeah that

55:27.740 --> 55:30.300
scheme that sounds interesting it's almost like they thought about this

55:30.300 --> 55:35.700
before they implemented it the browsers of today are broken they've been

55:35.700 --> 55:40.580
overtaken by a barrage of sneaky and annoying ads trackers that follow your

55:40.580 --> 55:44.460
habits and cookies that build profiles and all sorts of other internet clutter

55:44.460 --> 55:48.660
that's taking precedence over the content that you want to see in fact

55:48.660 --> 55:53.700
these useless bites can take up to a whopping 50% of page load times with a

55:53.700 --> 55:59.860
third of it anxiously trying to learn more about you to make matters worse

55:59.860 --> 56:03.740
some ad blockers are even letting the ads through and large advertisers pay

56:03.740 --> 56:08.860
them but do you really want a leaky ad blocker it's because of these very

56:08.860 --> 56:12.900
reasons that we developed brave a new browser that kicks internet crud to the

56:12.900 --> 56:17.100
curb and makes it faster safer and better to surf the web than your

56:17.100 --> 56:19.540
current browser

56:19.820 --> 56:24.580
with brave everything you need is built right in

56:24.580 --> 56:30.060
we integrated technology that automatically blocks trackers annoying

56:30.060 --> 56:33.580
ads and shields everything that can cramp your style and destruct your

56:33.580 --> 56:37.860
privacy wow I don't want you can expect increased speeds nearly two times faster

56:37.860 --> 56:43.100
on laptops and up to four times faster on mobile so there you go that's the

56:43.100 --> 56:47.940
pitch on brave it's it's a Mozilla project so that's you know sort of

56:47.940 --> 56:52.060
interesting it's not no it's not it's the guy from Moses the founders of

56:52.060 --> 56:58.500
Mozilla founded this okay I see that was the confusion so is it web kit based

56:58.500 --> 57:05.100
then yes I think it's linked it's a bit more complex than that but yes

57:05.100 --> 57:09.580
essentially well now I'm like I'm like half as excited but I'll still get with

57:09.580 --> 57:13.100
a go I was way more excited when I thought it was Mozilla realizing that

57:13.100 --> 57:15.580
the Firefox was dead and they were starting a new product and that they

57:15.580 --> 57:19.820
were gonna revitalize gecko and a new more competitive browser but now that's

57:19.820 --> 57:23.260
what they're already doing the Firefox though yeah that's what the web

57:23.260 --> 57:27.980
extensions are for that's what servos for yeah yeah yeah and web extensions

57:27.980 --> 57:32.820
are coming in three releases like they're gonna be like the the main thing

57:32.820 --> 57:36.300
in three releases right now you can already use them and they've already got

57:36.300 --> 57:40.500
electrolysis out and all this other stuff it's good yeah you should use

57:40.500 --> 57:46.580
Firefox already has all these things Chrome you know I really am so I'm so

57:46.580 --> 57:49.620
depressed about this topic I don't think I want to talk about it much check out

57:49.620 --> 57:55.340
Linux action news 11 I mean we covered a story it's just it's devastating

57:55.340 --> 58:02.220
devastating for Firefox it's just so sad it's so sad and there's just nothing

58:02.220 --> 58:05.820
they can do about it because it's you know and I make this I make this pitch a

58:05.820 --> 58:10.300
lot here on the show but as open source enthusiasts we are a particular kind of

58:10.300 --> 58:14.500
techie crowd and we are particularly susceptible to getting into arguments

58:14.500 --> 58:21.180
about things on their technical merits and we are less capable often I don't

58:21.180 --> 58:24.820
know I'm trying to put this nicer but we are less likely to have a better

58:24.820 --> 58:29.820
understanding of market dynamics and the market dynamics are such that a monopoly

58:29.820 --> 58:34.540
in search and in web services is contributing billions of dollars worth

58:34.540 --> 58:40.420
of advertising space ie the top of YouTube Google search Gmail calendar

58:40.420 --> 58:47.180
all the Google's premier products if you are not running Chrome constantly nag you

58:47.180 --> 58:51.340
to upgrade to Chrome and that's the terminology they use is upgrade to Chrome

58:51.340 --> 58:54.660
and they do Google Google Docs works better offline if you upgrade to Chrome

58:54.660 --> 58:57.980
Google Calendar works offline if you upgrade to Chrome having problems

58:57.980 --> 59:00.500
watching this video this is why I've seen this one on YouTube are you having

59:00.500 --> 59:04.020
problems watching this video try upgrading to Chrome can you imagine how

59:04.020 --> 59:07.180
many users must fall for that that's interesting see I use Firefox to work

59:07.180 --> 59:10.420
but I don't I only use it really for like for working so I don't watch

59:10.420 --> 59:13.660
YouTube I don't check my personal email or any of those so I don't see that

59:13.660 --> 59:17.340
that's it's literally invaluable ad space because Google doesn't sell that

59:17.340 --> 59:24.540
to any Adsense customer only and and the thing is is that Firefox isn't

59:24.540 --> 59:29.860
competing against Internet Explorer anymore mm-hmm when when Firefox was

59:29.860 --> 59:35.100
truly taking over they were being innovative and competitive in a way that

59:35.100 --> 59:42.380
the consumer base was hungry for the issue is is that like the beard just

59:42.380 --> 59:47.300
jokingly said oh that's nice you know it also has that is Chrome Google has not

59:47.300 --> 59:50.980
stood still at all they are not the stagnant monopoly that Internet Explorer

59:50.980 --> 59:57.460
was they are hungry as hell to shape the web and they are moving at a breakneck

59:57.460 --> 01:00:03.660
pace continuing to outpace Firefox and finally say that Firefox's release

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:07.460
schedule is fast know what I just mean is in oh I'm sorry I mean they're

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:11.340
continuing to get more users to like they're they're they're down velocity

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:14.780
yeah their momentum with their momentum is continuing to grow and they're

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:18.420
continuing to develop the product like it's it's just not the same not like

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:22.140
what IE was right yeah exactly they have a vested interest in getting as many

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:27.620
users as possible so it's just you know it's just a plus Firefox had a had a had

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:32.420
a had an unlikely ally in the US justice system which was beating

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:36.700
Microsoft over the head about bundling IE which slowed things down yeah I mean

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.820
it's it's harder the the argument between Chrome and Firefox is really

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:43.980
hard because both are very good browsers to use and it's purely a technical

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:48.260
aspect that but see brave would be new and shiny and a chance at new branding

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:51.740
and I mean look at the attention Braves getting already like if this was a

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.540
Mozilla project they're only getting attention because of the ad thing if

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:58.380
most if Firefox did the same thing and added an ad thing it would be the same

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:06.540
effect well there is a big problem with Braves though it doesn't work on porn

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:11.540
sites that's the big problem oh really why is that everything just is black

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:18.060
because it blocks everything so I'm told right these websites my friends that

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:22.580
tell me I know a lot of unsavory characters use brain for that's what

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:26.460
Firefox focus is for well maybe they'll just start working in 2022 when these

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:30.940
drop flash okay hold on I'd actually now this works so you use brave for

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:41.940
everything else and you use focus for porn and oh wow hey so I guess a flash

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:45.660
flash update again another real-time update here on the show breaking news

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:50.060
mr. wimpy reports that brave is now installable via the software boutique

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:54.900
good job with me that was like you're welcome so there's a bit of a patreon

01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:59.420
leak rumors are spreading and you know I just I wanted to give you an

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:03.300
opportunity to address the rampant speculation that the Ubuntu matei

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:07.180
project is moving to github that just seems seems like that's just rampant

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:11.500
speculation yeah we have in fact we've moved all of our projects to github

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:18.020
wow we're integrated to the max now we've also got slack going for the core

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:23.380
team and we're expanding the team quite considerably so at the moment we've got

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:27.580
Etienne who's come in he's been doing good work behind the scenes for some

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:32.540
time and he's now heading up the QA team and there and whilst I'm here having an

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:37.460
evening of podcasting they're busy doing the ISO testing for the new release

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:41.780
thank you so really good yeah we've got a lot of improvements that streamline

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:45.340
our processes and there'll be more tooling just coming along just to make

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:49.140
sure I'm clear though this means the project is essentially migrating from

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:55.020
launchpad right we have moved the few packages that we were maintaining on

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.500
launchpad to github and that isn't required to be a flavor to be on

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:02.900
launchpad well we need to have our bug tracker on launchpad and what have you

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:07.260
and that's still there okay you know so that's more about if there's a bug

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:11.660
reported we're able to close the bug by uploading new package directly in

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:16.100
launchpad but in terms of source code hosting that's all on github now that

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:20.660
makes plus there's also the mirroring to launchpad thing no we've we've just

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:25.100
exported everything to github the only thing that we've left on launchpad are

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.940
the seeds because they have to be there and do you do you suppose that this

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:33.580
might lead to more more contributors to the project people that me that's yeah

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:38.420
yeah without a doubt we've already seen it with the day after we migrated we

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:41.460
just dumped you know just might run a load of migration scripts and moved

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:45.820
everything over and we knew there was a load of like URLs and things that needed

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:50.420
changing in the code before we could repackage them and the next morning

01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.420
there was a load of pull requests where people had just come in and changed all

01:03:53.420 --> 01:04:01.300
of those URLs for us and that's the github effect right so yeah you know

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:05.660
open source code hosting and all the rest of it github is where most of the

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:10.660
eyeballs are and you get more drive-by commits there it's as simple as that

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:15.340
yeah it makes sense that does and if they if it leads to more open source it

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:18.340
seems to me a net to be a good thing and if it leads to more people writing

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:22.180
open source then in that it's a good thing this seems would be like it's oh

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:26.740
go ahead I was just gonna say it's it's so much better now that it's on github

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:30.820
because it's a lot easier to just do a pretty much everything because like just

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:34.860
by creating a launchpad account and trying to commit to a contribute to a

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:39.060
project is so difficult that most people just give up I've had an account with

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:46.340
launchpad for I don't know like ten years I think I've used it maybe yeah

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:50.300
okay so this is just my impression I'm not saying this is wimpy's position but

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:56.380
to me what looking at this alpha I mean it's a freaking alpha it first of all I

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:59.860
don't really I don't know it's so damned it's to feel so damn ready I it sort of

01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:04.140
blows my mind but this feels like this is the release it's really like this is

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:08.620
ready for the masses it's ready for people look at unity refugees I mean

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:12.860
this really feels like it's polished to the next level for this desktop release

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:19.740
yeah so it has been a ton of work it's been three months we literally started

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:24.780
working on this the day after 1704 was released we were the first people to

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:33.220
commit anything to 1717 awesome and it's been late nights and long nights for

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:38.880
three months and we've pretty much landed at this point everything that we

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:43.460
wanted to get on the desktop for the final release that's three months from

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:50.420
now so we're done in terms of features except we've got another three months so

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:54.300
now we're going to go and circle back to something so you will you will have heard

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:58.660
the news about our new software boutique which is not in this release it's the

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:04.460
old one slightly refreshed so now work will start on finishing up the new

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:08.460
software boutique and there's a few other little skunk work projects that

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:12.740
some of the other project they're helping us with and they should trickle

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:18.220
along between now and October so we're kind of done with the desktop and now

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:21.420
we're going to really start adding some more polish and improvements on top of

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:25.300
what we've got here that's a good position to be here that's going to make

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:29.820
for a this release so it sounds so damn good you should have saved it for the LTS

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:35.740
no kidding I guess this is just we're one step away right so I've not been

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:40.020
doing you know the flavors in a bunty for very long but I have done one LTS

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:45.740
before and I remember what it was like when we were making 1510 and then the

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:51.980
effort that was involved to get 10 to 1604 yeah and that was hard work and I

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:59.500
realized that really 1710 needs to be your 1804 and then it's all about

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:04.620
improving the quality and the stability in that 1804 cycle that's landing those

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:09.940
last few features but really making sure it's solid yeah totally that is that's

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:13.180
gonna make for a good song and we're well ahead of where we wanted to be

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:19.380
because this time last year we were transitioning from GTK 2 to GTK 3 and I

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:24.580
had originally planned we would finish that GTK 3 transition about now about

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:31.100
this time but we finished that last October so we we got like a cycle ahead

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:36.820
of ourselves so I'm really an Ubuntu Marte now is really starting to be the

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:43.540
desktop platform that I wanted to use because simple things like super key and

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:47.820
and the HUD and global menus I don't use the global menus myself but I know lots

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:51.300
of people like those these were all things that were niggling at me that I

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:55.380
knew weren't quite right and it wasn't perfect and it's really feeling like

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:58.880
it's falling into place now and it's all coming together and the indicator

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:03.180
support it's got the same indicators that you'd expect to find in Unity 7 so

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:07.260
everything that you'd expect to find in a unity desktop you'll find here now so

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:11.100
I'm really pleased with how it's shaping up yeah it really comes through as a

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:15.300
great release just even trying out the the latest that I got the daily build

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:19.500
and it was it was pretty great if you you know if you want to know about this

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:24.780
stuff first the people who support the Ubuntu Mate project learn about it from

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:32.060
the horses fingers I guess patreon.com slash Ubuntu underscore Mate I'll have a

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:35.540
link in the show notes too if you want to support the project not only do you

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:40.260
get news but you help help the news keep on coming yeah there is there's a poll

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:43.780
over there right now about which video player should be the default in Ubuntu

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:49.260
Mate obviously it should be GnomeMPV it is the greatest just saying with in my

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:55.100
humble opinion I completely agree well when we voted let me go yes yes I did

01:08:55.100 --> 01:09:00.620
yes I did good yeah yes we need more GnomeMPV needs more love it's such a

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:06.060
team GnomeMPV yeah it is a great media player and it's somebody who does a lot

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:12.940
of media editing and work and then also uses that really pushes it for unfilter

01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:17.580
it's just such MPV such a great tool are you saying GnomeMPV or just MPV well

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:20.420
MPV in general and if you're gonna use GnomeMPV if you're gonna use a

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:24.660
wrapper around it GnomeMPV is the way to go it really is great okay I was just

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:28.740
wondering like is it I've always never noticed the reason why would somebody

01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:32.940
want to use GnomeMPV versus MPV like it's just you could just right-click

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:36.700
and load the video with MPV so I'm just curious if the I could tell you why I

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:42.340
because I'll go ahead with me well I was gonna say I like it because it adds the

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:48.300
typical interfaces to manipulate it that you'd expect to be there yeah the users

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:53.700
doesn't feel like an odd duck right but I like it because so I use it exclusively

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:58.660
to play back all of the crazy types of file formats we have for unfilter clips

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:03.260
it's just a whole range that we get stuff in whatever you can real player I

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:06.700
mean I'm telling you it's a whole range and then that's an MPV thing right right

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:10.340
no I know but let me just say so the nice thing about GnomeMPV is it gives

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:15.780
you a super clean minimal but always available play bar indicator pause

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:21.320
button I can only see where the play position is and it is one of the it's

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:26.540
probably one of the best designed gnomes in the sense that it's almost nothing to

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:30.700
it except for just barely what you need and it's just enough that I can look

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:33.700
down I know exactly where it's at play wise and if I want to go full screen

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:37.340
it's like f11 or you know a click away or whatever it is so it's kind of like a

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:41.480
perfect balance for me in that sense so I guess it's more like it's a user in

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.540
our user experience is easier to get you because you don't have to learn all the

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:48.740
specific shortcuts that MPV there's that and it's like I while I'm playing

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:53.820
something on the stream I can't keep putting my mouse over the video to see

01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:56.420
where the play positions that have that display over the video because that's

01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:00.580
tacky so having it just below the video where I can still see where the play

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.820
positions at but don't have to show anything on screen makes for a better

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:07.500
presentation okay I understand there's always weird you know use cases I always

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:10.580
have a weird one so it's very much a tool it's where it's regular MPV works

01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:14.100
great if I'm gonna put on some you know MP MPV file and just watch it for an

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.820
hour yeah like if I'm gonna do a live stream I just MPV and then the URL I

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:21.340
don't bother with dome MPV like if it's because and there's really MPV I in my

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:25.740
opinion has done such a good job at giving you information that is readable

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:29.140
on the command line output when you use it from the command line that even if

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:32.420
you're not like a pro user you can see like it's trying to fix it'll try to

01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:35.980
fix a video and audio sync for you and tell you what it offsets it's using like

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:40.500
it's just brilliant there's another thing that I found in recently MPV does

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:45.460
that a lot of people don't you think that they would do this but you can take

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:51.340
videos that are like awkwardly slowed down or have weird cropping issues and

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.620
you can like resume and recrop I use that all the time automatically yeah I

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:58.620
use all the time yeah that's really nice VLC is a great tool as well we do use

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:02.180
that in production here at studio but you know if I could only have I'm on an

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:06.940
island and I can only have one package MPV or no MPV all the way mm-hmm it's

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:10.380
it's so great all right so I there's a couple more things I want to talk about

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:13.980
before we wrap up for the day and we also have I think we have I think we're

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.380
gonna get some more Alex cute info out of Simon in the post show yeah more to

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:20.460
come a more to come but I want to take a moment and I want to talk about

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:23.100
something else I take on that desert island with me and that's the Linux

01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:27.380

Linux Academy comm slash unplug a platform by Linux I'll say it again a

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:40.220
platform a platform you see I got a little pop there a little bit a platform

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:44.100
by Linux enthusiasts for Linux enthusiasts people that wanted to spread

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:47.540
the adoption of Linux and kind of began to think about this project from there

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:51.460
then got together with real-world educators people with experience

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:56.180
developers that came together as a group like a holy trinity you might say I mean

01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:59.980
they probably wouldn't say that but I might say that of Linux education and

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:03.460
they built a system they started and they started in a reasonable like

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:07.580
approachable like actually accomplishable product and then it just

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:11.700
took off like wildfire and they've been able to grow it and it just adds so much

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.620
value to the platform if you've been a subscriber now for like a year you've

01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:17.940
just seen it take off like nuts self-paced in-depth video courses

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:21.980
hands-on scenario based labs to give you real experience on servers you get to

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.780
SSH into those bad boys and use them like you really would and man is that

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.660
nice because it gives you confidence to actually work with the stuff oh you're

01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:32.100
busy yeah I know about that they have a course schedule that worked with your

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:36.180
busy time to make it all fit in there they have learning paths too if you just

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:40.140
want to go into a specific career track maybe you've got some type of type of

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:43.740
certain mind well they also have courses created specifically to prepare you for

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:48.300
that they also have a vibrant community that's packed full of Jupiter broadcasting

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.900
members and study tools that you can download offline and take with you and

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.700
iOS and Android apps if you have some downtime and want to do a little study

in and I think probably you know I gotta say my favorite feature is the human

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:13.340
beings the instructor mentoring like the actual help because that's that's really

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:16.620
what takes them up to the next level because instead of just throwing on

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:21.020
Linux as a feature that they have as well as plumbing and Adobe After Effects

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:24.260
and Final Cut oh and then they have your Linux stuff over here and your

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.380
developer stuff because you got to have those checkboxes you got to check those

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:31.660
boxes then they're not gonna have anybody passionate about that stuff in

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.180
their company that's not like their core focus that's not what their missions

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:38.220
about so Linux Academy they focus on Linux open source and all the stuff

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:42.580
around it which means they can hire people professionally well not just

01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:45.660
professionally trained but passionate yeah passionate about it means you can

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.300
count on them that you know they know what they're doing and if you get stuck

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:51.580
or you know it just sometimes you need two or three different ways of hearing

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:54.780
something to learn it the other way that the other way that it manifests

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:57.780
itself in a way that is valuable to customers is that since they're

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:01.420
following trends because they're enthusiasts they they're on to stuff

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.980
that is valuable like when containerization started becoming a

01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:08.140
thing Linux Academy was having court it was having the best courseware on it and

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:11.980
the stuff like you could immediately go and apply to a job kind of stuff really

and it got me missing gnome already and it was from a metanova over in the

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:30.980
unplugged subreddit Linux unplug dot reddit comm and he says greetings

01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:34.260
unplugged I recently have made the switch back to arch and gnome 3 and for

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:38.420
the most part I'm pretty happy with the switch however I'm distracted easily huh

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:43.980
what would you say oh I'm sorry you distracted you weren't listening and so

01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:47.540
I try to do my best to adapt my desktop environment to account for this my

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:52.700
biggest problem with gnome or good gnome as you say is that the activities window

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:56.740
overview is really disorienting for me I use dash to dock for switching windows

01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:59.740
but I still have problems when I open the overview to launch applications

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:03.700
seeing every single window I have whoosh onto the screen is really distracting it

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:06.140
can really knock me out of my flow well I could see that like you know your

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.780
telegram window comes up and you see you got a shit ton of chats that you haven't

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:15.140
answered in 15 minutes or with slack or the IRC or your email what was that oh

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:18.740
the easiest solution to this problem is to use another application launcher like

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:22.060
no I'm doing anyways it goes through his goals here to sort of make gnome a less

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:26.420
distracting UI and I it dawned on me that this was the problem I ran into when I

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:29.900
switched to plasma for a while is that there was just so many things for me to

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:33.940
play with widgets that tell me my CPU stuff and my new messages and there's

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:38.220
different ways to set up the panels a ton yeah he's doing he's doing a plea

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:41.720
for help he says does anyone in the unplugged family to fam the unplugged

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:46.140
fam know about this is there an extension I'm missing I like that

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:50.020
alternatively if anyone here is familiar with developing gnome extensions

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:52.820
creating extensions that hides window previews and activities etc it'd be

01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:55.540
greatly appreciated ultimately I'm looking for an activities

01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:01.060
tweaker or other ideas and experiences that the audience has had and we have a

01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:06.540
link to metanova's thread if you want to toss in there what about us are you do

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:10.060
suffer because you you probably get in cut type of work that requires that you

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:14.140
get into a flow and maintain that flow for a while do you suffer from

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:20.740
distracted UI you know thankfully not especially not on on gnome I don't

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:25.420
usually you know if I if I am even using dash to dock it's hidden so there's

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.780
always the problem of notifications but that's you know usually a per app thing

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:32.300
so as long as I'm you know divide my screen in half I got a terminal I have a

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:36.620
web browser I can get in the groove hmm but I do know you mean like playing with

01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:39.460
plasma in the past especially for me when it might be something that like

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:43.420
I've been using it over ages now so it might just be used to anything that

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:45.940
would have distracted me as a new user I think that's probably part of it

01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:49.380
ww you seem like a nice rational gentleman do you have the problem of

01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:57.420
distracting UI right now no not really cuz and like I don't have any like any

01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:01.900
background wallpaper forget about asking me for what's it look cool because I

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:08.420
have a billion windows up I have tabs yeah so tabs is pretty much my life

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:16.020
yeah I know what the beard solution is full screen all the things oh yeah if you

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:18.980
just run everything full screen then you can only look at one thing at a time I

01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:22.340
don't have we ever talked about that the fact that you're a full screen maniac I

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:26.740
don't think so he's all in on the full screen every app I have is full screen

01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:30.780
yeah I have like 20 to 30 apps oh yeah and then you know Chris ever a split and

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:34.160
and then like my browser that has 200 tabs yeah so I can only ever see one

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.540
thing at a time so I'm never distracted that is a it's an intense way to

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:42.260
operate but you do seem to make it work for you for me like I get claustrophobic

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:46.180
in that setup like I'm like I gotta I gotta be able to like I need an overview

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:49.260
and all I need windows that's for me I need to be able to move stuff around I

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:52.860
just oh yeah see I agree with architect if you can see your background you're

01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:57.540
just being lazy all right that's it that's not a bad note to end it on I'll

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:00.300
just I just want to talk really quickly then about this journey that I'm

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:04.100
starting it's it's fun for me and I won't go on and on about it so I put it

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:06.700
at the end of the show but it's something it's different for me

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:11.180
personally with my Linux use in a long time is I'm I'm making I've talked about

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:14.180
this on user a little bit so I'll just give you the cliff notes I'm switching

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:20.540
away from Antigros and arch love arch I think it's a great great great desktop

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:27.340
workstation OS super stable despite what all the haters say Antigros has been

01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:31.060
difficult for me recently and they it's a good project it's a great way to get

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:36.340
your hands on but I just have I just constantly having package

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.420
keys package key problems that prevent me from updating my system and it's only

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:44.620
about a five minute fix each time but it happens about once a month now and when

01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:47.900
you multiply that across like five systems it gets frustrating and it's

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:52.420
even the same commands to fix it and all that stuff but it just feels like well I

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:57.640
don't want it I like the project a lot but it's it's just what happens is is it

01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:01.420
makes me skip updating which is that only makes it worse that's when you

01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:04.820
start going down a slippery slope with arch and you start you start not

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:07.700
updating and you start running into problems so it's kind of changes the

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:10.660
value proposition for the whole thing in some ways the other thing that's been a

01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:19.020
big change for me is post Linux action show I don't do desktop app pics and a

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:23.540
project spotlight and a distribution pic like I don't have the pics and so I

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:28.580
don't have to try out so the pics look we talked about one app that week but

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:32.660
we tried five or six other ones other contenders so it means installing five

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:36.140
or six or seven or eight or sometimes ten different things to try out which

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:39.140
one really works and which one is generally available to the audience and

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:44.140
applicable and the AUR was just a slam dunk if you want to try out all the

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:49.180
different yeah it's always there and so it made it it literally made it was

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:52.100
part of my workflow you know go into the AUR find the application try it out

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:57.080
review it for the show probably uninstall it maybe not and that will you

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:01.500
know rinse repeat every single week and now I don't really have like I've kind

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:04.620
of have my stable set of applications I use I'm just getting my work done now

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:10.100
I'm not I'm not like sitting there trying to find new stuff constantly and I

01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:13.320
don't know so it's changed it's changed what I need from my distributions

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.660
package manager to write and I would say like when you first switched to arch you

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:20.640
know snaps were not flat pack they're not in the place that they used they

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.500
aren't they weren't even a thing yeah so you have a lot more options even on you

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:27.140
know it wasn't a thing yeah right so there's also that's the other thing is

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:31.380
is there's like I was experimenting with solace and there was software I wanted

01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:34.580
that wasn't available I was like oh yeah talker mm-hmm and I'm gonna have a whole

01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:38.420
system running if you want one of the things that so it's funny cuz now I'm on

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:42.540
the other end of this one of the things that's that's true is for me is I don't

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:46.220
I wonder if it tells me right here I don't I don't make it a priority to

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:53.660
update yeah so there's 231 package updates for the OBS machine I don't make

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:58.300
it a practice to constantly upgrade the OBS machine because that makes a

01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:02.340
production machine less reliable I need newer versions of everything underlying

01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:07.300
OBS and I need newest versions of OBS but I don't need my gnome shell to

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:12.660
change I don't really need my new tools to change my kernel updates unless you

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:15.460
know except for security I don't I mean everything's working as it is in fact we

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:20.420
have some customized drivers for these capture cards so an LTS is starting to

01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:23.500
make a lot more sense to me than it used to you're just gonna make Noah's day

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:27.380
aren't you you're making the what I like to call the Rekai to Noah transition

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:31.820
yeah right exactly how so well cuz I like the bleeding edge of everything and

01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:35.220
Noah likes the LTS so you're making the transition from one to the other yeah I

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:38.460
don't see this it makes sense on the production equipment but it sounds

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:41.860
boring snot for my desktop it just really it's like it sounds like it's

01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:46.820
sucking some of the fun out of using Linux but I think you're also some maybe

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:50.260
in a place where you're very busy and you're doing a lot more content

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:53.900
production yeah that makes it this is what I was thinking too I mean you can

01:22:53.900 --> 01:23:00.740
always leave have you heard of the Church of neon oh you know I that's so

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:03.380
that's the other that's the other wrinkle isn't it because you've we've

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:12.620
got we've got a true blue gnome desktop coming from Ubuntu very soon and I'm

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:16.940
very interested in that we just talked about the super slick snot stuff in

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:22.020
Ubuntu Mate that really makes it a contender then you you do have the

01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:29.140
plasma desktop as well I just like the whole field is open to me again I feel

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:32.700
myself I'm beginning to distro hop in a way that I haven't done for two and a

01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:36.740
half two and a half three years so I've I've been trying out right now I've been

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:40.020
trying out mostly Ubuntu based stuff because I keep thinking if I'm gonna go

01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:44.060
this route it seems like I should probably rebase on Ubuntu but there's

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:47.500
like this I key on my shoulder that keeps talking about all the cool shit

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.620
that solace is doing about how clear boot manager would be great for us for

01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:54.540
you some production here and and then fedoras got this fedora workstation OS

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:58.980
tree release that they're working on and I'm like oh my goodness so many good

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:02.020
options it's it's it's so much harder than it ever has been to pick a

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:06.140
distribution right now and then Rika is saying slackware off in the corner you're

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:09.580
so that's why I was gonna do a slackware challenge but I'm right in the middle I'm

01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:13.900
in the throes of this like my guess is Chris is gonna he's not gonna be able to

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:18.380
decide and he's gonna compromise and end up on a boot to budgie there we go well

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:21.380
that's reasonable what do you think bashful that might be a good way to go

01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:32.660
huh yeah I'm kind of a little one-sided on this you use it as a dick you could

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:37.620
speak from as a from the perspective of a daily user over there you get you get

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:40.700
you get your work done every single day right and you're running you're running

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:45.540
it on the last release right now I don't know but I mean you're using it every

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:50.220
day as a daily driver yeah I'm running 1704 and I'm actually running it at work

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:54.420
too so and that's over a remote session as well and I haven't really had any

01:24:54.420 --> 01:25:00.380
issues with it at all I got it another option is nitricks good callback good

01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:08.900
callback nitricks I see budgie is a great desktop but it's so why would I

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:11.620
switch to that just so that way I can switch again in a year or whatever like

01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:15.020
I don't know yeah but you're gonna run into that with almost any destroy you

01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:19.260
pop in if you're not entirely happy no I just I just mean like that I think that

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:22.260
desktops gonna be going through a transition where right now it seems like

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:26.620
the time to you know get in on gnome 3 if things are shaping up like Mike Mike

01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:30.060
Mike when's the last time we crashed it's been it's been like two weeks right

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:33.660
since we've had a gnome 3 crash yeah so the last time the last round of updates

01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:38.900
I did manage to apply did seem to improve stability so that's good yeah

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:43.060
until the next issue crops well there's that there is that yeah so anyways my

01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:47.060
distro my distro hopping ways have returned like it and of course it's

01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:50.660
happening fun it has to be happening right around the 1710 release cycle too

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:56.540
so and you know you say that that that's a reason not to use budgie but don't you

01:25:56.540 --> 01:26:00.180
think that gnome is probably about to go through a huge transition as well no I

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:05.260
think GTK 4 is gonna be more evolutionary well I was more talking

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:09.860
about the effect that Ubuntu might have on gnome oh boy well so far I like all

01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:14.700
those effects I gotta say I mean I'm really this is this is the thing is what

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.900
I was trying to boom to mate and I rebooted this system like I realized as

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:23.060
I was hitting the restart button like I really like gnome like I really like

01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:27.420
gnome 3 it's really good it's just I don't like it when it runs like dog poo

01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:30.420
and crashes a lot but other than that I really like alright Chris you can run

01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:34.300
gnome on your desktop upstairs and then down here in the studio we'll run Katie

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:37.540
everywhere well okay so if you're gonna go this is then we can have both then

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:40.060
we can wrap this up we got it we got a move we got to wrap it up for the day

01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:45.300
but if just just if you take it to its practical logical conclusion why not go

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:53.140
Ubuntu LTS with unity 7 because this is this is a seriously this other than the

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.900
few problems we've had with the sound interface this this this mobile system

01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:02.260
that's running unity 7 and Ubuntu is like 100% yeah yeah and I guess by the

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:06.100
time that it's end of life will probably have moved on to something else and

01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:10.660
we've even done a couple of update batches on this thing so it's managed to

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:15.460
take its updates and not shit the bed and it runs until we have some cocky

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:20.940
many reason to reboot it and I mean it's just been rock-solid and unity 7 opens

01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:25.180
windows real nice it has nice like borders to grab my windows to resize

01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:29.580
them all the things I like about a desktop maybe 87 on some stuff too it

01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:34.180
does randomly inexplicably spin up our GPU though that is true that did start

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:36.940
happening that did start happening I've been getting a lot of crap for saying

01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:40.740
nice things about unity people are really angry that all of a sudden I have

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:43.900
positive things to say about unity now that it's end of life and it's I think

01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:47.460
it's I think it's funny because if you look at the the majority of the

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:52.940
community that the transition has been much more positive for unity now that

01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:56.340
things like all of the features that unity had that people didn't even know

01:27:56.340 --> 01:28:00.740
existed they're going oh wow that's great you know too bad unity's dead now

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:04.260
like well yeah good job yeah but those same people just you know a couple

01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:07.300
months ago we're crapping on unity because why is it moved to do in their

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:12.220
own of course anti canonical rhetoric yeah just this is the canonical hate and

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:16.460
then that's I don't I never understood then and I always they're always pointed

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:20.540
out how unity has a lot of cool features and now that it's gone it's kind of it's

01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:24.540
kind of sad in a way it's still there like it's a saying it's like no that's

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:27.700
gonna mean I mean as far as like the innovation is all dead like the fact

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:31.360
that the HUD the concept of the HUD is just being is was abandoned and then

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.780
people and other people were trying to like rebuild everything and bring back

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:39.620
the global menu and like what the global menu has like every single gold menu

01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:44.100
implementation so far has these weird massive holes like the CSDs don't work

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:52.940
and well I'm kind of not in a bunch of math a 1710 might drop canonical will

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:57.620
bring some of those improvements to know and make it a desktop that I like

01:28:57.620 --> 01:29:01.940
more because I don't really like no right now yeah yeah that's I am not

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:06.740
ruling out plasma either so it's supposedly not changing that much except

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:10.580
for like already made extensions well initially but who knows what they're

01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:16.780
gonna do down the road I think it's I think it's I think it's too obvious I

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:21.960
think it's not about it's not about changing the direction of gnome because

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:26.600
that's sort of the whole point of making this switch was to not have to to be

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:30.860
that to be that to be that player now you're now the idea is you ride with

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:36.800
upstream and you can spend your time fixing so we got to go we let Dan know

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:42.020
we're just gonna be five minutes so here's the thing the hard stuff isn't

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.980
getting done in open source and a lot of us know it a lot of us know that the

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:49.780
stuff that's really really tough to fix requires people that are working in

01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:53.660
teams that have a coordinated development standards practice that maybe

01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:56.700
have a PMO that's managing the things they're working on and telling them

01:29:56.700 --> 01:30:01.020
instead of them choosing by what happens to fit their fancy the really hard stuff

01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:04.620
is they underline stuff like the hundreds of bugs and Bluetooth and

01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:09.180
things like that that require a real development focus and team to work on

01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:14.220
them and that's an area where canonical can really and is already adding a ton

01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:20.220
of value without having to fork the file manager or anything like that and I think

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:24.620
that is fundamentally going to be the long long term impact to the gnome

01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:29.820
desktop isn't so much about them dictating the design future of gnome 3

01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:34.700
but more about letting the gnome project make a great desktop making

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:38.420
modifications via the extension systems where it's appropriate and working on

01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:42.380
the underlying underpinning stuff that makes using like a Bluetooth speaker

01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:46.500
with your Linux box actually usable and that's I think going to be the big

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:52.820
benefit end of rant there's just a quickie well I I agree with that but I

01:30:52.820 --> 01:31:00.940
also think that the fact that Ubuntu is settling on gnome now lets you work

01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:06.180
better with upstream while also making changes so it's more like it's not

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:09.300
necessarily you're changing the direction of gnome it's you're just

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:13.060
helping improve the gnome experience right which is I think what was why some

01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:16.900
people it's though some of the unity haters didn't like unity yeah is the

01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:22.580
mixed resources thing oh we got a we got a fire fair unity 7 was way unity itself

01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:28.300
was way better for not with a gnome for years like a gnome for three to four

01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:32.980
years was utter garbage yeah all right well there you know what on that positive

01:31:32.980 --> 01:31:37.120
note because that's you know that is that is a story for another time we could

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:39.980
you know we were thinking about it we should do like a history edition like a

01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:44.340
gather around story version where we go back through the good and bad old days

01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:50.060
of all of this but not for today that is a project for future Linux unplugged if

01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:53.220
you'd like to participate in the conversation join us live on Tuesdays

let's go pick a title before we get a mumble room thank you very much Simon

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:21.260
had a couple of I know he had several points you want to get in about Alex

01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:24.460
cute so let me say this really quick go over to JB titles calm let's see if we

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:28.100
can't make our quickest title pick yet that way Dan and West can get started

01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:32.700
ASAP Simon you wanted to jump in there real quick on a couple of things that

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:41.820
was yeah so alpha 2 is gonna be released on Thursday and both me and and bashful

01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:47.860
robot we're doing the checklist tracking so so we're we're just wondering if

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:50.660
anybody can help test you you know if you're if you're installing boot to

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:54.100
Montana machine or if you're installing you know the other flavors are kaboom

01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:57.780
to which they have I believe they have the latest plasma on this release you

01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:01.580
have the little into the boom to next flavor which it's the experimental

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:06.380
image and you have a boon to budgie and we do chillin so if you install any of

01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:10.380
those on your machine if you happen to do that within the next day or two it'd

01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:13.980
be great if you could at least you know let us know that it works that sort of

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:18.180
thing because we're right now in a lane sort of like a testing phase for alpha

01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:23.300
2 return of the distro hopper I think Chris switches to BSD we should save

01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:27.100
that one in case that ever actually happened I doubt it but boy so many

01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:29.820
people since I've mentioned this are like dude you should try out BSD and I'm

01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:35.060
like uh-huh I think I would rather run slack where then run BSD maybe I'm not

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:38.980
sure BSD is like the greatest thing you should possibly want if you don't want

01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:46.420
to run a desktop swap your hosting duties there Chris yeah I mean I could

01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:52.180
fill in now yeah let's see scratch by a thumbnail keeping keep killing flash I

01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:57.180
still think return of the distro hopper might be better so long and thanks for

01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:01.860
all the flash yeah that's good too but I've already that was taken by chromium

01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:07.620
you know I want to you know maybe one day somebody you know what

01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:10.300
somebody actually pitched it to me as somebody actually suggested I should

01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:14.620
switch to BSD so that way when I use Linux it's emulated and it's consistent

01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:17.940
and so I'll have a more stable Linux experience because I'll be using an

01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:25.100
emulated Linux experience under BSD there you go somebody around here made

01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:29.940
that argument this neck of the woods and I that one really got me JB titles.com I

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.700
think we're gonna go with return of the distro hopper just in like that in the

01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:37.780
order of expedience here flash dance you know I get a flash dance is good too I

01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:42.980
gotta say wimpy made me happy and then he immediately made me sad what happened

01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:47.660
because he's talked about moving Ubuntu mate to github yeah and he moved

01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:52.700
everything to github except for the part that I hate about launchpad the bug

01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:58.900
tracker oh yeah that bit of infrastructure you can you can raise

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:03.620
issues on github that's no problem we'll deal with issues in github okay that's

01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:08.060
fine as well oh that's a good trackers are open but we need we also need the

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:12.220
one in launchpad to actually close project milestones and stuff yeah you're

01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:17.020
welcome that's brilliant just just work on Chris explaining needs a stable

01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:21.540
operating system for his production machine point him at the he'll walk in

01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:49.300
with the green one and mate will be on every system
