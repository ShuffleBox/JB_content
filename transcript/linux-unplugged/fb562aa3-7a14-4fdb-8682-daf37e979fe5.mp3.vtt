WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
Let's start with a nice positive story, a nice positive note.

00:04.640 --> 00:09.480
I noticed the Linux Foundation posted this up over at Linux.com about an 84-year-old

00:09.480 --> 00:16.380
volunteer who's never worked in IT, but he spends his free time rebuilding laptops, loading

00:16.380 --> 00:20.340
them with different versions of Linux, and then shipping them off to different areas

00:20.340 --> 00:21.880
in Africa.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.540
It's with an initiative called Free Geek, and the Linux Foundation made a video of it,

00:25.540 --> 00:26.540
so let's watch it.

00:26.540 --> 00:30.280
I think this is pretty cool.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.400
I'm James Anderson.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.920
I'm 84 years old.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.320
Through the years, I've always done repair work.

00:37.320 --> 00:41.680
I've enjoyed just taking things apart and seeing how they work, but that goes way back

00:41.680 --> 00:50.000
to childhood when I took apart an electric plug in my grandmother's floor lamp and promptly

00:50.000 --> 00:52.280
blew out all the fuses.

00:52.280 --> 00:58.280
I'd had a computer since the days of what we called then transportable computers, a

00:58.280 --> 01:04.880
luggable computer, weighed as much as my wife's sewing machine that I carried around, so I've

01:04.880 --> 01:11.120
had owned a computer since probably the mid-1980s, and I've always been interested, used them,

01:11.120 --> 01:19.500
although I'd never been an IT person at all, never had any training in it.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.200
I work at Free Geek.

01:21.200 --> 01:26.080
I learned about Free Geek from my friend Bob, who was a neighbor.

01:26.080 --> 01:31.860
I had just returned from working for 13 weeks in Zimbabwe.

01:31.860 --> 01:37.960
I saw the need for computers among young people who were studying and who seemed deprived

01:37.960 --> 01:43.140
to me of the opportunities that computers offered them, so when I heard about Free Geek

01:43.140 --> 01:50.080
and its program of receiving donations of used computers and the possibility that through

01:50.080 --> 01:57.640
rebuilding them, I might be able to provide computers to some of those young people.

01:57.640 --> 02:02.280
After a couple of years here, I moved into rebuilding laptops, and since I've been

02:02.280 --> 02:08.480
rebuilding laptops, we've sent well over 100 laptops to various African nations and

02:08.480 --> 02:14.000
to be used in schools and by nonprofit organizations.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.240
Free Geek makes a huge point of being open source, so every PC computer here goes out

02:21.240 --> 02:25.040
with Linux-based, and that's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.

02:25.040 --> 02:31.040
This is just one room with our laptops waiting to be repaired.

02:31.040 --> 02:36.880
All of these that are working will go out with Linux-based operating systems.

02:36.880 --> 02:42.800
My continuing goal in being at Free Geek is to provide the laptops for Africa, and the

02:42.800 --> 02:45.120
kind of problem-solving that's involved.

02:45.120 --> 02:52.840
You've run into an issue with a computer, and I find it very rewarding to solve that

02:52.840 --> 02:53.840
problem.

02:53.840 --> 02:58.440
I like the tinkering, but above all, I just simply enjoy the community.

02:58.440 --> 03:03.120
It's an unusual place, and the results are very rewarding.

03:03.120 --> 03:07.760
So as long as I'm able, I think I will be here on Fridays, as long as they'll let me

03:07.760 --> 03:11.440
and I have no indication that they won't.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.440
That's pretty neat.

03:12.440 --> 03:16.320
You know, what I want to do is I'd like to go find those places and talk to those people.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.320
That's pretty neat.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.480
I don't know if they do those around here, but I think there might be something like

03:19.480 --> 03:20.480
that.

03:20.480 --> 03:22.440
I want to do that as a job.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.440
I know.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.160
It's pretty cool to take those old machines that people don't want to necessarily use

03:27.160 --> 03:31.080
and send them somewhere, make them be of pretty good use.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.600
So that is pretty cool.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.960
Anderson began in 2006, that's pretty cool, after he and his wife went to Zimbabwe to

03:37.960 --> 03:38.960
teach math.

03:38.960 --> 03:44.560
They didn't know to do an interview at scale with an organization in Southern California

03:44.560 --> 03:45.560
that was doing something like that?

03:45.560 --> 03:46.560
Yeah, there's a few.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.800
We see them at every fest we go to.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.600
Yeah, it's getting more and more of a thing, which is like, oh, I just don't know how to

03:50.600 --> 03:51.600
get involved.

03:51.600 --> 03:56.960
I don't know much about it, but I know that there's a local group here that takes old

03:56.960 --> 04:00.560
computers and puts them at libraries or something.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.960
They're not sending them off out of the country, they're putting them here local for students

04:03.960 --> 04:04.960
and stuff.

04:04.960 --> 04:05.960
So it's pretty neat.

04:05.960 --> 04:14.640
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's just simply counting down

04:14.640 --> 04:18.280
the days until they install Linux on the Apple Watch.

04:18.280 --> 04:19.520
My name is Chris.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.520
And my name is Matt.

04:20.520 --> 04:24.120
All right, Matt, that'll conclude all of our Apple Watch discussion, probably forever in

04:24.120 --> 04:25.120
Linux Unplugged.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.120
No, I can't say that.

04:26.120 --> 04:29.480
But definitely this week, we have a huge show for episode 91.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.040
We got a couple of things to follow up on that I think are pretty important because

04:32.040 --> 04:36.800
we pre-recorded last week, so I want to get those in towards the top.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.540
Then Mr. Saigo, friend of the show, joins us in just a little bit to discuss what's

04:40.540 --> 04:44.680
going on at Colab and the Roundcube project, which is...

04:44.680 --> 04:48.600
Roundcube is an incredible open source web mail project.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.240
I just recently backed their most recent crowdfunding initiative.

04:51.240 --> 04:56.460
We're going to talk about that, maybe discuss how it compares to some of the other popular

04:56.460 --> 04:57.460
projects out there.

04:57.460 --> 04:59.560
So Saigo will be joining us to talk about all that.

04:59.560 --> 05:03.040
And then towards the end of the show, we're going to get the Mumble Room's reaction to

05:03.040 --> 05:06.600
the Ubuntu 15.04 release.

05:06.600 --> 05:10.500
There has been some strong reaction in some areas of the internet, specifically in regards

05:10.500 --> 05:12.240
to the system de-implementation.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.240
I don't look into that in just a minute.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.120
And then we're going to look ahead at Ubuntu 15.10 just got its name.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.160
They just announced a new focus on the desktop.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.800
We'll try to figure out what the hell that means and if it actually is going to make

05:22.800 --> 05:24.440
any bit of difference.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.380
So we got a lot to talk about today, a lot to get through.

05:27.380 --> 05:30.080
And not only that, we have a bustin' Mumble Room.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.080
Let's bring them in right now.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.080
Time appropriate greetings, my virtual lug.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.080
Time appropriate greetings.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.080
Hello.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.080
Good evening.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080
Hello, everybody.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
Hello.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.080
Hi, guys.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.080
Oh, Wimpy and Popy.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.080
You guys snuck in right as we got started.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.080
Hello, guys.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.080
Good to have you here, too.

05:44.080 --> 05:48.280
Time to do, let's do a victory lap for a member in our audience.

05:48.280 --> 05:54.880
This just came in just about five hours ago from PM Nocturnal, his freshly minted MacBook

05:54.880 --> 05:56.200
Pro 8.1 edition.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.760
It looks pretty nice, and he had this to write in.

05:58.760 --> 06:02.080
I just thought this was perfect because we've been following this kind of thread for three

06:02.080 --> 06:03.080
weeks now.

06:03.080 --> 06:07.420
He says, I just converted my family over to Linux completely.

06:07.420 --> 06:09.820
The last was a MacBook Pro used by my bro.

06:09.820 --> 06:13.420
The moment it was updated to Yosemite, things started to slow down horribly.

06:13.420 --> 06:16.680
It took 30 effing seconds to start Firefox on it.

06:16.680 --> 06:22.520
He was fed up, and it went, and in one night, I installed Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon Edition,

06:22.520 --> 06:24.320
and he said, quietly kept.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.480
I'm not sure, I guess he just quietly kept it on there.

06:26.480 --> 06:30.640
He was so happy to see the way I customized it to work with his workflow.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.720
He now owns a small photographic and AV studio.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.320
Now all I need is quality audio and video editing apps.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.520
He's willing to learn new apps.

06:36.520 --> 06:40.880
GIMP is what I made him use in Mac, so editing wasn't a problem under Linux.

06:40.880 --> 06:44.420
iMovie and GarageBand is what's stopping me to make the complete switch for him.

06:44.420 --> 06:48.640
He started using KDE and Live, and he started to like it, yet there's not much like iMovie.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.400
I hope he'll eventually switch over for audio, but I can't think of a good app.

06:51.400 --> 06:55.640
I'm searching things like KX Studio, AV Linux, but suggestions are welcome.

06:55.640 --> 06:59.680
He says also, we'll get to suggestions in just a second, but he says also, just a tip,

06:59.680 --> 07:03.640
if you're converting a Windows user to Linux, just hit them with quality plasma-based desktop.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.440
Manjaro is good, yeah, he likes Manjaro.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.600
For Mac users, go with Linux Mint Cinnamon rather than Gnome and install Plank and customize

07:10.600 --> 07:11.600
it.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
That's worked for him.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.600
Well, that's each your own.

07:13.600 --> 07:20.240
So, audio apps, I'm a big fan of Oaken Audio and Audacity, which Audacity just recently

07:20.240 --> 07:23.560
had, I read an interview with the developers, there's some really interesting stuff happening

07:23.560 --> 07:24.560
with the project there.

07:24.560 --> 07:31.240
They are finally working on a new UI for Audacity, which would be really welcome, and it seems

07:31.240 --> 07:32.960
to be like it's got some serious legs.

07:32.960 --> 07:37.220
They just recently did an update after a long time that introduced real-time effects preview,

07:37.220 --> 07:39.040
so Audacity is getting pretty serious.

07:39.040 --> 07:43.040
The UI, I think, is doing it a disservice because it doesn't look like a serious app.

07:43.040 --> 07:48.120
It looks like a 90s Linux app that was always missing features compared to the proprietary

07:48.120 --> 07:50.840
alternatives, where now it's actually a pretty serious contender.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.120
It just has that legacy UI.

07:53.120 --> 07:58.760
So take a look at that, PC or PM Nocturnal, but Matt, do you have any suggestions for

07:58.760 --> 07:59.760
audio stuff?

07:59.760 --> 08:05.440
You know, I've been using Audacity since as long, literally as far back as I can remember,

08:05.440 --> 08:09.780
since my earliest days of using Linux, and yeah, the UI is definitely one of those things

08:09.780 --> 08:11.800
to where it grows on you after a while.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.320
Initially I thought it was, even back then I thought it was horribly ugly, but now it's

08:14.320 --> 08:16.880
like I can't even fathom them changing that.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.960
It would feel somehow wrong, but as far as other applications, that's pretty much my

08:21.960 --> 08:22.960
primary one.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.040
I can't really see using anything else.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.400
It just does what I need it to, but my needs are pretty minimal.

08:27.400 --> 08:35.280
Mumbaroon, anybody have any comments on audio and things like for studio work?

08:35.280 --> 08:36.760
Nobody's going to mention Ardour, really?

08:36.760 --> 08:39.560
I figured somebody would come to the defense of Ardour.

08:39.560 --> 08:44.740
Yeah, this is your more serious end production software, where if you have multiple tracks

08:44.740 --> 08:48.840
and devices coming in real-time audio recording, with real-time effects and all of that, Ardour

08:48.840 --> 08:52.600
is serious business, and it's definitely worth taking a look at too.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.320
I think we've mentioned this before, but I don't mention it very often because we don't

08:56.320 --> 09:00.320
use it here at JV1, so I don't have a lot of hands-on experience with it.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.720
I think if I did, I'd probably promote it more.

09:02.720 --> 09:06.240
I think my hangup is, because I've looked at wanting to get into it at one point, but

09:06.240 --> 09:11.200
I think when I look at it, I see all these options, and I'm a little overwhelmed, but

09:11.200 --> 09:15.800
at the same time, I want to take a weekend and just dedicate myself to trying to learn,

09:15.800 --> 09:19.400
because I'm sure I can, but I feel like it's like trying to learn Blender.

09:19.400 --> 09:23.240
Incredibly powerful, but I'm just too much of a noob, I guess.

09:23.240 --> 09:27.000
Lightworks is like that too, and that's a really hard line to walk if you're going to

09:27.000 --> 09:30.480
have a serious tool to do production and work.

09:30.480 --> 09:35.340
They are often too complicated in a lot of ways.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.760
It's just the nature of the beast.

09:37.760 --> 09:41.520
I don't know if you guys noticed, but today, it doesn't really affect us Linux users yet,

09:41.520 --> 09:46.880
but good old games, the guys over at GOG, guys and gals, I shouldn't say guys, the folks,

09:46.880 --> 09:50.780
the people, launched Galaxy to the public today.

09:50.780 --> 09:56.060
It's only available for Windows and Mac, but I suppose eventually they seem to be indicating

09:56.060 --> 09:59.200
that they'll be also releasing for Linux.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.820
What is Galaxy?

10:00.820 --> 10:04.680
I didn't know until this morning, to be honest, because it's not really on my radar, but think

10:04.680 --> 10:09.960
of it as a platform for DRM-free games similar to Steam, with auto-updates, downloading from

10:09.960 --> 10:14.360
the library, social interaction, and one of the key components is it does not require

10:14.360 --> 10:15.360
online connection.

10:15.360 --> 10:24.160
Now, it is not open source, but it is predominantly featured focusing on DRM-free games.

10:24.160 --> 10:28.720
Anybody in the Mumble Room see this and have a reaction to it?

10:28.720 --> 10:32.960
We talked about it today on Tech Talk Today, and it seems to be that the people who are

10:32.960 --> 10:37.560
for this are people that like Steam, but have a good set of games they have from their good

10:37.560 --> 10:42.160
old games library, don't really want to have to have online play, want to still be able

10:42.160 --> 10:45.080
to do like the social thing for multiplayer and things like that.

10:45.080 --> 10:49.240
Well, I'm on their page now, I'm looking at, just under the news section for GOG, just

10:49.240 --> 10:51.280
kind of get an idea of it.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.280
Sounds really awesome.

10:52.280 --> 10:56.740
Unfortunately, their news page for it is really doing it a disservice because all it shows

10:56.740 --> 11:02.280
me is a banner with GOG.com Galaxy and some space and then the verbiage.

11:02.280 --> 11:05.680
I would really be interested in maybe, I don't know, seeing the beta in action on a YouTube

11:05.680 --> 11:06.680
video.

11:06.680 --> 11:10.560
So they want to be, think Steam, but for GOG games, but they're going to do a couple of

11:10.560 --> 11:14.860
features like rollbacks, like if a game update makes something you don't like, you can roll

11:14.860 --> 11:16.600
back to the previous version.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.600
That's kind of neat.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.600
I like that.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.600
No, I love that.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.600
Right?

11:20.600 --> 11:23.080
In fact, you don't even have to have a profile to use it unless you want to get game achievements

11:23.080 --> 11:25.360
and things like that.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.360
So it sounds like the two killer features then, if I'm understanding correctly, the

11:28.360 --> 11:31.280
big one is if you just really don't want to deal with the profile, you don't have to have

11:31.280 --> 11:33.680
one if you don't want to have the achievements and whatnot.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.400
And then the rollback feature, that alone, honestly, I got to tell you, that's pretty

11:37.400 --> 11:38.400
sweet.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.400
Yeah.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.400
It's cool.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
WWNSX, what do you think?

11:41.400 --> 11:49.520
I'm like, with the Steam backlash, a week and a half ago or so, there was someone made

11:49.520 --> 11:55.320
an app or someone's been working on an app or it conglomerates like this.

11:55.320 --> 12:01.320
It was going to make this Steam and then Origin all at once.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.480
It's just too much to run on one system.

12:03.480 --> 12:07.440
Like I have Steam or I have Origin, then I have to have this.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.600
And then on top of that, on Steam, if you buy something from Ubisoft, then you have

12:11.600 --> 12:14.840
Uplay running at the same time as Steam.

12:14.840 --> 12:22.680
It's a good idea if you want to focus solely on GOG, DRM free, hopefully want to get more

12:22.680 --> 12:23.680
Linux titles.

12:23.680 --> 12:27.440
But to me, it's just like, I already have enough.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.760
I'll probably maybe get it.

12:29.760 --> 12:34.960
I do like some of the things like they're pushing the optional auto updates that you

12:34.960 --> 12:36.360
can roll back.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.360
That's really good.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.360
Yeah.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.360
I guess I'm starting to...

12:39.360 --> 12:41.240
I was starting to lean towards it.

12:41.240 --> 12:47.360
Well, I watched their video and their video is very much like consumer choice and freedom

12:47.360 --> 12:48.360
of this.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.360
And here, let me...

12:49.360 --> 12:50.360
I'll just...

12:50.360 --> 12:54.320
Let me check that it gets towards the end of the video, about 50 seconds into the video.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.320
...to use.

12:55.320 --> 12:59.480
We call this freedom of choice.

12:59.480 --> 13:03.800
Our client application will offer convenient game updating as well as the option to stay

13:03.800 --> 13:08.880
in touch with friends, but we will never force it on you, never require you to have it to

13:08.880 --> 13:10.400
play your games.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.840
We call it the optional client.

13:14.840 --> 13:18.200
Regardless of which digital store you buy your games from, we don't think you should

13:18.200 --> 13:19.360
be locked into it.

13:19.360 --> 13:23.440
We strongly believe that you should be free to play together with all your friends without

13:23.440 --> 13:26.640
any third party client apps or accounts required.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.120
We call this Classplay.

13:30.120 --> 13:37.520
Welcome to GOG Galaxy, the DRM free online gaming platform.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.400
So that's how they pitch it.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.400
Pretty good pitch.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.400
That's actually...

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
Okay, now that's pretty good.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.400
Yeah, right?

13:43.400 --> 13:44.400
Immediately I realized why I care.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.400
Yeah.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.400
That's always been my big gripe with anything.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.400
I like that.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.400
And I like that it's optional.

13:48.400 --> 13:52.040
But the only way I could see this possibly working is if I only have Steam in this.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.040
There's no way I want more than that.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.360
I don't want Steam, Desura, and whatever the else is.

13:55.360 --> 14:00.900
And thankfully on Linux, we don't have this whole crap show, but yeah.

14:00.900 --> 14:04.600
Although it is kind of funny to where we get rid of that pesky DRM stuff so that you can

14:04.600 --> 14:09.320
run this on your Windows computer kind of mentality, which is kind of like, what?

14:09.320 --> 14:10.720
But outside of that, I like the message.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.720
I like the idea.

14:11.720 --> 14:15.080
I like the fact that they are at least at some general level providing folks with a

14:15.080 --> 14:16.080
choice, and that's cool.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.440
And I'm going to grab a video that Michael89 in the chat room just linked here.

14:19.440 --> 14:24.920
This is the first look from Kelly Head Pro, or Craig Head Pro.

14:24.920 --> 14:25.920
I'm sorry, Craig Head.

14:25.920 --> 14:26.920
I don't...

14:26.920 --> 14:27.920
Hey, I'm Craig of Craig Head Pro.

14:27.920 --> 14:28.920
That's Craig.

14:28.920 --> 14:29.920
There you go.

14:29.920 --> 14:30.920
Nice.

14:30.920 --> 14:31.920
It looks like he's on Windows 10.

14:31.920 --> 14:32.920
So, yeah.

14:32.920 --> 14:33.920
Of course.

14:33.920 --> 14:34.920
Moving on.

14:34.920 --> 14:39.000
I would say it looks like a web app on a desktop, so it looks like your GOG library.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.120
The fact that they couldn't make this available for Linux is a joke.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.120
Yeah.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.120
That's kind of my...

14:44.120 --> 14:45.120
Wow.

14:45.120 --> 14:49.600
It's like pushing the whole DRM free freedom choice, you know, come on.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.600
You got to go all the way with it.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.600
That's all.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.600
This is their Galaxy client.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.600
This is their website.

14:53.600 --> 14:54.600
Oh, that's it.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.600
This is...

14:55.600 --> 14:57.680
You're telling me they couldn't have released this for Linux?

14:57.680 --> 14:58.680
This is super weak.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.200
It's not like it's really that visually...

15:00.200 --> 15:01.200
Like it doesn't...

15:01.200 --> 15:02.200
It looks like it's just a website.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.880
It looks like a Chromium app with a web page inside of it.

15:04.880 --> 15:05.880
It probably is.

15:05.880 --> 15:11.000
You know what would be funny is to actually build that and then email it to them.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.720
This is starting to feel like good old games or GOGs.

15:13.720 --> 15:17.120
I like them a lot, but they're lackluster.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.920
Like if you want to be a serious contender in this game, you got to be like Steamin'

15:19.920 --> 15:20.920
Dessert.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.920
You got to have a Linux client.

15:21.920 --> 15:22.920
A, number one.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.960
B, make the client seriously worth it.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.340
Don't do this crap MVP stuff.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.120
Actually show something that's worth my time.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.120
I just...

15:31.120 --> 15:34.200
Well, visually, it's meh, you know, at best.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.280
I mean, there's that factor.

15:35.280 --> 15:38.080
But also, as you pointed out, the fact that they're not releasing it for Linux.

15:38.080 --> 15:42.200
I mean, just from a brass tax financial point of view, fun fact, if you're in the indie

15:42.200 --> 15:48.080
game space or you're in the not EA or not, you know, some of the bigger guys out there

15:48.080 --> 15:51.400
that are running games on disks and things like that you buy from stores, you probably

15:51.400 --> 15:54.520
want to make sure you're hitting as many markets as possible and Linux is where the growth

15:54.520 --> 15:55.520
is.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.520
So they might want to get on that.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.440
And, you know, you talk to indie developers and they say Linux is a small but passionate

16:00.440 --> 16:04.000
and growing section of their business and they want to be in there now as they're growing

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
their business.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.160
It makes a lot of sense for them.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.760
I'm sure GOG will eventually come around with a Linux client, but after seeing that, I'm

16:09.760 --> 16:11.520
not so sure I'm waiting anymore.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.120
I'll just continue to download from their website.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.800
I just bought one of the Star Wars games a couple of days ago from them.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.240
Well, as you pointed out, if anyone wants to build their own, they can.

16:19.240 --> 16:22.000
They just simply, you know, I forget exactly how you do it from Chrome, but it's usually

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
pretty easy.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.600
You just like pop out a thing and it appears on your desktop.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.600
There you go.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.600
You're done.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.600
You know what?

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
I'm going to build them.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.640
I'm going to create it for them and then I'm going to send it to them.

16:30.640 --> 16:31.640
I'm going to send them a little voice.

16:31.640 --> 16:36.760
And be like, call it the Linux port of the GOG galaxy.

16:36.760 --> 16:37.760
Seriously?

16:37.760 --> 16:38.760
Yeah.

16:38.760 --> 16:39.760
Okay.

16:39.760 --> 16:40.760
Are we being too harsh?

16:40.760 --> 16:41.760
Yeah.

16:41.760 --> 16:49.720
I think it's interesting because GOG still has a user base which is 90% Windows and Mac

16:49.720 --> 16:54.000
and they are going to get a Linux client available.

16:54.000 --> 17:01.040
I think they're meeting a need that Linux games is a process of refinement.

17:01.040 --> 17:08.480
Steam gets the massive user base over, but it still contains DRM, which isn't what everyone

17:08.480 --> 17:11.280
should be content with.

17:11.280 --> 17:17.840
I think I don't know if GOG is going to be the people who make it.

17:17.840 --> 17:24.640
They make what everyone wants, but as long as there's people trying to work on it, can't

17:24.640 --> 17:26.160
we only just make progress?

17:26.160 --> 17:27.160
Yeah.

17:27.160 --> 17:32.320
I do kind of grok what you're saying, but I kind of hate that argument on the other

17:32.320 --> 17:40.000
respect because I would say GOG's small Linux share would be due to the fact that they've

17:40.000 --> 17:45.200
completely ignored GOG, even teased a Linux market to some degree pre-Mac announcement

17:45.200 --> 17:46.400
for many years.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.640
And so it's kind of like saying, my tomato garden really sucks.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.640
Yeah.

17:51.640 --> 17:52.640
Yeah.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.640
Guess what?

17:53.640 --> 17:54.640
I don't nurture my tomato garden.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.640
Yeah.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.640
Obviously it sucks.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.640
I mean, that's obvious.

17:57.640 --> 18:00.160
Yes, of course their Linux market share is tiny.

18:00.160 --> 18:06.280
There was demand for them to enter this market well before there was ever Steam for Linux.

18:06.280 --> 18:11.580
I understand that just sheer numbers wise, the Linux share is small, but they could have

18:11.580 --> 18:16.840
been with their DRM free stance, with their huge DOSBox compatibility.

18:16.840 --> 18:22.960
And here's the other thing, before you completely give them a pass, also consider that in this

18:22.960 --> 18:27.120
same time while Steam passed them up and got a Linux client out there, there's this other

18:27.120 --> 18:29.440
group that came along called the Humble Bundle.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.760
And the Humble Bundle not only showed us how you can get games over to Linux, but how you

18:32.760 --> 18:38.600
can actually get developers to do ports, and in almost all cases native ports over to Linux.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.160
And that's another opportunity that GOG completely missed.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.820
They got lapped by the Humble guys.

18:42.820 --> 18:46.480
Now there's a full-time Humble store, and they're making great profits.

18:46.480 --> 18:50.080
And GOG totally missed that opportunity, because they never had their head in Linux.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.420
They never figured it out.

18:51.420 --> 18:55.040
But if they would have followed some of these things, they could have been these guys, GOG

18:55.040 --> 18:57.200
would have been perfect for those kind of bundles.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.680
That would have been perfect for them.

18:58.680 --> 19:03.160
Plus, they could have filled in from their back catalog as well.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.160
They didn't see it.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.920
And I'm sure they don't have the resources, but I don't want to give them too much of

19:06.920 --> 19:07.920
a pass.

19:07.920 --> 19:13.120
We too often do that, and in reality, sometimes companies make mistakes and they miss market

19:13.120 --> 19:14.120
opportunities.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.800
And I think GOG's done that, and now they're at a continual disadvantage in the Linux market,

19:17.800 --> 19:21.840
and so it continues to perpetuate that priority for them.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.220
One area I think they still have an opportunity to recoup from, because I do agree that they

19:25.220 --> 19:27.240
missed an opportunity, but I see another one.

19:27.240 --> 19:30.000
What they're doing with this client itself is great.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
I love that.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.260
Unfortunately, it's not available for us.

19:33.260 --> 19:37.240
If they would simply pull the trigger and export an icon to their desktop, like I suggested

19:37.240 --> 19:42.040
with Chrome, and make it available to everybody, I honestly feel like that it's like, OK, so

19:42.040 --> 19:43.040
we've created an atmosphere.

19:43.040 --> 19:47.000
Now, they may not have the resources to encourage a lot of porting to games.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.240
They may not even have an interest in it, but at least the client is there.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.900
At least it's like, OK, now we're different than Steam.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.560
Come bring your games over to us, and we can actually encourage this other atmosphere.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.000
Just having something on the desktop is nice.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.320
Just that is nice.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.680
And then other game developers might be like, oh, hey, I would like to have an opportunity

20:04.680 --> 20:07.240
to provide my games to where they don't have to have an account.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.240
This is different than Steam.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.240
That's cool.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.240
Let's check that out.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.240
That's all they've got to do.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.240
It doesn't require a lot of effort on their part.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.360
It doesn't take a lot.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.240
It doesn't have to be much.

20:15.240 --> 20:18.720
It just has to be slightly more useful than the web.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.000
That's all you have to go for.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.920
Steam walks that line pretty closely.

20:23.920 --> 20:29.840
Steam is, in a lot of ways, it's the insides of the Steam Chrome are just a web page.

20:29.840 --> 20:32.140
The outsides, though, are written in the native platform.

20:32.140 --> 20:34.840
So like in the case of Linux, it's GTK, and you can theme it.

20:34.840 --> 20:37.860
And you can go in there and set the dialogs and create libraries and where you want downloads

20:37.860 --> 20:38.860
to go.

20:38.860 --> 20:40.200
You can opt into betas and the settings.

20:40.200 --> 20:45.560
There's interfaces for your microphone, for doing team speak, and for your social settings.

20:45.560 --> 20:49.520
All perfect, all in the Steam client, without ever having to load your web page.

20:49.520 --> 20:54.080
So the Steam client does a brilliant job of walking the line, of standing on top of their

20:54.080 --> 20:57.040
web technology, so that way they don't have to write two different stores at the same

20:57.040 --> 20:58.040
time.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.520
But then yet wrapping it in a Chrome that gives you a lot of extra options and benefits

21:01.520 --> 21:05.880
that absolutely make it worth having the Steam client, not to mention the downloader management

21:05.880 --> 21:07.120
and all that kind of stuff.

21:07.120 --> 21:13.640
So I think that's all GOG really has to do, and that bar is not that high.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.640
Steam's not that great.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.960
No, it really isn't.

21:15.960 --> 21:20.440
And as much as I enjoy Steam games, I would be thrilled pink to see GOG rattle Valve's

21:20.440 --> 21:21.440
Cage a little bit.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.440
Great!

21:22.440 --> 21:23.440
I'm all for that.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.440
Yeah.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.440
Cool.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.880
But it has to have some kind of functionality, and I'm sure they'll work that in there.

21:28.880 --> 21:29.880
Oh yeah.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.320
And like I said, I have not written them off at all.

21:32.320 --> 21:36.280
Hopefully this is their cold cup of coffee, and that they're going to say, oh wait, we

21:36.280 --> 21:37.280
really need to get on this.

21:37.280 --> 21:41.160
As soon as one hits the AUR, I'm going to install it.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.160
There you go.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.760
Which will be five minutes from now.

21:44.760 --> 21:45.760
You think?

21:45.760 --> 21:46.760
Yeah.

21:46.760 --> 21:47.760
I wonder.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.760
Wouldn't be that hard.

21:48.760 --> 21:49.760
Yeah.

21:49.760 --> 21:50.760
All right.

21:50.760 --> 21:53.560
So before we go any further, I want to take a minute and talk about our friends over at

21:53.560 --> 21:57.600
Linux Academy who are sponsoring this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

21:57.600 --> 22:01.360
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, speaking of that.

22:01.360 --> 22:05.120
And that's where you're going to get our Linux Unplugged discount, which is fantastic.

22:05.120 --> 22:11.840
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and you'll get a 33% discount on the Linux Academy

22:11.840 --> 22:12.840
content.

22:12.840 --> 22:13.840
That's an incredible discount.

22:13.840 --> 22:14.840
33% is nuts.

22:14.840 --> 22:17.000
So that's going to be $50 for a quarter.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.800
Now, why do they do it like this?

22:18.800 --> 22:20.240
Why is this system set up like this?

22:20.240 --> 22:24.160
Because they're always adding great stuff, really, really, really great stuff.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.800
I could tell you all about Linux Academy, and I want to do that.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.960
But a lot of you have heard about Linux Academy.

22:28.960 --> 22:32.880
So for those of you who have heard this spot before, stay tuned, because there's something

22:32.880 --> 22:35.320
that is for you specifically that I want to get to.

22:35.320 --> 22:39.200
But first, for those of you who are new, Linux Academy is the place to go to make yourself

22:39.200 --> 22:42.400
sort of break through that level, to train yourself on that next skill set, to learn

22:42.400 --> 22:46.040
that next thing, to transition from one distribution to another.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.500
It's an online, self-paced learning system.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.360
It's an entire platform created by true Linux and open source enthusiasts who got together

22:52.360 --> 22:56.720
with their friends who are educators and developers, and they created the Linux Academy platform

22:56.720 --> 22:58.380
specifically for this purpose.

22:58.380 --> 23:01.960
That's all they do is cover open source and Linux technologies.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.400
That's why they're great at it.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.400
It's their passion.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.400
It's their focus.

23:05.400 --> 23:09.040
And they have scenario-based labs, which give me the confidence, and will give you the confidence,

23:09.040 --> 23:10.980
because you work hands-on in these scenarios.

23:10.980 --> 23:12.560
They'll receive access to these labs.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.520
They'll put you in the middle of tasks common to an everyday environment.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.360
You'll work in the advanced lab environments and complete the scenarios from beginning

23:18.360 --> 23:20.720
to end on live servers.

23:20.720 --> 23:24.100
So you'll walk away from that having the experience and confidence when you need to go apply that

23:24.100 --> 23:25.220
to a job.

23:25.220 --> 23:28.080
That's more than just training.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.200
That honestly, for me, reduces anxiety.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.840
That means I'm not doing this stuff for the first time.

23:31.840 --> 23:33.720
Plus, you don't have to worry if you get a little stuck.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.240
There's instructor help available.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.600
You can choose from seven-plus Linux distributions.

23:37.600 --> 23:41.100
They'll automatically adjust the courseware and the virtual machines, because they spin

23:41.100 --> 23:42.840
up virtual machines as you need them.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.120
And this can be a good cost savings if you're going to be learning some AWS stuff, because

23:46.120 --> 23:49.440
you don't have to worry about getting dinged on AWS, which I've done.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.320
And something for guys like me who've now been a member for Linux Academy for a little

23:52.320 --> 23:54.440
while, they've added nuggets.

23:54.440 --> 23:57.640
And I like this because I have found that even though I've been using Linux for longer

23:57.640 --> 24:02.220
than I'd like to admit, I still could do things a little bit better from time to time.

24:02.220 --> 24:04.720
And there's just a lot of ways to string things together.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.440
And this is where nuggets come together.

24:06.440 --> 24:09.680
They're single how-tos that walk you through doing specific tasks that don't belong on

24:09.680 --> 24:13.280
a course, don't really go with like a large range of things.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.960
It's a single video lesson.

24:14.960 --> 24:18.040
It's somewhere between two and 60 minutes, and it teaches you like one specific thing

24:18.040 --> 24:19.040
on how to do it.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.040
It's pretty cool.

24:20.040 --> 24:22.320
And those are nuggets, and they just added them recently.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.440
So speaking of things they've added recently, if you've been a listener for a little while,

24:25.440 --> 24:27.240
you're probably familiar with Linux Academy.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.440
You might even be a member, at least I hope you are.

24:29.440 --> 24:33.360
Well, I think this is something pretty cool, and it's going to fund open source development.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.640
So I want to tell you about it.

24:34.640 --> 24:38.240
It's called the Linux Academy Founders Club, and this is where you can go.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.680
You can become a member.

24:39.680 --> 24:43.120
You get access to like content as it's being developed.

24:43.120 --> 24:47.440
You get major swag from time to time, access to site beta features.

24:47.440 --> 24:50.320
You get special recognition in the community, different areas.

24:50.320 --> 24:54.280
But you also get to vote on something really neat that they're working on.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.820
It's their open source grant program.

24:56.820 --> 25:01.920
Any open source license project can apply for this, and they're going to give up to

25:01.920 --> 25:07.040
$5,000 for the project that their Founders Club votes on.

25:07.040 --> 25:10.920
That's amazing, because these guys truly care about this kind of stuff, and they want to

25:10.920 --> 25:11.920
give it back.

25:11.920 --> 25:15.440
And there's a pretty good chance that one of those open source projects is going to

25:15.440 --> 25:16.440
be in our audience.

25:16.440 --> 25:19.720
So I'm going to have more information about how you can get that soon.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.320
The RHCSA just also recently went live.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.080
DevOps Essentials is available now.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.260
50 Video Nuggets just recently went up.

25:26.260 --> 25:30.640
The OpenStack course is just, they're always updating new stuff.

25:30.640 --> 25:35.760
I think that's probably the area I should maybe visit, to be honest with you.

25:35.760 --> 25:38.720
But I love that I know it's just always constantly getting refreshed, and so that means I'm always

25:38.720 --> 25:41.800
getting value out of my membership, which I do pay for my membership.

25:41.800 --> 25:45.680
You go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, sign up, get our 33% discount, and you also

25:45.680 --> 25:46.680
support this show.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.960
And then you get to try something out really great that might even help take your skills

25:49.960 --> 25:50.960
set up to the next level.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.720
They have in-depth resources.

25:52.720 --> 25:53.920
You're going to be super impressed.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.880
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.840
And a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

26:00.840 --> 26:05.480
Well, two critical courses that I don't think most people are aware of, that I think are

26:05.480 --> 26:06.880
probably two of the most important.

26:06.880 --> 26:10.600
The first one is, I've never touched Linux in a day in my life, and where do I get started?

26:10.600 --> 26:11.600
That's a good one.

26:11.600 --> 26:12.600
I love that course.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.760
I mean, I forget the proper name for it, but that's essentially what it is.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.560
It's like, it is literally, you park anyone in front of it, and they will actually walk

26:17.560 --> 26:18.560
them through it.

26:18.560 --> 26:22.040
And the second course is, okay, so I've got some certs, I've studied for my certs, I'm

26:22.040 --> 26:23.040
ready to go.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.640
It's basically designed to help you find work.

26:24.640 --> 26:25.640
Yes.

26:25.640 --> 26:26.640
That's awesome.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.280
That's an actual proper course they have.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.400
Those two get you in the door and it gets you out the door.

26:31.400 --> 26:34.720
You know what makes me pumped to do these spots is when I get there, and I'd love people

26:34.720 --> 26:38.120
to keep sending them to me, when they say, hey, I went Linux Academy, I got my certs,

26:38.120 --> 26:39.120
I got a job.

26:39.120 --> 26:40.120
Right?

26:40.120 --> 26:41.120
Yeah.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.120
That's really cool.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.120
So cool.

26:43.120 --> 26:47.320
So we have Mr. Saigo joining us in just a moment, but producer Rotten Corps is here,

26:47.320 --> 26:50.520
and I wanted to get an update on a software project that he's involved with.

26:50.520 --> 26:56.240
So I asked him to join us to give us a little update on YouGet, which just shipped version

26:56.240 --> 26:57.240
2.0.

26:57.240 --> 27:02.120
Mr. Corps, what's new with YouGet, and what the heck is YouGet?

27:02.120 --> 27:04.720
YouGet is a download manager.

27:04.720 --> 27:09.600
It's a multi-download, so you can do a queue of downloads, you can get a ton of downloads

27:09.600 --> 27:15.300
all at once, and it makes it a lot easier to just manage a large list of downloads that

27:15.300 --> 27:16.300
you're doing.

27:16.300 --> 27:17.560
And this is a project you maintain?

27:17.560 --> 27:18.560
Yeah.

27:18.560 --> 27:24.640
I'm one of the... I'm not the founder, but I'm the project manager of the project.

27:24.640 --> 27:28.520
And we've actually made a lot of changes.

27:28.520 --> 27:34.400
There's a couple thousand line changes, and there's been almost a couple hundred... I

27:34.400 --> 27:39.360
think it's like 180, 175, somewhere around there, commits to it over the course of about

27:39.360 --> 27:41.600
a year or so.

27:41.600 --> 27:50.100
The biggest change is the fact that we've separated the UI and the application core,

27:50.100 --> 27:57.080
so that the whole core is separate from the GTK toolkit, so that allows us... we could

27:57.080 --> 28:00.400
eventually put QT on it or something like that.

28:00.400 --> 28:06.160
We haven't set that up, but the whole goal is to be able to do that at some point.

28:06.160 --> 28:12.760
We've also made it where... it used to be with the 1.0 branch, there was a requirement

28:12.760 --> 28:19.160
for the plugin to do certain features, like multi-threading and mirrors, so multi-source

28:19.160 --> 28:20.160
modes.

28:20.160 --> 28:24.840
We no longer require that plugin, although we still offer the plugin, and we even improved

28:24.840 --> 28:26.800
some features with the plugin as well.

28:26.800 --> 28:34.320
So now there's the core engine, which is run through curl, and area two as the plugin are

28:34.320 --> 28:38.560
now separated both as plugins, so you can choose whichever one you want.

28:38.560 --> 28:42.840
You can even... if one of them fails, you can actually make it revert to the next one

28:42.840 --> 28:49.000
in a sequence, so no matter what, the engines will be there to do whatever you want to do.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.840
And what's the shenanigans I hear about an Android app?

28:51.840 --> 28:52.840
What's this crap?

28:52.840 --> 28:53.840
What is this?

28:53.840 --> 28:54.840
Yeah, we created an Android app for YouGet.

28:54.840 --> 29:00.440
It's actually not based on the 2.0 version, but it is basically all the features that

29:00.440 --> 29:03.240
people love about YouGet is in the Android version as well.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.840
That is super cool.

29:04.840 --> 29:09.800
And you can use it to download crap to your Android device, like your SD card or whatever?

29:09.800 --> 29:13.080
Yeah, you can download anything you want.

29:13.080 --> 29:19.600
One of my favorite parts is that with my RSS reader, I can just copy the URL and have YouGet

29:19.600 --> 29:23.280
running and then it'll immediately start downloading to the app.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.280
That's neat.

29:24.280 --> 29:25.280
That's great.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.280
Well, very cool.

29:26.280 --> 29:30.520
I love it because when I'm going to download a big ISO or a whole bunch of stuff or a big

29:30.520 --> 29:34.400
batch of stuff off of archive.org, I often will just throw it into YouGet.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.360
That way I can just close my browser and not worry about it.

29:36.360 --> 29:37.360
I like it.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.920
There's actually a new feature we added as well that helps people who want to do a huge

29:40.920 --> 29:42.040
batch.

29:42.040 --> 29:47.880
We have a system called Sequential Batch where it'll automatically scan the list of what

29:47.880 --> 29:53.040
you want it to do and it will use wildcards to find out what, like to just go through

29:53.040 --> 29:57.520
a sequence of the numbers based on dates or something like that.

29:57.520 --> 30:01.680
Now we actually have it where you can do multiple wildcards in the same list.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.920
That sounds like somebody could nicely abuse a CDN with that one.

30:04.920 --> 30:05.920
Very nice, sir.

30:05.920 --> 30:06.920
Very nice.

30:06.920 --> 30:07.920
The CDN punisher.

30:07.920 --> 30:10.800
You should, you know, if you did it right, you could repackage this and sell it to guys

30:10.800 --> 30:12.640
like Alan as a CDN stress tester.

30:12.640 --> 30:13.640
All right.

30:13.640 --> 30:19.560
All right, Rob Korfst, thank you, sir, for the update and it was great to see you at

30:19.560 --> 30:20.560
Linux Fest.

30:20.560 --> 30:24.400
We'll have a link to YouGet in the show notes.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.400
All right.

30:25.400 --> 30:31.040
So we'll have, we have just speaking of Linux Fest Northwest, I also wanted to mention Jupiter

30:31.040 --> 30:36.040
Broadcasting is going to be at OSCON in July, July 20th through the 24th.

30:36.040 --> 30:40.280
See Noah and I at OSCON as well as Angela and Paige.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.760
And I don't know, maybe some others as well.

30:41.760 --> 30:45.640
We'll probably be taking the train down or perhaps maybe taking the whole family down.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.920
So OSCON is the O'Reilly Open Source Conference.

30:47.920 --> 30:51.200
I think this is the last year it's going to be in Portland too.

30:51.200 --> 30:54.080
So this may be the last year I go.

30:54.080 --> 30:58.160
So if you want to meet up with us, join us July 20th and the 24th.

30:58.160 --> 31:02.880
If that's not going to work for you, also coming up even sooner, Southeast Linux Fest,

31:02.880 --> 31:09.520
June 12th through the 14th at the Sheraton Charlotte Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina,

31:09.520 --> 31:11.840
June 12th through the 14th, Southeast Linux Fest.

31:11.840 --> 31:15.200
I'm not so sure if I'll be at this one or BSDCAN because they both are on the same day

31:15.200 --> 31:21.720
or weekend, but I'm pretty sure Noah and producer Q5SIS will be at Southeast Linux Fest and

31:21.720 --> 31:22.720
we'll have a big presence.

31:22.720 --> 31:27.560
They're a live stream powered by OBS and we'd love to have you stop by and say hi to us.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.480
That is a great, great, one of the best Linux Fest.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.480
Not the best.

31:31.480 --> 31:32.480
I can't, I mean, come on guys.

31:32.480 --> 31:34.300
Linux Fest Northwest in my backyard.

31:34.300 --> 31:38.360
But if I live down South, something tells me this might be the one.

31:38.360 --> 31:43.560
Southeast Linux Fest or SELF, June 12th through the 14th, come say hi to the JB crew.

31:43.560 --> 31:48.860
And speaking of SELF, our buddies over at the Arch Assault Project have a shirt to help

31:48.860 --> 31:52.720
fund their initiative to get to SELF to meet the community.

31:52.720 --> 31:57.880
They're releasing their first Arch Assault shirt in prep for Southeast Linux Fest.

31:57.880 --> 32:03.640
They are selling them at teespring.com slash archassault dash at dash SELF.

32:03.640 --> 32:08.160
Not the best URL ever, but it's a teespring.com slash archassault dash at dash SELF.

32:08.160 --> 32:12.560
If you like the Arch Assault Project and want to help them get to SELF, they'd love to sell

32:12.560 --> 32:16.320
a few shirts and I'll have a link in the show note for that as well.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.320
And it's a nice shirt.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.160
It's got the Arch Assault logo right here on the front.

32:19.160 --> 32:20.560
Oh, that's cool.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.560
Yeah.

32:21.560 --> 32:22.560
And I'm an Arch fan, of course.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.560
Everybody knows that.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.720
And I used to be a pen tester, so it's kind of cool to have that.

32:25.720 --> 32:27.220
So I'm definitely getting one.

32:27.220 --> 32:30.880
And then on the back they have, there is no security on this earth.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.800
There is only opportunity, General MacArthur.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.240
Pretty hardcore.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.440
Pretty hardcore.

32:36.440 --> 32:41.360
And it's just, they're selling it for basically no profit, $15.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.960
So maybe buy two, because they're not going to make any money at $15.

32:44.960 --> 32:45.960
But it's pretty cool.

32:45.960 --> 32:46.960
Yeah.

32:46.960 --> 32:47.960
No, that's true.

32:47.960 --> 32:48.960
I would have gone a little higher.

32:48.960 --> 32:49.960
You know, don't you?

32:49.960 --> 32:50.960
I think buy two would be the way to go.

32:50.960 --> 32:51.960
You do know.

32:51.960 --> 32:52.960
At $15, you don't make nothing.

32:52.960 --> 32:58.820
Teespring.com slash archassault dash at dash SELF or just find the link in the show notes.

32:58.820 --> 33:01.080
And good luck to the Arch Assault guys.

33:01.080 --> 33:05.320
They were put on a good show there last year.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.360
And I think you should definitely check it out.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.360
All right.

33:08.360 --> 33:09.820
So I know I've been teasing it for a long time.

33:09.820 --> 33:11.300
And I want to clear room for it.

33:11.300 --> 33:13.460
So I wanted to just take a moment right now.

33:13.460 --> 33:18.020
And I want to, right before we bring Mr. Saigo in, I want to mention DigitalOcean.

33:18.020 --> 33:20.480
Because I think they're so awesome that we've got to just take a minute and mention them.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.520
And then we'll start talking to Aaron.

33:21.520 --> 33:22.520
I love DigitalOcean.

33:22.520 --> 33:23.520
I love them.

33:23.520 --> 33:28.720
I love them because my son, I was really, really excited to get him to try a Linux rig.

33:28.720 --> 33:34.440
And the candy that got him to like swallow it was Minecraft.

33:34.440 --> 33:38.400
And then I'm like, okay, well, we have a Minecraft server for the Jupyter Broadcasting community,

33:38.400 --> 33:40.640
but it requires a slightly older version of Minecraft.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.660
And I'm not so sure I want him on the public just yet.

33:43.660 --> 33:47.920
So I went over to DigitalOcean and I set myself up a Minecraft server.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.720
Just a really straightforward process.

33:49.720 --> 33:54.600
It took no time at all because I get root access to my own cloud server up at DigitalOcean.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.720
And it is super intuitive and very easy to get started.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.520
So I knew I was going to get a great Linux rig.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.640
I knew I could throw Minecraft on there in no time.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.440
I got started in less than 55 seconds.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.760
And pricing plans, they start at only $5 a month.

34:05.760 --> 34:11.280
Then I get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, yeah, they're all SSDs by the

34:11.280 --> 34:14.380
way, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer.

34:14.380 --> 34:18.280
Now since I'm doing Minecraft, I decided to go with two gigs of RAM and I think I have

34:18.280 --> 34:20.620
a 40 gigabyte SSD.

34:20.620 --> 34:23.280
It's really straightforward, the pricing structure.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.520
And they even offer hourly pricing.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.240
If you just need to do some software testing or something like that, just go spin up a

34:27.240 --> 34:31.040
droplet up there, throw something in a Docker container and bang on it for a couple of hours

34:31.040 --> 34:32.040
and you're done.

34:32.040 --> 34:35.460
And the thing I love about that is they make it really easy to deploy Docker containers.

34:35.460 --> 34:39.160
So you could be working locally on your laptop or your desktop and when you're ready to actually

34:39.160 --> 34:41.920
test it, maybe you want to throw it on a public IP, you don't want to have to bug IT to open

34:41.920 --> 34:45.760
up a port on the IP or on the firewall, you know, just throw it up on a DigitalOcean droplet

34:45.760 --> 34:49.720
for a couple of hours, have the public tester bang on it, get your test results in and then

34:49.720 --> 34:50.880
shut it down.

34:50.880 --> 34:51.880
It's really cheap.

34:51.880 --> 34:55.140
And they have an incredible interface to do all of this and this is sort of the secret

34:55.140 --> 34:56.140
sauce here.

34:56.140 --> 34:59.760
It's very intuitive and power users could replicate on a larger scale with their straightforward

34:59.760 --> 35:00.760
API.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.840
They could automate that process and that's starting to get pretty powerful.

35:03.840 --> 35:07.800
And they've got data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

35:07.800 --> 35:12.040
London and a brand new one in Germany that's gorgeous with great connectivity, really a

35:12.040 --> 35:14.720
central point over there.

35:14.720 --> 35:18.400
And when you look at all of this, you're thinking, okay, this is a pretty good package.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.640
And I'll tell you from a technology standpoint, I'm all in.

35:20.640 --> 35:25.360
It's based on Linux, they're using KVM for the virtualizer, it's SSDs for the IOs, so

35:25.360 --> 35:29.600
you get super high-end IOs, you don't need a full like fiber attached RAID full of 10,000

35:29.600 --> 35:35.480
RPM for 15,000 RPM spinning rust, you just have a great SSD and it's really easy to expand

35:35.480 --> 35:36.480
that.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.600
They can do that inside the interface, you don't have to reload the box or anything like

35:38.600 --> 35:39.600
that.

35:39.600 --> 35:43.680
You've got one-click deployment of applications, Ruby on Rails, Docker, GitLab, Ghost, WordPress,

35:43.680 --> 35:45.760
all the good stuff, one button deploys it.

35:45.760 --> 35:50.600
And then on top of all of that, they have the best tutorials on the internet.

35:50.600 --> 35:54.160
And I'm just going to say that because it's like I noticed this started to happen with

35:54.160 --> 35:55.440
Arch a few years ago.

35:55.440 --> 35:58.800
You start to search for stuff and a lot of time the Arch wiki result shows up saying,

35:58.800 --> 36:01.040
man, Arch has pretty good documentation, that's good.

36:01.040 --> 36:04.920
Even before I used Arch, I knew Arch had good documentation, everybody knows that, right?

36:04.920 --> 36:08.200
That's what's happening over DigitalOcean because they started to pay their contributors

36:08.200 --> 36:10.800
up to $200 to write these tutorials.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.960
And then they realized, okay, well now we need an editing staff.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.840
So then they invested in hiring editors to curate and edit the how-tos and they keep

36:16.840 --> 36:18.220
them relevant and current.

36:18.220 --> 36:22.660
And when they roll out a new technology like FreeBSD, they roll out a whole host of tutorials

36:22.660 --> 36:23.660
to match that.

36:23.660 --> 36:25.440
It's an end-to-end thing they do.

36:25.440 --> 36:29.200
It's a complete product, complete package, and it's super respectable and they do it

36:29.200 --> 36:30.200
right.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.200
And here's the best part.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.120
You can get a $10 promo, you can try it two months absolutely free when you use the promo

36:34.120 --> 36:35.520
code DOUNPLUG.

36:35.520 --> 36:38.560
You create your account, no credit card required, you just apply it.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.560
DOUNPLUG, one word, lowercase.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.280
That'll give you a $10 credit.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.520
Go try out CoreOS.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.520
It is a game changer.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.760
CoreOS is going to change the enterprise.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.260
You can go try it out.

36:49.260 --> 36:50.880
FreeBSD's up there, I don't know why you'd want that.

36:50.880 --> 36:54.220
They've got Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, all that good stuff's up there.

36:54.220 --> 36:55.560
You can go deploy applications.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.320
It's really good.

36:57.320 --> 37:00.760
You could even go like baller style where like, you know what, don't even bother with

37:00.760 --> 37:02.320
like starting to just deploy the whole thing.

37:02.320 --> 37:06.840
Ubuntu 14.04 up to date with the entire LAMP stack, MySQL ready to go, boom, done.

37:06.840 --> 37:07.840
You've got it.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.240
Seriously, it's a great way to go.

37:09.240 --> 37:14.420
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

37:14.420 --> 37:17.800
You guys, freaking maniacs over there with all this stuff.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.520
I'm really impressed with the pace of innovation.

37:19.520 --> 37:20.520
I don't know how they do it.

37:20.520 --> 37:24.600
You know, I talked to the people on the inside and not only do they do it, but they kind

37:24.600 --> 37:26.080
of do it with a good attitude.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.080
It's kind of remarkable.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.440
I think it's because they're on the East Coast.

37:29.440 --> 37:30.440
Maybe that's what it is.

37:30.440 --> 37:31.440
Yeah, that definitely helps.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.440
Sure.

37:32.440 --> 37:33.920
I think on the West Coast, we don't quite work at that same speed.

37:33.920 --> 37:38.640
Well, Matt, I'm super excited to welcome Aaron Seigo, friend of the show and his new jingle

37:38.640 --> 37:44.640
because he's a returning guest, Mr. Aaron Seigo is now working for a new company.

37:44.640 --> 37:45.640
Is it CoLab?

37:45.640 --> 37:47.120
CoLab Systems, Aaron?

37:47.120 --> 37:48.560
What's the name for the full name?

37:48.560 --> 37:50.840
Yeah, it's CoLab Systems AG.

37:50.840 --> 37:56.480
CoLab Systems AG, and here's what I know about CoLab.

37:56.480 --> 38:02.240
It's a free software platform of sort of like an exchange competitor or like a Zimbra competitor,

38:02.240 --> 38:08.780
but a little more open, really respected for privacy, is sort of the hubbub on the street,

38:08.780 --> 38:13.080
and it's something that's always been on my bucket list to try.

38:13.080 --> 38:18.280
I was pretty excited when I saw you moved over there, but I don't actually get the connection.

38:18.280 --> 38:22.560
When I think of Aaron Seigo, I think KDE, I think of the Valde tablet.

38:22.560 --> 38:26.920
I don't know if I necessarily thought CoLab, so what are you doing at CoLab, and how's

38:26.920 --> 38:27.920
it been?

38:27.920 --> 38:32.920
Yeah, so I mean, the connection is, I guess, long term.

38:32.920 --> 38:38.120
When CoLab first started, a lot of people that were involved in the project were also

38:38.120 --> 38:39.120
involved with KDE.

38:39.120 --> 38:42.920
There was a crossover there already, so I kind of knew some of the guys behind it, and

38:42.920 --> 38:46.560
this is back in like 2001, I believe.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.960
And so when it first hit 1.0, I actually deployed it, tried it out.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.880
It was usable.

38:52.880 --> 38:58.760
It was not what we have today, but it was there, and it was definitely a step up.

38:58.760 --> 39:03.680
When CoLab systems started, it was started by a very good friend of mine, Georg Griever,

39:03.680 --> 39:07.460
who lives in the same city that I do now, which is handy, and we'd often talked about

39:07.460 --> 39:11.880
doing something together sometime, and late last year, the opportunity came up.

39:11.880 --> 39:17.000
He said, remember how we've always said we should maybe do something sometime, well,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.120
how about it?

39:19.120 --> 39:25.600
So I'm there doing two things right now, which is, on the one hand, I'm helping with some

39:25.600 --> 39:32.200
of the technology, the architecture of certain pieces of what goes into CoLab.

39:32.200 --> 39:36.160
So on that side, my official title is Senior Technologist, and I work with a couple of

39:36.160 --> 39:42.680
other guys that are just fantastic, including people like the lead architect for the entire

39:42.680 --> 39:45.520
Shebang, Yaron.

39:45.520 --> 39:48.560
So that's been great, and the team in general is just fantastic.

39:48.560 --> 39:53.660
Just so I kind of am tracking my understanding, is there also like a hosted CoLab company

39:53.660 --> 39:57.120
that is separate but somehow related to CoLab systems?

39:57.120 --> 39:58.480
Yeah.

39:58.480 --> 40:05.200
So we started as a proof of concept to show that, well, what can CoLab do?

40:05.200 --> 40:11.200
And so we started CoLab now, and it just so happened that it was launched within about

40:11.200 --> 40:19.040
24 hours or so of the Snowden revelations, which was just complete coincidence, we promise.

40:19.040 --> 40:27.720
But we had a real focus on privacy, and one of the reasons why it's hosted and managed

40:27.720 --> 40:32.800
entirely within Switzerland is because of the legal framework here, which has a lot

40:32.800 --> 40:38.160
of privacy or a lot of respect for people's privacy, and all the routes for things like

40:38.160 --> 40:45.840
requesting data and whatnot are not only very strict on the side of the consumer, the individual,

40:45.840 --> 40:48.080
but also it's a transparent process.

40:48.080 --> 40:51.880
So we never have a gag on us that says, oh, you can't talk about it.

40:51.880 --> 40:57.420
In fact, here, the federal government once a year releases a complete report of every

40:57.420 --> 41:01.760
single wiretap, et cetera, request that they make.

41:01.760 --> 41:06.640
They obviously anonymize it, but they say when, where it basically happened, and for

41:06.640 --> 41:09.760
what reason, what law was enacted in that.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.360
So transparency is a big thing here.

41:11.360 --> 41:18.360
So yeah, so CoLab now, we've got a lot of people from all over the world that use that

41:18.360 --> 41:22.200
single system, and that's our hosted version of CoLab.

41:22.200 --> 41:26.440
And of course, a lot of people use CoLab on site.

41:26.440 --> 41:34.400
People who are larger institutions, especially they hire us to do support, and we have CoLab

41:34.400 --> 41:35.640
Enterprise for that.

41:35.640 --> 41:39.240
So this is really anybody that needs like an exchange type solution where you have a

41:39.240 --> 41:47.020
groupware with calendaring, email, task lists, contacts, resources, and roles, and all these

41:47.020 --> 41:48.100
kinds of things, right?

41:48.100 --> 41:50.240
It's a complete solution for this.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.240
That's right.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.240
Notes as well.

41:52.240 --> 41:56.440
Yeah, and so resource booking, all of those fancy dancy features, and the client side

41:56.440 --> 41:57.640
is all across platform.

41:57.640 --> 42:04.080
If you have a Windows phone, Blackberry, iOS device, Android, like most of the rest of

42:04.080 --> 42:06.600
the world, you're covered.

42:06.600 --> 42:09.920
If you run it on Windows, Mac, or Linux, you're covered.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.800
So you choose the client, we run the servers.

42:12.800 --> 42:18.800
And so CoLab has been around, I'm sorry, I think you mentioned it, but did you say 2006?

42:18.800 --> 42:22.160
Well, CoLab itself started in the early 2000s.

42:22.160 --> 42:26.120
CoLab Systems itself has been around in its current form for about four years.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.120
Okay.

42:27.120 --> 42:34.000
So now I want to fast forward to this week where I saw you did, or you were involved

42:34.000 --> 42:39.600
with CoLab's announcement for Roundcube's next funding initiative.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.600
They're calling it Roundcube Next.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.280
They're doing it on IndieGoGo.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.640
They have 58 days left.

42:44.640 --> 42:51.320
They've raised $13,629 of a goal of $80,000, 17% funded right now.

42:51.320 --> 42:55.560
How is Roundcube connected to CoLab and what's going on here?

42:55.560 --> 42:56.560
Yeah.

42:56.560 --> 43:02.520
So we obviously need an amazing world-class kick-ass web app to sit in front of it, right?

43:02.520 --> 43:06.280
I mean, if you don't have a web interface, you don't have a group or a server these days.

43:06.280 --> 43:09.200
And Roundcube, I think, has got the best interface out there.

43:09.200 --> 43:13.880
Well, the rest of the world agrees with you because it's the most popular free software

43:13.880 --> 43:16.680
webmail app on the internet.

43:16.680 --> 43:21.680
We know over half a million installations, and some of these are serving entire ISP,

43:21.680 --> 43:23.600
ASP communities.

43:23.600 --> 43:28.440
So there are millions of people literally every day who access their mail, their contacts,

43:28.440 --> 43:30.760
their calendar, et cetera, through Roundcube.

43:30.760 --> 43:36.400
So the connection between CoLab and Roundcube is that we needed something that was great.

43:36.400 --> 43:41.440
And before, we were using something called Horda, which had its limitations.

43:41.440 --> 43:46.640
And Georg, who I mentioned earlier, my good friend, founder, CEO of the company, he got

43:46.640 --> 43:51.640
together with Thomas Bruderley, who lives in Switzerland as well, as it turns out.

43:51.640 --> 43:57.440
And they sat down on a veranda with some beer in hand, as one does, and said, hey, we need

43:57.440 --> 43:59.480
a good web app.

43:59.480 --> 44:00.480
You make one.

44:00.480 --> 44:01.480
How can we make this work?

44:01.480 --> 44:08.420
And so what ended up happening is Thomas and the other, the second most important developer

44:08.420 --> 44:13.160
in terms of contribution and whatnot, both ended up working for CoLab Systems.

44:13.160 --> 44:20.640
So for the past few years, we've actually been paying for the large lion's share of

44:20.640 --> 44:24.760
Roundcube development, which we've been very happy to do, because it's an amazing product

44:24.760 --> 44:25.760
and we need it.

44:25.760 --> 44:28.040
So we have no problems with giving back like that.

44:28.040 --> 44:33.760
I don't know if I was quite aware of that level of, I didn't know that level of involvement.

44:33.760 --> 44:35.000
That's actually pretty great.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.520
And so, of course, the number one thing that the internet does is, well, what about?

44:39.520 --> 44:43.400
And they'll pick their favorite dark mail, mail pile, et cetera.

44:43.400 --> 44:48.320
Do you have any comments on where Roundcube fits in to some of these others that have

44:48.320 --> 44:51.560
also sort of gotten more popularity post Edward Snowden?

44:51.560 --> 44:52.800
Yeah.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.960
So I think that the more options we have, the better.

44:54.960 --> 44:59.120
It's always, I think, a for granted, as long as it's a free software.

44:59.120 --> 45:01.700
Not all the new things are.

45:01.700 --> 45:05.800
But what we can say for Roundcube is it has 10 years of history.

45:05.800 --> 45:08.120
It works now.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.960
And we plan to push it forward even further.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.840
I like the way you're doing this, too.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.160
The primary funding is like, OK, we get this primary funding.

45:15.160 --> 45:17.000
We're going to get this core figured out.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
We get to more funding.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.200
We're going to get some of these other things that are really nice to have figured out that

45:22.200 --> 45:23.200
would be really great.

45:23.200 --> 45:26.400
Then there's these stretch goals that are like the filter, the road warrior, the chatter,

45:26.400 --> 45:27.400
the organizer.

45:27.400 --> 45:32.040
It's just an interesting way to sort of display this.

45:32.040 --> 45:33.040
What do you think, Aaron?

45:33.040 --> 45:38.240
Are you so far pleased with the traction, $13,000 in two days?

45:38.240 --> 45:39.240
Yeah.

45:39.240 --> 45:40.240
That's fantastic.

45:40.240 --> 45:43.680
We're looking for a total of $80,000 to get the core done.

45:43.680 --> 45:45.840
And we're trying to be realistic about what it takes.

45:45.840 --> 45:50.480
We want to make sure we have enough resources to really make this happen.

45:50.480 --> 45:53.280
At the same time, we're going to continue to maintain Roundcube 1.

45:53.280 --> 45:55.120
We have to for clients as well.

45:55.120 --> 45:59.680
So it's a fairly big commitment on our part to make this happen.

45:59.680 --> 46:03.760
It's great to see the community of users pitch in.

46:03.760 --> 46:09.080
In fact, we actually just today had cPanel pick up one of the, actually the high-end

46:09.080 --> 46:10.080
perk.

46:10.080 --> 46:16.440
So they should be joining our advisory board as a result of that, which is great.

46:16.440 --> 46:20.280
And that's another part of this, right, is it's not just us looking for you to fund what

46:20.280 --> 46:25.280
we're doing, but there are two perk levels which are really aimed at people becoming

46:25.280 --> 46:26.280
more involved.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.820
So one of them is the Backstage Pass.

46:27.820 --> 46:29.800
It's for individuals.

46:29.800 --> 46:37.600
And the idea is that you get access to kind of the day-to-day, ongoing what we're doing.

46:37.600 --> 46:40.480
We do it all in the open, but this is a bit more than that.

46:40.480 --> 46:43.240
And you will be looked to back.

46:43.240 --> 46:47.760
So we really hope our dedicated users pick that one up, and a number already have.

46:47.760 --> 46:51.640
And then we've got the advisory committee, which is really aimed at large organizations

46:51.640 --> 46:54.120
that use Roundcube as part of their business.

46:54.120 --> 46:56.840
cPanel fits that perfectly.

46:56.840 --> 47:04.360
And it's an advisory committee that, as one does, you look for sage advice and wisdom

47:04.360 --> 47:07.040
from those who rely on you.

47:07.040 --> 47:11.960
So we're trying to make this a full kind of virtuous circle kind of thing.

47:11.960 --> 47:16.640
I see one potential flaw with all of this, one huge flaw, Aaron, I don't know if you've

47:16.640 --> 47:19.400
noticed, it kind of stands out like a sore thumb.

47:19.400 --> 47:23.160
Underneath your promo video, it says, Aaron Saigo, zero Facebook friends.

47:23.160 --> 47:24.560
It's very sad.

47:24.560 --> 47:28.200
It's just like Aaron has no friends, and I realize probably you don't have a Facebook

47:28.200 --> 47:30.040
profile, but that's bad marketing.

47:30.040 --> 47:34.200
I feel like that's kind of sad.

47:34.200 --> 47:35.200
That's right.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.200
Feel sad about me.

47:36.200 --> 47:37.200
Fund my own project.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.200
Yeah, there you go.

47:38.200 --> 47:39.200
Good work in your favor.

47:39.200 --> 47:40.200
All right.

47:40.200 --> 47:43.680
So just along the same line of questioning about the Snowden stuff, what about the popular

47:43.680 --> 47:47.760
demand for things like integration of GPG and things like that?

47:47.760 --> 47:52.320
Do you see a place for features like that in a fundraiser like this, or is that something

47:52.320 --> 47:56.120
outside of that or something down the road, what are your thoughts?

47:56.120 --> 48:01.400
So all of those stretch goals, the chatter, the organizer, yada, yada, those are actually

48:01.400 --> 48:08.320
all applications that will be added to RoundCube Next when it's all done.

48:08.320 --> 48:12.440
How fast we get there really relies on the kind of support we see.

48:12.440 --> 48:18.640
In amongst all that, GPG support is actually on the roadmap.

48:18.640 --> 48:22.600
It's a bit further down the roadmap because we want to be able to use their calendar first

48:22.600 --> 48:25.120
before they can use GPG to encrypt it.

48:25.120 --> 48:30.120
So there's a certain order to the madness there.

48:30.120 --> 48:33.520
But that's already something that's on our roadmap.

48:33.520 --> 48:36.600
In addition to that, so this is also what's kind of exciting to me, and we announced this

48:36.600 --> 48:40.640
at the Colab Summit as a Colab initiative in general, but RoundCube is also part of

48:40.640 --> 48:45.720
this, where we feel that we've done a really good job with asynchronous communication,

48:45.720 --> 48:48.720
mail calendaring, yada, yada, yada.

48:48.720 --> 48:52.440
And one of the things we're working on really hard this year to bring to the Colab side

48:52.440 --> 48:58.880
and we'll be putting into RoundCube Next as well is the synchronous side of it.

48:58.880 --> 49:04.520
So that's things like IM, instant messaging, which we'll be using Jabra for, WebRTC video

49:04.520 --> 49:14.620
chat, the whole deal, as well as, hold on to your seats, collaborative editing.

49:14.620 --> 49:19.360
So this is why we actually had both WebODF and LibreOffice at the Colab Summit.

49:19.360 --> 49:24.160
In fact, I have a handy little gif of one of the lead ODF developers and Michael Meeks

49:24.160 --> 49:28.320
sitting down together and smiling over some beers after dinner.

49:28.320 --> 49:31.400
So it's, yeah, this is something we take very seriously.

49:31.400 --> 49:33.400
Oh, this makes me very happy.

49:33.400 --> 49:38.920
So these are all stretch goals that we have that we'd love to hit with the RoundCube Next.

49:38.920 --> 49:43.100
And we have a roadmap that goes all the way through this.

49:43.100 --> 49:51.640
And so I suppose this is, if this happens, then you have Colab, something that's becoming

49:51.640 --> 49:55.720
more and more relevant really to the open source world, especially, again, post-Nodin

49:55.720 --> 49:58.720
and not to overuse it, but it's true.

49:58.720 --> 50:02.000
And you would have a truly first class mail client.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.620
I mean, at the end of the day, that's what we'd be accomplishing here is we would be

50:05.620 --> 50:12.120
integrating the best in web mail with the best of open source groupware collaboration.

50:12.120 --> 50:17.920
Yeah, I mean, if you look at it, whenever we talk to people about Colab these days,

50:17.920 --> 50:20.840
in their minds, they often go in one of two routes, right?

50:20.840 --> 50:25.600
One is it compared to Exchange on the one hand.

50:25.600 --> 50:30.820
And on the other hand, it is compared to Office 365 or Google Apps.

50:30.820 --> 50:39.040
And so we realize that the future is in this integrated online services kind of area where

50:39.040 --> 50:45.600
we can offer that full range of messaging and document editing on top of all those other

50:45.600 --> 50:46.600
things.

50:46.600 --> 50:50.640
And there's people in the channel going, but we all want GPG.

50:50.640 --> 50:52.760
And yes, it will come.

50:52.760 --> 50:55.440
One thing is that we want to do it right.

50:55.440 --> 50:59.040
There's a lot of people selling snake oil out there right now saying things like, oh,

50:59.040 --> 51:00.160
we encrypt it on our server.

51:00.160 --> 51:06.160
I know of one group that's doing that actually well, but they only do it with email.

51:06.160 --> 51:10.120
But there are others who are saying, yes, we encrypt it, but they hold all the keys,

51:10.120 --> 51:13.120
which makes it almost useless.

51:13.120 --> 51:15.240
Doing this right is non-trivial.

51:15.240 --> 51:20.720
And one thing that we commit to within Colab and Roundcube is when we do something, we

51:20.720 --> 51:23.760
try and do it right or not at all.

51:23.760 --> 51:26.960
So we will get to GPG support for sure.

51:26.960 --> 51:32.280
Like I said, it's on our roadmap, and we're committed to doing it properly.

51:32.280 --> 51:39.040
So it's over on Indiegogo right now, Indiegogo Roundcube Next is what you want to search

51:39.040 --> 51:40.040
for when you get over there.

51:40.040 --> 51:42.280
We'll have a link in the show notes as well.

51:42.280 --> 51:46.800
So if I wanted to get started with Colab, Aaron, just maybe for an on-premises installation

51:46.800 --> 51:50.760
or something like that, what would be a good spot to check that out?

51:50.760 --> 51:52.040
How do I get started?

51:52.040 --> 51:53.780
Is there a distro that comes preloaded?

51:53.780 --> 51:57.000
Is it just easier to just set something up and install it, go hosted?

51:57.000 --> 51:58.560
What's my best option there?

51:58.560 --> 51:59.560
Yeah.

51:59.560 --> 52:02.960
So if you go to colab.org, there is documentation.

52:02.960 --> 52:05.760
As you were talking about earlier, documentation is awesome.

52:05.760 --> 52:10.680
We've got pretty extensive documentation for many distributions, especially the more popular

52:10.680 --> 52:11.680
ones.

52:11.680 --> 52:21.480
It is add a repository, run your package managers foo of choice, and you get the packages put

52:21.480 --> 52:22.480
in.

52:22.480 --> 52:27.160
And there's a small post-installation routine that you run to put in, OK, what is your domain

52:27.160 --> 52:30.800
name that you want and et cetera.

52:30.800 --> 52:32.400
So that's really the easiest way.

52:32.400 --> 52:38.200
Personally, when I'm trying out a new version, I fire up a VM on my machine and install there.

52:38.200 --> 52:43.760
So that'll get you the community version, which is exactly the same as the enterprise

52:43.760 --> 52:44.760
version.

52:44.760 --> 52:49.480
There is some version drift between the two of them, depending on release dates, but we're

52:49.480 --> 52:50.480
not open core.

52:50.480 --> 52:52.320
We hold nothing back.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.720
If you get the community version, you actually get a very good idea of what the enterprise

52:55.720 --> 52:56.720
version gives you.

52:56.720 --> 53:02.200
And by not open core, you mean not just the core is open, everything is open.

53:02.200 --> 53:03.840
We only do free software.

53:03.840 --> 53:07.040
It's an ethical position for us as a company.

53:07.040 --> 53:12.700
So it's kind of like the Red Hat thing, and that's all we do, no matter what.

53:12.700 --> 53:13.700
So that'd be the way to go.

53:13.700 --> 53:15.840
Go to Collab.org, check that out.

53:15.840 --> 53:24.400
We just released 3.4 recently-ish, and Collab Enterprise 14 is based on that as well.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.680
So that was not so long ago.

53:26.680 --> 53:31.920
So we've got some really fresh, good stuff there.

53:31.920 --> 53:38.040
And you've got the usual slate of IRC channels and mailing lists and whatnot.

53:38.040 --> 53:39.040
Very cool, Aaron.

53:39.040 --> 53:41.880
Well, anything else you want to touch on before we bump along?

53:41.880 --> 53:46.680
And I was thinking, if you want to stick around for the rest of the show, we could discuss

53:46.680 --> 53:47.680
more of the GPG stuff.

53:47.680 --> 53:49.320
Rotten, you wanted to ask about the Road Warrior.

53:49.320 --> 53:50.960
Go ahead and fire that up before we wrap up.

53:50.960 --> 53:55.120
Yeah, I couldn't find a description of what that stretch goal meant, so I was just wondering,

53:55.120 --> 53:56.920
what does Road Warrior entail?

53:56.920 --> 53:58.720
Yes, we're teasing you.

53:58.720 --> 54:04.280
We will actually explain what all the stretch goals are over the next week, so as a way

54:04.280 --> 54:07.600
to just kind of continue that communication.

54:07.600 --> 54:12.280
So yeah, the Road Warrior is actually the collaborative editing.

54:12.280 --> 54:16.920
He's the guy who's on the road, and he needs to edit documents while he's going.

54:16.920 --> 54:19.680
So that's a good pick on that one.

54:19.680 --> 54:23.040
Yeah, before we go on, two really cool things, I think.

54:23.040 --> 54:24.960
One, you mentioned Docker earlier on.

54:24.960 --> 54:25.960
Yeah.

54:25.960 --> 54:30.240
One of the things we're doing in terms of deployment is we're actively working and coming

54:30.240 --> 54:33.880
to a near conclusion of the process of dockerizing the entire thing.

54:33.880 --> 54:34.880
Interesting.

54:34.880 --> 54:35.880
So that you'll be able to run...

54:35.880 --> 54:38.560
I mean, Colab is a swarm of microservices, really, right?

54:38.560 --> 54:39.560
Yeah.

54:39.560 --> 54:42.400
We have an LDAP server, IMAP server, SMTP, blah, blah, blah, blah.

54:42.400 --> 54:46.680
Each of those goes into its own Docker container, so you can install them all on a single VM

54:46.680 --> 54:53.040
or machine, or you can split them up one on each machine, set up fallbacks between the

54:53.040 --> 54:54.040
different services, et cetera.

54:54.040 --> 54:57.520
And Docker's going to make that, we think, a lot easier.

54:57.520 --> 55:00.200
So that's one thing we're doing that's really cool.

55:00.200 --> 55:03.880
Another really fun and cool thing that we're doing, well, I think it's fun and cool because

55:03.880 --> 55:13.000
it's ironic and funny, is in two weeks at the Microsoft Platinum-sponsored Plugfest

55:13.000 --> 55:21.160
event in southern Spain, we will be demoing Mapy, extended Mapy, with Colab, which means

55:21.160 --> 55:26.280
you'll be able to plug in the old, crappy Outlook directly into it, and it'll just go.

55:26.280 --> 55:27.280
So Outlook will...

55:27.280 --> 55:28.280
And Outlook will just what?

55:28.280 --> 55:30.600
Think it's talking to an Exchange server?

55:30.600 --> 55:31.600
That's right.

55:31.600 --> 55:34.480
We're doing that with the OpenChange people, which is why we had the lead OpenChange developer

55:34.480 --> 55:35.480
at the Colab Summit.

55:35.480 --> 55:36.480
That's how we go.

55:36.480 --> 55:37.480
That's huge.

55:37.480 --> 55:38.480
That's huge.

55:38.480 --> 55:43.840
Being able to say, I mean, the number one thing when I went into an office and talked

55:43.840 --> 55:48.860
about Zimbra, the first question was, what's the Outlook story?

55:48.860 --> 55:49.860
Every single time.

55:49.860 --> 55:54.160
I mean, people that have worked in Outlook are like, I know guys that they literally

55:54.160 --> 55:59.680
spend their entire workflow inside freaking Outlook, their meeting hounds, and they have

55:59.680 --> 56:00.680
to have it.

56:00.680 --> 56:02.240
That's going to be huge, Aaron.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.240
Yeah.

56:03.240 --> 56:07.480
And I mean, we were a bit concerned because from the free software perspective, Zarafa

56:07.480 --> 56:11.160
was pretty much the only ones who had this, and they've dropped support for it.

56:11.160 --> 56:18.000
So we will become the only truly free software group or solution out there with this.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.280
And we're really happy to work with the OpenChange people to make that happen.

56:21.280 --> 56:22.280
So yeah.

56:22.280 --> 56:27.640
And for the really big institutions, they should come talk to us about things like boring

56:27.640 --> 56:31.680
things like data loss prevention and audit trails, which we're also bringing online,

56:31.680 --> 56:36.760
but probably not as interesting to your audience here, but for the corporate audience, that's

56:36.760 --> 56:37.760
it.

56:37.760 --> 56:38.760
But necessary.

56:38.760 --> 56:39.760
Yes.

56:39.760 --> 56:40.760
Yeah.

56:40.760 --> 56:41.760
Yeah, absolutely.

56:41.760 --> 56:42.760
Cool.

56:42.760 --> 56:43.760
Wow.

56:43.760 --> 56:44.760
That is really exciting.

56:44.760 --> 56:45.760
And audit trails, I can tell you, in industries I worked in before, that is also sometimes

56:45.760 --> 56:47.120
an essential feature.

56:47.120 --> 56:51.760
And one that lacks in most software packages right now, even the ones that tout their audit

56:51.760 --> 56:52.760
trail functionality.

56:52.760 --> 56:53.760
Yeah.

56:53.760 --> 56:54.760
Tell us about it.

56:54.760 --> 56:59.000
Auditing, audit trails and data loss prevention means we keep an extra copy of your email

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
somewhere on a disk.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Yeah.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
Yeah.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Yeah.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.960
We got really good logs that you can go through.

57:04.960 --> 57:05.960
All right.

57:05.960 --> 57:06.960
Cool.

57:06.960 --> 57:07.960
Well, that is really exciting.

57:07.960 --> 57:08.960
And Aaron, you are...

57:08.960 --> 57:10.200
I know it's...

57:10.200 --> 57:11.360
What time is it where you're at right now?

57:11.360 --> 57:12.360
It's late, right?

57:12.360 --> 57:13.360
It's like 11?

57:13.360 --> 57:14.360
Yeah.

57:14.360 --> 57:15.360
No, it's after midnight.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.360
Okay.

57:16.360 --> 57:21.520
So if you are free to leave, if you want to go crash, you're welcome to stay with us.

57:21.520 --> 57:29.120
We're going to get the pulse from the Mumble Room on their reactions to Ubuntu 15.04 in

57:29.120 --> 57:30.120
just a moment.

57:30.120 --> 57:31.120
So that's what we're going to shift gears.

57:31.120 --> 57:34.800
And of course, if you want to stick around and sort of just do freestyle Q&A after the

57:34.800 --> 57:38.040
show, you're also welcome, because I'm sure people have lots of questions.

57:38.040 --> 57:40.480
I wanted, though, because we haven't...

57:40.480 --> 57:45.480
Because of Linux Fest Northwest, we didn't normally dedicate time like we would to review

57:45.480 --> 57:47.880
Ubuntu 15.04 outright.

57:47.880 --> 57:51.000
And so I wanted to start the process here on the show to kind of start to make up for

57:51.000 --> 57:55.840
that and get the Mumble Room's reaction, because I actually have limited experience with 15.04

57:55.840 --> 57:56.840
at this point.

57:56.840 --> 57:57.840
I've been using Ubuntu Mate.

57:57.840 --> 58:02.400
I do have a few thoughts, and I have a few observations and some funny reactions that

58:02.400 --> 58:07.880
I've noticed in the reviews, plus 15.10 is coming up, but first, got to thank our friends

58:07.880 --> 58:08.880
over at Ting.

58:08.880 --> 58:09.880
Go to linux.ting.com.

58:09.880 --> 58:11.440
Everybody in the chat room, will you do this for me right now?

58:11.440 --> 58:15.280
I want you to try it, because they got something that I think if you try, it's really going

58:15.280 --> 58:16.280
to make you think.

58:16.280 --> 58:18.000
So go to linux.ting.com right now.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.500
Head over there, and I want you to try out the Ting Savings Calculator.

58:21.500 --> 58:22.500
So go over there.

58:22.500 --> 58:24.160
We'll do this while I tell you about Ting.

58:24.160 --> 58:25.400
So click the Savings Calculator.

58:25.400 --> 58:26.640
Start putting in your actual usage.

58:26.640 --> 58:27.760
Now, what is Ting?

58:27.760 --> 58:28.760
Ting is truly mobile.

58:28.760 --> 58:29.760
That makes sense.

58:29.760 --> 58:32.560
No contracts, so there's no early termination fee.

58:32.560 --> 58:33.840
You only pay for what you use.

58:33.840 --> 58:34.840
You start with the line.

58:34.840 --> 58:37.960
It's $6, so that's your flat rate right there for that line, and then they just take your

58:37.960 --> 58:39.560
minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

58:39.560 --> 58:40.560
They add that up.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.380
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you have to pay.

58:42.380 --> 58:46.980
So for me, it makes it very economical to have three lines, and paying like $30, $40

58:46.980 --> 58:49.480
for a busy month, because I use Wi-Fi very heavily.

58:49.480 --> 58:53.880
I do a lot of data calling, and I use Telegram, but if something sends me an automated text

58:53.880 --> 58:54.880
message, not a big deal.

58:54.880 --> 58:57.880
I don't need to buy a whole bunch of text messages for those occasional text messages.

58:57.880 --> 59:01.780
I'll just pay some tiny fraction of an amount when I get one, and Ting has an incredible

59:01.780 --> 59:05.200
dashboard that lets you manage your account really, really nice, activate, deactivate

59:05.200 --> 59:10.320
devices, transfer them, name them, audit them, really cool stuff.

59:10.320 --> 59:14.120
They have, of course, all the features you'd come to expect, picture messaging, texting,

59:14.120 --> 59:15.680
voicemail, everything.

59:15.680 --> 59:18.440
In fact, I shouldn't say it like that.

59:18.440 --> 59:22.640
They've got way, way, way, way more than you've come to expect, like no hold customer service.

59:22.640 --> 59:25.080
You can call them at 1-855-TING-FTW.

59:25.080 --> 59:26.320
Who else has got that, right?

59:26.320 --> 59:27.800
They've got hotspot and tethering.

59:27.800 --> 59:29.160
You want it, you just turn it on.

59:29.160 --> 59:31.020
You don't have to have some sort of special plan.

59:31.020 --> 59:33.080
They're not going to punish you.

59:33.080 --> 59:34.840
They're not going to slow you down.

59:34.840 --> 59:37.840
They're not going to say, excuse me, you need a family share plan if you want tethering.

59:37.840 --> 59:41.560
No, you just go into your operating system and check the box, like the way the OS vendor

59:41.560 --> 59:43.340
intended it to be.

59:43.340 --> 59:44.400
That's what's so cool about Ting.

59:44.400 --> 59:45.400
It's just data to them.

59:45.400 --> 59:48.020
If you want to use them as ISP, Ting is Honey Badger.

59:48.020 --> 59:49.020
They don't care.

59:49.020 --> 59:50.080
In fact, they love it.

59:50.080 --> 59:52.600
They just lit up their first Gigabit Fiber customer.

59:52.600 --> 59:53.600
How about that?

59:53.600 --> 59:54.600
That's pretty exciting.

59:54.600 --> 59:55.600
Yeah, Ting's getting into Gigabit Fiber.

59:55.600 --> 59:59.560
They're not going to go crazy, but they're experimenting with this right now.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:05.040
And they just launched, I guess it looks like Brian Callahan, who's the owner of Rock Bridge

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.120
Guitar in Charlottesville, Virginia.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.680
The first to get Gigabit Internet Fiber with Ting.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:12.680
Wow, that's pretty cool.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.960
Man, I'm super jelly.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.120
I'm super jelly.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.520
But you can get in on Ting's wireless plan.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.640
They got a bunch of great devices.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:18.640
They're unlocked.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.640
You own them outright.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.040
You can get a $9 GSM SIM card and put it in any device that supports SIMs, or you can

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.360
get a device directly from Ting.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.960
They got everything from really great value feature phones up to the highest end smartphones.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960
Linux.ting.com.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.720
Go there to support this show.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.380
Linux.ting.com also gets you a $25 discount off one of those devices I just mentioned.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:42.160
If you have a Ting compatible device, and you probably do because they have a huge GSM

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.600
network now and a huge CMA network.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.600
If you have one of those devices that works on those networks, that $25 will go to a service

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.080
credit.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.700
That service credit will very likely pay for more than your first month.

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.920
That's how great Ting is.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.800
$25 will probably pay for more than your first month.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800
It did mine.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.760
If you're a super crazy talker or something, I don't know.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.760
I don't know.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760
I'm not judging, but I'm just saying.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.760
Geez, really?

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.760
That's kind of ridiculous.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.760
Get Skype.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.760
No, I'm kidding.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.600
No, really, but it will seriously... Plus, they have an early termination relief program

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.040
too if you've got a contract right now, and then it really starts adding up.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:22.080
Linux.ting.com, and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.660
All right, so Mumble Room.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.040
Anybody want to go first with their reactions?

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040
You know what?

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.280
I'm going to ask Wimpy, since he shipped a distro based on it, and then the other people

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.280
can fill in.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.640
But Wimpy, if you don't mind, what are your initial reactions to the Ubuntu 15.04 release,

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.360
either from more of a lower end perspective or from a perspective of the user side?

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:51.400
Well, from my own point of view, I really like the 15.04 release.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.400
In some respects, I prefer it to the 14.04 release.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.880
This is really from an Ubuntu Mate perspective, and that's because you will have noticed that

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:07.600
Debbie and Jesse released a few days after 15.04, so consequently, a lot of the work

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:14.920
that I've been doing in Debian, which has flowed into Ubuntu, was done as part of the

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.760
Debian LTS strategy, so it's kind of a shame.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:25.440
The one drawback of 15.04 is it's only got that nine month support window, because in

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:32.960
terms of Mate implementation, it's really solid, so it's going to be a shame to see

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.440
that one go away in nine months time.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:44.160
But I think for Ubuntu as a whole, on the desktop, there were some improvements in stock

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:51.160
in Ubuntu, but it's really the under the covers stuff that's really evolved in 15.04.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:55.200
So system D, for example, is one area where there's been change.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:03.440
And then in the server side of things with things like Snappy and Juju and Mass, there's

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.520
been some big advancements.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:11.280
So I think it's actually quite an important stepping stone release to where, you know,

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.760
Canonical want to get to.

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:16.440
Let me pick one thing out that you mentioned there, and maybe I can rope Popi in here,

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:22.000
because according to the register, everything's fine except for Ubuntu is now full of system

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.940
D. Listen to this, the initial review line starts, system D is here.

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:32.480
It's arrived in Vivid, the latest just released distro of Ubuntu 15.04.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.960
Essentially, Popi, apparently Canonical has condemned us all to system D. Now, how are

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.080
you feeling about that?

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:48.680
So the day that I switched from Upstart to system D was an ultimately uneventful day.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.840
I followed you on Google Plus, I remember.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:51.840
As it should be.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:52.840
Yeah.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.640
It was a package update, basically, right?

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.640
Right.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.040
And I switched back the other way and then switched forward again.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:03.320
And actually, in 15.04, if you really, really want to, you can use Upstart, you don't have

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:09.080
to use system D. So, you know, it's not compulsory to use system D if you're that way inclined.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.440
I did not expect the switch to happen so soon.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.160
So in terms of like full switch over, is there still some sort of like compatibility happening

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.880
or like is everything truly like system D scripts and it's all 100% done?

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.200
Well, the desktop is, but the phone isn't.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:28.000
So the phone is still using Upstart for user sessions.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.240
So that will switch probably in 15.10.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:37.940
But there's a whole bunch of stuff that needs to happen for that to actually work.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:42.640
But yeah, we did it for 15.04, that'll happen for 15.10, no doubt.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:48.800
Also in 15.04, Upstart still used for X sessions as well.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.520
Yeah, that's not too surprising, I suppose.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.940
So there is a little Upstart still in there for some things.

01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:00.320
But it boots unbelievably fast, unbelievably 15.04 boots fast.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.640
That was one of my initial impressions.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:06.080
In fact, Wimpy, you nailed it when you said, I wish 15.04 was going to stick around longer

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.160
because I like it a little bit better than 14.04.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.120
I like it a lot better than 14.04, actually.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.680
Yeah, I do.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.920
It's the system that I'm installing on all my stuff now.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.320
I've kicked the LTS thing into touch, 15.04.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.240
So are you just going to replace it later then?

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:25.220
Well, for those machines have already got installed, just an upgrade.

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:29.600
And for those that I'm installing fresh, just going straight to 15.04.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.640
Anybody else in the Mumber room want to jump in with their impressions?

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.800
Matt, if you have any impressions on 15.04, feel free.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.920
You know, I'm always one of those people who tends to hold off until it's been out till

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.120
just to the point where the next release is and then I'm popping into the new one.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.360
I'm still on LTSs on both of my boxes.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.360
It works for you.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.360
Yeah, it works for me.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.360
But the speed thing has piqued my interest because that does sound appealing because

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:55.840
some of the machines I use, I do like to turn off and have them boot up reasonably quickly.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.840
So that's cool.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:57.840
I like that.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.840
So you know what you ought to do then, Matt?

01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.840
What's that?

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:00.840
You ought to hang out and wait for 15.10.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.840
I mean, I hate the way this happens.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.800
I hate that they just got out and now we're talking about 15.10.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:09.680
But we've gotten the code name for Ubuntu 15.10.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.760
It's going to be called Willy Werewolf, which is kind of silly.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.760
What?

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:14.760
Wiley.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:15.760
Yeah, I read about this.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.760
Wiley.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.760
Sorry, Wiley.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.760
Yes, Wiley.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.760
Wiley.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.080
Wiley was a joke I was making earlier, totally unrelated and it got stuck in my head.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.320
Wiley Werewolf, because Wiley is supposed to be somebody who's wise and crafty, right?

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.720
So yes.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:36.760
And with an October time frame and the scuttlebutt is to focus on the desktop.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.760
What does that mean, Poby?

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:46.620
So there's the usual desktop release in 15.10, which will have all the usual updates and

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:53.200
probably I'd imagine the new kernel with live kernel patching without having to reboot.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.040
That'll be nice.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.240
And all the usual updates, you know, Firefox, LibreOffice and all that.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.440
So a few other interesting things as well.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:05.120
I feel like you're burying the awkward teenage lead, though, and that is this is where we

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:10.160
begin to see like the converged desktop come together, right?

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.800
This is right, isn't it?

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.800
Bits of it.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800
Yeah.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.800
I mean, there'll be the I mean, we've already got the Unity Next ISO, which we've had for

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.960
four months, but then we're going to integrate Snappy into that.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:24.960
Here's what I'm trying to get at.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.960
Yeah.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.760
Here's what I'm trying to get at is I hear it's a full time.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.960
Tell me what you want to talk about, because you're telling me nothing that you're saying.

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.680
You're saying I'm saying it's a focus on the desktop.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.160
I'm reading it's a focus on the desktop from several news outlets.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.000
But then when I ask what's going to happen on the desktop, I hear Snappy packages and

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I hear a live patching kernel, which are awesome, but they're not desktop.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I'm just curious.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I don't care.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.880
I'm just it seems like the focus is on desktop.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.120
I'd be kind of interested to see what that direction goes, because I've I've been one

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.920
of these people really curious where canonical is going to take it eventually.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.920
And I know that it's more like the 16 series before we're going to see Unity eight probably

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.160
be default and things like that.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.520
But man, I'm just curious.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.440
So I don't know if you were listening to Mark's.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.440
I haven't.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:07.440
No, I haven't heard that yet.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.640
Oh, well, maybe you should have a plan.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:18.200
He mentioned that 2015 there'll be a convergence device before the end of the year.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.080
So I have I did pull the quote I did manage.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.400
I did manage to grab that he said I would like to announce that we're going to ship

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:28.560
a device this year with a manufacturer that will fit in your pocket and be a phone and

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.260
give you a desktop experience.

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:34.140
That PC pocket experience is real on Ubuntu.

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:37.560
So am I to interpret that as to sort of the focus on the desktop is the beginning of things

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.280
to make that device possible towards later of the year?

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.340
Yeah, it kind of goes from both directions.

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:48.680
So from the desktop, you know, moving towards snappy and also from the phone moving towards

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.680
the desktop.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.920
So yeah, having a conversion device by 1510.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.920
Yeah.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.680
So that's what I really wanted is I wanted you to say Ubuntu Teen Wolf is going to focus

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.720
on a brand new software center.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.720
That's what I wanted you to say.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.720
You software center.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.720
That's what I wanted.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:02.720
Follow me.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.720
But I know it's not going to happen.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.720
It's OK.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.560
I got to wait till you guys are all done because then I'm sure you're going to have to write

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.000
it in whatever is fancy for click backers.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.480
It already exists on the phone.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:16.460
The click store already exists on the phone and on the new and on Unity next desktop.

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:19.240
You can open the click store on the desktop right now.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.240
I guess so.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.040
And I guess apps work either way.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.080
But do you see do you see that eventually becoming like a full on replacement to the

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:29.140
software centers, like all of the applications that we get from the software center would

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.680
be in there, too?

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:31.680
Yep.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:37.920
Oh, the snappy store will be the place where you get apps and you could install a separate

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.920
store on there as well.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.920
Isn't that everything?

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.800
So eventually then Ubuntu software center would probably just kind of go away.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:45.800
Yeah.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:46.800
Yeah.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.800
OK.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.800
Oh, my God, we need a poppy.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:49.800
Save us.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:55.040
It's actually funny, I looked at the change log for software center and there was one

01:09:55.040 --> 01:10:01.180
change back in January this year and then the last change to software center was April

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.180
the previous year.

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:05.760
So, yeah, software center hasn't had a huge amount of love recently.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.640
No, but it makes sense if you're moving to something new, I guess.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.440
So any any other thoughts on 1504 before we wrap up?

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:19.240
So the weird thing for me is I've been running 1504 for months, you know, I upgrade early

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.000
and I'm running it as my daily machine.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.280
So whenever I'm on release day, I'm like, all right, yeah, everyone else is catching

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.280
up.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.280
Yeah, I know.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.320
Because I when I'm usually going to do a review, I try to run it for quite a while before

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.320
the review.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:36.880
So sometimes I'll start sort of late beta RC just to kind of start to get a feel for

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:37.880
it.

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.680
And so it kind of does take away a little bit of the the excitement on release takes

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.360
like, yeah, OK.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.040
What release day usually means for me is I get a few more package updates.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.060
That's usually what release day means.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:51.000
And overall seems to be reviewed pretty well.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.400
That register piece, I think, was a bit tongue in cheek about the system stuff because it's

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.760
really been a non story.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.680
And it seems to be a pretty positive reaction overall.

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.460
The meta review would be it's good.

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:01.820
Not too many changes, but it's still good.

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.960
And I think that's not a bad place to be.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:07.920
There's actually a cool feature that the upstart syntax still works.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.800
And when you activate it, it kind of sends a script through system D.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:11.800
Neat.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.420
Corky, you wanted to give Kabuntu some airtime.

01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:22.280
I'm not a user, but I've been using Plasma 5 recently on Arch.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:28.440
And isn't it 1504 is the first to do default Plasma 5.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:37.160
And yes, from initial reviews, it's just fantastic for a first time default desktop environment.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.160
That is great.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.560
I have also been playing with Plasma 5.3 over the weekend.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.560
I found it to be a little buggy, but nice.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:49.160
And I've only seen good feedback about Plasma 5 in 1504.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.760
So I'm using 5.3, but I'm doing it under a high DPI display, which makes it a little

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.320
trickier because KDE doesn't quite.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:00.000
So what you do is you go scale up your icons, and you go scale up the text DPI, and you

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.400
go tweak about four or five spots in KDE.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.280
And it's actually pretty darn nice on high DPI.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:14.280
And the breeze theme with Plasma and the breeze icons and all of that stuff look really sharp.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:19.680
The Plasma desktop, I think 5, now they're shipping 5.2 in Kubuntu 1504.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.680
That's a really good release.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:26.080
I think 5.3 may be slightly buggier, but also 5.3 introduces a lot of nice new features

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.320
for laptops.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.800
So it's kind of, and the new media center demos in there.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:36.260
So yeah, you're right, Kubuntu 1504 is a fantastic release.

01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:40.200
And if you've been looking for a well implemented Plasma desktop, sounds like that could be

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.200
a really good one.

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:48.600
And if you're on Arch, 5.3 recently hit the repos, and it's really nice.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:53.360
Only reason I went back to GNOME is I started having sound problems again.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:59.600
And what happens is under 5.3 is it's after I get a notification on the desktop, I get

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.000
another notification immediately after that saying, I have changed the sound device to

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.960
Intel HDMI out.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960
Would you like to revert?

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:13.640
I have to click revert, and then it goes back to my Intel standard HD audio, whatever it

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.640
is.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.160
And then it happens in a few minutes later.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:20.560
So between that and a few other things, I just went back to GNOME.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.200
But it's really, really good.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.560
Ww, you had something you wanted to add on Plasma.

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:31.880
Yeah, I had nothing but issues with Plasma 5.2 on my Intel laptop with Nvidia.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:39.080
Once I went from the Novu driver to a Nvidia driver, I've had like, I need to track down

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.440
this issue or see if others are having it.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:50.480
I went to rebooting after two minutes after I hit reboot on the menu, it would just finally

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.400
pop up.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:14:00.480
So I eventually went Plasma 5.3 with the back ports, and that works out way better for me.

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.480
I still think there's some things that need to be polished out though.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:11.480
We had a meetup back in October, it was a while ago, where producer Eric and I met up

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.680
with some folks from the KDE project in Seattle.

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.080
And they said, yeah, you know, we're really excited about Plasma 5.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:21.240
But the one that we think is going to be ready for everybody is Plasma 5.3.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:24.480
When Plasma 5.3 ships, start telling your listeners to install it, because we think

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.480
that's going to be the one.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:29.360
We'll have a lot of our art stuff done in that one, and all this kind of stuff.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.000
And I got to say, it's very nice.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.200
It feels, it has right now, this might seem a little brutal, but I had the sensation that

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:41.960
it feels like a race car, like a really high-end race car, kit car.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.160
Really powerful, crazy fast, the best compositor.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.940
I don't know what it is, guys, but even when I'm typing in freaking console, the way the

01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:54.120
text appears in the console feels slicker than the way it does under Gnome Terminal.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.640
And I can't even, like I tried it, and then I logged out and went into Gnome Terminal,

01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:00.280
and I'm like, what are they doing differently?

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:03.720
And for some reason, it feels smoother under KDE.

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:09.560
It is a slick, fast, smooth experience that every now and then completely falls apart

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:10.560
on me.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.080
I probably had the Plasma desktop crash on me six or seven times.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:17.480
And most of the times, it's whenever I'm messing around with widgets, but I don't even have

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.480
to be trying a widget.

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.980
If I can just right-click on the desktop, unlock widgets, add widget, scroll through

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:24.840
the widget list, close it, Plasma crashes.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.640
Oh, okay.

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.040
That kind of stuff.

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.280
And I'll give it this, it bounces right back.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:34.460
It restarts and everything, nothing, I don't lose anything.

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:37.440
It's not really any big consequence, it's just annoying.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.000
Or my sound constantly changing is annoying.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:45.240
And I feel like it's just a little rough still, but if you are the type of person who likes

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.800
that kind of experience, that sort of sports car kit experience, it is great.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.880
It is in a good spot right now, and it's looking better than ever, too, which I'm really pleased

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:55.880
with.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.800
So, yeah, there's Dairy Corky, there's your Kubuntu Airtime.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.880
I don't talk about it a lot because I don't use it, but I did happen to run Plasma over

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.360
the weekend, and I walked away with those observations.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.760
All right, guys, I think we're all done.

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:10.880
I think we had a lot to cover.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.280
Aaron, thanks so much for joining us.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.920
If you'd like, we're going to do a little post-show in just a bit.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.440
You can stick around and chat with us.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.360
Thank you very much, sir.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.200
And we'd love to have you join us out there live.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.840
I mean you, listener, you, join our virtual lug.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.360
Just go over to jblive.tv.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.280
We do this show on Tuesdays at 2 p.m. Pacific.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:31.260
You can go to jubilabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted over to your

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:32.260
local time.

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:35.720
And then you can hang out in our chat room or our mumble room and talk with us as we

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:36.720
do the show.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:40.680
Matt, is there anything you want to plug or mention before we get out of here today?

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:44.000
Nothing too pressing, however, if you want to keep up with the latest stuff that we have

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.800
going, including how to Linux, which I receive emails on a daily basis about, you can check

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.720
me out at matthartley.com, and you can hit me up with contacts.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.200
You can subscribe to the email alerts, which will tell you when things like how to Linux

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.200
come out.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.200
So yeah, check that out.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.200
Matthartley.com.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.400
I'm excited to hear that people are pumped about how to Linux.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.400
Oh, you should see my inbox.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.400
Great.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.360
Don't forget you can fill our inbox too.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.240
Go to jubilabroadcasting.com slash contact.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:11.800
Choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown, or maybe even better, join our subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:15.160
Makes this show better, community feedback, stories, topics, votes, all that stuff is

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.160
great.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.160
I'd love to see you live, jblive.tv.

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.160
All right, everybody.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.900
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:22.640
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:17:50.900 --> 01:18:01.660
Okay, we have just a little titles business to take care of before we get out of here.

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:02.660
JBtitles.com.

01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:03.660
Everybody go over there and vote.

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:04.660
Or you can still bang suggest.

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:05.980
You still have probably a chance to get your title in too.

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:08.580
Aaron, it's good to catch up with you.

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.540
I don't think we've talked since you joined Colab.

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:13.700
No, I don't think we have.

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.540
And when I saw that move, I thought, oh, that's a good one.

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:17.540
That's a good place to go.

01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:20.460
And man, the timing and all of that, that was crazy.

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.900
We could have worked out a little bit better.

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:23.900
Yeah, no.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:27.420
And it's, I mean, there's so much to be done in this space.

01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:33.080
And yeah, I know so many of the people involved with it already, it was a pretty easy transition

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.340
and yeah, lots to keep me busy and excited.

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:40.500
Blame the chat room is our third position title right now.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.180
JBtitles, bang suggest.com.

01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.180
Everybody vote.

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:50.020
So Aaron, you mentioned open clients for Colab.

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:54.340
I haven't looked at Colab, I'm very sorry.

01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.500
You mentioned there's clients on multiple platforms.

01:18:56.500 --> 01:19:02.740
Are you talking about like third party clients or are they first party clients that you guys

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:04.600
have developed?

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.820
They're second party clients.

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:13.180
I don't know what that would mean, but yeah, no, we've got Contact, which we actually do

01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:17.460
enterprise support for on Windows as well as Linux.

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:22.820
On Mac, we rely on Apple's own apps just because they work really well.

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:26.900
And from our feedback, that's what Mac people prefer to use.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:31.860
So we support web dev, web cal, or cal dev, blah, blah, blah.

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:35.820
And all of that stuff is supported as first class citizens in the Mac world.

01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:44.000
And then on the mobile side, it's mostly active sync with some platforms anyways.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.700
We do recommend on Android using things like DavDroid because that gives a slightly more

01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:51.780
privacy respecting experience.

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:57.540
So it's mostly whatever app the user is familiar with already or whatever app ships with the

01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:02.580
platform already can connect and you provide instructions for connecting to your back end,

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:03.580
right?

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:09.020
Yeah, with the exception of Contact on Windows and Linux.

01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:12.620
And what's used on Android, active sync on Android?

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:19.900
So on Android, our recommended mix is DavDroid plus canine mail.

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:26.620
And that gives you access to everything, your contacts, your calendars, your email, et cetera.

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:32.860
But if you don't go that road or you can't go that road for some reason or you just want

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:36.220
to stick with what Android comes with, then active sync also works just fine.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:41.100
I have devices where I have one or the other, so I've tried both and yeah, they work.

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.100
Active sync is cool.

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.100
How about you?

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.740
No, no, you don't seem like you're going to break it any second.

01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:47.740
Okay, good.

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:52.140
Because I feel like maybe my blood pressure is high right now and I left my watch upstairs

01:20:52.140 --> 01:21:00.620
so I can't take my heart rate, but I tell you, I literally have an A and B comparison.

01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:05.920
So here's what I want to admit to right up front before I go any further into this discussion.

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:10.820
This only applies to me and because of my use case scenario where I'm in front of these

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:17.620
two computers for an extended period of time every single day except for Saturdays, I just

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:20.180
think maybe this only applies to me, okay?

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:23.060
I don't even know if it applies to anybody else in the entire freaking universe.

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.060
I'm so special.

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:28.180
But here, because I'm such a special unicorn, here is what I have observed.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:34.460
The stable releases of Linux, their updates break everything just as much as my rolling

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.460
release.

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:36.460
No, way more, way more.

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:37.460
And you know what?

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.420
I'm not even going to couch it.

01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:43.760
The rolling release breaks way less than the Ubuntu 14.04.

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:44.760
And here's what happens.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.480
About once a month, I install updates.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.700
Now I cannot recall how long this has been on Ubuntu 14.04, but we're going on like six

01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:52.700
months probably, a little more.

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.300
Here's what I have observed.

01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.160
About once a month, I install updates.

01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:00.060
And if you have watched the jblive.tv stream and we're not live, you may have noticed we

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:01.820
no longer have videos playing.

01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:04.740
We instead are rebroadcasting our audio stream.

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:06.340
Why you might ask?

01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:11.940
Because an update to Ubuntu 14.04 broke our capability to play video and same stereo mp3

01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:13.860
audio over the HDMI interface.

01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:17.480
We can no longer do that because an update on Ubuntu 14.04 broke that.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.500
So now our live stream just is a replay of our audio stream.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:26.060
And now today, I did an update yesterday, I noticed today all of the audio interface,

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:28.460
one of the audio interfaces fails to even show up.

01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:32.820
I had to completely power cycle the machine, unplug the device, power cycle the machine

01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:36.220
back up, plug the USB device in, and then of course I had to go back in and choose

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:42.140
all of my audio inputs, readjust all of their levels, and all I did was install updates.

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:45.580
The last time I did this, we lost an audio device.

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:51.120
The time before that, our video driver got messed up and it's an Intel video card.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:56.660
Then almost on a day-by-day basis, maybe about once a week when I'm busy, I update the arch

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:59.740
box running on my System76 Bonobo.

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:02.900
One is an Intel NUC, one is a System76 Bonobo.

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.140
Both make great Linux machines.

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:05.840
It's not a hardware thing, okay?

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.660
You can take hardware out of this because it's about as vanilla as it gets.

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:14.380
The Bonobo running Arch, getting updates on a rolling release, never fails.

01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:18.180
I cannot do a show without this Bonobo.

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:22.380
It drives all of the visuals, it drives all of the sounds, I can't show a story in a video

01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:23.660
without this Bonobo.

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:27.140
It is literally one of the most, besides the machine that actually records the video, it

01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:32.180
is the most important machine in the studio and it runs Arch Linux rolling and it breaks

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:33.220
the least.

01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:38.580
The Ubuntu machines and the Macs break more than the Arch Box does and I'm not doing anything

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.300
special.

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:45.280
So I don't get why everybody always gets on my case about how awful rolling is when in

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:51.280
my experience here, I tell you, the systems that are supposed to be long-term support

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.580
seem to break just as much as, or more, and I'm saying just as much because honestly I

01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:57.780
think everybody's going to attack me.

01:23:57.780 --> 01:24:02.540
But I think they break even more, but I'll say they break just as well as the rolling

01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:03.860
release machines do.

01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:09.860
So what I do not understand is the constant dogpiling when I go out there and say, actually

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:14.060
I don't think rolling is all that bad, or like when I wanted to switch Angela to a machine

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:17.140
and it was going to be rolling, the dogpile, oh don't do rolling, don't do rolling, everything's

01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:22.060
all going to be all right, well actually my rolling machines break less than my stable

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:23.060
machines.

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:26.660
So how do you guys explain this total dichotomy that I seem to be witnessing?

01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:33.320
I apparently have like jumped through a portal and I am now a slider in an alternative version

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:38.140
of Earth where rolling releases are more stable and long-term supports are more disastrous

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:43.380
and yet nobody else is in the same universe with me, I'm over there all by myself.

01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:47.820
It's always like that, Chris, because you know, the rolling release distros have more

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:53.260
practice in terms of software updates so they can do it a lot more, but they found all the

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:59.420
problems already, the ones that do it every once in a while like Ubuntu, they tend to

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:05.460
just, you know, run into problems or overwrite config files or corner cases that no one cares

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:06.460
about.

01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:11.740
Rolling has a lot more practice with updating packages all the time.

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:17.660
That seems pretty reasonable, that seems like a reasonable explanation as to why.

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:23.020
And you know, I always do rolling nowadays, Slackware is like where everything should

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:24.540
be just, you know.

01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:28.700
Okay, well here was my theory, heavens, and this is what I wanted to bounce off you.

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:34.980
What if software has gotten better and so it's now not as hazardous to go to the next

01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:35.980
version as it used to be?

01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:36.980
Is that possible?

01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:42.740
Like, like Linux version 2 was a completely different beast than Linux version 4 is now

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:47.380
and you know, it's a much more mature product now and so is the Nvidia driver and so is

01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:49.840
GNOME 3, much, much more mature, right?

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.940
So is Chrome and Firefox and GTK and all of these things in the stack now are just much

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:57.700
more mature products.

01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:05.300
Yeah, but they'll also when you do coding, right, you usually kind of have a backwards

01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.060
compatibility thing with your previous version.

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:15.980
So if a version is only increasing or incrementing by one major version each time as a rolling

01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:21.500
distro versus Ubuntu's maybe skipping two or three versions at a time, they don't have

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:25.980
the backwards compatibility or at least the code in order to say, oh yeah, last release

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:26.980
we've done this.

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:28.620
We've got to change the data structure this way.

01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:32.660
Okay, so here's the other thing that kind of I don't get about the, now I know, I think

01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:36.380
I eventually did get my kernel updated here, so let me double check real quick.

01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.380
So I'll do a uname here.

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:40.860
I'm not an RPM fan at all.

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:42.100
Okay, no, never mind.

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:46.300
So even though I've done a dist upgrade, so I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 and it ships with kernel

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:47.300
3.13.0.

01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:51.540
Now I think there is a way to update that, but I'm an Ubuntu matei, I've done all the,

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:56.320
I've done apt-get update, I've done dist upgrades, I'm on kernel 3.13.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.860
Now this is generally considered not like the best kernel of the three series, right?

01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:03.020
This is considered one of the work, worser kernels in terms of performance and other

01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:04.100
things like that.

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:07.180
So it's interesting that they chose this dist, now maybe they've patched it in some way I'm

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:11.300
not aware of, but when they did that choice, I was like, huh, that seems like maybe they

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:14.740
had an off release and they just happened to land on a bad kernel.

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:19.100
And then 15.04 comes out and the kernel they ship with it has that butterFS problem that

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.460
I ran into.

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:23.500
Like they shipped it with the version that still has the butterFS lockup issue.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:26.620
And again, I'm like, what are they doing?

01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:28.700
Like aren't they supposed to be curating the best kernel?

01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:30.880
Like they picked a bad kernel.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:33.820
Like if I was rolling my own dist, I never would have shipped that kernel.

01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:36.360
And maybe again, maybe they fixed it, maybe they patched it, I don't know.

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:39.020
But every time I see it, I think, huh, this seems like they're supposed to be doing a

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:40.020
really good choice here.

01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:43.180
It seems like they've almost just thrown a dart on the board on the current kernel.

01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:47.140
Like, well, we're going to release around this time, so boom, we'll go with that kernel.

01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:49.580
And they just, that's all the thought that goes into it.

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:53.220
Not like, well, this kernel is known to have issues with lots of butterFS instances where

01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:54.960
you can't mount the root file system.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:59.380
Like that didn't seem to be like maybe a major issue and oh yeah, by the way, it only seems

01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:01.920
to hit like after three to five weeks of being used.

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:05.460
So we'll have a whole bunch of people at 15.04 that all of a sudden hit this.

01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:08.740
Like that was not part of the discussion apparently, or maybe it was and they fixed it, but it

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:09.820
was never noted.

01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:10.820
I don't know.

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:14.980
So again, with rolling, this is an issue I don't run into it.

01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:18.420
Just if it, like I had that kernel and then it pretty quickly gets replaced with the next

01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:19.420
kernel.

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:25.380
But now here on this Mate box, I'm on kernel 3.13 still, which is a clunker.

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:31.860
I've got a maintenance, I mean a Linux Mint install for a friend of mine and their little

01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:37.340
Linux kernel version manager is a, I guess the best thing you can get close to that.

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:44.420
But if I ever, ever run Ubuntu, I always use the daily builds of the kernels from their

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:47.340
like FTP server.

01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:50.420
Just the actual daily current builds of current kernels.

01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:53.060
I never use what's in Ubuntu's repositories.

01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:54.060
Ever.

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:55.060
Really?

01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:56.060
I don't know.

01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.540
That seems like you're asking for it, but I don't know.

01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:04.100
Well, I run completely their daily dot dev files, screw running the kernels that they

01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:05.100
put on the refills.

01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:06.100
You do daily?

01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:08.100
Daily kernel?

01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:09.100
Yeah.

01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:11.540
They build kernels daily on their site.

01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:13.260
I can find the link for it.

01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:14.980
Why do you want a daily kernel though?

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:17.980
Oh, it's always the best of the best.

01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:18.980
All right.

01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.980
Bugs yesterday aren't a bug now.

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:22.500
No, I'm not a bad mood.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:28.180
I just, what I'm trying to put together in my head is what appears to be my practical

01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:29.180
experience.

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:31.620
And you know, it's not just like these two machines either.

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:39.660
I've got, here in the studio, we have one, two, three, four computers that are running

01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:40.660
Arch.

01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:45.660
Well, I guess, yeah, I'm counting, I guess let's just count one of the VMs right now.

01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:48.100
We're just really using one of them heavily.

01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:51.940
And that's, you know, and then I have at my house two machines running Arch, and then

01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:58.340
I have a DigitalOcean droplet running Arch, and I have another DigitalOcean droplet running

01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:01.340
Arch that just runs Minecraft, doesn't really do anything.

01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:05.460
And all of these, I sort of, none of them are updated at any of the same intervals.

01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:07.220
Some of them are updated very frequently.

01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:14.020
Some of them are updated like once every three months maybe, like the VMs, and none of them

01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:17.260
exhibit issues like this.

01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:20.540
And I'm not like doing anything all that savvy, really.

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:25.620
I'm just doing the updates and I'm watching if there's an error, which in fact there's

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:30.580
so infrequently errors that I have to be mindful about watching for it because you know, it

01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:33.140
is that one time you relax that it will make a mistake.

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:36.660
And you can check the news, you can check the forums.

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:38.660
So here's my point because I'm rambling.

01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:44.100
My point is, in my experience, it really does not seem to be one is more dangerous than

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:45.140
the other.

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:50.000
They both seem to need equal amounts of lots of love and attention when you're doing updates.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.940
And I feel like there is a little bit of techno fear in the community about rolling.

01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:58.940
I think people are inherently a little scared of software.

01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:02.860
And I think also these are the same people who also sort of revere software developers

01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:07.200
as sort of unique creators that are sort of a step above everybody else and not just people

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:08.940
who have a talent in a specific area.

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:12.860
I think it kind of plays into that same kind of culture and that culture also bothers me

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:16.020
because I think it sort of creates like these egos that don't need to exist.

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:17.540
Anyways, I'm again rambling.

01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:21.220
I think all of these things come together where it feels like I'm pushing up against

01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:23.980
something that is a bit of a bias.

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:27.180
And it's not like it's really, it's a first world bias, it's not like it's that important,

01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:28.180
but it bothers me.

01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:33.280
I feel like it's not an injustice, but close to it.

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:37.820
And so I feel like I should be rallied to the cause to defend a truth out there that

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:38.820
people are ignoring.

01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:42.260
I don't know why I feel that way about this particular matter, but I do.

01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:47.580
And I think part of the reason is because I was 100% on the other end of the spectrum

01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:48.580
at one point.

01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:50.860
I was the enterprise Linux guy.

01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:55.180
I was Soos enterprise Linux guy and Red Hat enterprise Linux guy.

01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:59.700
I tried Gentoo for a while and I thought it was amazing and I like swung way, way back

01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:03.820
to enterprise and I did FreeBSD and I did the enterprise distros for a little while.

01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:07.100
And then I went to Ubuntu and you guys know the arc of that in the show.

01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:08.780
I was very much an Ubuntu guy on the show.

01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:14.500
I very, very hand, very readily, handily dismissed Arch and it's been a transition for me.

01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:18.940
And now I'm at the other end of the transition and looking back and I'm going, okay, I think

01:32:18.940 --> 01:32:23.380
I made a mistake and I think I'm seeing the same mistake other people are making and I'm

01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:26.780
not trying to preach some sort of gospel, but I'm just trying to open up the way people

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:31.060
look at software because if you're into Linux and you're into this kind of stuff, it's very

01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:33.920
satisfying and it's very fun to watch.

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:38.560
And I don't think it deserves sort of the constant criticism it seems to receive.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:44.280
And I'm a little ashamed that my show has become one of the platforms to perpetuate

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:48.140
that criticism that I think there is a space to criticize.

01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:52.180
I think it's totally worth criticizing because there are risks because new software inherently

01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:55.140
can have regressions or flaws.

01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:56.980
So there's totally a space for debate about it.

01:32:56.980 --> 01:33:00.500
I'm not trying to say there isn't, but at the same time, I don't think we should shame

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:02.400
software just because it's rolling.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:05.380
And I kind of regret that that's the direction the conversation went now that I think about

01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:09.340
it when it came to regards to Angela's computer.

01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:15.420
There is a direct analogy to newsfeeds or news that evolves throughout time.

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:19.820
After a news story breaks, it evolves and changes and it gets more clear.

01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:23.100
That's exactly how a rolling update distro is like.

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:29.260
You subscribe to the newsfeed, but the newsfeed is just packages.

01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:33.900
You get the newest news every day and you're up to date and you're not left behind in the

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.900
dust.

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:35.900
That's very interesting.

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.540
That is a very interesting analogy.

01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:38.540
You're right.

01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:43.260
It's almost like a newspaper is a capture of the headlines in the state when they're

01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:44.760
sort of new and fresh.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:49.140
But online news, and especially like what we do here in this show, it's really...

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:50.140
Yeah.

01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:55.140
It's like we collect and it's a longer analysis after some time has evolved.

01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:59.460
And you're right, the story is more clear.

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:00.460
That is very interesting.

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:04.020
I mean, that's sort of like what it is, right, in a weird way in software.

01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:10.700
It becomes better and what the software developers are going for becomes more refined.

01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:15.980
They don't have much time to hide bad problems or let's say oopsies that they make.

01:34:15.980 --> 01:34:19.340
They have to live up and be accountable for what they do.

01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:46.420
That's what I like being daily or as up to date as I possibly can.
