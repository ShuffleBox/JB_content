WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.960
Oh

00:00.960 --> 00:02.720
My gosh you guys

00:02.720 --> 00:08.840
You know, I'll tell you Noah. I had to have a talk with myself after your ThinkPad review and last that was a

00:09.520 --> 00:16.900
Legitimately tempting review like after the things that the the the main things that really sold me was the problem-free

00:18.560 --> 00:20.560
Built-in LTE modem and

00:21.600 --> 00:22.800
The

00:22.800 --> 00:26.800
Temporary battery so you could swap you could swap batteries. I'm big on that

00:26.800 --> 00:32.040
I'm big on battery swap and I was I was king of battery one of the one of my favorite laptops of all time was

00:32.040 --> 00:38.880
The Apple Pismo and it was like when Steve Jobs was gone and every bay was modular and compatible with each other

00:38.880 --> 00:41.160
So DVD bays could also be battery bays

00:41.160 --> 00:46.680
So you could have two batteries or two DVDs or a hard drive and a battery and I love that man

00:46.680 --> 00:48.840
Cuz I get eight nine hours of battery life, you know

00:48.840 --> 00:52.240
I don't want to make you I don't want to make you I don't want to make you too jealous

00:52.240 --> 00:58.400
But Chris, do you know what my latest thing is on the ThinkPad what have you heard of the battery slice the what?

00:58.720 --> 01:03.840
The battery slice is a battery literally the footprint of the laptop itself

01:03.840 --> 01:09.680
Oh, and it goes underneath it kind of right underneath and that's not even new that's been around for a little bit

01:09.680 --> 01:15.360
Actually, I've never I've not had one before and I had I had I had a 10-hour flight to Tokyo

01:15.360 --> 01:18.320
I had a five-hour flight to Seattle. I had a one-hour flight to Minneapolis

01:18.320 --> 01:21.400
I had two hours in the airport there at 200 in the airport in Tokyo and

01:21.400 --> 01:26.280
I had my laptop powered on pretty much the whole time. Yeah, it went almost 24 hours

01:26.280 --> 01:28.760
So this actually goes like in the docking port, right?

01:29.480 --> 01:36.920
Yes, the battery slice attaches to so you have your extended battery plus you now have this battery which goes in your docking port, right?

01:38.320 --> 01:41.920
It's crazy. Yeah, they've had that for a while. That's super cool

01:41.920 --> 01:46.440
I used to I used to have one between all the batteries because of that power dock or they

01:46.440 --> 01:52.480
Yeah, what do they call the power center at the yeah, you know, you know too bad. I really really really don't like Lenovo as a company

01:53.280 --> 01:55.280
This is Linux unplugged episode

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
151 for June 28

01:58.440 --> 02:00.440
2016

02:10.080 --> 02:16.080
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's ready to go on vacation and is trusting the post-production

02:16.080 --> 02:22.160
Process my name is Chris. My name is Noah. Hello there Noah. Thank you for joining me this week

02:22.160 --> 02:27.400
You're actually back. You made it back from Tokyo. It wasn't it wasn't without a vent

02:28.360 --> 02:36.000
Well, I'm glad you could make it because we have a great show today coming up a Linux mint 18 is just hitting the interwebs

02:36.000 --> 02:37.680
I'll give you my quick take on that

02:37.680 --> 02:44.600
I've got it installed on a machine and I kick the tires and then later on is desktop Linux almost dead

02:44.600 --> 02:47.360
I don't mean actually like Linux on the desktop

02:47.360 --> 02:54.440
I mean desktop computers in general now with these massive machines that are desktop replacements devices like the NUC and of course the penetration of

02:54.440 --> 02:58.400
Mobile, you gotta wonder is there really a role for the truck anymore?

02:58.400 --> 03:03.160
At least let's zoom out like 10 years and talk about the future of Linux on the desktop

03:03.160 --> 03:05.620
Especially in light of some recent new hardware releases

03:05.620 --> 03:10.000
Plus we've got great updates from the Red Hat summit from the Docker group

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
There could be in a new a new Ubuntu phone and develop

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
What and much much more so Noah I am

03:18.360 --> 03:23.760
Super looking forward to Linux unplugged 151 because 152 will not contain any Chris

03:23.760 --> 03:26.400
So this is my last episode before I go on vacation

03:26.920 --> 03:33.400
You'll sit down in the center seat at the helm and command the ship and your time. I couldn't I can't even believe you're here

03:33.400 --> 03:37.920
I can't even believe you're here because I figured you're coming back from Tokyo. You're a busy guy

03:37.920 --> 03:41.120
You got a lot of stuff to cover. I didn't catch up on

03:41.120 --> 03:43.960
1159 at night when there's no flights to Grand Forks

03:44.320 --> 03:46.760
So you end up spending a good amount of time in Seattle

03:46.760 --> 03:50.560
it sounds like I ended up spending from 8 in the morning until like

03:50.800 --> 03:57.200
650 in the Seattle Airport and I was to the point where I thought I was going to inadvertently be doing Linux unplugged in studio

03:57.200 --> 04:04.000
And then and then I made a last last ditch effort flight and and got back to Minneapolis at midnight

04:04.000 --> 04:07.120
And then rented a car and drove for four and a half hours back. Oh, no

04:07.120 --> 04:12.840
I had a client that I had to take care of this morning and so I was I really I was expecting to be back on

04:12.840 --> 04:17.440
Saturday and that didn't work out and then I was hoping to get back on Sunday and that didn't work out and so ended up

04:17.440 --> 04:23.760
Being Monday very very very late man. It's always down to the wire, isn't it? Isn't it funny how that happens?

04:24.760 --> 04:30.600
Better that way. It's true. That's true. I have this, you know, I'm my road trip. I'm coming. I'm going to Montana

04:30.600 --> 04:35.680
I'm gonna do some soaking. I'm bringing Dylan with me. It's his first road trip. He's seven years old, you know

04:35.680 --> 04:38.640
It's it's it's summer break between first grade and second grade for him

04:39.320 --> 04:42.680
So this is like a big deal trip. This is like this is like the stakes are high

04:42.680 --> 04:44.520
This is his first impression to road trips

04:44.520 --> 04:47.760
So we really trying to make sure we just stock it full of fun stuff for him to do

04:47.760 --> 04:50.440
So we're gonna stop along the way we're gonna be like the Lewis and Clark caverns

04:50.440 --> 04:54.760
We're gonna go to water parks and all we basically have activities planned every single day

04:55.680 --> 05:00.040
But as of right now, I still don't even have lady dupes back in my possession

05:00.640 --> 05:05.640
Jeez, man, I know I am it is down to the wire. No, you are you're cutting it

05:05.640 --> 05:07.880
Down to the wire. I'm really glad that you give yourself

05:07.880 --> 05:12.640
Well that that that the circumstances have turned out so that you have so much leeway when something goes wrong

05:12.640 --> 05:15.720
So so here's what I've learned. It's like owning a boat

05:15.720 --> 05:20.440
I think I own an RV is like owning a boat where every time you kind of take it out on a major voyage

05:20.800 --> 05:22.600
stuff breaks and

05:22.600 --> 05:26.400
that's why you own RVs that have warranties that cover everything and

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
to their credit, you know, I

05:30.240 --> 05:32.400
Everything has been covered for totally absolutely for free

05:32.400 --> 05:37.120
The only problem is the delay as you authorize parts and you wait for that and that kind of thing

05:37.120 --> 05:43.740
So, right, I don't even think this road trip is gonna be possible except for we've gotten great customer service by one individual

05:43.740 --> 05:47.760
I'm gonna give him a shout out right here to Jeff. He's down at sunset RV

05:48.320 --> 05:49.400
Now they have it

05:49.400 --> 05:55.320
They have a main five location where we bought our rig but at a Buckley is where their maintenance divisions run and Jeff like

05:55.360 --> 05:59.680
He's been calling up Thor and verifying. Are you authorizing this? Where's this at?

05:59.680 --> 06:07.140
Can you put rush shipping on these parts and then he's gonna drive it up to our campsite as soon as it's ready to go

06:07.160 --> 06:09.520
So that way we can start loading it up and pack it up

06:09.520 --> 06:13.400
So we don't have to do that whole drive my truck down there jump in the rig and hit the road thing

06:13.660 --> 06:16.460
We can actually pack it up at our at our regular site

06:16.640 --> 06:21.000
so he's gonna drive it up there when as soon as they get done working on it, even that's Thursday night Friday night something like

06:21.000 --> 06:24.880
that and I told him a few if he can bring it up there, I'll take him out for a beer

06:24.880 --> 06:30.040
I leave Saturday morning. I leave Saturday morning. So it's like yeah. Oh

06:32.200 --> 06:37.100
And then at some point you'll be hearing a lot more from Noah because he'll be sitting in in the seat right here

06:37.600 --> 06:40.960
So let's jump into some of the stories. We have to get into this week

06:40.960 --> 06:42.640
We got a lot of project updates a lot

06:42.640 --> 06:45.960
And so without going too far without getting to them

06:45.960 --> 06:50.840
I think we should probably bring in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mama room. Hey pep

06:50.840 --> 06:57.820
I'm okay. Hello. Hello. Hello. Well, hello. Hi there, you know, I wanted to talk about something

06:58.440 --> 07:05.480
Right at the top of the show because mr. Drum edrum or perhaps you might know mishawn in the mumble room has worked on

07:06.240 --> 07:08.160
Yeah, what I'm known

07:08.160 --> 07:13.040
he worked on something special for me as a gift for last his 10th birthday and

07:13.960 --> 07:19.060
It was a nice totally set up. We'll talk more about why it's super super cool

07:19.060 --> 07:25.740
A setup installation of matter most for the Jupiter broadcasting community now we've talked about matter most in the past. That's that open-source

07:26.740 --> 07:31.260
Alternative to slack always rocket chat. That's another one and this week

07:31.260 --> 07:36.860
I wanted to highlight an article over at open source comm because I really ragged on them last week

07:36.860 --> 07:41.460
So I thought it'd only be fair to highlight when they do something pretty cool to actually give them some credit. So I

07:42.700 --> 07:46.900
Don't know if you had a chance to listen to last week's episode, but I I kind of called him out for a few things

07:46.900 --> 07:51.540
and this week though, I thought they had a great post up here by Adam Hyde on

07:52.580 --> 07:57.980
Open-source software needing to sell the user experience and I think a lot of us that listen to the show or participate in our virtual

07:57.980 --> 08:05.180
Lug agree that user experience is a super important part of the end result and he talks about how matter most is doing open source

08:05.180 --> 08:12.900
The right way about how they're creating a compelling project something that definitely competes with slack takes advantage of its open source heritage

08:12.900 --> 08:19.500
Uses that to build into features have things like code highlighting and snippets that are way better than anything slack can do

08:19.540 --> 08:22.340
while also providing a great interface and

08:22.820 --> 08:27.860
So it was sort of I thought a great opportunity with this article just posted full link in the show notes if you guys want

08:27.860 --> 08:33.860
To read it. Maybe we talked to Sean and and get his sort of back-end take on

08:34.380 --> 08:39.220
matter most what it was like to set it up for something that could potentially be used at large scale and

08:39.220 --> 08:45.140
Just sort of his overall thoughts on it. So Sean first of all, thanks for the 10th anniversary gift of saying that matter most

08:45.140 --> 08:49.100
We had a cool opportunity to use it during our fedora review

08:49.100 --> 08:52.540
We had a back channel thread going during last worked out super well

08:52.540 --> 08:58.100
I kind of just want to hear your thoughts on setting up matter most for a production deployment and what you think of it as a

08:58.100 --> 09:00.100
software technology

09:00.580 --> 09:04.300
Yeah, it's really I think it's really it's really runs really well

09:04.300 --> 09:09.140
During the floor of you everyone was John there the load on the server

09:09.740 --> 09:17.540
Cp load was like point zero five. Yeah, it was seems like it was like 200 megabytes and it just just purrs like a kitten

09:18.660 --> 09:22.700
Set up wise back when you did the rock the matter most and rocket chat review

09:22.700 --> 09:29.860
I is when I started working on this and I actually created a script for digital ocean to put in the user data

09:30.460 --> 09:32.100
field and so

09:32.100 --> 09:34.100
You just paste paste that in there?

09:35.820 --> 09:37.820
Set the variables for your configuration and

09:38.780 --> 09:45.780
Let it rip. No, it goes through and it takes care of setting up the firewall setting up your admin user and generates

09:46.740 --> 09:49.080
all new salts all passwords

09:49.780 --> 09:51.780
sets up

09:52.340 --> 09:54.020
The whole stack

09:54.020 --> 09:56.940
And it also does sets up let's encrypt

09:56.940 --> 10:03.980
So if you already have your a record cool, you can just set that up right during the install if not there are two

10:05.220 --> 10:08.540
two admin scripts in the admin users home directory and

10:09.660 --> 10:15.420
At that point you can just run one won't install a self sign cert and the other one will set up let's encrypt

10:15.740 --> 10:21.940
And it'll also create a cron job. So auto renew. So what would you say once all this is set up?

10:22.260 --> 10:26.860
Sorry, then you can go I just thought I just want to know for people that are that are listening right now that maybe

10:26.860 --> 10:27.980
You have an open source project

10:27.980 --> 10:32.860
They're involved in total commit time to getting matter most at a decent matter most installation at that set up

10:33.460 --> 10:35.460
Total commit time. What would you say it is?

10:35.820 --> 10:37.740
if you use my script

10:37.740 --> 10:41.300
Three to five minutes. Can you link that to me in the IRC so I can put in the show notes and go ahead?

10:41.300 --> 10:44.220
No, yeah, and to be clear when he says a script

10:44.220 --> 10:49.060
He doesn't mean like you have to set digital ocean up and then log into the droplet and then run a script

10:49.060 --> 10:53.300
That's not what he's talking about. He actually custom designed the script so that it can be dropped in

10:53.300 --> 10:57.700
In the digital ocean control panel and then spun up. That is awesome

10:57.700 --> 11:02.980
Yeah, and I wasn't even aware of that feature digital ocean and during Linux fest Northwest like two months ago

11:02.980 --> 11:07.420
We were in the hotel lobby at like three. Why is it that the meeting time of the hotel lobby is like three in the morning?

11:09.500 --> 11:12.300
Either you're there to pick up hookers or you're talking about Linux. That's

11:13.140 --> 11:15.500
That's true. That's true. Well, there were no hookers and blow that night

11:15.500 --> 11:17.140
So we were working on

11:17.140 --> 11:23.060
We were working on our laptops and he was showing me how he could literally drop this script in you change like what?

11:23.060 --> 11:25.900
Sean sevens variables and then you click on the button. There's

11:26.820 --> 11:29.180
mostly you need to change variables, but there's like

11:30.020 --> 11:35.900
30 other variables you can change if you want to really set it up and not have to do any configuration or if you want

11:35.900 --> 11:38.980
to keep the configuration that you already have and set it up on a

11:39.620 --> 11:45.580
Second droplet is like a failover or if you want to test something you can use the same configuration for both

11:45.660 --> 11:51.380
You know, here's why Sean I think this is kind of an important thing and I'd I actually wouldn't mind just sort of double downing

11:51.380 --> 11:54.380
on the double downing that sounds like a sandwich on this because

11:54.980 --> 11:56.980
one of the things that

11:57.380 --> 11:59.460
One of the reasons why Jupiter broadcasting

12:00.660 --> 12:02.660
Accidentally started using slack

12:02.860 --> 12:06.580
Was because it took me 35 seconds to try it and then I was like, oh

12:06.980 --> 12:12.440
Well, we could actually use this and so this is basically the way the way the decision tree works for me

12:12.440 --> 12:18.740
Is is this going to be a critical piece of technology to the operate to the successful operation of my business if it is

12:18.740 --> 12:22.340
I would like to own it control it deploy it. However, if

12:23.220 --> 12:28.220
Owning controlling and deploy it takes way more time than I have to dedicate to it. Then I will never do it

12:28.220 --> 12:30.060
I will never get it done

12:30.060 --> 12:34.020
So then I might as well just go use the hosted solution that seems to be from a reputable company

12:34.020 --> 12:38.980
It's gonna be around for a while because at least then I'm using something versus not using anything at all

12:38.980 --> 12:46.260
So by creating a script that makes it super fast and easy to deploy matter most you're you're you're making it much more competitive

12:46.260 --> 12:51.380
I think with slack Sean. What was the first thing? I told you when you first telegram me and said

12:51.380 --> 12:53.380
Why aren't you guys using matter most?

12:56.180 --> 12:58.180
Because Chris would have to set it up

12:59.740 --> 13:02.300
Did I say Chris's decision is based off of

13:04.380 --> 13:07.140
Path of leaf is resistant Greece the least resistance

13:08.860 --> 13:11.300
Damn it. You make me sound like a bastard. No, it's not

13:11.300 --> 13:16.900
Oh, no, I just make it sound like like a person who has a lot of really important things to do and so

13:17.460 --> 13:23.820
Delving in to to the specifics of setting up a server on a relatively new software platform is not really something you have the time

13:23.820 --> 13:25.820
Or energy to tackle

13:26.140 --> 13:30.020
Be willing to use it especially when you're not sure how much value it's actually gonna return to you

13:30.020 --> 13:35.940
So, you know, you're not really willing to commit a half a day to something if it's maybe something nobody uses

13:35.940 --> 13:41.940
Right because who would think that setting up something that's basically IRC would actually be useful. Why not just use IRC

13:41.940 --> 13:45.940
I mean, that's that was my default thinking about it. And that was my my essential

13:46.660 --> 13:51.940
Bias that I had my old man bias coming in until I actually tried it. So I don't know

13:52.300 --> 13:55.460
Mr. Drum anything else you want to touch on on matter most before we move on? I

13:58.100 --> 14:04.220
Don't think so then they're working on a federated system so you can have multiple matter most connect to each other. That's cool

14:04.220 --> 14:10.140
That will be very nice. That will be very very nice. That's always something. I'm a big fan of

14:11.060 --> 14:16.420
Speaking of fans. I I there is something going on over at system 76

14:16.700 --> 14:19.400
They have a it's only going on for a little bit too

14:19.400 --> 14:23.660
But they're lowering prices with that with with retweets of the or tweets of the hashtag

14:24.060 --> 14:31.140
Ubuntu 76 for two days up to 350 dollars off and I I'm not saying I have inside knowledge

14:31.140 --> 14:36.220
I'm just saying I have inside knowledge. That's all I'm saying and you have a little inside knowledge to know

14:36.220 --> 14:39.740
There is someone in the works here. I'm just saying it's in your benefit to get in on this

14:40.340 --> 14:44.480
Just put that out there. So if you check them out twitter.com slash system 76

14:44.480 --> 14:48.860
they're tweeting about it right now the key is to tweet with hashtag Ubuntu 76 and

14:50.780 --> 14:56.540
There's something they've been working for quite a while on really hard and they're super super excited about I've been getting telegrams

14:56.540 --> 14:58.540
I mean, I shouldn't say this

14:58.540 --> 15:00.540
unidentified sources

15:00.940 --> 15:05.820
Have been informing me about what could be in the works and I'm just saying I'm pretty excited about it

15:05.860 --> 15:09.060
So I've been retweeting and you guys should too because it'll be worth it

15:09.900 --> 15:13.860
All right, speaking of what might be worth it. This might be worth buying

15:13.860 --> 15:20.060
This could be my next and finally I might add the first Ubuntu phone I buy

15:20.300 --> 15:26.940
It's called Midori and no it's not a GTK web browser based on web kit that you wish you could use but just doesn't have

15:26.940 --> 15:30.500
Enough features it could be the next Ubuntu phone

15:30.900 --> 15:37.860
That's at least according from reader Richard s over at OMG Ubuntu who pointed OMG Ubuntu to bug

15:38.460 --> 15:40.460
155 1811

15:41.780 --> 15:44.060
Obviously, I know what you're all thinking. It's right there in the name

15:44.340 --> 15:49.680
This obviously points to a new Ubuntu phone actually the bug mentions a device code named Midori

15:49.680 --> 15:57.440
With regards to a trust prompt issue that causes a reboot on the MX4 and a mystery new handset later on in the bug report

15:57.560 --> 16:04.500
Director of engineering over at canonical who says the block says this will block Midori RC. Of course RC

16:06.080 --> 16:12.240
Being a release candidate channel for Ubuntu touch images a quick googling around shows the Midori would be in keeping with the code names

16:12.240 --> 16:16.160
for previous Ubuntu devices because they're based for some reason on

16:16.160 --> 16:19.480
on Dragon Ball franchise references

16:20.000 --> 16:26.120
So you have a couple other bits of evidence to there's some discussion in IRC channel about working on a fairly large change

16:30.320 --> 16:36.000
Interesting could you define the term OFONO for me? What is that? What is OFONO?

16:37.080 --> 16:41.880
Ofono, it's the radio stack that we use for doing like

16:41.880 --> 16:47.000
It's what it's part of the radio stack, you know, think of it like network manager and all that stuff

16:47.000 --> 16:52.600
So they they're working on a fairly large OFONO change at the moment for a new handsets as an IRC

16:52.600 --> 16:55.800
We're expecting to land and land a new version of OFONO soon. Oh

16:57.560 --> 17:02.000
What could it be a new device is expected all of a sudden code name Midori

17:03.080 --> 17:04.920
hmm Noah

17:04.920 --> 17:12.000
Noah I think where there is fire and there is smoke. There is an Ubuntu phone. What do you think? I

17:12.720 --> 17:14.860
think you might be onto something the

17:16.760 --> 17:22.800
Every time I see the Ubuntu phone in person I am I tell myself I'm like, this is perfect. I want this

17:22.800 --> 17:27.440
Did you know action itself? Did you yeah. Well, so Michael Hall that's his exclusive phone, right?

17:27.440 --> 17:32.040
So that like and we took him they so canonical ship them a computer for their demo

17:32.040 --> 17:36.640
But they may or may not have forgotten the euro cord that goes in the back of it. You're old card, dude

17:36.640 --> 17:42.760
really power cord partner so they we had to go to a store to go get a power cord and

17:43.960 --> 17:47.560
We and so we're I was in the car and I was I was talking with him and I was like man

17:47.560 --> 17:51.480
You really use that all the time. He's like, yeah, it's you know, it's a great experience. You're like, let's be clear

17:51.480 --> 17:56.260
You're like no, you're in the car with Michael Hall driving to a collection store. You're like, holy crap

17:56.260 --> 18:02.420
You're you're not shitting me. You actually use Ubuntu touch. That's your reaction. You actually are using that thing

18:02.420 --> 18:06.700
You didn't pull out an Android device when we go to find electronic store. That was your reaction

18:06.940 --> 18:13.380
So I just to me I just have a problem and I think you're in the same boat of like using

18:13.740 --> 18:18.020
The same using a phone that doesn't have the the available apps

18:19.580 --> 18:24.940
But you know and they have the necessary ones right they have like a terminal in an email client and telegram and stuff like telegram

18:24.940 --> 18:28.140
And telegram but um, but you know, there's a couple things that are missing

18:28.140 --> 18:30.860
And so I guess I was a little surprised that that was his exclusive phone

18:30.860 --> 18:34.020
But it seems with a couple of exceptions seems to work very very way

18:34.020 --> 18:38.340
Are you saying that there wasn't a maps program on the phone there? Well, yeah, you know, so he doesn't have GPS

18:38.340 --> 18:43.940
So I was doing oh, oh the phone doesn't have GPS. Well, I think the phone does it it does

18:43.940 --> 18:48.020
He happened about he happened to have a broken one. Oh, that's that's a bit of a bummer

18:48.020 --> 18:55.020
So so so in any case so there were there's like there's like little pitfalls the thing though when I get back though is I

18:55.020 --> 18:59.700
Just have such a hard time to actually make the leap like when I'm sitting here and I'm using my s6

18:59.700 --> 19:02.660
And I'm not a huge Android family. I don't particularly like Android

19:02.660 --> 19:06.660
I just don't know that I dislike it enough to go to a completely different

19:06.660 --> 19:10.540
Hmm a completely different system and it's I was looking through you know

19:10.540 --> 19:14.260
Like even small things like, you know, we switched over to OS ticket for all to speed now

19:14.260 --> 19:19.740
I'm not gonna have an app for that and I use that daily, you know to upgrade update work orders and get push notifications

19:19.740 --> 19:23.460
When new ones come in and and all that dare Devon, what do you fall down on this particular issue?

19:24.740 --> 19:31.940
For me, I think it will happen and the transition in the same way transition happened for me in Windows like windows

19:31.940 --> 19:34.740
Yeah, that's when I transition from Windows to full-time Linux

19:34.740 --> 19:41.100
I was like this decision of like I'm not gonna care just gonna deal with all the circumstances that show up as they show up

19:41.100 --> 19:46.580
Because I believe in it. So I want to see where it goes and be supportive. Well, that's usually no one's line. I

19:47.300 --> 19:51.380
Did that and I don't regret it and in the phone

19:51.380 --> 19:55.140
I think it will happen that I've been saying that I'd like a convergence thing

19:55.140 --> 19:59.300
But you know, I think when I do the jumping will be something like that

19:59.300 --> 20:03.940
I'll just drop my phone and say whatever if it's not there. I'll work on getting it there

20:04.500 --> 20:08.140
You know what? I think I need I guess what I need is I need a me in the mobile space

20:08.140 --> 20:14.220
I need somebody to come along walk alongside me and and solve my problems so that I'm not so and and hold my hand

20:14.220 --> 20:16.220
So I'm not scared. That's what I need. Hmm

20:16.820 --> 20:18.820
poppy how how

20:18.860 --> 20:23.580
realistic would it be for someone like me to assume that this might be an

20:23.860 --> 20:26.940
Image for a device that already exists versus a brand new device

20:28.660 --> 20:33.660
So this was reported on OMG Ubuntu, I think there was a photo of the device as well

20:33.660 --> 20:35.660
There's been a couple of photos

20:35.660 --> 20:40.500
I've seen a couple of myself. Yes. Yeah, one of them was a bit pixelated and the other one

20:41.540 --> 20:42.900
I think is a bit clearer

20:42.900 --> 20:47.900
But they show convergence in full effect and they show it docked to like in one case it shows a docked in there and you

20:47.900 --> 20:50.300
See that you see the unity 8 session up on the screen

20:50.900 --> 20:55.300
But when you mentioned the image, it's pretty much the same image on every device

20:55.300 --> 21:02.620
So when you know some new features enable it's enabled for everyone unless it's like hardware specific like a fingerprint reader or something

21:02.620 --> 21:04.820
Then it you know, everyone gets it

21:04.820 --> 21:11.620
So if there's new software which fixes bugs in network manager or something that fixes bugs in the radio or GPS

21:11.620 --> 21:16.020
Then everyone gets the fixes on all the devices. You want to do you want to playstation 4 poppy?

21:17.460 --> 21:19.060
No, I'm

21:19.060 --> 21:24.260
PC gamer PC master races. I just wonder because I just saw this leaked photo with the ps4 and I just wonder where it came from

21:26.820 --> 21:29.740
That's that's you know when you're compiling something

21:29.740 --> 21:34.300
I think that's that's a you know, when you're compiling stuff you like turn to the screen next to you

21:35.820 --> 21:38.820
I really I find it to be exciting that

21:39.340 --> 21:43.980
There's a possibility that there's such a new there's a new device already because I feel like we just got the pro

21:44.060 --> 21:48.820
The muaz or whatever you say it pro, which was a brand new would seem like a really nice high-end phone

21:49.820 --> 21:52.580
Meizu, thank you. Yep. And so here we are just

21:53.260 --> 21:55.980
It feels like Mobile World Congress was just a couple of weeks ago

21:55.980 --> 22:00.460
And we already are hearing possibly rumors about a new phone plus last week. We talked about the one plus three

22:00.780 --> 22:05.340
Getting a community around it to get a bunch of touch running on that which is an extremely well-reviewed phone

22:06.540 --> 22:08.540
So perhaps it is finally

22:09.020 --> 22:15.220
Happening as the Ron Paul meme says speaking of mobile. Let's talk about ting. That's right. That's right

22:15.220 --> 22:21.940
Go to linux.com and learn more about ting ting is a mobile service provider my mobile service provider

22:21.940 --> 22:28.100
No is mobile service provider. It's just mobile that makes sense. It's only pay for what you use mobile with no contract

22:29.380 --> 22:33.120
$6 for the phone line and then just your usage on top of that. It's super straightforward

22:33.660 --> 22:37.660
Super super crazy simple no gimmicks. No like on Tuesdays

22:37.660 --> 22:43.380
You're gonna get this and over the weekends you can do this and if you don't use this well rolled into this but only for this

22:43.380 --> 22:49.220
Amount of time like it's ridiculous or you want to you want to do hotspot or tethering you have to call in and enable that

22:49.220 --> 22:53.940
Like that kind of stuff is the 90s. It's done. It's over with and what's nice about ting

22:53.940 --> 22:58.500
Is they have two networks to pick from CDMA and GSM and all the devices are unlocked

22:58.500 --> 23:01.380
So if you're like crazy Noah, and you're traveling to Tokyo

23:01.380 --> 23:05.940
You can take your everyday driver phone and just pop a new sim in there. It's no big deal

23:06.460 --> 23:12.040
Or like sometimes, you know like needles Noah and I will swap phones because we're not hardcore junkies

23:12.040 --> 23:16.380
We're hardcore phone nerds and we swap phones and it's just pop the sim and pop the sim out

23:16.380 --> 23:22.020
It's true. Like we and and legitimately the when Noah travels to the jb1 studios

23:22.020 --> 23:26.820
He usually brings a tink sim with him true or not Noah. You know, I travel I travel everywhere with one

23:26.820 --> 23:28.820
And I actually I made this guide actually

23:30.300 --> 23:35.780
How to I'll have to get it to you I I stole it from from the the the ting website

23:35.780 --> 23:42.240
But I went through and I started identifying different like ideal phone specifications and which models

23:42.240 --> 23:47.320
So nice. Yeah specific which models you can buy so that when people ask they say I want the XYZ

23:47.320 --> 23:47.960
I can say well

23:47.960 --> 23:52.040
This is the specific model for that phone that you want right that would work with with ting or whatever in that

23:52.200 --> 23:57.160
That that's been really neat because if you buy one that has all of the the I think there are

23:57.520 --> 24:02.480
Five bands that you're looking for for LT if you buy one of those phones with five with all five bands

24:02.480 --> 24:07.000
It will work not only on ting but again if you're roaming abroad into Europe or in Japan

24:07.000 --> 24:10.920
So I just you know and you can buy a prepaid sim in almost any country stick it in and then you have a local number

24:10.920 --> 24:12.640
Yeah, like a local. Yeah, and you know

24:12.640 --> 24:17.240
It's getting way more common to have all of the bands just built into the phones, especially the most recent phones

24:17.240 --> 24:20.480
That's just sort of what the chipset brings now. So that's making it easier

24:20.480 --> 24:24.480
But so ting has a CDMA and GSM network and so we're like with the Nexus devices

24:24.480 --> 24:27.840
You can have either or it depends on your phone and what its capabilities are

24:27.840 --> 24:31.360
But if you understand that there's a thing called GSM and there's a thing called CDMA

24:31.360 --> 24:33.720
You're pretty much good to go ting is gonna really help you out

24:33.720 --> 24:39.080
They have great customer service so you get to speak to a human being they have a dashboard that makes managing all of this crazy

24:39.080 --> 24:43.680
Easy, they have a store online where you can get things from feature phones. I started like 60 50 bucks

24:44.160 --> 24:46.800
Just I mean imagine that you need a backup line

24:46.800 --> 24:51.680
We can just make phone calls and you only pay for when you use it get a $50 feature phone and put it

24:51.680 --> 24:56.040
You know just put it on ting or go all the way up and get yourself a full-fledged computing device

24:56.680 --> 24:58.680
That's unlocked and you own it outright. I

24:59.160 --> 25:05.640
Personally as much as I can I am advocating for the Nexus ting combo or iPhone ting combo. I think

25:05.640 --> 25:09.480
having been back on Android for a few weeks now since Linux fest and

25:10.400 --> 25:17.480
And sort of now getting an appreciation for those monthly updates from Google it makes Android to me a much more palatable

25:17.760 --> 25:21.240
much more secure much more like feels

25:22.080 --> 25:26.800
Much more in line with my priorities from my room a really important computing device

25:26.800 --> 25:31.360
You know something that's getting security updates directly from the vendor and ting never gets in the way of that process

25:31.360 --> 25:35.860
They don't have an agenda. They don't have to like brand the update before it gets out there

25:35.860 --> 25:41.120
So when you get a Nexus device from the Play Store and you bring it over to ting a couple of really amazing things happen

25:41.840 --> 25:45.460
First of all when you go to Linux not ting comm your first month is gonna probably be paid for

25:45.600 --> 25:48.680
Because average ting bills like 23 24 bucks for a line

25:49.000 --> 25:55.400
So you go to Linux not ting comm you get your first month paid for you bring the device on there you pick GSM or CDMA

25:55.400 --> 25:59.880
What's ever stronger in your area because the Nexus devices are doing all of it once you get it online put it on Wi-Fi

25:59.880 --> 26:04.720
Get all your updates get all your applications installed and then just sit back and enjoy the savings

26:04.720 --> 26:06.720
It's it's such a great combination

26:07.240 --> 26:11.360
Even if you're from outside the US and you're just visiting the states for a little while

26:11.720 --> 26:18.720
Bring go go on eBay get a cheap GSM phone put it on the ting network and that travel account

26:18.800 --> 26:23.840
They're traveling from the outside outside the US a lot of phones abroad have two SIM slots. Yeah, I know

26:23.880 --> 26:25.880
Yeah, just bring a phone. There's

26:25.880 --> 26:32.120
It and it's so simple because at the end of the day you have the safety net of the ting support where they're actual geeks

26:32.120 --> 26:34.840
That love this stuff and they're willing to engage with you

26:34.840 --> 26:40.000
So you actually have really great support to go to check them out at Linux not ting comm

26:40.160 --> 26:43.240
Also, if you want to just support the show by visiting that page go read their blog

26:43.280 --> 26:48.280
They got a new post on a hundred and thirty over-the-air TV stations coming to us cord cutters

26:48.280 --> 26:50.280
I have not had a chance yet to read this

26:50.280 --> 26:56.780
But man does that sound like music to my ears as someone who's probably not gonna be getting cable and it may be

26:57.240 --> 27:00.740
Satellite during the election of things get crazy, but I just for right now

27:00.740 --> 27:05.480
I'm trying to do everything over-the-air in lady tubes and that's a blog post. I'm gonna read so go to linux.ting.com

27:06.600 --> 27:12.000
Calm. Hey Noah, how about we get super geeky for a second on the show you ready for this? That's great

27:12.000 --> 27:16.880
I love getting super geeky in the air. I know you like yourself a VPN and that secure networking

27:16.880 --> 27:21.560
So this is what I am looking forward to it hasn't hit mainline kernel yet

27:21.640 --> 27:29.520
But say goodbye soon to open VPN say goodbye to IPSec and say hello to the next generation secure network tunnel

27:29.520 --> 27:31.320
announced for Linux

27:31.320 --> 27:33.320
Jason Donfield is the

27:33.760 --> 27:39.880
Developer and it's called wire guard. It's described as a next-generation secure network tunnel for the Linux kernel

27:39.880 --> 27:46.760
It's built into kernel space unlike open VPN which runs in user space and inherently when you're dealing with all this crypto stuff and networking

27:46.760 --> 27:52.740
Stuff we're running in user space and then communicating with the kernel kernel. There's just it's just an inherent disadvantage there

27:53.040 --> 27:57.680
So Dunfield explained to a briefing to for Onyx last week about wire guard

27:57.680 --> 28:01.780
He says IPSec is overly complex and impossible to actually use in a secure manner

28:01.920 --> 28:06.700
But it's the fastest thing out there for a VPN and secure tunneling open VPN very popular

28:06.700 --> 28:14.140
But it's super slow and by virtue of being in user space. It contains a whole buggy SSL x59 x509 stack

28:14.140 --> 28:17.380
He says I've started from scratch and written an extremely simple yet powerful

28:17.820 --> 28:22.780
Cryptographically secure replacement in around 4,000 lines of code called wire guard

28:22.780 --> 28:29.860
It's much simpler than anything before it with peers exchanging short curve 25 519 public keys

28:30.300 --> 28:34.180
Just like an SSH secure network interfaces can be added and removed

28:34.620 --> 28:37.520
using the usual IP link and IP address tools and

28:38.140 --> 28:43.280
From there. Everything is easily taken care of by the kernel and secure tunnels are made quite simple

28:43.280 --> 28:48.460
Not only that but the performance is in fact better than IPSec which is basically a huge accomplishment

28:49.380 --> 28:52.400
Now this isn't brand new. He's been working on this for a while

28:53.220 --> 28:57.660
It's been detailed at some kernel conferences. So it's not like it just showed up out of nowhere

28:57.820 --> 29:03.580
It's using industry standard cryptographic standards and they have a brand new website at a wire guard dot IO

29:03.900 --> 29:09.380
Which they say there it aims to be an easy to configure and deploy as as SSH is

29:09.380 --> 29:16.260
but gives you a VPN connection made simply by exchanging very simple public keys just like exchanging SSH keys and

29:17.220 --> 29:19.500
All of its transparently handled by wire guard

29:20.380 --> 29:27.260
Roaming between IP addresses just like mosh is also supported. There's no need to manage connections be concerned about state

29:27.580 --> 29:29.820
Manage daemons or worry about what's under the hood?

29:30.860 --> 29:33.020
very basic but powerful interface

29:33.020 --> 29:38.220
This is a whole new way for doing secure networking under Linux. It's not a mainline kernel yet

29:38.940 --> 29:44.860
But man does this look super promising. No, I'll start with you. What are your thoughts about kind of just sort of

29:45.500 --> 29:48.940
Wiping the slate clean and starting over with VPN technologies under Linux

29:49.420 --> 29:55.780
So anyone who's worked especially in the commercial side of VPN knows what a pain it is to get some stuff set up correctly

29:55.780 --> 29:57.100
but

29:57.100 --> 30:01.580
Part of me says that like the last one I did which is just a couple of months ago

30:01.580 --> 30:07.700
It was literally as simple as I log to the routers are supporting it. Now. I logged into the router. I checked a box

30:07.700 --> 30:15.580
I specified the the DHCP leased space that I wanted the VPN clients to log in with I created credentials and I was done and

30:16.140 --> 30:19.620
That is thanks to the fact that that open VPN is just like

30:20.620 --> 30:24.380
Natively supported on like every major, you know device now

30:24.380 --> 30:32.380
So on some level I feel like we have already gotten, you know a long ways and we've made a lot of headway and

30:32.380 --> 30:34.380
And things are actually pretty good now, though

30:34.380 --> 30:37.380
I do respect and understand the concept of you know

30:37.380 --> 30:41.060
It may not be as secure as it could be and I got to tell you Chris

30:41.700 --> 30:47.780
Having fought with VPN for almost 10 years in various different forms if we could get to a point where it was as simple as

30:47.780 --> 30:54.580
SSH or I can install one package on the on the destination, you know server side one package on the client side, man

30:54.580 --> 30:58.780
That's appealing. Yeah. Yeah, I totally agree and you know, I started picturing like

30:59.540 --> 31:00.540
just

31:00.540 --> 31:02.020
essentially

31:02.020 --> 31:04.860
Using these types of links and connections as standard by default

31:05.860 --> 31:07.860
Here's the there is one

31:08.180 --> 31:13.300
Major issue the internet is taking with this new technology and I wonder if anyone in the mumble room feels this way

31:13.300 --> 31:17.620
One of the big pushbacks coming in right now. Well, there's two

31:18.260 --> 31:20.820
but the big first one I want to talk about is

31:22.900 --> 31:25.460
What about putting something that is network accessible

31:26.100 --> 31:32.060
That is essentially a core networking technology like this in kernel space because if there is an exploit against this thing

31:32.060 --> 31:38.300
You've just owned the entire kernel. You're now running your exploit now runs with kernel level privileges. You're in

31:38.300 --> 31:42.780
Doesn't anybody in the mumble room have any concerns about this? I?

31:43.420 --> 31:49.300
Thought for sure somebody would I thought for sure somebody would because that is genuinely I think a legitimate concern

31:49.500 --> 31:54.420
The other I think number two issue and the open VPN developers have already raised this one is

31:55.460 --> 32:01.020
Why not just spend this time making over open VPN faster? Why can't we why can't we risk?

32:01.500 --> 32:06.660
Take all this energy you guys have and put it in open VPN. What do you think about that? No, I don't think so

32:06.660 --> 32:10.380
Yeah, I think that open. So the the the the the thing about

32:10.980 --> 32:15.500
Starting over right is it I think to some degree it suffers from the not invented here syndrome

32:15.500 --> 32:20.300
I think it's it's it's you know, you get these people that say well I could do this better

32:20.300 --> 32:22.860
I could restart from scratch and I think that then you essentially

32:23.300 --> 32:26.380
We're reinventing the wheel on some level on the other hand though

32:27.140 --> 32:30.580
Every time I've seen this happen in the past where you take a technology

32:30.580 --> 32:36.660
You look look at system D for example, and I know there's probably a sore subject to bring up but you look at system D

32:36.660 --> 32:42.100
And look at what has happened and we have taken taken something and completely redone it from scratch and

32:42.260 --> 32:44.860
Everyone kind of said the same thing is oh you're reinventing the wheel

32:44.860 --> 32:48.980
There's no reason to do this and I got to tell you we have gone from you know, minutes

32:49.340 --> 32:55.220
Minutes of boot time to seconds and if you and if you don't if you're not working in a field where you see that

32:55.220 --> 33:00.500
Then maybe it's not as clear to you. But to me it's there there is there is there should be no discussion about this

33:00.500 --> 33:04.660
It was a it was a it's a clear win might have been a little quick on the draw

33:04.660 --> 33:09.340
But it is definitely the direction we should be moving. And so if if a new VPN

33:09.860 --> 33:11.140
You know protocol system

33:11.140 --> 33:16.540
integrated at the kernel level if we have that same kind of success and that same kind of cleanliness and that same kind of

33:16.540 --> 33:20.740
You know increase in performance and security. I'm all for it. Okay. Well, here's his arguments

33:20.740 --> 33:25.660
He says, you know, you just can't get the performance in user land applications. It's not that we don't want to support open a VPN

33:25.660 --> 33:29.940
It's that open VPN from a performance standpoint is just sort of doomed

33:30.660 --> 33:37.220
And he said the developer the other thing about wire guard is this why it's 4,000 lines of code. It's insanely simple

33:37.220 --> 33:43.100
It's meant to be the the smallest attack surface as possible. I was on the fence about this until I read

33:43.700 --> 33:46.820
Greg KH's post on Google+. Now. He's not a

33:46.820 --> 33:50.140
Networking developer, right? He you know, he focuses on the Linux kernel

33:50.140 --> 33:55.420
He were focuses on the LTS branch and on the USB stack and lots of important subsystems the networking subsystem

33:55.420 --> 33:59.420
Not one of them, but he writes a new VPN VPN protocol and implementation for Linux

33:59.420 --> 34:03.380
It was announced last year at the kernel recipes in Paris. It's great to see a

34:03.900 --> 34:08.260
Releasable state at this point. I recommend taking a look at it. If you're into this type of stuff disclosure

34:08.260 --> 34:12.340
I have reviewed various versions of the kernel code over the past few months and

34:13.340 --> 34:15.820
It seems safe. So I'm not going to go into that

34:15.820 --> 34:19.580
And it seems sane, but he says note. I'm not a kernel networking developer

34:19.580 --> 34:24.460
So Greg says, you know what? It looks like good sane kernel code to me, which is pretty encouraging

34:24.460 --> 34:31.740
I mean, I I definitely can't disagree with his opinion on the topic. So I just have one thing

34:31.740 --> 34:33.140
It's a network thing

34:33.140 --> 34:39.180
It's about doing this type of but it's in the kernel level when we have to understand what it actually means

34:39.340 --> 34:44.000
Being the kernel level also means that a potential flaw on it. Yeah, ten times higher to danger

34:44.000 --> 34:48.080
It's an immediate serious issue. It's an amoeba. It's especially if it's remotely exploitable

34:49.000 --> 34:51.240
Exactly exactly and not only that

34:51.920 --> 34:57.760
It's also something that if it's buggy for some reason crashes the entire system too because it's in the kernel. Yeah. Yep

34:57.760 --> 35:02.440
Yeah, so those things should be in mind. Yes, you're not gonna get the performance in the user space

35:02.440 --> 35:08.360
But I think it's a good trade-off. Maybe the performance for the security layer. Yeah, I don't know maybe yeah, yeah

35:08.360 --> 35:10.360
I

35:12.080 --> 35:15.000
Think I pretty much agree with your assessment. Okay. All right. Well

35:18.120 --> 35:22.300
We have great news today on the unplugged program finally

35:23.080 --> 35:25.600
after years of waiting Linux users our

35:26.480 --> 35:28.480
prayers have been answered

35:28.800 --> 35:31.480
Universal application installation is now available

35:32.240 --> 35:35.400
Thanks to a brand new standard called sub user

35:35.400 --> 35:42.260
That's right offering portability security and maintainability for a user application installations on Linux

35:42.320 --> 35:44.320
We have ourselves a brand new

35:44.480 --> 35:50.480
Standard called sub user you got your flat packs go screw yourself. You got app images good for you

35:50.480 --> 35:56.620
You got snaps you got I don't care because now we got sub users. Are you excited Noah? Come on sub user buddy

35:57.360 --> 35:59.360
Yeah

35:59.360 --> 36:07.720
Oh, you know that xkcd comic problem we have 13 community. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

36:08.800 --> 36:10.680
special news correspondent

36:10.680 --> 36:18.440
Wes is joining us in the field right now for reporting on this West you are at the launch event for sub user, correct?

36:19.400 --> 36:23.520
Yes, I am. And this is truly the one universal installations

36:24.320 --> 36:27.440
Solution for all Linux users, correct West. Is that what you're learning on the scene?

36:27.440 --> 36:33.320
Well, I think doctor was there already and this just makes docker every place else. That's right

36:33.320 --> 36:36.560
That's because this is application installation with docker

36:36.720 --> 36:43.280
So you take your docker containers and now you use them to distribute all your applications with sub user. That is oh

36:43.720 --> 36:46.200
You like you know what and here's the crazy thing

36:47.480 --> 36:48.920
this

36:48.920 --> 36:50.640
almost could work

36:50.640 --> 36:57.480
Because there is just a lot of stink behind docker containers. There's a docker container for everything. It's unbelievable

36:57.480 --> 37:02.280
So if you take that and you whittle it down a little bit and you make it as an application delivery platform

37:02.400 --> 37:07.880
You are utilizing the built-in knowledge set of all of these people that have already composed docker containers

37:08.080 --> 37:14.080
Which is a lot and it could almost by default just be a way people end up distributing applications

37:14.080 --> 37:19.040
At one point though, at what point do we just stop I don't I don't know

37:19.040 --> 37:24.200
I just don't know what to do with this anymore. It's too much. It's too much. My head kind of explodes

37:24.760 --> 37:28.400
But there you go. It's sub user and you can read more about its docker and

37:29.080 --> 37:33.160
Python and a little bit of git combined with a little bit of docker. I

37:33.880 --> 37:38.720
Think and to complement this we need to have some universal window managers. Yes, right

37:39.400 --> 37:43.000
Yeah, yeah, gotta make sure you gotta make sure you're doing the right thing

37:43.000 --> 37:46.200
You got to make sure you got to make sure that you got to make sure we get a couple of those though

37:46.200 --> 37:50.920
Can't just have one. Yeah, you know, it's amazing. It's amazing how on one side of this argument

37:50.920 --> 37:55.480
I started out like two years ago if you'd asked me two years ago what I thought about universal installers

37:55.480 --> 37:59.520
I would have told you that it was the number one problem on Linux and I don't care what anyone said

37:59.560 --> 38:06.520
the the number one resistance I think that happens links the reason that people don't port software to Linux the number one reason is

38:07.560 --> 38:10.400
Is there is no universal, you know app installer

38:10.400 --> 38:13.520
It's you gotta figure out which distro navigate that whole mess and now

38:13.920 --> 38:19.120
like I'm I've almost gone to the complete other side of it because I'm I just I'm not I

38:19.240 --> 38:23.800
Guess I'm not as convinced today that a universal installer could ever work in the Linux ecosystem

38:23.800 --> 38:27.280
I don't know if I don't know if I believe anymore that

38:28.240 --> 38:33.560
That it's that it's a viable solution for for the very nature of Linux. Oh girl you crazy

38:33.560 --> 38:38.440
I just I I almost don't know how and I know I get so much crap for this

38:38.440 --> 38:42.160
But I almost don't know how you can't see it. It's such like out of all of

38:42.960 --> 38:45.240
I'd say it's the number one problem with Linux desktop

38:45.240 --> 38:50.440
I agree. I agree, but I don't think it's a solvable problem unless we all agree on one distro to use. I disagree

38:51.480 --> 38:53.480
Well, the whole point of the

38:53.640 --> 38:56.000
Snaps for example is to be on multiple distros

38:56.000 --> 39:00.840
It doesn't matter what district use as long as the top-level application layer is not directly

39:01.840 --> 39:03.840
intertwined into the distro

39:03.840 --> 39:09.840
But then don't you have a handicapped version of the application potentially? No, what do you mean?

39:10.560 --> 39:17.180
Well, so for example if you have if the if the if the if the arch system for example works

39:17.420 --> 39:22.120
You know has is is not capable or works differently than Ubuntu then

39:22.540 --> 39:26.260
Isn't the isn't the snap package packaged for the lowest common denominator?

39:26.920 --> 39:28.920
No, it'll all work the same

39:28.920 --> 39:35.880
It's just that the current the current reason with the arch thing doesn't work as well as the Ubuntu one is because the Ubuntu

39:35.880 --> 39:37.040
one has been out for

39:37.040 --> 39:42.360
Two months and it has been developed before four months and the arch one has been out for well

39:42.680 --> 39:47.240
Four days. I'll tell you what. I think here's what kernel Linux is talking about rotten is he saying

39:47.760 --> 39:52.800
The application itself sort of has to assume the lowest common denominator when it comes in the library

39:52.800 --> 39:56.560
So for example when I installed the VLC snap on fedora 24

39:56.560 --> 40:03.200
I got a version of VLC that had really really crappy fonts compared to the rest of the fedora 24 desktop

40:03.200 --> 40:08.320
Which this is one of the areas they they specifically worked on for this release. And so it seemed like

40:09.560 --> 40:14.160
That's probably a early an early problem that's gonna get worked out. But right now

40:14.880 --> 40:21.040
That VLC snap doesn't take advantage of the better fonts and better font rendering on my host system

40:21.040 --> 40:23.200
That seems like a bit of a downside, don't you think?

40:23.200 --> 40:27.640
Well, yeah, it'd be kind of annoying. But if there was no one

40:28.240 --> 40:33.880
At all putting effort into like a shared library system for snaps that would suck but they're doing that

40:33.880 --> 40:38.040
So I'm okay with it. I think it's it's definitely less annoying than not having the application at all

40:38.480 --> 40:44.280
Yeah, that's true. That's true. And the other thing and they can also they could just include the font they want

40:44.920 --> 40:48.000
Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's I wonder about user experience like

40:48.000 --> 40:53.480
Where app image to me feels like it's kind of the easiest from the like Windows user download and run it

40:53.480 --> 40:55.960
I wonder how much we'll see that pushed

40:55.960 --> 40:59.480
I think canonical could do it, but it doesn't seem like it's at quite the same level

40:59.480 --> 41:01.720
Yeah, and that will probably determine a lot for the desktop user

41:01.720 --> 41:04.600
It's not even app image is not even that simple for the users

41:04.600 --> 41:10.100
It's more simple than an exe or a DMG in general because you you have to be able to do permissions

41:10.100 --> 41:14.820
But if as a user of app image you have to know that you have to do that

41:14.820 --> 41:20.800
So you have to exp you have to give them information about that you have to you have to set the permissions so that it can

41:20.800 --> 41:23.320
Execute you also have to know how to do that in the first place

41:23.460 --> 41:27.800
So there is still you know a stepping stone that you have to go through for app images

41:27.800 --> 41:31.920
that doesn't make it the best whereas in in certain cases the

41:32.360 --> 41:38.780
Their goal for snaps is to have just an installer that you would go to the you go to the Ubuntu software

41:38.840 --> 41:43.840
App or whatever they're calling it now and then you just install it and there you have it and it's a snap and you're done

41:43.840 --> 41:46.920
We'll be I know you want to try to train people to go to that app

41:46.920 --> 41:48.920
That's the thing that is actually

41:49.960 --> 41:53.640
Website and download the snap and it worked the same way or or if the website could somehow

41:54.400 --> 42:00.200
Initiate the software centers page. That would be nice to like it's like an apt colon. Yep. Yeah

42:00.200 --> 42:03.800
Yeah, I wouldn't I think you were about to try to jump in there during the crosstalk. So go ahead

42:04.520 --> 42:08.940
Yeah, I was just gonna say on the point of that VLC application or rather snap

42:08.940 --> 42:14.300
Um with because I've not seen it, but I understand what you're describing the first

42:14.820 --> 42:21.900
GUI application that I tried to make with a snap had no fonts whatsoever. The menus didn't render correctly and

42:22.900 --> 42:29.900
PNGs didn't render correctly and I fixed all of those problems and it now looks like a themed

42:30.460 --> 42:31.860
Ubuntu Marte

42:31.860 --> 42:33.340
application again

42:33.340 --> 42:35.340
and that took

42:35.340 --> 42:37.060
some changes in

42:37.060 --> 42:42.900
snap craft to support that and or rather snap day to support that and

42:44.220 --> 42:45.660
learning

42:45.660 --> 42:50.740
How to do this stuff and then that got abstracted away into the way you build snaps. So

42:51.420 --> 42:55.260
Don't assume that all applications are going to look like that by default

42:56.180 --> 43:00.540
just take it that somebody has made a VLC snap of a

43:00.540 --> 43:06.220
Pre-release version of VLC and they may well still be finding their way. Yeah

43:06.220 --> 43:10.640
How to act that was sort of my impression when I used it and I think that you know

43:10.640 --> 43:15.020
And when you see that represent itself in a couple of different ways, that's funny people will jump on it

43:15.560 --> 43:17.560
remember when LibreOffice

43:18.140 --> 43:21.200
Shipped their first snap and it was way bigger than it needed to be

43:22.020 --> 43:23.780
People jumped all over that

43:23.780 --> 43:26.540
Yeah, and that's another thing, you know you you have

43:26.540 --> 43:32.260
all the debug symbols in there by default at the moment for example, and you know

43:32.260 --> 43:39.820
Unless you there are mechanisms to say these are the own bits that I want in the squash FS file system

43:40.100 --> 43:43.780
This is the stuff that is the runtime and the executables for example

43:43.780 --> 43:47.860
And you can ignore all of these things and the first few times you make a snap

43:47.860 --> 43:52.540
you just include everything because you just get the thing to work and then once you've got something that works and

43:52.540 --> 43:56.760
Looks right then you can start refining it and actually trimming it down

43:57.300 --> 44:00.360
You know and just as an indication of how early days all this stuff is

44:00.360 --> 44:05.420
I ran into an issue during my fedora 24 review where I was trying to install GIMP

44:05.420 --> 44:09.300
And it just downloaded an empty repo folder into my home directory. It turns out

44:10.140 --> 44:14.900
That was a bug in Flatpak. I was hitting a bug and I didn't realize that I thought I was just doing the commands wrong

44:15.460 --> 44:21.040
And I got him I got a note back from our review as bit of feedback saying yeah turns out bug we fixed it now

44:21.040 --> 44:24.720
So it is super early days for all this stuff

44:24.720 --> 44:30.920
And it's it so with that when I guess what I'm trying to convey is not only is it early days for the back-end

44:31.080 --> 44:35.620
Implementation like the store what its source code is how the packages are delivered

44:35.640 --> 44:39.300
But it's also early days for all the people that are packaging the software

44:39.300 --> 44:41.060
And I feel like right now in terms of snaps

44:41.060 --> 44:46.840
I feel like we're up against a wall that's about to break and then a whole bunch of snaps are gonna come out

44:46.840 --> 44:50.160
But there's not a whole a whole bunch at the moment that you could just jump on

44:50.160 --> 44:54.000
You know for the from a dumb user perspective because that's that you know

44:54.000 --> 44:57.280
It was it was kind of a it was kind of an eye-opening experience

44:57.280 --> 44:58.440
I hadn't followed

44:58.440 --> 45:04.880
You know the snap packages in the Flatpak and the app image a whole lot prior to obviously until we you know covered it on

45:04.880 --> 45:09.000
The show but prior to that I I knew that it existed, but I hadn't really played with it

45:09.000 --> 45:13.120
And so my first foray into it was I went to download our app pic

45:13.120 --> 45:17.280
which was the that image burner that Rick I had suggested and it was an app image and

45:17.280 --> 45:21.400
I had no idea how to use it. I just downloaded on the site and double-clicked on it and it installed

45:21.400 --> 45:22.200
I was like, well, that's cool

45:22.200 --> 45:26.520
Then I did it on like three other distros and then that really started to click with me and when I went

45:26.680 --> 45:28.680
To install my first snap package

45:28.680 --> 45:30.320
I had no idea how to do that

45:30.320 --> 45:34.240
And so I was googling for snap packages found one online downloaded it from the website

45:34.240 --> 45:35.160
Tried to double click on it

45:35.160 --> 45:39.600
Like I did with app image and that didn't work and then I googled around a little bit and found that you could do it

45:39.600 --> 45:41.600
From the command line you want to go into or what? Were you on?

45:42.120 --> 45:44.720
Fedora that was yeah, that was about you. Yeah

45:44.720 --> 45:49.680
Okay. Okay. Yeah, and and so and and so basically I guess all that to say that

45:50.520 --> 45:56.640
If you are a person coming over from macOS or Windows the software installation of app image functions

45:56.960 --> 46:01.440
exactly how you would expect it to and you acquire software exactly how you would expect it to and

46:01.960 --> 46:07.160
Because it's cross distro. I know you no longer have to worry about training users to search for you know

46:10.560 --> 46:12.560
Look no, look

46:12.560 --> 46:17.260
I feel like I feel like I feel like your criticism right there is

46:18.000 --> 46:24.580
Temporary I feel like I feel like the next the next the next Ubuntu say the next release even will just they just have to

46:24.600 --> 46:30.000
Associate the snap files association with an application that can install okay, but every distro has to do that for that to work

46:30.120 --> 46:35.680
No, hang on a minute. Okay, you say that you downloaded an app image and you double clicked on it and it just did stuff

46:36.120 --> 46:40.680
It did not. Yes, that is right. Yep. You didn't have to make it executable

46:40.680 --> 46:42.680
Oh

46:42.880 --> 46:44.880
Did I

46:46.680 --> 46:48.680
Yeah

46:51.880 --> 46:56.080
That didn't double click them. No, you're right. It's not associated with anything. I had to download it

46:56.080 --> 47:02.080
I had to make it executable and then I could execute it and yeah, you're probably right. See that's that's

47:03.160 --> 47:08.680
That it wasn't so we looked at we looked at cha because itches that you know disk

47:08.680 --> 47:12.360
Creation utility right that runs on Windows Mac and Linux

47:14.200 --> 47:18.520
Rewriting all of our how to make a USB drive

47:19.080 --> 47:22.920
Using etcher so that every platform could use one tool

47:23.480 --> 47:30.280
But the process of actually installing etcher on Linux is so alien to how people would install things on Linux

47:30.560 --> 47:37.080
What we're actually going to do is write the instructions for Windows and Mac to use etcher and then use

47:37.080 --> 47:44.800
GNOME disks for Linux because isn't that isn't that now can we just talk about that for a second Wow that you know a distribution

47:45.800 --> 47:51.360
Is in the position where it is easier to write how to get it set up under Mac and Windows

47:51.840 --> 47:56.440
Than it is under Linux that right there perfectly defines the problem. We are trying to solve

47:56.440 --> 48:00.080
We're not I'm not arguing for the replacement of repositories

48:00.080 --> 48:02.360
I'm not calling for the end of Debs and RPMs

48:02.360 --> 48:07.960
But that right there is so such a wonderful illustration of the problem

48:08.720 --> 48:12.720
It's that's amazing well, but so I guess

48:13.320 --> 48:16.960
So what would be the alternative that we allow by default for applications to?

48:17.360 --> 48:19.360
When you download off the app well

48:19.440 --> 48:23.300
fast forward fast forward five years from now and and let's just say

48:23.480 --> 48:28.000
Flatpak snaps or app images have taken off one of them is is so predominant that

48:28.000 --> 48:34.120
that you can you can pretty confidently write a how-to and say download this app image and

48:35.080 --> 48:40.640
You can almost know with absolute certainty that they've downloaded an app image before and they know how to install it or if it's a snap

48:40.640 --> 48:45.280
They know what that's about and so now imagine what wimpy's process would be he'd have the same download page

48:45.280 --> 48:46.840
He'd say here's the instructions for Windows

48:46.840 --> 48:48.220
Here's the instructions for Mac

48:48.220 --> 48:49.920
And if you want to do in our Linux

48:49.920 --> 48:54.920
download the snap and he could link to the most recent snap or he could link to the you browse page or whatever it is you

48:54.920 --> 49:00.520
apps page and and it would just be double click the snap and follow the instructions when it launches it would literally be a

49:00.520 --> 49:02.600
Less instruction set than it is for Windows

49:02.600 --> 49:06.360
I mean, it's a fundamental shift in the friction

49:06.360 --> 49:10.600
And it's a fundamental reduction in that friction for users to start with matei I mean

49:10.600 --> 49:12.600
Do you think I'm wrong wimpy or do you think I'm right?

49:13.320 --> 49:19.480
No, you are right. We're constantly trying to find ways to make to lower the barriers to entry and

49:21.640 --> 49:23.640
For many reasons

49:23.640 --> 49:25.160
snaps and

49:25.160 --> 49:29.720
Universal package installers solve a number of problems. And the thing is is that you've talked about

49:30.200 --> 49:35.480
putting snaps on the vendor or you know authors website so people can download a snap and

49:36.040 --> 49:38.840
Install it the same way that Windows users do I?

49:39.560 --> 49:48.320
Feel that's a bit of a retrograde step because I think the central repository where you can search for find and install

49:49.440 --> 49:52.640
Applications from one place is the superior

49:52.640 --> 49:58.200
Mechanism but snaps support both paradigms. You can have

49:59.000 --> 50:01.160
a snap store or many snap stores

50:02.200 --> 50:07.800
Depending on you know, if you've got an iot device that or a nas, you know in the nas vendor wants their own snap store

50:08.840 --> 50:10.040
but

50:10.040 --> 50:12.040
companies like viber for example

50:12.760 --> 50:16.280
Could make snaps and have them download off their website

50:16.280 --> 50:23.600
So both paradigms are supported with snaps and I think that's um, that's a a particularly useful

50:24.160 --> 50:25.760
useful use case

50:25.760 --> 50:29.160
Do you think it's going to be problematic though for users?

50:29.160 --> 50:34.480
If sometimes you obtain it from a central software center and other time I go to that

50:34.480 --> 50:39.440
I do and that's why I I would prefer to see that people

50:41.240 --> 50:43.600
Embrace the snap store

50:43.600 --> 50:51.480
Paradigm and we keep what we're used to and what mobile phone users and tablet users are used to which is all of your

50:51.720 --> 50:58.020
Applications are in a central repository and frankly what macOS and Windows are going to write both have an application

51:00.160 --> 51:02.160
Yeah, yeah

51:02.520 --> 51:05.760
So let me so how about this is would there be a way for

51:05.760 --> 51:13.280
For for active for somebody to add if you know if the if the snap is on a website is would there be for somebody else to

51:13.760 --> 51:17.560
Take it off their website and add it to the store and then it would the reverse be true

51:17.560 --> 51:19.320
Would it be possible for somebody like me?

51:19.320 --> 51:26.280
Who really likes to have local copies of things to be able to download those those snap packages and store them on my device?

51:26.720 --> 51:29.520
Yeah, so when I build a snap package, for example

51:29.520 --> 51:36.560
I build it locally on my computer and I end up with an architecture specific snap so a an AMD 64 snap

51:36.720 --> 51:41.800
and the snap is a squash FS file system that encompasses the application and

51:42.080 --> 51:48.200
All of the shared libraries and assets that that application needs to run that snap file

51:48.200 --> 51:54.240
You can install by typing snap install path to snap dot snap file

51:54.240 --> 52:01.120
so you can download a snap and install it if you wanted to download all of the snaps in the world and stick them on a

52:01.120 --> 52:03.680
USB hard drive and carry it around with you and

52:04.280 --> 52:06.280
Install from those you could do that

52:07.520 --> 52:12.160
And if you have the snap yaml file the snap craft in the file, yeah, if you've got the yaml file

52:12.160 --> 52:14.760
You can build it yourself. Yeah, so dare Devlin

52:14.760 --> 52:18.920
What do you think about it being a centralized repository and that being with canonical because don't you think then?

52:18.920 --> 52:25.360
that means every single aspect of getting these snaps into the central repository has to be as

52:25.840 --> 52:29.040
Easy and simple as possible and I don't think we're there yet. What do you think?

52:30.160 --> 52:32.160
what I think is

52:32.840 --> 52:38.040
essentially, I agree with wimpy and that I prefer the model to have a repository and

52:38.280 --> 52:45.120
if we want to see the repository still to prevail as the way to install packages what we have essentially to do is

52:45.120 --> 52:50.320
just make the process easier for third parties to come and put their package in and

52:50.680 --> 52:51.880
Once we do that

52:51.880 --> 52:58.240
There's no excuse to why they're not deploying through that mechanism and why are they are distributing, you know?

52:58.240 --> 53:01.640
Through their website instead and perhaps make it easy

53:02.520 --> 53:05.360
To make their website put something that you know

53:05.360 --> 53:10.680
Like you do in Android you be doing a website in the text that it's an application from the Play Store and opens the Play

53:10.680 --> 53:12.840
Store you might want something that is similar to that

53:12.840 --> 53:19.280
That goes and opens your software center and install that so the website will do not actually have a download

53:19.280 --> 53:23.480
But actually something though because the store yes, that's true. Yeah rotten

53:23.480 --> 53:29.280
I wanted to give you a chance to jump in and just I was curious your thoughts about the process right now of getting into

53:29.280 --> 53:31.080
That central store

53:31.080 --> 53:36.960
Yeah, it's actually very easy. Like wimpy was talking about how he builds the snaps locally. You don't have to do that

53:37.480 --> 53:41.160
You can actually just make the yaml file and then send it to the launchpad

53:41.160 --> 53:44.680
we'll build it for you through the snap craft tool and create all the

53:45.320 --> 53:50.160
architectures snaps that you want and you just push it to the store and if you and if you get

53:50.440 --> 53:54.400
You on if you have a if you are a part of a project and you were like the official person

53:54.400 --> 53:59.520
You get the namespace of the official project. If you're not you get for example telegram

53:59.520 --> 54:07.220
It's telegram dash the name of the guy who did it then so that way you can there's there's no one fighting over namespace

54:07.220 --> 54:14.020
So then to get into the store is very simple and as long as your stuff runs and when you know

54:14.020 --> 54:16.360
It doesn't break anything. It's all good and you get it in there

54:16.360 --> 54:19.640
And then if you have let's say you see a bug and you want to fix it

54:19.640 --> 54:24.780
You just do it again through launchpad push it to the store and then the user gets the access to it and gets the update

54:24.780 --> 54:29.620
Hmm. Yeah, it actually is so it sounds like the biggest convenience here

54:29.620 --> 54:32.300
Sounds like the biggest inconvenience is you have to have a launchpad account

54:32.300 --> 54:36.840
I don't know. Yeah, that's about the size of it

54:39.020 --> 54:40.780
For some that's a deal-breaker

54:40.780 --> 54:44.620
And don't think it's a good thing. It's free and open-source launchpad is yeah

54:45.300 --> 54:50.080
And the the Ubuntu snap store implementation is just a snap store

54:50.540 --> 54:53.760
Implementation I think others will sprout up

54:54.300 --> 54:54.820
Yeah

54:54.820 --> 55:00.620
I I want their own to be only to be one because then if there is more than one there creates more

55:00.620 --> 55:05.340
Availability issues, but if there was a structure for example like Ubuntu's

55:05.820 --> 55:10.480
Store was like the core base that you could build on top of and have your own snaps

55:10.900 --> 55:14.140
But if you don't have a snap for a particular application you got it as like a fallback

55:14.420 --> 55:20.100
Yeah, or it could end up like repos where you could have multiples. You could have your local installation of snap

55:20.940 --> 55:23.420
Pointed at multiple repos just like you can't a flat pack today

55:23.980 --> 55:27.900
Couldn't it could be like that too. It might not be a hard-coded to a single story. Maybe you could have

55:27.900 --> 55:32.020
You know, let's say I'm let's say I'm Ubuntu mate. I could have

55:32.620 --> 55:35.860
When when my users launched their version of the software center

55:35.860 --> 55:40.420
it could be looking at can all of canonicals snap store and a

55:40.860 --> 55:43.060
Ubuntu mate snap store that maybe has

55:43.460 --> 55:49.220
The the welcome screen in it and maybe a menu launcher and a few other things that you know

55:49.220 --> 55:55.580
They've created that to ease the process and it may be it's only four or five things just like today enter gross does

55:55.580 --> 56:02.900
Enter gross does repo priority and you have anti grosses repo at the top and then they have the regular main

56:03.100 --> 56:06.520
repos and they they can pull from all the different sources just like a lot of like

56:06.620 --> 56:10.900
Like we see today with a lot of derivatives only this would be a snap version and be it

56:11.020 --> 56:13.020
It might not have support for it today

56:13.300 --> 56:17.220
Snap and snap and local snap do you know that might not have support for multiple stores today?

56:17.220 --> 56:21.660
But this is an open source project. I mean in a year it could it could do ten times what it does today

56:21.660 --> 56:27.860
Right. It has support for a store like having your own custom store now like, you know

56:27.900 --> 56:34.020
So it's only been like two weeks since that was even announced like they were doing the different distro stuff

56:34.020 --> 56:37.060
So that's already been proving that they're gonna do other things

56:37.060 --> 56:43.120
But there's actually something that a lot of people aren't aware of is that when you have a snap in the store

56:43.140 --> 56:47.700
You actually don't just have that snap and that branch you have multiple branches

56:47.700 --> 56:52.820
You have the stable branch the unstable branch like the constant testing branch

56:52.820 --> 56:57.140
So you can actually have like betas and all this and it's all still one snap that you control

56:57.140 --> 57:00.540
They just can the user can select which branch they want to use

57:00.540 --> 57:03.180
So if they want to lay absolute latest they can get it

57:03.580 --> 57:10.780
What about licensing issues like for you know, Adobe Reader or you know, they'll be flash or something like that. I

57:12.140 --> 57:14.340
Guess more so so more specifically, I guess here's my question

57:14.340 --> 57:20.820
The the concern I have about the whole repo idea is you're gonna wind up with I'm afraid that anyway that you're gonna wind up

57:20.820 --> 57:26.660
With some distros having certain repos and those repos not being added by default in other distros

57:26.660 --> 57:32.480
And so what you wind up with is again certain packages available in one distro and and and not another well

57:32.480 --> 57:37.380
But they're all snaps. They're all snaps. You can always just grab the snap right if you know where to but yeah, you're right

57:37.380 --> 57:40.780
Yeah, here's what I think though about that for when it comes to licensing and stuff like that

57:40.780 --> 57:42.780
I don't know if there's a direct answer because

57:42.780 --> 57:50.140
For all we know in six months snap or flat packet have have an option at install where it enables user prompting to accept

57:50.140 --> 57:53.780
EULA's and so that I'm not so worried about what wait the point

57:53.780 --> 57:55.700
I think you're touching on is if

57:55.700 --> 58:01.400
Something were to happen where you had multiple stores and you had like the chairman's talking about multiple people submit telegram

58:01.500 --> 58:05.720
How would you know which telegram is the one that's the most secure most updated most reliable?

58:05.720 --> 58:09.180
I think what you would see if that truly existed

58:09.180 --> 58:15.080
I think you're gonna like this answer is the market would respond by creating a directory like like GNOME files

58:15.140 --> 58:18.300
And like the you app browser that's already created there

58:18.300 --> 58:24.580
The open source community will step up and create a platform where you'll have everything indexed. You'll have comments

58:24.580 --> 58:29.240
You'll have votes. You'll have just like the AUR or just just like at GNOME files, right?

58:29.240 --> 58:31.340
It'll be that what so I don't use the

58:31.820 --> 58:32.860
As much as you do

58:32.860 --> 58:33.460
But you know

58:33.460 --> 58:40.100
I I go back to the most effective way for me to research products nowadays as I go to Amazon and sort by number of

58:40.100 --> 58:42.820
Reviews and if 10,000 people bought something and really liked it

58:42.820 --> 58:47.220
I know that I can try and buy the same product and probably a good experience right if we could bring that to software

58:47.780 --> 58:49.780
Jeez, man. Yeah, exactly

58:49.980 --> 58:52.540
Exactly. I think the market that's just what happened

58:52.900 --> 58:57.380
So wimpy I there's something you want to jump in before we wrap up because I didn't talk about this for that long

58:57.380 --> 58:59.380
But I wanted to give you the last shout. I

58:59.500 --> 59:03.160
Can't remember. Okay, no problem. No problem. You know what? I'll just say this

59:03.160 --> 59:08.100
we should probably move on because right now as we record this there is actually a news event happening and we

59:08.660 --> 59:13.380
Like I don't even know how long into the show and we haven't even mentioned it if you get to the point where you want

59:13.380 --> 59:19.100
To host your own flat packs your app images or your own snap store digital ocean.com use the promo code do

59:19.580 --> 59:25.260
Unplugged support this show and get a $10 credit man. Digital ocean is great because it's all KVM

59:25.260 --> 59:32.580
So the virtualizer I think I mean just my opinion the best virtualizing platform. I have ever used KVM is the bee's knees

59:32.580 --> 59:34.460
They've stacked that on top of SSDs

59:34.460 --> 59:40.580
Of course, it's all running on top of Linux 40 gigabit e connections into the hyper visors data centers all over the world and

59:40.980 --> 59:45.180
Literally the best interface that could have possibly built sitting on top of the shenanigans

59:45.180 --> 59:49.500
I don't know how they do it and the nice thing it's all HTML and even if it was an if they

59:49.860 --> 59:54.220
Like if if they had a native app that looked that worked this gotta be like man

59:54.220 --> 59:56.580
They got a great desktop app and then they have a functional website

59:56.580 --> 01:00:00.860
No, it's like better than I would have ever expected even from a native app. It is extremely functional

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:05.900
You get HTML 5 console access to your rigs. You can deploy SSH keys to multiple machines at a time

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.520
You can spin up applications like the entire frequent stack from everything from the you know

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:15.660
The kernel of whatever distro you chose all the way up to the final crazy Ruby on rails application

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.540
You want to run or just the base system?

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:22.100
They got data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore afternoon, London, Toronto, Germany, India

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:29.140
They're growing like crazy and they've matched this great interface that I just freaking love with a super cool

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:36.740
API an API that's so straightforward and simple and something they take seriously that a really great community has cropped up and built a ton

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:41.440
Of open source code around that speak in a community. They have some of the best documentation out there

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:45.060
Literally, even if you're not digital ocean customer, it's still

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.900
One of the best resources out there check it out because they take that very seriously

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:55.440
Which means between the application stacks they have available the base distros they have to choose from and their documentation

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.600
Experts and beginners can make super super good use out of a digital ocean droplet

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:06.360
They also have hourly pricing available because you can spin up and destroy a rig in matter of seconds with snapshots

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.040
You can restore and get right back to where you're at

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:12.600
It's really nice to take advantage of their hourly pricing and we use our promo code do

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:17.360
Unplugged one word lowercase you get the $10 credit that hourly price is gonna last you forever

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.720
So if you want to experiment with something on a machine that has a crazy great internet connection tons of CPU

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:26.000
You want to have multiple people bang on it? You want to put it in production for yourself?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.200
If you want something you can access between your work and your home and also on your mobile device and not have to mess

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.200
Around and fuss with your crappy router

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.880
Digital ocean just use the promo code do unplugged and if you ever get to a point where you're ready to put this thing in

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.000
production

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.960
It'll work. It'll do it and they make it easy to expand the machines to especially now with a new block storage beta program

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.360
You know right now

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.080
Jupiter broadcasting is taking advantage of digital oceans infrastructure like never before

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.540
It's so nice to know that when we just want to try a concept we can mess around on digital ocean

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:03.720
We don't have to worry about the costs. We know we get great performance and we're ready to go into production

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:10.040
We have enterprise grade features like their API like the snapshot capability like the application stack deployments

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.360
and

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.760
Go ahead. I'm just gonna say you're slowly moving your studio up to the

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.720
Cloud it's just a cloud that you can control so that you can get to it from anywhere in your RV

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.720
I was just I was just gonna say and now with the new team features

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.240
I'll just never have to worry about and let Noah do everything. Oh

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.320
Digital ocean

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.520
Well, that's Rekha's got the post-production work

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.680
Noah's got the server side work and you know also they make it nice

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.360
They like if you want to set something up for a client and transfer it to him you can transfer droplets

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.860
It's a pretty great service digital ocean comm just use the promo code do unplugged in a big. Thanks to digital ocean

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:48.420
So I was saying there's a news event going on right now

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:53.160
I got a little audio to get you in the mood for those of you that didn't know and I almost I

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:59.420
Considered making it but I would have to mess with the whole road trip plans that I I have right now

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:00.380
So I couldn't do it

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:05.320
But going on right now is a Red Hat summit or as the Red Hat folks that I've been talking to you call it

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:10.480
Summit summit is going on right now, and I got a little audio to put you in the mood

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:13.660
Whoa

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:18.020
Now no you might I always heard about it. You know you might be a little jealous new to Red Hat

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:22.820
I've only been doing it for over a year now my job thought it would be a great idea and a great experience for me

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:24.820
to come to Red Hat summit

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.940
My

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.860
Excitement here is to learn about a lot of things that I heard this morning

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.700
12 plus new release announcements. I'm like yes

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:40.820
And I'm just looking forward to the next four days. I mean there's so much going on around application development containers

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:46.740
Which is part of my world. I think there's a you know opportunity to figure out what's going on all in one place

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:52.900
You have a lot of vendors at summit who are in starting to embrace open source in new ways one of the things that we're really

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:59.420
Trying to talk about with customers is the fact that we have this cross portfolio experience including services

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:05.020
And it's not just product by product and these solutions can really help them solve specific problems all right

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:10.180
I was excited. I was stoked until that until that last executive spoke there

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:13.820
And then then the entire thing kind of lost me. I don't

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:20.660
You didn't hear it. Did you the smurfs is the fact that we have this cross portfolio experience, okay?

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:26.820
So one of the things we're trying to communicate to customers that we have this cross part proof a cross portfolio experience, okay?

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:31.380
Yeah, including services, and it's not just product by product including services

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:38.060
And it's not just product by product and these solutions can really help them solve specific problems

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:41.740
But these solutions can really help them solve specific problems

01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:44.140
I'm gonna play it once in its entirety Noah and then once it's done

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:49.860
I want you to tell me what she just said okay trying to talk about with customers is the fact that we have this

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:58.020
Cross portfolio experience including services, and it's not just product by product and these solutions can really help them solve specific problems

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:02.420
things you just saying that the red hat solutions stretch across a

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:10.220
Vast so they partnered with or they're working with Microsoft, and they're and they're working very hard with all of the different problems

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:14.860
Here and hired industry experts and have look available

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.740
All right, so you

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:21.940
All right

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:26.540
Yeah, okay, okay, okay, so that's what you think all right? No that was a good try. That was a good solid effort

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.540
We have good. We got nice music. Ooh

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:34.340
Yeah, okay, so I mean I'm digging this piece overall wimpy. Could you could you explain to me what she said?

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.060
Yeah, they've got I'm duck woods

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:42.700
You know I that wasn't helpful actually that didn't help Chris

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:47.740
You of all people should understand this that poor woman that poor woman is standing there

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:49.380
It's dead she's standing there with her computer

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:53.860
And she's working on a couple of things and everyone is like tapping her on the shoulder and finally this guy turns around

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.500
He's like hey

01:05:54.500 --> 01:06:00.060
I'm John from the from the from the media marketing department, and we're gonna shoot this thing about we're interviewing people

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:03.780
So tell us about red hat and she's and she told him. She's like. I'm not really good on camera

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.540
I don't you'd be fine. You'd be fine. I don't even really know to you. You'll be fine here

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:11.380
We're gonna start rolling okay. Go and then that's what came out. That's definitely a possibility

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:15.440
That's totally what happened. I I think I think what it was

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:18.940
Now here's what I think it was Noah and picture it okay

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:25.980
It's it's two days before the floor opens you finally just got all the banners up the executives are arriving for their pictures

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:31.420
Whoa who's getting aggressive in the mumble room daredevil and you were getting aggressive there in the mumble room everybody's arrived for their pictures

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:36.820
You haven't actually opened the doors yet, but from a corporate standpoint

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:44.620
You have decided what your core message about this entire event is so you get your marketing team there with their eight with their DSLR

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:50.700
Camera, and you say summit who are starting to embrace open source in new ways one of the things that we're really trying to talk

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:56.620
About with customers is the fact that we have this cross portfolio experience including services

01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:01.740
And it's not just product by product and these solutions can really help them solve specific problems

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:06.780
What I love about it is she ends with these solutions can help them solve specific problems

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:13.740
What what's so what's so corporately wonderful about it is we can help you solve your specific problem after making the most vague

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:20.780
Possible with generalized statement we could ever come up with that's what's so amazing about and I really respect Red Hat as a company

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:23.060
But when they actually outwardly communicate

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:28.820
So they don't they don't actually allow all the cool people in the company to brag and talk about all the neat stuff

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:32.980
They're doing and so when they communicate with their Red Hat voice

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.340
Even their CEO who seems like a pretty great guy

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:40.580
Communicates in this style that feels like Microsoft at its clumsiest

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:46.260
Yeah, I don't I guess I don't know I guess the problem is you're you're dealing with a couple of things, right?

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:51.140
You're dealing with a you're dealing with the most litigious country in the entire world

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:53.860
Yeah, that's such a that's such a tired Red Hat excuse

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:58.100
I'm so true when you have a company that big that's worth that much money

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:02.260
Yeah, they're walking around with a constant target on their butt meanwhile companies that are

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:09.500
Jillions of times larger have their top CEO a top top people sitting down and talking to podcasters by anything the podcaster asks them

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:15.540
That's such a tired tried excuse for all of the things that are wrong with Red Hat and fedora. I'm just sick of it

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:20.500
I just I guess I guess I would agree with you and you I know for a fact you've been there with me

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:25.980
I would agree with you if it wasn't for the fact that we've talked to those people and what they say on camera and what?

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:30.820
They're able to say I think I don't think I think there's I think there is a culture problem at Red Hat and I think

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:36.580
That the employees absolutely fear all these legal things. I don't think I think they all are the biggest bunch of paranoid

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:40.380
People out there. I mean it is ridiculous. I it's given their clientele

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:43.580
Do you think it I mean is it is the community involvement or a better presence?

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.820
Just not in their interest in the long-term fiscal sense. I think giving their clientele. It's expected

01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:51.660
This is how you communicate so it's part of the reason they communicate this way

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.580
Yeah, that's that might be part of it

01:08:54.580 --> 01:09:00.340
I guess I guess I just every time I every time that we've had somebody on

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:07.260
Camera, it seems like they they they follow this the the strict rudimentary procedure and then you get them off-camera and they're geeks

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:12.100
Just like you and me and that that just tells me that they have hired legal people that have specifically told them

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.780
Hey, these are the things that you don't want

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:17.940
These are these are the approved things that you say because these are the things that we can get right sure

01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:20.940
I feel like that does feel like what they say

01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:25.500
Why is it that the no other companies like that? No other company?

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:32.300
We talked to no other company in the Linux ecosystem has these same concerns other people are worried about these particular issues

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:39.340
But nobody is literally petrified the the employees from Red Hat are terrified of this particular issue. Nobody else is like that

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:41.340
What's the down?

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:47.420
I'd claim that none of them is as big as Red Hat and that's one thing and they have to be risk-takers if they want to

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.220
Be in the platform discussing when Red Hat is discussing things

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:57.020
You know what? I will also claim that they mentioned solutions, which is you know keyword to we provide for everything

01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:01.100
But what without committing into any specifics and you come with us you talk with us

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:01.580
Yeah

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:08.540
We're really trying to talk about with customers is the fact that we have this cross portfolio experience including services

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:13.580
And it's not just product by product and these solutions can really help them solve specific problems

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:16.300
You know, I've heard that 30 times and I still just doesn't make any sense

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:21.740
And I guess it doesn't matter. It's it's just a it's just a part of how they communicate. That's my that's my main point

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.220
They need some cross vocabulary solutions

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:31.500
Maybe they just think which company provides products and always advertises their products and it's their competitor

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:36.140
While they're providing solutions and that will be more pleased more pleasant to their customers to hear

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:40.220
Yeah, just think about that. Who's that usual canonical for example? Yeah

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:44.380
Focus on their products. It's there. What's the downside?

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:48.060
Yeah of saying something like that. Like where where is that? Where is it? Where is it problematic?

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:52.460
It sounds like disingenuous bullshit by people that don't actually even know the very products

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:55.260
They're selling and which makes me have doubt in the people that run the company

01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:59.820
But because there's a clear communication style

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:04.540
Isn't that doubt alleviated from the from the from from the from the people that do have the expertise

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.140
No, because they're not the ones making the decisions

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:09.580
The people making the decisions don't even know the product

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.140
Right and they're not listening to that spiel as well

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:16.380
Right, and they're not listening to that spiel. Anyway, they don't care the deals are made elsewhere, right?

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:22.460
But I feel like the entire culture at red hat is the is the idea that anyone in the company

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:27.260
Has the ability to offer input and in there is no top-down hierarchy

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:30.620
And that was entire that was the entire purpose of jim whitehurst's book

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:35.020
Was that he thought he was going to go into this company and teach them how to run a company from the top down

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.740
And what it taught him was that that's not the way that a company is run

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:43.340
Okay, that's much I mean I just that does sound that's the way pretty much every corporate company

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:48.380
Every you know cover integer speaks when you they do any kind of press like why what hurts?

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:50.380
What is hurting red hat in this case?

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:55.900
Maybe it's because no one listens to what they say because they never say anything. That is exactly it

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:59.340
And I don't really I guess I wish we weren't dwelling on this because i'd rather move on

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:04.140
But my point is is when you don't speak clearly you don't connect to the to the linux audience

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:09.580
You don't connect to the to the linux audience if you have an audience in the open source

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:14.540
This is this is a summit for technical people. Okay. This is not a marketing event. This isn't ces

01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:17.020
This isn't the this isn't something for consumers

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:23.980
This is at the red hat summit for people who are sys admins and people that make their livings on red hat systems, right?

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.500
So I think I want to be clear

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:31.020
This is an introduction to why you as a technical person should come to the summit that was posted on the red hat youtube channel

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:37.180
I get I guess that wasn't my impression of of uh of red hat summit. I thought it was for more like high level

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:39.020
you know like uh

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:41.020
like uh, you know

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:45.980
Absolutely, then there's there's all kinds of yeah, there's people vars there and all kinds of stuff and another

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:51.180
Another group of people there is microsoft, uh, and they made some huge announcement announcements at red hat summit

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:56.540
Which I think is sort of a big news story kind of in on itself is that microsoft is making these announcements at a red

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:02.380
Hat summit the company announced the general availability of dot net core and asp.net core 10 the microsoft announcement

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:07.500
uh is kind of a big deal at red hat summit and one of the motivations in open sourcing dot net is

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:13.500
They really want to collaborate more with red hat and red hat has a couple of web pages dedicated on their website now to making

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.580
red hat the premier dot net platform

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:21.420
Uh, the red dot net foundation will be the steward of overall dot net development and red hat just joined that foundation

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:23.820
So that's kind of a big deal

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:27.500
That's one of the that's an example of some of the folks that are at uh, the summit

01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:32.940
And it's really microsoft kind of delivering on this this promise of opening dot net and getting it running on linux

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:33.420
Yeah

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:39.340
Well, they seem to have some serious motivation because they announced that nearly one in three azure virtual machines are now running linux

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:45.100
Microsoft is uh sort of seeing a huge growth because just the same time last year they said one and four

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:49.340
So now they've gone in a year at least according to racinovich who runs azure

01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:53.820
uh, this is microsoft's gone from one and four of its azure virtual machines to one and three

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:56.140
and uh

01:13:56.140 --> 01:14:00.460
The other the other uh, two-thirds are just azure customers running windows servers and virtual machines

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.540
So they're they're seeing a big uptick for linux at azure and you know

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:09.340
It's one of the reasons linux academy has launched azure training is it's just big over there

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.820
So yeah

01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:14.380
That's a big. I don't know guys to me that seems like uh

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:19.340
It seems like the microsoft stuff changes how I think about it a little bit like I wouldn't previously like if I was going to

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:24.220
Make a project. I wasn't going to start it on dot net and maybe java if I want like a nice object oriented garbage collective

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.020
Etc

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.860
But if they're going to have first class linux support and you know really stand behind like that then

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:31.020
I mean they don't they make some good software

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:35.740
They have a lot of talented engineers there if they're really down with the openness, then maybe it's something to be worthwhile

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:42.060
So I just looked at the registration at 1600 bucks, uh for the for the full pass to go there

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:48.220
So it and to me this seems like a this seems like the oscon and the linux con of conferences

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:49.900
Except it based more on linux

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:57.260
And so in that regard, I don't know that I don't know that highly technical down to earth, you know unfiltered

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.420
You know technical talk is is necessarily the most appropriate to marketing video

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:06.540
Dude, you are really just all in with red hat. Well, I just I just I just I really am

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:11.260
You know, i'm not I guess i'm just not you're telling me you're telling me

01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:16.620
I mean, I I feel like this is sort of almost like it doesn't even need explaining but

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.700
What are what are the number who are the number one attendees of oscon?

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:26.860
You know, we've talked to a lot of a lot of big business people that could care less about no those are the vars

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.300
Those are the people at the booths

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:34.620
The attendees are our sys admins and dev guys who are sent there by their company because their company's paying for the ticket

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:39.260
That's the people walking around the floor. Those are the people attending the talks. That's I mean, come on

01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:41.900
Those are the people filling up those rooms listening to the talks

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.700
I I I I guess I I guess I don't I guess you're right there

01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:53.020
I mean, there's definitely a large majority of those but there's also a healthy there's also a healthy majority of

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:55.420
people that are you know that are

01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:01.660
That are just you know decision makers just you know executive types that are there to learn about their technology, too

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:05.420
They're not actually the ones implementing that stuff the low level developer kind of people

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:10.700
Uh, but I you're right. I mean we walked into that. There's a whole group of people that were that we talked to

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.060
Was at oscon, I think and all of them, uh, you know

01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:17.420
I think the funnier thing is that you're bringing it back up after we moved on

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.100
I just I went and looked at their website and I was like, all right

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:27.980
A little bit i'm looking at the keynote speakers and i'm looking there's a guy from target. There's a guy from uh, from from uh, intel

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.340
There's a guy from dell

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:35.420
It just it it very much feels like a very corporatey conference and it seems like corporatey speak is appropriate there

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:37.260
So what do you think about what do you think about?

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:43.580
Uh red hat enterprise being the premier platform to build dot net on a proven and trusted enterprise linux

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:49.500
Dot net on red hat enterprise linux gets started right now if you go to developers dot red hat dot com slash dot net

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:51.660
What are you excited noah?

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:57.260
I am excited that a company like microsoft is going to have the incredible influence of red hat over them

01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.260
To help them push them in the right direction

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:05.980
Uh, well, that's a very political way to say that that is very nice. Very nice. Um,

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:12.700
Are you okay if we move on or do we do we do we gotta hug it out if we gotta hug it out

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:17.740
No, we're good. I mean because you know, I know I know you don't like it when we talk bad about your red hat

01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:24.300
No, no, it's okay. Just they they red hat is why i'm on linux is because they made such an amazing product

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.820
Ha ha

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.740
All right. Well

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:31.580
Speaking of running linux. I have been running linux mint 18

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.300
And I gotta tell you

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:35.580
It's not so bad

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:37.580
Uh by the time you're probably getting this down

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:44.860
Listen, if you're a download audience member linux 8 linux mint 18 cinnamon and mate additions will likely be released softpedia

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:49.500
Noticed it a little earlier. Thanks to a tipster. They have links to the iso downloads which are in our show notes

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:52.460
And this is as of june 28th

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.300
um now

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:58.860
This is the uh, this is the new version after a lot of talk about xapps and all of that kind of stuff

01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:04.780
It has the new of cinnamon 3.0 goodness in it that probably a lot of you have been anticipating if you're a cinnamon user

01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.940
And this release is going to be supported until

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.180
2021

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:14.480
So this is something that'll be around for a while. In fact, it'll be the base of future releases until 2018

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:17.340
So like I was mentioning this has the new xapps in it

01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:22.940
Which I had a chance to try out a little bit. It has high dpi support. Well, he's much improved high dpi support

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.300
um

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.300
Has the uh, it has the brand new

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:31.740
Info screen when you launch the update manager for the first time that gives you a little bit more clarification about the different

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:34.620
upgrade options

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.260
What is there's somebody like

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:41.340
There is somebody there is somebody going on with the jacksaw in the back. I don't know what's going on out there

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:47.500
Uh, and uh, it's got uh, I the new theme that is based on arc and the mocha icon theme

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.300
uh the mint y theme which actually

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.100
When you put it in dark mode looks, uh

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:59.340
It looks pretty nice. It looks uh, pretty nice. So this is the new mint 18 sort of at a very high level

01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:01.180
I've only been using it for like um

01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:03.920
Three hours, so I only have very very first impressions

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:05.580
I did hit a few bumps

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.980
So I want to give you guys a few warnings and things like that

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:12.620
Anybody in the mumble room had a chance to try any of the betas of mint 18 or been looking at it as the release

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:14.460
Has been getting closer

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:19.420
I've been doing competitive research. Yes. Oh, really? And what is your uh, reconnaissance, uh showing you?

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.540
Uh, it's linux mint

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.100
Same stuff but newer

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.180
so, um

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:33.020
That was sort of my impression too and I was actually kind of hoping you would have more because I didn't have much

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.580
That's kind of oh my god. Sorry. Sorry for stealing your wind. Yeah, you did

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:41.420
And my wind was not much. I had very little wind, uh, which is not normal right now

01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:45.740
I think right now like what we were talking about at least we're talking about like 17 71, etc

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:47.340
I think

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:48.940
We kind of know what linux mint is

01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:52.620
And where they really shined in the past was on some of that polish and integration

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:55.420
And it's kind of hard to assess that this close after release, right?

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:59.420
So maybe in a week or two we can see really are they excelling at what they're trying to do or not?

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:04.700
Yeah, I actually think wait a week or two would be good advice because uh, so I decided to put this on the libram

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:09.100
Which is as you guys are probably well aware a laptop built to run linux

01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:11.100
No, did you know that?

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:15.580
What are you laughing about? It's a laptop built to run linux. What's the problem? What's undoubtedly about to leave your mouth?

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:20.860
So, uh the linux mint, uh first pass on the install, uh wouldn't work

01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:27.260
Uh, it warned me about some uefi issue. Uh, basically that I had another os on there and that uh,

01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:33.500
Yeah, there's some shenanigans where to occur with a with a bios simulation that I may not be able to boot into their os

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:37.660
Is to which I said the entire reason i'm installing mint is to not boot into those other os

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.820
So go ahead and nuke and pave. All right, so I figured this problem solved. Oh, no

01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:45.020
What you didn't switch the hard drive, did you?

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:46.300
No

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:49.820
Okay, so we just blew away our obs. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:54.220
Yeah, and and I realized that and I realized it doesn't boot. It's just so

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.420
Good at all. So that's good. So that's sweet

01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:02.380
And then I did manage to get it to boot but uh, I don't know why but my wi-fi is not working

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:06.780
And I haven't and that's kind of so I just ended up using ethernet, uh usb adapter to play around because

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.260
I didn't have time to troubleshoot the wi-fi at the moment

01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:14.140
I did notice the settings control panel is also a little cleaned up and there's uh, there's the you know

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:20.140
There the overall uh, the new theme and all that and the new version of uh, sentiment is really nice

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:22.380
It's a really nice stuff to click yet

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:28.780
So I tried to figure that out for you because I thought you might ask me that and they've removed the mouse and trackpad

01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:32.780
Uh control panel applet from the settings thing now you might

01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:35.500
Some stuff you can still search for like so for example

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.740
If you wanted to search for uh proprietary drivers

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:42.620
You don't you no longer can find like the drivers or software sources entry in the settings

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:45.260
But if you search for it in your mint menu, it will come up

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.540
Ah, that's good that that makes a lot of sense. I'm glad to hear that

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:53.500
So yeah, it looks like I was gonna ask if we can enable touch to click. Yeah, right. I know I know no not no

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:58.380
No, not no, I hate apps to click. I don't just and I don't mean like click during the show. No, uh,

01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:00.700
quietly click

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:07.580
Here's your the thing is I actually not only I don't just like kind of dislike it. I actively like I can't stand it

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.860
I can't stand I can't even use a computer if it has to happen

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:15.500
He gets super grumpy west and then if it's like one in the morning, he gets like all diva about it. It's bad

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:18.700
It's real bad. We don't want that and you could ask rikai

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:26.060
My son dylan was over here at the house last night at the studio and uh, he was going on a rant about track pads

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:32.460
And then him and rikai started labeling me as a track pad as a track pad supporter as a tracks

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:36.620
I know it got it started getting heated in my own studio over track pads

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:40.540
So I you know, and i'm just i'm just a track pad indifference. That's all I don't like them

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:44.220
But I don't dislike them that much and I started I started taking a lot of track bad heat

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:49.260
So no, you are you are leading a revolution, you know, who else is leading a revolution?

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:51.260
That'd be red hat in their communication

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:56.060
Is one of the things that we're really trying to talk about with customers is the fact that we have this

01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:04.140
Cross-portfolio experience including services and it's not just product by product and solutions can really help them solve specific problems

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.620
Yeah

01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:11.180
Uh track bad works under fedor just saying oh good. Yeah. Yeah the new lib input, huh? Yeah, that is nice

01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:15.340
I can go ahead and disable tactically. That's it's fantastic. You know the first time we used the new fedora 24

01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:18.620
There was like 20 seconds where the mouse felt really weird

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:23.820
And then yeah, go ahead. Are you looking for are you looking for cross cursor solutions?

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:31.580
Yeah, could you have any specifics because uh, I wonder if you don't have it from any specific division maybe as a service

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:36.060
All right. So this is yeah, can't you tell this is my last lup for a week? Yeah, I know right

01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:42.860
All right before we get into these desktop killers that wimpy and I have been drooling over and I think noah

01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:47.420
You're perfectly suited as a orx pro owner and as somebody who also has the 13 inch side of this

01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:54.220
we're going to talk about um, is linux technically dead on the desktop not because of linux itself, but because

01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:57.580
Just statistically speaking in 10 years five years

01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:01.740
Is is the desktop really going to be necessary

01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:07.020
We have a couple of new products out in the market that are just unbelievably powerful and they're portable

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:09.580
I I can't even as somebody who works in video production

01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:11.340
I can't even believe i'm about to ask this question

01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.980
But realistically I gotta look at I gotta look at the specs

01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:19.100
I gotta look at the sales stats and I gotta ask the question. So before we go there, let's go somewhere nice

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:24.780
Let's go to this new. Oh, there it is. There's the one just on time. There's that weed whacker good

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:30.860
This is uh, we're then we've added that weed whacker in post. We sweetened up the linux academy spot

01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:34.060
We wanted to make sure you know what else and then we add a few other things like we brought in bill hammer from

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:36.140
Our himmer from uh, fox news

01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:41.340
See there's bill so that's nice and megan kelly's here too to help us omg omg omg

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:45.500
I don't know why I don't know why but we also have a little background music for linux academy

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.820
That's right. Go over to linuxacademy.com

01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:51.500
Unplugged friends and look at that new site. Oh, look at that site

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:55.100
Oh friends

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.420
Look at that thing. They they I tell you what

01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:02.140
They ain't stopping over at linux academy. They're adding new content all the time

01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:07.740
They've expanded their staff to make sure the old stuff stays relevant. It's linux enthusiasts

01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:10.700
trainers developers

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:14.720
Educators they've came together. They created a linux academy platform and you can get started at linuxacademy.com

01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:17.580
Unplugged you get a great discount

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.100
They have hands-on labs

01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:22.220
So you get to work with this stuff instructor mentoring when you need to talk to humans

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:26.940
Video courses with self-paced in-depth courses. We can download comprehensive study guide

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:31.340
The courseware automatically adjusts to the distribution you want to use

01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:34.620
Learning plans

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.120
learning paths

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:42.300
Availability planners all of these things help you structure a learning plan when you don't have a lot of time. So if you get busy

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:45.500
Going on a road trip those kinds of things you're going to tokyo

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:51.740
Linux academy's got your back. I like that too for the this is like when you're just

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:57.260
You only got an hour. They got nuggets deep dives. They have ios and android applications

01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.500
They have note cards that can be forked to help you study

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:02.300
And they have a super active community packed

01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:06.140
Full of jupiter broadcasting members

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:10.460
Or if you have 13 hours of free wi-fi on an airplane over to tokyo

01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:12.300
then

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.140
You can continue to learn

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:19.500
While lounging about on an airplane. I like that in business class too at that you swath son of a gun

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:24.160
That's right getting your getting your knowledge on at linuxacademy.com

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:27.660
Go check them out. They're growing like crazy

01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:30.380
It's a really great platform committed

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:35.740
To expanding linux all of the technologies linux core technologies and also the technologies built

01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.380
On top of linux academy go there now

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.700
Because time my friends

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.700
Is running out

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.540
Linux academy.com

01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:47.980
Unplugged and a big thank you to linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:53.500
And thank you to that weed whacker for adding a little bit of extra context to that spot a little extra buzz

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:58.860
Yeah, you know a little bit of layers a little bit of flavor. So, uh, there's this guy named martin wimpress

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:00.380
Uh, I don't know who he is

01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:02.540
But he's got a lot of nerve teasing me like this

01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:08.780
This son of a gun over here posts that intro where will soon be announcing a new laptop that he had the privilege of naming

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:11.020
the entry where athena

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:12.860
Well wimpy that sounds pretty cool

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:17.260
Tell me about the process of naming a computer and maybe a little bit of backstory here about the athena

01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:19.420
And then the big reveal if you will

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:23.980
Okay, so I obviously have a relationship with intro where um

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:29.740
And i've known that they've been working on this computer for some months now

01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:33.660
And as it was getting close it had like a code name

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:39.740
Uh, and we were exchanging details using the code name and uh, and then they sort of said oh

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.740
We're going to call it this

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:44.940
And I was like, oh, okay. I said, oh, uh

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.020
Oh, we're thinking of calling it this and I was like, oh

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:54.940
I'd like uh coming up with a name. So I came up with the the name athena which they liked so

01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.660
It's the intro where athena

01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:04.620
That is pretty an athena. What is there any special revelance or uh connection to the name? Well, um

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:09.180
Um, all of their machines are named after greek gods and goddesses

01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:14.780
uh, um, and I like the classics and athena I think is the uh,

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.020
the uh

01:28:17.020 --> 01:28:18.540
most interesting

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:23.580
Uh of the goddesses. So she's the goddess of war and peace

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:28.780
and wisdom and craft and uh, all sorts of things so she's uh, she's

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:31.740
Got more attributes than any of the others

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:37.020
So, uh, this is a pretty well-specced machine and depending on your different options

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.020
It could be a powerhouse now

01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:44.540
I I happened to a little birdie told me that you may have ended up purchasing one of these athenas

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:50.060
So you must have had it for at least a bit wimpy. How is it? How is the machine?

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:54.620
Why did you decide to purchase it? What are your experiences like tell us all about it?

01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:58.300
So I have sold every computer I own

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:02.220
My own in order in order to make some money to buy this

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:06.860
So once I knew this was on its way i've been ebaying my com my computers

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.820
and um

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:16.140
Uh, i've also I don't if remember a few weeks ago. There was a sharp uptick in uh, the bitcoin price

01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:22.140
It went up about 20. Oh, yeah, I did notice that as a matter of fact. Yeah. Yeah, so I I I cashed out some coins

01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:27.100
Between you know, and I were playing the bitcoin market for our hardware. Yeah

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:30.380
To uh to uh, sort of cover the balance

01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:32.700
so I

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.940
uh, i've gone full full metal

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.500
intro ware athena, so uh

01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:42.380
The one I have has got the uh skylake i7 6820 hk

01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:48.300
Which is a quad core and that can push out a turbo 3.6 gigahertz

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:52.220
64 gigs of ddr4 ram

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:54.940
all right, um i've got uh

01:29:54.940 --> 01:30:00.060
Uh, i've only installed three of the hard drives at the moment. So i've got three ssds in there at the moment

01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:03.020
a 256 drive which is boot

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.780
and two

01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:06.780
one terabyte drives

01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:14.620
And i'll be i'll be adding another one and the reason for the two one terabyte drives one is for

01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:20.940
Uh the home partition and then I also create myself a second logon. That's just called steam

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:24.620
And I mount that second drive on slash home slash steam

01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:31.500
So that all of the games sit in there and then uh as as I reinstall and what have you

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:36.300
I don't have to download all of my stuff. Oh, that's a really smart idea

01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:39.980
I put mine all on a drive called slash big and it's just like a pool of drives

01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:45.260
So that's a clever name. Hey speaking of names, uh wimpy. I have I have one question for you

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.740
Did you consider?

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:49.740
naming the laptop

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:51.740
laptop mclappy face

01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:54.860
No, I didn't

01:30:54.860 --> 01:31:00.620
I spoke about this on the ubuntu podcast and they all pointed out I missed the obvious thing is that I should have called

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.700
it the intro where martin but

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:07.180
Nobody

01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:09.980
Would have gone for that. Yeah

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:11.260
Yeah

01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:16.220
So, um, this has got the it's got uh, intel iris 5 30 pro graphics in it

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:21.020
And it's also got an nvidia gtx 980 m in it as well

01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:23.820
um, so with optimus switching

01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:26.380
Oh, and is that working?

01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:31.980
Yeah, well, um, it's you have to log out and log in so I it doesn't do diane on the fly switching

01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:35.020
I I imagine if I messed about with bumblebee I could get that to go

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:41.660
but I usually i'm using the intel graphics the only time I use the nvidia graphics is if

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:44.700
I want to do uh some game playing or

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:48.940
Or uh, i've just started recently experimenting with the nvank stuff

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:54.620
But those tend to be specific work cases and i'm quite happy to log out and log back in to handle that

01:31:55.900 --> 01:32:01.100
But I wrote a utility from for marty, um, or rather forked a utility

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:07.260
And extended it a little bit that um sits in the tray and it shows you which you're using and you can just toggle

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:09.980
And then uh log out log in

01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:15.340
Wow, that is quite the mission. That's a multi-year machine. I can tell you somebody who's bought some workstation killers before

01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:17.820
Yeah, any chances are going to be?

01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:20.540
Sorry, any chances are going to be available in the us at some point?

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:27.500
Uh, there are no immediate plans for entroware to ship in the us as far as i'm aware now is this

01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:29.820
Yeah, go ahead

01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:34.060
I do know despite despite the politics in the uk

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:40.940
Uh last week. I do know entroware are very close to launching in some european countries

01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:45.200
This seems this seems very similar to to the orx pro from system 76

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:49.980
So that's it. Yeah, so noah, you may already have something very similar to this rig

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:56.380
Yeah, I know I I figured that the I figured the odm, you know manufacturers probably the same but it just there are small

01:32:56.380 --> 01:33:00.860
Differences of course across them because they're both building them assembling them separately and making right

01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:04.860
And the other thing is is in in in limpy and I had talked about this a little bit is

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:11.500
That you know various little components inside are are sometimes different and that leads to drastically different. Yeah, it does. Yeah

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:15.980
Yeah, it does. Yeah, and this also you can get with ubuntu mate from uh, entroware, which is kind of nice

01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:18.700
Yes, it uh, it arrived pre-installed with ubuntu

01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:23.340
Yeah, have you have you experimented with battery life much

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:29.100
Uh, no. No, I I haven't plugged it into the main since I received it. So

01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:32.780
Um i've been playing with it on and off during the day

01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:34.780
I've probably

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:39.180
Well, I don't know how long we've been sat here this evening. So it's done several hours and yeah

01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:44.060
It's about half halfway exhausted at the moment. Well, congratulations. So, you know

01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:48.460
Now kind of so this is where I started thinking about this on the high end

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:52.940
You have these athena's bonobos orx pros these real desktop killers

01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:55.820
They're they're not super portable but they can get you a few hours

01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:59.820
They can move they can move you between your different work spots and then on the other end

01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:05.180
You now have very efficient performance and capabilities from something like the nuke skull canyon

01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:10.940
So compare and contrast those two machines for me wimpy. Do you think uh, when you look at the two spectrums there?

01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:16.620
Is there less and less of a role for you with a traditional desktop tower that you assemble and you put together or you buy?

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:18.220
pre-built is there

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:20.060
Where's the tower fitting in?

01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:26.220
Well, the the tower computer that I bought in 2008 is one of the boxes that i've sold in order to

01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:28.780
Make the funds available to buy this computer

01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:35.660
So that that computer back in the day in 2008 was a dual quad core xeon with 32 gigs of ram

01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:39.340
Uh, and it had two nvidia something or others in it at the time

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:45.580
Um, so that was a fairly stonking machine when I bought that and that just about expired in time

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:48.300
It was still worked, but it was it was you know, breathless

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:50.700
Um doing gaming for example

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:55.020
So i've sold that and it was massive and it had a 750 watt power supply

01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:59.500
um, and the by comparison the skull canyon nuke

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:06.780
Um is about three times faster than that quad core xeon from 2008 in terms of cpu

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:08.540
performance

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:14.220
And this this uh box had an nvidia when I sold it had an nvidia

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.780
680 in it

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:21.340
And the skull canyon nuke with its iris pro 540 could outperform it

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:26.220
Um on 3d as well, you know for gaming and what have you, you know, isn't that something?

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:34.140
So i'm using nux so I bought a nuke back in november which i'm very happy with and i've still got

01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:38.620
And the only reason I got the skull canyon nuke is because i'm about to replace

01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:46.560
My plex server and I thought i'd buy a nuke to be the plex server and i'd plug external drives into it over usb3

01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:51.260
Okay, because i'm trying to find smaller form factor lower power

01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:55.340
Um solutions and then I thought huh? Well i've got this nuke

01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:57.500
and it's really

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:00.300
Beefy and then I saw the skull canyon was coming along

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:02.700
So what i've done is i've bought the skull canyon to become my new

01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:09.820
New desktop workstation and my old nuke which is only six months old is going to become the plex server nice

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:17.820
Um, but the reason I like the knucks is they're so small. Um, i've now mounted my skull canyon nuke onto the back of my monitor

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:20.300
So everything's now behind

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.300
the screen

01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:28.380
And because I i've got hubs and stuff built into the screen, you know, it's just tidy, you know, I had this massive

01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:31.260
sort of 40 kilo

01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:32.540
Mm-hmm

01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:39.900
Del precision workstation. Yeah, and it's got bricks in it. Yeah, and and now it's this tiny little device and uh,

01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:47.820
It's it's great. Uh, so I really like the knucks. They're great workstations and i've the one laptop i've kept is my apollo

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:50.620
So I still have my apollo

01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:52.300
and that's my

01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:54.300
lightweight i'm

01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:56.140
going out so

01:36:56.140 --> 01:37:00.220
Those are people that know me sort of see me in real life

01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:04.380
Uh, I have a habit of going to do coding in the pub

01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:06.860
um

01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:12.300
So, um, I I I take myself away for sort of a couple of days

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:16.860
And I go and camp out in a in a pub and just sort of have a one-man sprint

01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:25.580
um, and that that apollo is the computer that comes with me and it's great for a one day, you know

01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:30.940
You can go anywhere, you know, the battery's going to last you can get stuff done. It's lightweight. It's easy to carry

01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:33.340
but when I go away for a bit longer

01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:36.860
And i'm going to probably work on different things

01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:42.300
I want something a bit more powerful one of the reasons i've got this machine is because I run lots of virtual machines

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:46.700
So i've got the disk space for that now and i've got the ram and the cpu for it

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:49.020
Yeah, we were talking about snaps earlier

01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:54.220
when you build snap packages on your own machine, you can now do that by um

01:37:54.220 --> 01:38:00.380
Um building them inside, uh lxd containers. So each build is isolated and clean nice

01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:03.580
But you can also build simultaneous snaps

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.540
different snaps simultaneously

01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:10.860
So if you're working on several projects, you could actually have three or four snaps building

01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:16.780
So another reason for this machine is that I can have all the cores that workload. Yeah. Yeah, of course

01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:19.660
cool wimpy well congratulations and you know, I

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:24.140
As somebody who recently just got a semi-upgraded desktop here in the studio

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:28.380
Uh, I I feel like desktops aren't going away from me for a long time. I want capture cards

01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:30.380
I want multiple drives cooling

01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:35.340
but I think and I would be curious really to get the audience's reaction to this is

01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:39.500
If we remove ourselves from the equation and we you know, we just like if you're looking at a chart

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:41.660
You know, we just chop off our our percentage

01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.980
How many people realistically that are buying computers say?

01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:50.460
From best buy or going into costco are really going to want desktop towers for much longer

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:56.860
It seems like that's a dying breed just and it's not to be the not to be the uh, not to use the steve jobs analogy here

01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:00.300
But it really does seem like cars versus trucks. There's going to be a lot less people driving trucks

01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:02.060
Um, and I don't think they're going away

01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:10.060
But to that end I think one of the hazards of it becoming a smaller and smaller market is the components are becoming crappier and crappier

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:14.860
Yeah, and when you build, you know when you buy when you're trying to build multiple machines and you're buying all the parts

01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:19.260
Most the parts are bad. It's it's becoming more and more of a commodity or i'm sorry

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:25.500
A niche market and the parts are becoming more commoditized in the val and the um quality is going down

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:29.260
For for the uh, enthusiast market and that's sort of the downside of it all

01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:34.060
So that's why I think when you have companies like entryware and companies like system 76

01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:36.780
And you have dells out there that are shipping linux rigs

01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:43.340
It's nice to have a good set of answers now for pre-built machines where they're being the front line for that kind of problems

01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:47.420
Uh, but there are still options for the rest of us. So my question to the audience is realistically

01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:49.260
What's your over under?

01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:55.820
What's your long shot on how much we have less left on desktop computing for average people linuxactionshow.reddit.com?

01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:59.420
That's where you go to leave your thoughts. I won't be here next week, but mr

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:02.620
Noah will and they have plenty of good things planned for you

01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:04.620
So if you'd like to help them put together a great show

01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:09.100
You can submit topics to linuxactionshow.reddit.com vote them up and comment on them there

01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:16.540
You can leave feedback at jupiterbroadcasting.com contact. Don't forget to join us live over at jblive.tv. We do the show live

01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:20.460
Well, I I don't I assume you guys are doing it live at the regular time. No, but if you're not

01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:23.180
Jupiter broadcasting

01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:27.660
Two in the morning two in the morning great idea great idea. It's time. I'm kidding

01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:30.380
Yeah, if that was everybody that shows up at two in the morning

01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:33.760
No, and we apologize already check the calendar jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:37.980
Calendar, otherwise it's out for download later on in the week

01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:43.120
And don't forget your stickers at jupiterbroadcasting.com stickers, and i'll see you back here in two weeks

01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:09.980
So

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.220
There we go, there we go, there we go

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:37.180
Oh, this is that was it with no music that was it and we're not doing the west

01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:43.500
You missed but we're not doing the music live anymore for a little bit. Okay, which is hard for me. It's hard for me

01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:46.060
That's weird. Why I I tried to convince him west

01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:50.700
I was telling him if he just put the theme song in telegram, then he could play it to himself sure your phone sure

01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:55.020
Yeah, that makes total sense. Oh, yeah, I would like that too. JBtitles.com here. I'll show you west

01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:58.780
I'll tell you why JBtitles.com JBtitles.com everybody go vote

01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:04.060
Uh, so here's the thing west as noah would say is uh now no you won't be able to hear this because i'm playing

01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:09.900
This on the computer that you're connected to academy. Okay, so uh, prepare yourself for silence. No, i'm I apologize about that

01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:12.160
But let's see. This is going back to 150

01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:15.980
Right. Uh, so here we are west. This is you and me commuting about a kickstarter

01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:23.440
5000 so they're they're they're scratching some itch but it's yeah, it's essentially a read only live gnome desktop

01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:26.700
With a decent gnome theme. Yeah, I mean it doesn't look you can hear it

01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:28.140
You know

01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:29.980
Why is it a keyboard as well?

01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:34.140
It well because then it's the tamper proof device where it freaks out when it gets broken. Yeah

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:39.180
You know what guys this is what it tells us. It doesn't matter about the technical. All right

01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:40.700
So here we're about to start the intro music now

01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:44.220
We didn't hear this live west during the show but in post it's obvious. Here it comes

01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:48.060
What it does tell you is that we are in the wrong business

01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:55.580
This is linux unplugged episode 150 for june 21st, 2016. I see what you mean

01:42:57.580 --> 01:42:59.580
Yeah, it sounds horrible

01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:01.900
That's rough

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:05.740
Yeah, so we're just gonna play it in post and then there'll be no processing of it

01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:09.020
So, you know, I think what it is when we try to level out all the different mumble levels

01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:14.560
I think it just butchered the mosaic right that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right jb titles.com

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:16.560
Um

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:18.800
Let's go boat

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:24.800
Universal package paradigms not just a packaging solution snap a packet ship it. Can we do three weeks of packaging?

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.880
I don't know if we can guys

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:31.040
Universal divide that's not bad. Love packaging. Oh, dude. We love it

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:36.000
Love it. Noah is number one intro where pub laptop going full intro where the red hat summit

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:38.720
cross packaging solutions

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:39.840
I think uh, I think uh

01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:44.080
I think I owe no apology because I upset it as I upset him when I talked bad about his bay

01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.720
I am sorry. Noah. I didn't mean to make you upset

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:51.840
Uh my apologies. Here's the thing. You just you you said something incorrect and I and I corrected

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:58.400
You have the right to be incorrect this is america, okay. All right good good good

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:03.280
Yeah, all right. So that's it. That's all it was fuck the eu what don't say that

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:09.380
uh, I say balder dash jb titles.com jb titles.com

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.060
I

01:44:12.060 --> 01:44:14.060
experienced life in freedom

01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.880
I don't know about universal package paradigms

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.160
I don't I don't know if I want my last show before vacation being about being titled about packaging. I just

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:24.560
that feels like a

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:27.120
A failure on my part like I didn't show up for duty

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:31.280
Although we did have a good organic discussion about it. They're fools

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:39.120
Yeah, jb titles.com. No, I've you gone do you see when you like what about you?

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:42.880
Did you see when you're like, thanks for making it west. Where are you right now? Where are you?

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:46.080
I'm at the beautiful east hotel in downtown portland

01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:48.640
downtown portland, I I I I just

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.160
You know last I heard you were just uh rubbing elbows with linus. So

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:58.320
You know, we're just best buds now. He's a very nice guy face to face. I heard you were making him breakfast

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:03.120
He loves his eggs bacon and turkey toast. He made fun of my suit

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:08.640
Yeah, that's true. That is true. Yeah, that is that is that is noah's experience with linus

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:10.320
Yes, yeah

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:14.320
I was at the next one and I was there a client had paid for for my trip down there

01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:18.400
And and paid for the hotel and everything and um, and so I was representing them

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:22.640
I was in a suit and I was with there's other people there from the company

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:25.840
And and I walked up met him and shook his hand got my picture and he's like

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:31.360
Why are you wearing suit kind of like that's amazing. Yeah, he's like you shouldn't wear a suit

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.560
This is this is you're the only person here wearing a suit. That's that's very strange

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:38.720
I don't know why you'd wear a suit here and i'm like not because other people because the company wearing suits

01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:41.760
So he questioned your linux like credentials, basically

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:49.360
Yeah, exactly that's rough man, that's right I got a chip on my you could never make a curl yeah

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:54.160
Yeah, yeah, which I mean is true I couldn't either but whatever

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:56.160
What do you guys think of universal divide?

01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:01.200
You like that? I like the universal divide. Yes, i'm voting for it. I just voted for it. I think now it has 11

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Okay. No, it's just the chat room. Shout out

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:06.800
