00:00.000 --> 00:03.020
Rumor has it Mr. Bacon has himself some new hardware.

00:03.020 --> 00:03.860
I do indeed.

00:03.860 --> 00:07.400
I recently got in my new Pine Book Pro.

00:07.400 --> 00:08.240
That's exciting.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.680
Yeah, it's an interesting little machine.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.840
I haven't had a lot of time to play with it yet,

00:11.840 --> 00:14.480
but I will say that out of all the delivery drivers,

00:14.480 --> 00:16.560
the DHL guy seems to be the most courteous.

00:16.560 --> 00:17.400
Yeah.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.920
Like he gave me a nice little knock on the door.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.440
He didn't like cop knock the door or anything.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.680
He actually knocked.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.280
Mike gave me a big hug the other day.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.840
Just a big old hug.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.140
This geeky also just got your Pine Book?

00:28.140 --> 00:30.440
Yeah, the DHL guy bought it this morning.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.640
Did you give him a hug?

00:31.640 --> 00:32.660
I didn't get a hug from him,

00:32.660 --> 00:35.280
but he did comment that his wife had the same car as me,

00:35.280 --> 00:36.120
but that was about it.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.240
That's your move right there.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.080
That's the window.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.560
I mean, he's asking for a hug.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.160
That's what it seemed like to me.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.640
You had a delightful DHL delivery man as well.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.880
That's great.

00:45.880 --> 00:46.920
Yeah, it was great.

00:46.920 --> 00:47.760
Ha ha ha.

00:47.760 --> 00:52.760
Oh, hello friends and welcome into the Unplugged program.

00:52.760 --> 00:53.600
My name is Chris.

00:53.600 --> 00:54.440
My name is Wes.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.260
Well, hello, Wes.

00:55.260 --> 00:56.100
Hello.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.600
Who brought this big show?

00:57.600 --> 00:58.440
I think you did.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.280
Yeah, I think you did.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.440
Uh-oh, someone did.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.160
Maybe it was a team effort.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.320
High five, Wes.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.480
Ha ha ha.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.920
We have so much to talk about today.

01:05.920 --> 01:08.600
In the community news, there's new hardware,

01:08.600 --> 01:12.320
there's new software, and there's things to discuss.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.440
And then we're gonna give follow-up thoughts

01:14.440 --> 01:19.440
on Fedora 31, as well as the release of Fedora 21.

01:19.440 --> 01:23.520
Follow-up thoughts on Fedora 31, as well as,

01:23.520 --> 01:27.040
we'll be joined by a special guest in the Fedora 31 section

01:27.040 --> 01:29.560
to talk about some of the underpinnings

01:29.560 --> 01:31.080
of the Fedora operating system,

01:31.080 --> 01:35.240
as well as what's coming up in 32 and 33.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.360
There's a lot to look forward to.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.740
Yeah, it's really something.

01:38.740 --> 01:40.240
But there's much more than that as well,

01:40.240 --> 01:41.840
including the picks and the housekeeping.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.160
And our community, let's start off

01:44.160 --> 01:46.480
by saying hello to Cheese and Alex.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.300
Hey guys.

01:47.300 --> 01:48.140
Hello there.

01:48.140 --> 01:49.120
Hello internet.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.200
Oh hi.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.000
Oh hi, don't say hi to me, that's fine.

01:52.000 --> 01:52.840
It's just me.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.760
I thought you spoke for the internet.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.160
I do now, Wes.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.880
Also, speaking of the internet,

01:57.880 --> 02:00.420
we have our virtual log time appropriate greetings.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.260
Mumble room.

02:01.260 --> 02:02.100
Hello.

02:02.100 --> 02:02.920
What's up?

02:02.920 --> 02:03.800
Good evening.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.600
Well, hello, hello.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.800
It's nice to see all of you.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.260
I see, of course, let's see.

02:09.300 --> 02:11.600
Let's lean into this one here, Wes.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.680
I'm gonna say, Ace Nomad.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.520
You got it.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.040
I thought you were gonna mess it up on that time.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.400
No, it's not Acne Nomad.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.360
No, it's Ace Nomad.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.200
Not this week, anyway.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.360
The one, the only Brent photo.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.200
Hello, Brent.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.020
Oh, hey there.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.680
Mr. Bitebitten, good to see you as always.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.520
Hello.

02:28.520 --> 02:29.880
Carl, every time I see you, I just get hungry.

02:29.880 --> 02:30.900
Good to see you, Carl.

02:30.900 --> 02:31.740
I'm hungry too.

02:31.740 --> 02:33.400
Good man.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.000
Cassidy's here from Elementary OS.

02:35.000 --> 02:35.840
Hey Cassidy.

02:35.840 --> 02:36.660
Hey Cassidy.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.880
And the one, the only, Mr. Dan the Rabbit,

02:38.880 --> 02:40.840
one of my favorite podcasters in the universe.

02:40.840 --> 02:41.680
Hey, Dan.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.520
Heyo.

02:42.520 --> 02:43.340
Heyo.

02:43.340 --> 02:44.180
How about that?

02:44.180 --> 02:45.020
Anne Frank's here.

02:45.020 --> 02:45.840
Hello, Frank.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.680
Hello, Mini Mac.

02:46.680 --> 02:47.520
Hello.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.360
Hello.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.880
And this geek, Anne, coming in, right in,

02:51.880 --> 02:53.160
as I'm calling out names.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.640
Hello, Mr. Martin Wimpress.

02:54.640 --> 02:55.480
Hey Wimpy.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.960
Hello there, just in the nick of time then.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.080
Yes, good job.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.200
You got the shout out.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.200
Good to see you as well.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.880
Well, we have a lot to get into this week,

03:02.880 --> 03:04.280
so let's get started.

03:04.280 --> 03:08.400
We, I think, need to acknowledge yet another milestone

03:08.400 --> 03:10.980
for our beloved desktop.

03:10.980 --> 03:14.400
This week, Dell has really increased their range

03:14.400 --> 03:17.680
of selection of hardware for their preloaded systems

03:17.680 --> 03:19.080
with Ubuntu.

03:19.080 --> 03:24.000
Their XPS 13 line has gone from like two or three options

03:24.000 --> 03:26.480
to something damn near 18 options now,

03:26.480 --> 03:27.980
depending on how you configure it.

03:27.980 --> 03:28.880
This is big, Wes.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.680
This is like, Dell goes big on Linux,

03:31.680 --> 03:35.060
and they're betting on this developer workstation.

03:35.060 --> 03:37.560
It has felt like, I mean, just more and more configurations,

03:37.560 --> 03:40.520
and you've seen some of the precision line as well.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.520
It's clearly doing well enough, they're

03:42.520 --> 03:44.480
willing to continue to invest.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.520
And I like having a lot of different Linux laptops

03:46.520 --> 03:47.320
to choose from.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.760
Yeah, this is a large range, from systems

03:49.760 --> 03:53.920
with four cores, six cores, 1804 pre-installed.

03:53.920 --> 03:57.760
Also, more Wi-Fi options than I ever expected them.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.000
That's an area I didn't expect.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.280
And actually paying attention to Wi-Fi and Linux,

04:01.280 --> 04:05.120
playing nicely together, that's always good.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.360
I'd love to see more than 16 gigs of RAM.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.000
Would love to see that.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.960
But these are beautiful systems with that gorgeous Infinity

04:13.960 --> 04:17.000
Edge display.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.680
I think I really have enjoyed using my T480,

04:20.680 --> 04:23.960
and I really do like a ThinkPad for work.

04:23.960 --> 04:27.560
But if I could be fancy enough to own multiple Linux

04:27.560 --> 04:30.720
high-end laptops, my T480 would be my work laptop,

04:30.720 --> 04:33.360
and an XPS 13 would be the laptop I buy for myself.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.440
It just feels kind of friendly and approachable.

04:35.440 --> 04:35.920
It's light.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.400
You can throw it on the couch and not worry about it.

04:38.400 --> 04:38.960
Yeah.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.000
So how's the trackpad?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.080
Because the benchmark, in my opinion, of trackpads

04:43.080 --> 04:46.160
is or was the MacBook glass trackpad.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.440
ThinkPad trackpads are definitely a step down from that.

04:49.440 --> 04:52.960
Where does the XPS fit in that kind of hierarchy?

04:52.960 --> 04:55.640
So I think it depends on what ThinkPad you have as

04:55.640 --> 04:57.960
to the quality of the trackpad.

04:57.960 --> 05:02.560
So my ThinkPad has got a glass trackpad, and it's very good.

05:02.560 --> 05:06.240
And now I have a MacBook Pro, albeit a 2015 model.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.440
I can make an objective comparison.

05:08.440 --> 05:11.040
And certainly, the MacBook Pro is better,

05:11.040 --> 05:13.800
but probably it's better because the gesture support is just

05:13.800 --> 05:15.800
so much better.

05:15.800 --> 05:20.800
And I would say that the XPS, I've got a XPS 15

05:20.800 --> 05:23.840
and a couple of XPS 13s.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.160
Their trackpad is as good as you can

05:27.160 --> 05:30.000
get for a Microsoft Precision trackpad,

05:30.000 --> 05:35.520
but it's still not to the level that the MacBook trackpads are.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.640
Yeah, that's basically my assessment as well.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.320
I thought it might be fun if I configured

05:41.320 --> 05:43.520
one of these new XPS systems.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.200
I think I'm going to go.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.400
I think I used to hold back on 4K.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.520
I think you're ready now.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.520
Oh, well, the desktop's kind of caught up.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.120
Yeah.

05:52.120 --> 05:52.880
It's not me, Wes.

05:52.880 --> 05:53.960
I've been ready.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.600
My body's been ready for a long time.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.520
I think Wimpy's ready.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.360
That's what it is.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.520
Yeah, if Wimpy could get Mate together.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.360
No, actually, that's actually my point,

06:01.360 --> 06:03.360
is things are getting to be in pretty good shape

06:03.360 --> 06:04.600
on high DPI now.

06:04.600 --> 06:13.520
$1,499.99 is my config.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.160
What's with me?

06:14.160 --> 06:15.360
Am I so much of a fancy boy?

06:15.360 --> 06:17.080
But even that, that's not that bad.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.240
If it's going to, you know, I mean,

06:18.240 --> 06:20.080
you're going to keep it for three, four years.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.520
Well, let me tell you what you get.

06:21.520 --> 06:27.880
So for 1,500 US greenbacks, you get 16 gigabytes of DDR3 RAM,

06:27.880 --> 06:34.520
a 13.3 inch 4K 3840 by 2160 Infinity Edge touch display,

06:34.520 --> 06:39.360
512 gigabyte PCIe mVini drive, which is fast as hell,

06:39.360 --> 06:41.800
killer Wi-Fi, which is pretty damn good,

06:41.800 --> 06:44.280
and actually really good Wi-Fi matters to me,

06:44.280 --> 06:48.480
and a 52 watt hour battery for sale.

06:48.480 --> 06:52.520
$1,500 for something that is also

06:52.520 --> 06:56.760
putting a vote towards shipping something with Linux preloaded

06:56.760 --> 06:59.440
that is a nice tight package that I have now

06:59.440 --> 07:01.360
owned two different generations of XPSs,

07:01.360 --> 07:03.480
so I know they're good stuff.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.200
Yeah, I think that's a fair price.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.440
I actually thought I'd come out here and say it was too much,

07:07.440 --> 07:09.160
but now going through it, I think it's actually fair.

07:09.160 --> 07:09.360
Right.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.360
I mean, it's not the best, and you unfortunately

07:11.360 --> 07:13.720
can't quite seem to get everything all in one package.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.160
It'd be nice to have more RAM or a little more configurable

07:16.160 --> 07:17.440
or horsepower in there.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.920
But it's a really shiny Linux laptop

07:19.920 --> 07:22.520
that you're not ashamed to bring into any environment.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.520
And you know, it's just going to keep getting better.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.320
So if you invest now, we can look forward

07:26.320 --> 07:27.280
to more good things.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.760
To that note, Wes, I tweeted at Barton George this week

07:30.760 --> 07:32.600
saying if it was 32 gig, it would probably

07:32.600 --> 07:34.560
be an instant buy from me.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.600
And he and several other people on Twitter

07:37.600 --> 07:39.400
were very responsive, I've got to say.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.000
So I think if the more people can tweet Dell

07:42.000 --> 07:44.600
and say that we want more RAM, it

07:44.600 --> 07:48.400
sounds to me like it might happen one day.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.080
For now, they're pointing people at the Precision line.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.640
But I don't think it's an impossibility,

07:53.640 --> 07:56.320
because that 10th gen chip that's in there, the CPU,

07:56.320 --> 07:58.560
does support up to 64 gigs.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.680
I guess it's just a case of finding somewhere to fit

08:00.680 --> 08:02.920
the other chips on the board.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.360
Right, yeah, updating the platform to include it.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.000
Or the power usage.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.120
Oh, yeah, could be that.

08:08.120 --> 08:11.720
Yeah, I recently reviewed a Precision 3540,

08:11.720 --> 08:15.480
which was pre-installed with Ubuntu on the Ubuntu podcast.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.160
And I have to say, they had to wrestle that laptop back off

08:19.160 --> 08:19.660
me.

08:19.660 --> 08:20.880
I absolutely loved it.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.160
Yeah, you did.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.120
And that one, you can put 64 gigs in.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.680
OK, well, so I'm the guy that has

08:28.680 --> 08:30.520
systems with 32 gigabytes of RAM.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.680
But I'm also going to play devil's advocate here

08:32.680 --> 08:34.480
for a moment.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.040
This morning, as I was using my workstation,

08:37.040 --> 08:40.120
and my mouse was chopping across the screen

08:40.120 --> 08:43.920
like it was a system from 1992, I

08:43.920 --> 08:47.920
really wondered if it was worth having 64 gigabytes of RAM.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.280
And I thought about, if an audience member came to me

08:50.280 --> 08:52.800
and said, I have a limited budget,

08:52.800 --> 08:55.440
what's the most I should spend on RAM,

08:55.440 --> 08:58.240
I think I would have to advise them 16 gigs.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.200
Because performance on Linux starts

09:01.200 --> 09:03.880
to shit the bed way before you use up all your memory.

09:03.880 --> 09:06.960
Now, if you have 4 gigabytes of RAM or 2 gigabytes of RAM.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.880
Yeah, 16 is pretty comfortable these days.

09:08.880 --> 09:12.320
I mean, I've got 32 right here, and I have 28 available.

09:12.320 --> 09:15.480
I can bring my fairly high-end system down

09:15.480 --> 09:19.200
to a laggy desktop mess by simply playing a YouTube video

09:19.200 --> 09:21.640
and browsing the web and loading other web pages

09:21.640 --> 09:23.640
while I have a couple of chat applications

09:23.640 --> 09:25.800
going in a terminal.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.920
And I'm sitting there using 5 gigs of RAM,

09:28.920 --> 09:33.040
so I've got literally 59 gigabytes of RAM unused.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.600
So it's not a memory thing.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.140
So I think we've got other problems

09:38.140 --> 09:41.720
we have to solve before we really address the memory.

09:41.720 --> 09:45.320
Not all desktops experience this issue, I grant you.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.720
But it was a little disappointing,

09:46.720 --> 09:49.240
because I felt like I've gone to this.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.520
When I built this system, I went to this effort

09:51.520 --> 09:54.160
of separating out the disk I.O. So my scratch disk,

09:54.160 --> 09:57.560
my home directory, my game disk, my operating system OS.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.600
They're all on separate, very high-speed disks.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.960
I got high-end graphics.

10:02.960 --> 10:06.040
Like I said, 64 gigabytes of RAM, six CPU cores.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.280
I thought, this will be the fastest computer I have ever

10:08.280 --> 10:08.800
owned.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.000
Just a machine you can work on and not

10:10.000 --> 10:10.920
have to think about anything else.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.120
I'll just crunch through it.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.440
But screw me, because I open up YouTube in another tab

10:15.440 --> 10:17.640
and then tab out while I read news stories

10:17.640 --> 10:21.040
and scroll web pages, and my whole computer lags out.

10:21.040 --> 10:25.040
And heaven forbid, something gets a little excessive

10:25.040 --> 10:28.920
in Slack, like maybe an animated emoticon that really

10:28.920 --> 10:30.080
pings one thread.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.160
Because then, if I'm watching a video, browsing a web page,

10:33.160 --> 10:35.880
and somebody's done something in Slack,

10:35.880 --> 10:40.100
well, then my mouse jumps across my screen every few seconds.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.360
It's just like a stuttering mess.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.200
It's unusable, yeah.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.240
So there's other problems.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.160
Not to go there, but.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.640
You know, I hear Linux runs great in a virtual machine.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.800
Well, what I was going to say is,

10:51.800 --> 10:53.320
maybe we should just hit the reset button

10:53.320 --> 10:54.840
and switch to the ARM platform.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.760
No, I mean, I know we'll get these things fixed up.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.280
And I know it's the worst on Gnome Shell,

11:00.280 --> 11:01.920
and that I'm really on the cutting edge,

11:01.920 --> 11:03.020
and this is what you get.

11:03.020 --> 11:05.160
So I put all that into perspective.

11:05.160 --> 11:10.000
But I am very impressed in what we're seeing,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.320
not just in the Pine Book, but also just from the Raspberry

11:13.320 --> 11:14.280
Pi 4.

11:14.280 --> 11:16.960
It is significantly more powerful than the Raspberry Pi

11:16.960 --> 11:17.460
3.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.680
It's definitely entered an interesting territory

11:19.680 --> 11:23.040
of keeping up, being able to perform a number of tasks

11:23.040 --> 11:25.800
that the previous gens just couldn't quite get to.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.200
I have a significant number of things I'm using Raspberry Pi 4.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.040
In fact, I go into some significant detail

11:31.040 --> 11:33.880
in the self-hosted that comes out later this week.

11:33.880 --> 11:37.560
But I haven't really seen any distro except for Raspbian

11:37.560 --> 11:39.680
step up to the Raspberry Pi 4.

11:39.680 --> 11:45.160
So that's why I was very happy to see a post on the ubuntu.com

11:45.160 --> 11:49.240
blog on November 3 that talks about Canonical's plans

11:49.240 --> 11:51.400
for support for the Raspberry Pi.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.960
They write, with 1910's release of Ubuntu Server,

11:53.960 --> 11:56.400
Canonical has announced official support for the Raspberry Pi

11:56.400 --> 11:57.160
4.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.080
The latest board from the Raspberry Pi Foundation

11:59.080 --> 12:02.080
sports a faster system on a chip with a processor that uses

12:02.080 --> 12:04.920
the Cortex A72 architecture.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.800
Additionally, it offers up to four gigabytes of RAM.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.680
We are supporting the Raspberry Pi 4

12:09.680 --> 12:11.800
to give developers access to a low cost

12:11.800 --> 12:13.760
board powerful enough to consolidate

12:13.760 --> 12:16.160
compute workloads at the edge.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.280
That sounds pretty great.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.360
Unfortunately, they go on.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.560
However, our official support for this board

12:21.560 --> 12:25.560
is currently limited to the one gig and two gigabyte versions.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.760
Due to a kernel bug, USB ports are not

12:27.760 --> 12:31.320
supported out of the box in the official ARM64 image

12:31.320 --> 12:33.560
on the four gigabyte version.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.160
Kernel fixes have been identified

12:35.160 --> 12:37.000
by Canonical engineers.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.560
And we're currently testing these fixes extensively.

12:39.560 --> 12:42.440
Yeah, I ran into this with my tester.

12:42.440 --> 12:46.040
I talked about it a little bit during our 1910 review.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.120
And I did discover, too, that if you limit the memory

12:48.120 --> 12:50.080
to less than four gigs, or if you just simply

12:50.080 --> 12:52.840
use the 32-bit image, it's fine.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.600
But then it also turned out there was a KVM bug in there.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.960
But they're getting pretty close to having this fixed.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.280
And it's really kind of taking some work upstream,

13:02.280 --> 13:04.480
as well as Canonical kind of keeping on top of it.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.520
Right, it is kind of a reminder that these are

13:06.520 --> 13:08.560
special, unique little devices, right?

13:08.560 --> 13:10.640
And you might have good support running in Raspbian,

13:10.640 --> 13:12.880
because they spend a lot of time getting that to work right.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.120
And it takes a little longer for that to filter downstream.

13:15.120 --> 13:15.720
Yeah.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.920
It is kind of a core reminder that you can just

13:18.920 --> 13:21.440
limit the amount of memory your system uses, too, in Linux.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.400
It's just so easy and so cool.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.720
That is really neat.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.720
Wimby, do you have any insight into this process,

13:26.720 --> 13:30.200
either for Ubuntu MATE or for a mainline Ubuntu LTS

13:30.200 --> 13:31.160
or whichever?

13:31.160 --> 13:34.920
Yeah, so the hardware enablement that's in 1910

13:34.920 --> 13:40.240
will become the next point release for 1804.

13:40.240 --> 13:44.080
So around that time, the Raspberry Pi 4 support

13:44.080 --> 13:47.120
will roll into an 1804 version, as well.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.040
Obviously, we want to get that bug fixed

13:50.040 --> 13:54.040
where all of the USB ports go away unexpectedly.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.360
And obviously, having a Raspberry Pi 4

13:56.360 --> 14:00.600
with 4 gigs of RAM, that makes the 64-bit story a lot more

14:00.600 --> 14:01.840
compelling there now.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.760
So we want to get that right.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.240
And then, of course, when 2004 comes around,

14:07.240 --> 14:10.680
we'll have Ubuntu core images, as well,

14:10.680 --> 14:13.960
for the entire family of Raspberry Pis.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.400
It seems like a pretty serious commitment.

14:16.400 --> 14:20.200
The quote here that I highlighted for our saving

14:20.200 --> 14:24.320
is, canonical is dedicated to offering outstanding support

14:24.320 --> 14:26.000
for the Raspberry Pi boards.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.760
To achieve this objective, we are

14:28.760 --> 14:31.080
listening to feedback from the community

14:31.080 --> 14:33.960
and acting upon it to improve our delivery process.

14:33.960 --> 14:38.320
We want Ubuntu to become even more compelling option

14:38.320 --> 14:40.800
for an operating system on the Raspberry Pi boards.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.160
Wow.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.320
That seems like it's a pretty serious effort.

14:44.320 --> 14:44.840
Yeah.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.160
There's lots of people lined up behind this initiative.

14:47.160 --> 14:47.800
Yeah.

14:47.800 --> 14:48.480
It's nice to see.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.120
I mean, nothing against Raspbian,

14:50.120 --> 14:52.080
but it just feels so foreign.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.200
You know, it's so specialized and localized.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.920
And one of the things I love about using Linux

14:55.920 --> 14:58.200
is I can use the same thing on the server, the desktop,

14:58.200 --> 15:02.000
or on my little Pi platform, but it's not there yet.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.080
Well, I feel like I'm the silly one right now that's saying,

15:05.080 --> 15:07.960
you can use a Pi 4 in production?

15:07.960 --> 15:10.840
And the thing that makes me the most

15:10.840 --> 15:14.640
uneasy about that recommendation is Raspbian.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.840
Nothing against the project.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.400
So far, as I have used it, it seems

15:17.400 --> 15:21.560
to be a great distribution, and I get why they make it.

15:21.560 --> 15:25.720
However, when I have put so much effort

15:25.720 --> 15:28.040
into building the perfect home setup,

15:28.040 --> 15:31.040
and I'm sitting there doing an OS upgrade,

15:31.040 --> 15:32.640
there is just a bit of confidence

15:32.640 --> 15:34.840
I have when it's an operating system that

15:34.840 --> 15:37.680
is a daily driver for me, like Ubuntu LTS.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.560
And there's a lot to like about Ubuntu right now.

15:39.560 --> 15:44.200
And I just have faith in its process to upgrade.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.040
And I also know there's a certain scale factor that's

15:47.040 --> 15:47.640
safe there.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.240
But so far, Raspbian's been fine.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.280
But I would be much happier running something

15:52.280 --> 15:55.360
that I use on my other systems in production already.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.620
And so I'd love to see this.

15:57.620 --> 16:00.040
In the meantime, there is some workarounds for the bugs

16:00.040 --> 16:00.920
until they're sorted.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.680
But it's nice to see that the LTSs will be getting it.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.220
In the future, there are ways you can do it,

16:06.220 --> 16:08.320
but I wouldn't necessarily recommend them yet based

16:08.320 --> 16:09.640
on my testing.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.560
And the other thing I should just point out,

16:11.560 --> 16:14.640
because it might not be obvious, but the images

16:14.640 --> 16:17.200
we prepare for the Raspberry Pi are

16:17.200 --> 16:20.560
subject to the same security maintenance

16:20.560 --> 16:23.320
as every other Ubuntu version.

16:23.320 --> 16:26.920
So kernel patches and libraries and everything,

16:26.920 --> 16:29.200
all of that stuff in the Raspberry Pi images

16:29.200 --> 16:31.480
moves at the same cadence as everything else.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.680
Have you had a chance to play with the Raspberry Pi 4?

16:33.680 --> 16:36.480
I have two of them on the desk behind me at the moment.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.040
I am not blown away as a desktop.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.040
They seem quite good as a desktop.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.160
But I am legitimately impressed with what

16:43.160 --> 16:45.440
they are capable as a headless Linux

16:45.440 --> 16:48.080
box running home servers services.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.000
Yeah, it's definitely a huge step up

16:50.000 --> 16:56.440
from the Pi 3 and 3 Plus and that era of Raspberry Pi.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.920
Every time these boards get revved,

16:57.920 --> 17:01.480
I think people have expectations that are unrealistic.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.300
If you follow the SOC developments closely,

17:04.300 --> 17:06.560
you'll know that they're never going to compete

17:06.560 --> 17:12.160
with contemporary Intel or AMD-based parts,

17:12.160 --> 17:15.680
even at the lower power limits.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.320
But I really quite like them.

17:18.320 --> 17:22.400
I'm obviously working on Ubuntu MATE for the Raspberry Pi 4.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.840
That'll probably be available sometime near Christmas.

17:26.840 --> 17:28.280
So that's a fun project for me.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.300
But I'm also, I've just got an arcade fighting stick

17:31.300 --> 17:34.600
and I'm building a new emulation station system.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.480
So I'm using the Pi 4 for that.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.720
Oh, that's great.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.680
You know, the only thing that really scuppers the Pi for me

17:40.680 --> 17:42.760
at the moment, Pi 4 in particular,

17:42.760 --> 17:44.640
is the SD card requirement.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.440
I don't want to put something into production

17:46.440 --> 17:47.960
that relies on an SD card.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.100
Use a USB stick.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.520
Can you boot from that, though?

17:50.520 --> 17:51.600
No, not yet.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.560
It's not available yet, but it will be coming.

17:53.560 --> 17:54.320
Yeah.

17:54.320 --> 17:58.560
I, on the other hand, I find SD cards pretty easy to manage.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.840
Because, I mean, you're talking to a guy

18:00.840 --> 18:03.960
who used to make custom boot floppies to play video games.

18:03.960 --> 18:07.360
So I can duplicate them fairly straightforwardly.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.680
They are of a reasonable cost.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.240
And you can use them to just essentially bootstrap

18:12.240 --> 18:16.440
the system and then use larger storage elsewhere.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.800
It's a compromise at this point.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.800
But I have faith that they'll get there.

18:19.800 --> 18:20.640
You're right, though.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.320
It is, I think, the way to put that, Alex.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.560
It's definitely something to be aware of.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.000
Because those things do have a certain endurance

18:27.000 --> 18:28.480
and then they start to fail.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.200
And that's a bad morning.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.680
Wimpy, you've had a lot going on.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.880
There's been some changes for you in life.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.880
Probably a good time to mention that you recently

18:35.880 --> 18:38.080
sat down for a brunch with Mr. Brent.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.920
I did have a lovely brunch with Brent.

18:39.920 --> 18:43.040
It was a high point of my week.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.400
Extras.show slash 29.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.480
I really enjoyed it.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.280
Really, a really great episode.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.360
And Brent, you just got to keep it up.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.160
Because I learn more about folks when

18:54.160 --> 18:56.840
they go on brunch with Brent than I would have otherwise.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.400
It's like, you get there.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.080
You know, you get down, you get deep.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.160
You get the details.

19:01.160 --> 19:02.160
Don't worry, it doesn't hurt at all.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.080
Brent's very gentle.

19:03.080 --> 19:05.000
Yeah, and it's delicious.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.400
You know, I've been having a lot of fun with these chats.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.040
And the chat with Wimpy, of course,

19:09.040 --> 19:10.960
was a lot of fun while we were doing it.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.160
And it sounds like a lot of people

19:12.160 --> 19:14.200
are really enjoying it on their commutes and stuff like that.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.840
So I'd say, if you enjoyed it, spread it widely.

19:16.840 --> 19:17.360
Yeah.

19:17.360 --> 19:20.280
And also, Wimpy, just congratulations.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.200
I think it's, anyone who's been following your journey

19:23.200 --> 19:26.520
on this show knows that it's a bit of a remarkable journey.

19:26.520 --> 19:30.280
And now, here you are as the director of the Ubuntu Desktop

19:30.280 --> 19:32.640
at Canonical, which is just incredible.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.680
And some of that journey is talked about there

19:34.680 --> 19:35.640
in that extra.

19:35.640 --> 19:40.360
Yeah, and my time here, particularly on Linux Unplugged,

19:40.360 --> 19:44.400
has been pivotal in getting to where I am today.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.800
And I talked about that with Brent.

19:46.800 --> 19:50.480
So if you're curious as to how all that unfolded,

19:50.480 --> 19:52.240
that's one of the things we talked about.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.080
But yeah, thank you for Linux Unplugged.

19:54.080 --> 19:58.200
It really has had quite the profound impact on my life.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.120
And it's always a joy for turning up.

20:01.120 --> 20:01.920
Oh, stop.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.200
No, no, stop it.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.200
Thank you for being here.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.320
Extras.show slash 29.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.280
Go listen to that.

20:07.280 --> 20:08.920
It's a great additional little thing

20:08.920 --> 20:11.040
that you might call an extra.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.440
You might just call it that.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.600
Well, Cassidy and Dan from Elementary OS are here.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.320
And I think this is the perfect opportunity for us

20:18.320 --> 20:22.120
to discuss some major updates for Elementary OS.

20:22.120 --> 20:26.800
This is the one where we see a lot of Flatpak support land.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.480
So what does this look like?

20:28.480 --> 20:30.220
Because Cassidy, I think the takeaway

20:30.220 --> 20:32.720
that I've seen the internet at large discusses,

20:32.720 --> 20:34.360
they're calling it sideloading.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.040
So what are we talking about here?

20:36.040 --> 20:39.360
Yeah, so we've heard from users that there's

20:39.360 --> 20:42.600
a lot of these cross-platform apps or just apps that

20:42.600 --> 20:46.200
don't fit the other requirements for being curated in App Center

20:46.200 --> 20:47.920
that they want to use on their machines.

20:47.920 --> 20:52.300
So we talked a while ago in the spring about Flatpak

20:52.300 --> 20:54.200
being the future for our stack, and we're

20:54.200 --> 20:56.880
going to be moving our App Center apps over to Flatpak.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.020
But since Flatpak is our plan, it

20:59.020 --> 21:03.960
means we can support a more secure way

21:03.960 --> 21:06.120
of getting third-party apps on the system

21:06.120 --> 21:08.480
from outside of the app store.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.280
So that's what we call sideloading.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.160
I like the screenshot you have in the blog post

21:12.160 --> 21:13.240
that we'll have linked in the notes,

21:13.240 --> 21:15.000
because you get an idea as an end user

21:15.000 --> 21:18.280
what this is going to be like from an implementation standpoint.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.520
You get an idea of how big the download is.

21:21.520 --> 21:24.140
It really kind of helps you understand that this is only

21:24.140 --> 21:26.440
being backed solely by the developer.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.320
We as a project have not vetted this.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.600
And when you add this, this is the tricky part

21:31.600 --> 21:34.600
that I think I was really curious how you would parse

21:34.600 --> 21:35.960
this, and I think you nailed it.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.600
And the last line is, when you add this app,

21:39.600 --> 21:41.680
it may add its entire repository,

21:41.680 --> 21:44.360
and so you will see other apps by this developer.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.640
And that's the hardest thing, I think,

21:45.640 --> 21:47.680
when it comes to this kind of thing for end users

21:47.680 --> 21:49.360
to wrap their heads around.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.000
So this dialog box, it seems like one

21:52.000 --> 21:54.720
of these things that would be so obviously a clear thing you

21:54.720 --> 21:56.040
should do for end users.

21:56.040 --> 21:59.220
But the reaction, and I saw your tweets today,

21:59.220 --> 22:01.920
the reaction has been, oh, it's so much like Mac OS

22:01.920 --> 22:02.920
calling it sideloading.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.720
They're just locking it down even more.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.320
Do you push forward and just try to ignore that completely,

22:08.320 --> 22:10.840
or do you feel like that's worth addressing on the show here?

22:10.840 --> 22:13.620
It's funny, because with this update,

22:13.620 --> 22:16.280
we're bringing a ton of new capability to the OS

22:16.280 --> 22:18.680
and a ton of new software that you

22:18.680 --> 22:22.200
can install with one click.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.920
And it's using an open source technology

22:24.920 --> 22:29.760
that the other desktops have kind of standardized on.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.560
It's this very open process, and we're being very, very honest

22:32.560 --> 22:34.480
and realistic about expectations.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.000
And that's actually something we've heard from our existing

22:37.000 --> 22:40.920
users, is they want to know what the implications of installing

22:40.920 --> 22:44.120
apps, whether it's from Flatpak or from the Ubuntu

22:44.120 --> 22:46.440
repositories, they want to know what

22:46.440 --> 22:48.360
the difference is between these curated apps

22:48.360 --> 22:51.100
and these third party sideloaded apps.

22:51.100 --> 22:52.520
So we're addressing that.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.680
And I think, of course, we'll always

22:54.680 --> 22:57.600
get blowback from people who probably don't even

22:57.600 --> 22:59.900
use the OS.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.080
And that's fine.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.000
That's part of building an open source product.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.080
Oh, man, you just so nailed it right there.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.800
It's frustrating, too, that the comparisons are always

23:08.800 --> 23:10.000
there with the Apple stuff.

23:10.000 --> 23:10.600
I know.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.840
To me, it seems much more just like you guys are bringing

23:13.840 --> 23:18.320
some modern OS paradigms that the whole world is exploring

23:18.320 --> 23:20.400
here on the Linux desktop, and it's nice to see.

23:20.400 --> 23:23.360
One of the things that actually inspired the idea originally

23:23.360 --> 23:28.240
is that Android comes with a built-in APK installer thing

23:28.240 --> 23:29.640
where you can sideload apps.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.240
That's what I thought of, not Apple.

23:31.240 --> 23:31.720
Yeah.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.160
So it's really funny that there's

23:33.160 --> 23:36.800
this weird obsession with people comparing us to Apple.

23:36.800 --> 23:41.120
And it's like we draw inspiration from all over open

23:41.120 --> 23:45.720
and closed platforms and build the best product that we

23:45.720 --> 23:47.080
can from those ideas.

23:47.080 --> 23:50.160
Well, actually, I would imagine this is probably never

23:50.160 --> 23:55.120
going away because your motivation is to sell

23:55.120 --> 23:57.640
a good operating system product.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.880
Apple's motivation is to sell expensive hardware.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.560
In both of those, you think about what makes a good

24:04.560 --> 24:06.240
customer experience first.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.640
If you're not trying to sell them into a bundle of services,

24:08.640 --> 24:10.400
you're not trying to sell them into an ecosystem

24:10.400 --> 24:13.080
so much as you're just trying to sell them a product,

24:13.080 --> 24:14.240
the user is not the product.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.320
The product is the product.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.620
So how do we make this the best?

24:16.620 --> 24:19.520
So a lot of times, there will be a process of thinking of how

24:19.520 --> 24:21.960
do we make this best for the end users that

24:21.960 --> 24:24.640
will be reflective of how Apple looks at things.

24:24.640 --> 24:27.400
And so those comparisons will probably never go away just

24:27.400 --> 24:30.400
because the nature of the product being a product

24:30.400 --> 24:32.360
and not the user being the product.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.720
But there's something else you touch on in this update

24:34.720 --> 24:36.400
that I just wanted to get more information on

24:36.400 --> 24:37.800
because it's like super light.

24:37.800 --> 24:41.040
Towards the end here, you write, the end of the month,

24:41.040 --> 24:44.760
we will finalize our brand new automation powered release

24:44.760 --> 24:47.800
process, meaning we will easily queue up

24:47.800 --> 24:51.200
the release of several apps and desktop components.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.600
I don't know what you mean there.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
Could you tell me more about that?

24:53.600 --> 24:55.840
Because that sounds like really cool high tech stuff.

24:55.840 --> 24:59.000
Yeah, so this has been an awesome, awesome bit of work

24:59.000 --> 25:01.320
over the last month or so with several people

25:01.320 --> 25:05.920
in the community coming together to help automate this stuff.

25:05.920 --> 25:09.040
Basically, we have completely rebuilt

25:09.040 --> 25:12.600
how we build elementary OS.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.160
We're using, we've been adopting CI

25:15.160 --> 25:18.840
across all of our over 100 repositories on GitHub.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.920
We're doing things like testing builds,

25:20.920 --> 25:23.880
validating with Houston CI, which is our app center test

25:23.880 --> 25:24.380
suite.

25:24.380 --> 25:27.160
So the same standards that we hold third party developers to,

25:27.160 --> 25:29.680
our apps are tested against.

25:29.680 --> 25:33.240
And then we're also linting the code

25:33.240 --> 25:35.360
to keep up with code quality standards.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.720
And now we even automate translation template updates.

25:38.720 --> 25:41.160
So a lot of these things that kind of used

25:41.160 --> 25:43.840
to be a lot of manual labor for a release

25:43.840 --> 25:46.320
or for just maintaining the code in general

25:46.320 --> 25:47.800
have been automated.

25:47.800 --> 25:51.400
And along with that comes automating the package release

25:51.400 --> 25:52.120
process.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.440
So when we actually want to send out an update to users,

25:54.440 --> 25:57.800
like we mentioned in the monthly update posts,

25:57.800 --> 25:59.680
there's a whole big, long process

25:59.680 --> 26:01.400
of preparing that release.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.640
And the majority of that now has been automated

26:03.640 --> 26:06.000
with continuous integration and continuous delivery,

26:06.000 --> 26:07.200
which is so, so cool.

26:07.200 --> 26:07.760
MARK MANDEL.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.400
Hopefully, that just frees you up

26:09.400 --> 26:11.520
to spend more time on the things that actually matter.

26:11.520 --> 26:11.560
DAN SANDLER.

26:11.560 --> 26:12.040
Exactly.

26:12.040 --> 26:12.240
Yeah.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.000
We were spending a lot of time on these release processes.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.440
And now we can do more releases faster.

26:17.440 --> 26:18.320
Oh, that's great.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.760
Oh, that's so cool to hear.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.680
So there's one thing that really strikes me.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.560
So Dan, I want to give you a chance to jump in here.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.000
Kind of wondering why this isn't all

26:27.000 --> 26:30.360
being held for just the next elementary OS release.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.560
Because the blog post, we've touched

26:32.560 --> 26:37.320
on three of a dozen things that are landing that

26:37.320 --> 26:40.680
looks like it's just an update coming to the existing OS.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.120
Is this a strategy change?

26:42.120 --> 26:44.720
You know, it really isn't a strategy change for us.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.800
This is something we've been doing for a while.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.200
And it's funny, because we hear from people

26:50.200 --> 26:53.800
who are outside of our community talk about, oh, well,

26:53.800 --> 26:55.800
I don't want to use an LTS-based distro,

26:55.800 --> 26:57.560
because that means I won't get updates.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.960
But we're totally opposite of that.

26:59.960 --> 27:03.840
You have that stable base of the Ubuntu LTS underneath,

27:03.840 --> 27:05.120
which is really great.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.120
But we're also continually delivering updates

27:08.120 --> 27:11.080
to all of our own applications every single month.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.080
And we've been doing that for over a year now.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.520
And all the apps in App Center are

27:16.520 --> 27:18.480
released whenever those developers publish

27:18.480 --> 27:19.480
new releases.

27:19.480 --> 27:22.560
And now you can even get the latest versions

27:22.560 --> 27:24.960
of third-party apps because of the great Flatback support.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.480
So I think we're just continually pushing

27:27.480 --> 27:32.440
that we want to be the most stable, but also most updated

27:32.440 --> 27:33.760
distro that you can have.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.840
And you get kind of that best of both worlds.

27:35.840 --> 27:37.240
You guys better be careful, or else people

27:37.240 --> 27:39.120
are going to start figuring out what you're doing.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.360
And then this thing's going to blow up out of control.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.240
You're not going to do it with a success.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.480
You better be careful.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.960
Because yeah, this is great.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.680
This update, it's definitely worth a read,

27:49.680 --> 27:52.920
because there's a lot more coming, including just nice

27:52.920 --> 27:58.360
tweaks to the look and feel, the drop-down date menu,

27:58.360 --> 28:00.720
just nice things for the date and time indicator,

28:00.720 --> 28:03.200
just all kinds of small quality of life improvements,

28:03.200 --> 28:06.480
as well as tons of new third-party software

28:06.480 --> 28:09.240
that you can now get in the best-designed App

28:09.240 --> 28:10.400
Center out there.

28:10.400 --> 28:13.680
So hashtag, check it out.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.040
Is that what the kids say, Wes?

28:15.040 --> 28:15.680
Did I get that right?

28:15.680 --> 28:16.240
Yes, you did.

28:16.240 --> 28:17.160
Thank you.

28:17.160 --> 28:20.160
I defer to Wes on those things.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.800
Anyways, thank you, gentlemen, for joining us

28:22.800 --> 28:25.960
and keep up the great work, because my family

28:25.960 --> 28:27.160
appreciates it.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.000
I love it.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.600
Thank you.

28:29.600 --> 28:33.360
I do, I really think it's just so great.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.440
All right, Wes, we've got to do some housekeeping,

28:35.440 --> 28:36.400
because everything changes.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.080
We've got to stop salivating over to elementary.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.360
Everything changes now.

28:40.360 --> 28:40.880
Everything.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.560
Everything, and nothing is changing.

28:43.560 --> 28:45.040
Well, we're changing everything,

28:45.040 --> 28:47.680
but then the stuff in the middle doesn't really change.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.000
No, and stuff at the end doesn't really change,

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
except for it'll be sooner.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Right, faster.

28:53.000 --> 28:53.760
Faster.

28:53.760 --> 28:57.960
So we are experimenting with a new live time slot

28:57.960 --> 29:00.320
for this here humble podcast.

29:00.320 --> 29:03.080
We're going to attempt to move it up a couple of hours

29:03.080 --> 29:04.240
in the daytime.

29:04.240 --> 29:08.000
We currently do Linux Unplugged live every Tuesday

29:08.000 --> 29:11.160
at 2 PM Pacific time.

29:11.160 --> 29:15.760
Now, we're going to try moving that up to noon Pacific time.

29:15.760 --> 29:19.240
Still on Tuesdays, still at jblive.tv.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.880
We really need the sun right above us

29:20.880 --> 29:22.080
when we're podcasting.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.840
It just helps a lot.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.880
Yeah, it's the solar panels we installed on top of our heads,

29:27.880 --> 29:30.160
Wes.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.520
So we really would love you to show up,

29:32.520 --> 29:35.680
because we're petrified this is going to go horrible.

29:35.680 --> 29:36.880
We're just really terrified.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.360
And we love doing the show live.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.960
I mean, it's kind of the whole thing.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.840
Well, and we've got that virtual log, and we'll miss you

29:42.840 --> 29:43.840
if you don't come join us.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.680
We've been at this live time since the show's inception,

29:46.680 --> 29:48.760
and people built a routine around it.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.480
So we're completely paranoid.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.840
But it is something that would work better for everyone

29:52.840 --> 29:55.320
involved in the production of the show.

29:55.320 --> 29:58.320
So we're going to try doing noon Pacific going forward.

29:58.320 --> 30:04.000
Now, next week, I'm traveling, so we'll pre-record an episode.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
So next week, we're just throwing everything.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.520
Don't bother showing up live, but do check your feeds.

30:09.520 --> 30:10.880
Yeah, we have a new episode.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.960
Just won't do it live.

30:12.960 --> 30:16.040
Then we're coming back at the new time, noon Pacific.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.600
What's that East Coast time there, Wes?

30:17.600 --> 30:18.880
Well, you just got to add three hours.

30:18.880 --> 30:19.320
I know.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.520
That's why I thought you would just save the time.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.280
Yeah.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.720
You're supposed to flex your math muscle over there

30:24.720 --> 30:25.800
when I do those kinds of things.

30:25.800 --> 30:26.920
I don't want it to be too easy for you.

30:26.920 --> 30:27.800
I got to keep you sharp.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.120
Thanks, yeah.

30:29.120 --> 30:31.280
So this is the last two.

30:31.280 --> 30:32.320
I know.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.360
It's weird.

30:33.360 --> 30:33.920
It's weird.

30:33.920 --> 30:34.760
Savor it.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.000
So let us know what you think.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.960
And if you haven't had a chance to make it before,

30:38.960 --> 30:40.960
and maybe the new time works a little better for you

30:40.960 --> 30:44.040
for some reason, please, please come.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.640
Because like I said, we're terrified

30:45.640 --> 30:46.520
that nobody's going to show up.

30:46.520 --> 30:47.520
Vote with your presence.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.880
We've had our lug time at a certain specific time

30:49.880 --> 30:52.480
in it forever, and it's just scary.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.520
So let us know.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.880
Now, also, we mentioned Brunch with Brent over at Jupiter

30:56.880 --> 31:00.800
Extras, but while you're there, check out ThreatHunting101.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.320
There's a lot of lingo these days

31:02.320 --> 31:03.960
when it comes to protecting your network

31:03.960 --> 31:06.160
and the whole quote, unquote, cyber security,

31:06.160 --> 31:07.880
end quote, industry.

31:07.880 --> 31:11.040
Well, just sort of with a big sharp needle

31:11.040 --> 31:13.920
to pop the hype bubble, Elle has a chat.

31:13.920 --> 31:16.160
You join her with a guest, special guest.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.600
And I thought it was really good, ThreatHunting101.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.280
Actually, you've got two special guests.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.040
That makes it an extra special extra.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.480
There might be some more stuff in the works.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.120
In fact, there might be some other things

31:25.120 --> 31:26.880
in that feed related to the topic that

31:26.880 --> 31:27.920
are worth checking out too.

31:27.920 --> 31:28.960
Indeed.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.480
It's possible, Wes.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.520
It's possible.

31:31.520 --> 31:34.920
That extras, it's becoming something of a gold mine.

31:34.920 --> 31:40.640
And I guess while we're here, in celebration of Mr. Daniel

31:40.640 --> 31:44.840
Foray, submit your hashtag ask error questions.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.040
It's a great part of the show.

31:46.040 --> 31:49.080
Yeah, you want to listen to Dan say something hilarious.

31:49.080 --> 31:49.960
Oh my god.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.480
You got to start that chain.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.520
I really appreciate, Dan, how you

31:54.520 --> 31:57.040
are willing to take a ribbing from those guys

31:57.040 --> 31:58.040
and stay true to yourself.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.760
See, I was going to say bring reason.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.600
Oh, well, that too, actually.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.160
These guys are so nice.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.200
They are, aren't they?

32:05.200 --> 32:08.640
So get your questions into the crew, hashtag ask error.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.640
Anything about Linux, the universe, life itself,

32:11.640 --> 32:14.000
ask them and they'll answer it in a future episode.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.400
All right, there you go, Wes.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.920
It's so clean in here.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.560
Housekeeping is a great moment in time.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.560
It really is a chance to clean everything out.

32:21.560 --> 32:24.480
So we have been really enjoying ourselves.

32:24.480 --> 32:28.280
Everything Fedora 31, it's a great time of year.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.680
You've got right before the holidays,

32:30.680 --> 32:32.320
you get to celebrate the Linux days.

32:32.320 --> 32:35.040
You get Ubuntu 19.10, which is really

32:35.040 --> 32:38.360
like your first visceral look at the new gnome

32:38.360 --> 32:41.280
shell and all the improvements of the different flavors.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.000
And then Fedora usually ships somewhat on time.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.920
And this time they nailed it.

32:45.920 --> 32:49.360
And it's really a great opportunity for those of us

32:49.360 --> 32:51.400
who just love Linux and love the different desktop

32:51.400 --> 32:53.360
implementations to try it all out.

32:53.360 --> 32:56.840
We've been running Fedora 31 for over a week.

32:56.840 --> 33:01.400
And we have some questions about some of their bigger changes

33:01.400 --> 33:04.880
and maybe just what the future holds for 32 and 33.

33:04.880 --> 33:07.120
And we knew just who to ask.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.080
Christian here is the senior engineer manager

33:09.080 --> 33:12.360
for desktop graphics at Red Hat.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.720
First of all, I love that there's a senior engineer

33:14.720 --> 33:15.200
for that.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.480
I might not have expected that.

33:16.480 --> 33:18.080
So welcome back to the show, Christian.

33:18.080 --> 33:18.640
Thank you.

33:18.640 --> 33:19.840
Thanks all for having me.

33:19.840 --> 33:23.400
I love your blog posts that you do kind of midway

33:23.400 --> 33:27.600
into the development cycle of the next Fedora workstation.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.880
They are so packed full of information

33:29.880 --> 33:33.400
that these really could be the release announcement notes.

33:33.400 --> 33:36.280
So on September 23, you posted what's

33:36.280 --> 33:39.080
coming in Fedora workstation 31.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.600
And there's actually quite a bit that didn't really

33:41.600 --> 33:45.000
make it into the official bullet points of what's new.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.360
One thing you guys wrote in here that I thought

33:47.360 --> 33:49.640
would be really kind of interesting to get some insights

33:49.640 --> 33:52.000
is you wrote, an item we feel is important

33:52.000 --> 33:53.920
is reducing the need for X-Wayland

33:53.920 --> 33:57.400
and having Firefox run natively on Wayland.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.040
Why did you feel like that was important?

33:59.040 --> 34:03.160
And why do we need to reduce our use of X-Wayland, do you think?

34:03.160 --> 34:04.680
I think there's many reasons for that.

34:04.680 --> 34:06.520
But I mean, I think for me, the major thing

34:06.520 --> 34:09.640
is, of course, that even though we're working very hard

34:09.640 --> 34:12.200
to make sure X-Wayland is a really great solution

34:12.200 --> 34:14.840
and works really, really well, it still adds overhead.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.560
And it's sort of like an abstraction layer

34:16.560 --> 34:19.920
where you're sort of abstracting in the old X system.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.360
And of course, you also maybe lose some of the advantages

34:22.360 --> 34:24.560
that Wayland is meant to give you

34:24.560 --> 34:29.000
by having to rely on X in terms of security and so on.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.120
So yeah, we invested in making sure

34:32.120 --> 34:34.760
that Firefox would get a native Wayland port.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.560
And I think it's actually worth mentioning that I think

34:37.560 --> 34:39.760
for the last five years at least,

34:39.760 --> 34:41.800
Red Hat has more or less single-handedly maintained

34:41.800 --> 34:43.840
Firefox for Linux.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.320
So anyways, we did the work to make sure

34:46.320 --> 34:48.080
that we could get a native port.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.520
Also because a browser, right, is the most critical

34:50.520 --> 34:51.400
application we have today.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.120
I mean, I think often, at least for me

34:53.120 --> 34:54.560
myself and I think for many others,

34:54.560 --> 34:56.040
there are days where I literally don't open

34:56.040 --> 34:58.160
any other application than the browser.

34:58.160 --> 35:01.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.240
So we wanted to make sure that the browser works really well

35:04.240 --> 35:06.440
and is a top-notch experience under Wayland

35:06.440 --> 35:09.400
and that it runs natively and not only this old layer.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.680
And of course, not starting X-Wayland eventually, right,

35:11.680 --> 35:14.040
will also be a resource-saving thing.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.320
That if you don't need to start it,

35:15.320 --> 35:19.200
then we free up that overhead that that causes.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.080
You're also, in this post, talking

35:21.080 --> 35:23.040
about X-Wayland on demand.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.480
Does that play into that as well?

35:24.480 --> 35:25.280
Yes, exactly.

35:25.280 --> 35:28.920
So at the moment, right, because after 30 years,

35:28.920 --> 35:31.000
everything had a lot of hard dependencies in X

35:31.000 --> 35:32.600
and are assuming things are based on X.

35:32.600 --> 35:33.120
Yeah.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.920
So even though Fedora has been running Wayland

35:34.920 --> 35:38.520
as our primary display server for years now,

35:38.520 --> 35:40.320
it was only very recently that we

35:40.320 --> 35:43.280
were able to get rid of the last remnants of code in Gnome

35:43.280 --> 35:46.480
that still assumed there would be an X session available.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.560
So that meant that X-Wayland has always been running.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.080
And if there was a problem with X-Wayland, of course,

35:50.080 --> 35:51.600
it affected your whole desktop session.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.600
But now that we are at the point where

35:53.600 --> 35:56.960
Gnome can run on just Wayland and don't need X at all,

35:56.960 --> 36:00.080
we will also then do this X-Wayland on demand

36:00.080 --> 36:03.360
so that we only start it once an application actually requested.

36:03.360 --> 36:06.480
So if you don't have a legacy application that still uses X,

36:06.480 --> 36:09.960
that's when we start X-Wayland, as opposed to ramping it up

36:09.960 --> 36:11.560
for every desktop session you have,

36:11.560 --> 36:14.240
even if you don't actually run anything on Wayland,

36:14.240 --> 36:15.440
start on X directly.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.720
No need to have it hanging around running

36:16.720 --> 36:17.560
if you're not using it.

36:17.560 --> 36:18.040
Yeah.

36:18.040 --> 36:20.440
My battery thanks you for that.

36:20.440 --> 36:20.920
Yeah.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.680
No, because there's a lot of discussions

36:22.680 --> 36:24.840
about performance in general.

36:24.840 --> 36:28.200
And of course, there's a lot of work on making animations

36:28.200 --> 36:29.560
smoother and these kind of things.

36:29.560 --> 36:32.120
But I think often people tend into the performance term

36:32.120 --> 36:35.280
to also put resource usage.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.000
And of course, so that's another thing

36:37.000 --> 36:38.800
we've been looking at is like, how can we

36:38.800 --> 36:41.920
get rid of processes to keep your session as small as

36:41.920 --> 36:44.000
possible, especially if you don't need them?

36:44.000 --> 36:44.760
Yeah.

36:44.760 --> 36:48.160
I want to get to Pipewire because this is something

36:48.160 --> 36:52.600
that it feels like things are getting lined up in 31,

36:52.600 --> 36:56.760
but things really start to shift in 32 and 33.

36:56.760 --> 37:00.440
And maybe it's good to just recap a little bit of Pipewire

37:00.440 --> 37:01.000
history here.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.880
So Pipewire initially was a project

37:02.880 --> 37:06.280
that started to really provide remote video solutions

37:06.280 --> 37:07.720
for Wayland sessions.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.800
Yes, correct.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.960
I mean, the original name actually,

37:10.960 --> 37:12.440
if you go back and get history, you

37:12.440 --> 37:14.240
can probably still see that it was originally

37:14.240 --> 37:16.080
called Pulse Video.

37:16.080 --> 37:19.640
So the idea was like, hey, we need something

37:19.640 --> 37:23.160
like Pulse Audio for video because both for Wayland

37:23.160 --> 37:24.960
but also for as we went to Flatpaks,

37:24.960 --> 37:28.120
we realized that when you sandbox applications,

37:28.120 --> 37:29.480
we want it as a secure way for you

37:29.480 --> 37:31.840
to be still able to access things like your webcam

37:31.840 --> 37:32.960
and so on.

37:32.960 --> 37:36.440
So it's all like, hey, let's put together

37:36.440 --> 37:38.320
what we called Pulse Video at the time.

37:38.320 --> 37:41.160
And then I guess as we kept discussing and looking at it,

37:41.160 --> 37:43.560
we thought, well, we can make the whole architecture

37:43.560 --> 37:45.280
or desktop a lot easier to maintain and deal with

37:45.280 --> 37:46.640
if we could start centralizing things

37:46.640 --> 37:49.040
by instead of having Pulse Audio and Pulse Video next

37:49.040 --> 37:52.520
to each other, basically have one thing that handled both.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.680
And then we also said, well, maybe we can bring in Jack

37:55.680 --> 37:56.400
to this too, right?

37:56.400 --> 37:59.000
So because that's always been the ugly stepchild

37:59.000 --> 38:01.160
of the Linux universe, it's like this extra thing

38:01.160 --> 38:03.480
that you have to tweak and twiddle to get going.

38:03.480 --> 38:06.880
And we thought, let's look at it if we can get the performance

38:06.880 --> 38:12.040
into Pipewire that enables it to also replace Jack

38:12.040 --> 38:13.880
and basically provide a drop-in replacement

38:13.880 --> 38:15.480
for both Pulse Audio and for Jack

38:15.480 --> 38:17.800
and, of course, provide this new video functionality we needed.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.640
Now, as things have evolved, it's

38:19.640 --> 38:24.000
not so much replacing Jack but more working alongside Jack?

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
No, it's still the goal is to replace it.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.960
I mean, we will be having a separate drop-in replacement

38:30.960 --> 38:31.760
process.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.400
Technically speaking, no Jack application

38:33.400 --> 38:35.160
will need to be rewritten.

38:35.160 --> 38:38.440
It will still find the quotation mark Jack server there,

38:38.440 --> 38:41.040
but it will actually be Pipewire providing that Jack server, not

38:41.040 --> 38:42.840
the native Jack process.

38:42.840 --> 38:45.680
So is it sort of like a Pipewire Jack library

38:45.680 --> 38:48.480
that the applications will just be able to communicate with?

38:48.480 --> 38:52.840
Yeah, well, I mean, this is a Don't Sobbing Manager.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.400
I don't know the details that well, but.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.520
Yeah, I'm obviously a little outside of my pay grade, too.

38:57.520 --> 39:01.320
But Jack is, well, just like Pulse Audio, it's a server,

39:01.320 --> 39:01.840
right?

39:01.840 --> 39:04.720
So as long as you have the server there and you speak

39:04.720 --> 39:07.480
the Jack protocol, basically, then you can communicate with.

39:07.480 --> 39:10.640
So it's essentially creating a Jack-compatible server

39:10.640 --> 39:11.480
for Pipewire.

39:11.480 --> 39:12.200
Yes, exactly.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.640
And, of course, the same on the Pulse Audio side,

39:14.640 --> 39:17.000
that it will be a Pulse Audio-compatible server

39:17.000 --> 39:19.160
for Pulse Audio applications.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.840
So my question that I just desperately need to know

39:21.840 --> 39:25.120
is, will there still be some ALSA in the stack?

39:25.120 --> 39:27.600
Like at the low level, are we still going through ALSA

39:27.600 --> 39:28.520
to get to the hardware?

39:28.520 --> 39:29.000
Yes.

39:29.000 --> 39:29.880
Yes, we are.

39:29.880 --> 39:30.360
I love it.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.080
OK.

39:31.080 --> 39:31.600
All right.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.360
Very good.

39:33.360 --> 39:35.240
Yeah, I mean, ALSA, of course, is still

39:35.240 --> 39:36.320
going to be the driver side.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.920
I mean, I guess there is definitely

39:37.920 --> 39:42.800
parts of ALSA that, of course, is not so needed anymore.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.240
I mean, back in the day, right, we

39:44.240 --> 39:46.680
had all this software mixing done in ALSA.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.640
And these days, I think Pulse Audio used to do that.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.880
And, of course, Piper do that.

39:49.880 --> 39:54.040
Of course, in some sense, we're maybe stripping back ALSA

39:54.040 --> 39:55.760
a bit to be a pure driver layer, right,

39:55.760 --> 39:59.120
as opposed to having all these sort of more high-end features

39:59.120 --> 39:59.800
over there.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.120
Yeah, that's a fair explanation.

40:01.120 --> 40:01.640
That makes sense.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.480
And that's kind of what it's doing best right now anyway.

40:03.480 --> 40:04.280
Yeah.

40:04.280 --> 40:07.000
Let's talk about 33, though.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.880
So some of this lands in 32.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.600
But in 33, the idea is to ship PipeWire

40:11.600 --> 40:14.200
as the default audio handler, with a way

40:14.200 --> 40:17.680
to hit a switchback function somehow.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.320
Is that, do you think, too aggressive?

40:19.320 --> 40:20.520
Or is that just on the edge?

40:20.520 --> 40:22.440
It's going to be like the rollout of Pulse Audio all over

40:22.440 --> 40:22.880
again.

40:22.880 --> 40:23.680
Yeah, I'm curious.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.080
Because as production people, we're

40:25.080 --> 40:27.840
really curious to see where this goes and very excited.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.520
Yeah, so the way we, I mean, this

40:29.520 --> 40:32.160
was me and Wim sort of sitting down and hashing out

40:32.160 --> 40:33.320
the plan for how to do this.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.120
And I mean, originally, I think, probably

40:35.120 --> 40:36.200
when I talked to you guys the last time,

40:36.200 --> 40:38.640
our plan was let's roll out jack support first

40:38.640 --> 40:40.320
and then do Pulse Audio later.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.000
I think we actually concluded in the end

40:42.000 --> 40:44.120
that that created more problem than it solved,

40:44.120 --> 40:47.000
because you suddenly then have to deal with interacting

40:47.000 --> 40:50.440
across the Pulse Audio and PipeWire boundary.

40:50.440 --> 40:53.680
So we decided, OK, we just need to roll out in one go.

40:53.680 --> 40:57.480
And so the plan now is for 32, we

40:57.480 --> 40:59.960
will have a feature complete, or at least closely feature

40:59.960 --> 41:02.560
complete, PipeWire there that you very easily can turn on.

41:02.560 --> 41:05.520
And then, of course, our hope is that you and other people

41:05.520 --> 41:07.520
start hammering on that and testing it and giving us

41:07.520 --> 41:09.640
feedback, like, hey, everything is perfect,

41:09.640 --> 41:11.600
or, hey, here are the problems.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.920
And then our goal is that for Fedora 33,

41:13.920 --> 41:15.880
we can say, hey, everyone has no report

41:15.880 --> 41:17.360
that things are really good, and we've

41:17.360 --> 41:20.760
been able to fix a lot of bugs during the lifecycle of Fedora

41:20.760 --> 41:22.080
32.

41:22.080 --> 41:25.400
So we feel confident about switching on default.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.040
But we will do the same here that we

41:27.040 --> 41:28.680
did for the Wayland rollout in Fedora,

41:28.680 --> 41:33.000
where we had a plan of rolling it out at least two releases

41:33.000 --> 41:34.520
before we actually did.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.400
But we kept finding issues that we felt

41:36.400 --> 41:37.960
were major enough to delay the release.

41:37.960 --> 41:41.760
And of course, if you experience the same here,

41:41.760 --> 41:43.680
because what I don't want is, as you said,

41:43.680 --> 41:46.840
the PulseAudio situation, where it literally took people years

41:46.840 --> 41:50.000
to stop hating PulseAudio because the rollout was so

41:50.000 --> 41:51.600
bumpy.

41:51.600 --> 41:55.240
And I don't want to repeat that experience for Pipewire.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.880
Lesson learned.

41:57.880 --> 41:58.800
Yeah, well, very good.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.000
We will bang on it for sure.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.320
And we will try to report anything that we find amiss.

42:04.320 --> 42:07.280
I mean, Wes has already been attempting to give it a go on 31.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.000
So we're very excited.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.440
Because listening to the talks and just looking

42:12.440 --> 42:14.320
at the way it's laid out, this could

42:14.320 --> 42:17.400
be an improvement in latency, like a reduction even further

42:17.400 --> 42:18.280
than what we have now.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.120
I mean, we already have Pulse applications.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.320
So if they can just talk to our Jack applications

42:22.320 --> 42:24.660
through Pipewire and not have to use all the gross bridging

42:24.660 --> 42:25.600
we have in place now.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.080
We could see an improvement in real time processing,

42:28.080 --> 42:31.280
which could be great for us for effects for our live stream.

42:31.280 --> 42:32.760
So it's pretty exciting.

42:32.760 --> 42:36.280
We've got cool technologies like Toolbox and Silverblue.

42:36.280 --> 42:39.820
You've got Wayland and Pipewire and Flatpaks.

42:39.820 --> 42:42.040
It feels like the underlying technology stuff

42:42.040 --> 42:43.600
is getting really, really solid.

42:43.600 --> 42:45.200
And don't forget tools like Podman.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.200
Right.

42:46.200 --> 42:49.360
So I wonder if, when you look at this as a developer

42:49.360 --> 42:52.120
workstation, being that you're on the desktop team,

42:52.120 --> 42:56.920
do you see that Gnome Shell is like the next big frontier

42:56.920 --> 42:58.160
of work that needs to be done?

42:58.160 --> 42:59.720
Is that what you're seeing after this?

42:59.720 --> 43:01.480
Or what's your opinion on that?

43:01.480 --> 43:04.360
Yes, we're definitely looking at if there

43:04.360 --> 43:06.320
is ways to improve Gnome Shell.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.600
And we actually have a, I don't think

43:08.600 --> 43:10.440
I've talked about it in the public blog yet,

43:10.440 --> 43:13.840
but I've been actually doing this effort with a lot

43:13.840 --> 43:16.520
of students that we are getting in every year,

43:16.520 --> 43:18.240
both in Brno in the Czech Republic

43:18.240 --> 43:21.120
and here in Boston at the Boston University,

43:21.120 --> 43:23.360
where we're trying to basically do a lot of surveys

43:23.360 --> 43:28.600
and do automatic data gathering to basically try to figure out

43:28.600 --> 43:29.920
what are their likes and dislikes.

43:29.920 --> 43:31.220
And especially from any of them, they

43:31.220 --> 43:32.840
come either from Windows or Mac.

43:32.840 --> 43:35.100
So they're set up with Gnome Shell desktops,

43:35.100 --> 43:36.840
and then you're capturing their experiences?

43:36.840 --> 43:37.800
Yes, exactly.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.400
Wow, that's fascinating.

43:39.400 --> 43:42.320
We're trying to build up our capability

43:42.320 --> 43:45.080
and figure out exactly how to do it better,

43:45.080 --> 43:46.920
so that we can start capturing that feedback

43:46.920 --> 43:48.600
and then improve our user experience.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.760
And that, of course, we hope to then feed back into,

43:50.760 --> 43:52.800
for instance, Gnome Shell and say that, OK, here's

43:52.800 --> 43:54.800
how we can make Gnome Shell an even better option

43:54.800 --> 43:55.640
for developers.

43:55.640 --> 43:58.360
But I mean, of course, in the short run, for me,

43:58.360 --> 44:01.080
the developer killer feature that we're pushing hard

44:01.080 --> 44:04.520
is, of course, the Fedora Toolbox, which, of course,

44:04.520 --> 44:07.480
is this new tool we have created and we

44:07.480 --> 44:10.360
are putting a lot of resources into to make pet containers

44:10.360 --> 44:13.520
feel natural and easy to use.

44:13.520 --> 44:16.560
And I mean, it's not an advanced product in many ways.

44:16.560 --> 44:19.000
I mean, Wes, I think you mentioned Podman.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.400
I mean, Podman, of course, is a tool for creating and running

44:22.400 --> 44:23.560
a lot of your containers.

44:23.560 --> 44:26.080
So Toolbox is basically using Podman

44:26.080 --> 44:27.720
to make that process even simpler,

44:27.720 --> 44:29.800
so that we don't need to sit there

44:29.800 --> 44:32.100
reading documentation to figure out what are commands

44:32.100 --> 44:33.600
and all the cool things and stuff.

44:33.600 --> 44:37.640
And our plan is that you can do Toolbox create,

44:37.640 --> 44:39.040
and it creates you a pet container.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.080
And then you can much more easily

44:41.080 --> 44:44.040
find and interact with your pet containers.

44:44.040 --> 44:46.320
And at the same time, we're doing UI integration.

44:46.320 --> 44:49.880
Like the idea is that, for instance,

44:49.880 --> 44:51.960
when you have a terminal opening into your toolbox

44:51.960 --> 44:53.840
or into your pet container, the prompt

44:53.840 --> 44:56.440
will be slightly different from, let's say, your host,

44:56.440 --> 44:58.600
so that you don't sort of just jump to, let's say,

44:58.600 --> 44:59.720
your 10 different terminals.

44:59.720 --> 45:01.360
You're not sure where you are anymore.

45:01.360 --> 45:04.000
Also, there's some integration with Gnome Shell Terminal

45:04.000 --> 45:06.400
to remember what Toolbox you're in as well, right?

45:06.400 --> 45:07.640
Yes.

45:07.640 --> 45:10.360
So the plan is, of course, that you very easily

45:10.360 --> 45:12.520
can find the terminal corresponding

45:12.520 --> 45:13.840
to a certain toolbox.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.160
Yeah, that's great.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.760
So that's kind of features, you know?

45:16.760 --> 45:19.400
Those high-level user experience features.

45:19.400 --> 45:21.480
All the technology's there, like you're talking about,

45:21.480 --> 45:23.280
but no one's going to find it if it's not

45:23.280 --> 45:24.160
right there in their face.

45:24.160 --> 45:25.320
Right, what's kind of thrilling about it,

45:25.320 --> 45:27.580
it's taking stuff that's super low level

45:27.580 --> 45:30.240
and bringing it all the way up to the user experience

45:30.240 --> 45:32.680
from the top of the layer all the way down to the bottom.

45:32.680 --> 45:34.440
But not even just using it like the tool,

45:34.440 --> 45:36.200
the command line, whatever, the main pages,

45:36.200 --> 45:37.440
it's the whole workflow.

45:37.440 --> 45:39.360
That seems a big deal.

45:39.360 --> 45:40.880
Yeah, so I agree.

45:40.880 --> 45:43.080
That seems like I'm already using it.

45:43.080 --> 45:45.480
As soon as I started reading what it was,

45:45.480 --> 45:48.040
I just started using it, and I love it.

45:48.040 --> 45:50.440
But I mean, I'm thinking about Gnome Shell itself,

45:50.440 --> 45:53.040
like architecturally, the transition to Gnome Shell 4,

45:53.040 --> 45:54.840
is that a near-term project, or do you

45:54.840 --> 45:57.520
think those are longer-term projects?

45:57.520 --> 45:59.920
Well, I would call it medium-term.

45:59.920 --> 46:03.680
I mean, at the moment, we had a meeting just the other day,

46:03.680 --> 46:06.560
and I said, my focus now is that I want to, in some sense,

46:06.560 --> 46:11.360
be able to sign off saying that, hey, Wayland is done.

46:11.360 --> 46:14.400
And I want us to focus on getting toolbox up and going.

46:14.400 --> 46:17.640
And of course, there's also various other polished items

46:17.640 --> 46:19.840
related to Silverblue that I want us to cross off.

46:19.840 --> 46:21.720
And I said, only once we have these in place,

46:21.720 --> 46:23.840
then I feel the time is to maybe start

46:23.840 --> 46:27.280
moving into at least more serious Gnome Shell tweaks.

46:27.280 --> 46:29.840
I mean, I'm sure that you will see smaller things coming

46:29.840 --> 46:33.280
in going forward with, like, Alan Day, who's

46:33.280 --> 46:37.080
sort of leading that effort to try to research what could

46:37.080 --> 46:38.720
sort of be Gnome Shell 4.

46:38.720 --> 46:40.400
It's still a sort of exploratory phase

46:40.400 --> 46:45.480
and trying to get use cases and discuss with, what we'll call

46:45.480 --> 46:47.640
it, student focus groups, but also with some existing RHEL

46:47.640 --> 46:49.040
customers and so on to just make sure

46:49.040 --> 46:52.040
that we don't want to sit in our own little echo chamber

46:52.040 --> 46:54.120
and saying, oh, here's the new perfect design,

46:54.120 --> 46:55.040
and then we ship it.

46:55.040 --> 46:57.920
And it's like, oh, but this really breaks things for me

46:57.920 --> 47:00.440
when I try to use Gnome Shell with Maya or something.

47:00.440 --> 47:02.800
Good job on you, because it makes sense

47:02.800 --> 47:04.320
to wait for the user survey data,

47:04.320 --> 47:07.520
wait for some of these tools that fundamentally change how

47:07.520 --> 47:09.160
someone can use their workstation,

47:09.160 --> 47:12.440
wait for those to develop, tackle the Wayland problem

47:12.440 --> 47:14.120
that's going to have to be completely solved

47:14.120 --> 47:15.880
for the next Gnome Shell.

47:15.880 --> 47:17.840
That really does seem like the right approach.

47:17.840 --> 47:19.360
It just means we have to be a little patient.

47:19.360 --> 47:20.000
We've got to wait.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.400
But things are getting better in the meantime.

47:21.400 --> 47:23.760
It's not like there isn't active continuous improvement.

47:23.760 --> 47:24.000
Right.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.640
I mean, even so, I mean, even in the Wayland transition,

47:26.640 --> 47:28.360
I'm surprised how good it all is, right?

47:28.360 --> 47:30.080
There may be X servers running under the hood,

47:30.080 --> 47:30.800
but I never know.

47:30.800 --> 47:32.520
It is flawless on my ThinkPad.

47:32.520 --> 47:33.680
It is completely flawless.

47:33.680 --> 47:40.560
Even playing Proton games on Steam on Wayland is flawless.

47:40.560 --> 47:41.080
It's great.

47:41.080 --> 47:41.560
Yeah.

47:41.560 --> 47:43.520
No, I mean, I think we're pretty happy with it.

47:43.520 --> 47:45.640
I mean, the one big, well, I mean,

47:45.640 --> 47:46.680
there are some smaller items.

47:46.680 --> 47:49.000
I mean, I guess you guys have seen Hans Guede, who's

47:49.000 --> 47:51.520
on our team, right, working on trying to improve some things

47:51.520 --> 47:53.920
regarding scaling of old STL games.

47:53.920 --> 47:56.360
But I mean, the one big item that we're, of course, waiting

47:56.360 --> 47:57.840
is to get things working perfectly

47:57.840 --> 47:59.320
with the NVIDIA binary driver.

47:59.320 --> 47:59.800
Right.

47:59.800 --> 48:01.240
And that, of course, is something

48:01.240 --> 48:02.840
we can't do on our own, right?

48:02.840 --> 48:04.760
This is a collaboration with NVIDIA.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.360
And then, of course, we've been trying

48:06.360 --> 48:07.960
to help them put pieces in place.

48:07.960 --> 48:10.840
But of course, we need them to then try out and enable

48:10.840 --> 48:13.000
those features in their driver and tell us how it works.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.360
And then hopefully, at some point in the not too distant

48:15.360 --> 48:19.760
future, we can say, hey, Wayland or other X Wayland

48:19.760 --> 48:22.040
on top of the NVIDIA binary driver now works correctly

48:22.040 --> 48:24.640
and is ready to go.

48:24.640 --> 48:25.440
That'll be huge.

48:25.440 --> 48:25.920
Wow.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.640
I mean, the one thing that actually delayed that a bit

48:27.640 --> 48:30.040
was it turned out to be a bigger effort than we thought

48:30.040 --> 48:32.560
because a lot of these tools that, for instance,

48:32.560 --> 48:35.000
a lot of our rail workstation customers use,

48:35.000 --> 48:39.280
all, for instance, are based on OpenGL extensions,

48:39.280 --> 48:42.720
for instance, that NVIDIA are shipping with their driver that

48:42.720 --> 48:44.280
are custom to NVIDIA.

48:44.280 --> 48:46.200
And I mean, I think for a regular desktop user,

48:46.200 --> 48:47.600
you don't even probably know about them

48:47.600 --> 48:48.320
or ever heard about them.

48:48.320 --> 48:50.560
But if you are using one of these applications

48:50.560 --> 48:52.480
and you don't get access to those extensions,

48:52.480 --> 48:55.880
then, of course, your desktop doesn't work for you.

48:55.880 --> 49:00.200
So we ended up having to do more work on enabling

49:00.200 --> 49:01.720
the binary driver for X Wayland.

49:01.720 --> 49:04.200
But we believe we have the infrastructure now.

49:04.200 --> 49:07.640
But, of course, NVIDIA now need to find the time

49:07.640 --> 49:09.520
to do their testing and validation of it

49:09.520 --> 49:12.760
so that we can get the driver out that supports it perfectly.

49:12.760 --> 49:15.240
I'm amazed that we're even talking about this stage,

49:15.240 --> 49:17.320
though, because it does mean at some point

49:17.320 --> 49:21.680
there will be a point in time when NVIDIA binaries worked

49:21.680 --> 49:23.200
with Wayland and when it didn't.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.280
There'll be a marker in Linux's history.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.360
There's going to be new Linux users who never had

49:27.360 --> 49:28.240
to go through this.

49:28.240 --> 49:28.760
We're right.

49:28.760 --> 49:30.760
People will adopt Linux and never

49:30.760 --> 49:32.840
have had to worry about this.

49:32.840 --> 49:35.720
And I put a big asterisk next to my it works perfectly.

49:35.720 --> 49:37.560
It works perfectly in the right scenarios.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.560
And I think that's where Wayland's at right now.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.400
I had to switch a couple of apps that I used,

49:41.400 --> 49:43.080
drop a couple of extensions.

49:43.080 --> 49:46.120
And I happen to already be switching over to Firefox

49:46.120 --> 49:48.000
anyway, so it sort of worked perfectly for that.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.960
And on the right hardware, like my ThinkPad with Intel

49:50.960 --> 49:54.480
graphics or when I hook up my AMD eGPU, it's great.

49:54.480 --> 49:56.520
On my machine upstairs, it's a little more tricky.

49:56.520 --> 49:58.840
So there's some scenarios where it's not perfect yet,

49:58.840 --> 50:01.880
but it showed me that everything that's

50:01.880 --> 50:03.720
sort of been promised for so many years

50:03.720 --> 50:06.480
is really beginning to solidify.

50:06.480 --> 50:09.360
It's not 100% yet, but it really is beginning to get there.

50:09.360 --> 50:11.240
I mean, I think there's a lot of sort of unsung heroes here.

50:11.240 --> 50:13.800
I mean, there's a guy called Olivier Ferdinand on our team

50:13.800 --> 50:16.320
who I think is mostly actually known as being

50:16.320 --> 50:20.120
the founder of XFC, but he's been doing, for instance,

50:20.120 --> 50:22.240
an absolutely stellar job the last few years just keeping

50:22.240 --> 50:25.440
track of every wayland bug that has come in and making sure

50:25.440 --> 50:28.000
we fix it and then figure out what is a corner case

50:28.000 --> 50:29.400
triggering this issue.

50:29.400 --> 50:32.600
And it's sort of like, not the person we might sort of see

50:32.600 --> 50:34.840
in the headlines, but definitely some of those people

50:34.840 --> 50:37.080
who've been doing so much legwork and just making sure

50:37.080 --> 50:39.920
it becomes a solid experience for more and more people.

50:39.920 --> 50:43.880
And even things that might feel obscure,

50:43.880 --> 50:45.720
that we actually get them resolved.

50:45.720 --> 50:47.600
And I mean, that blog post I mentioned I wrote,

50:47.600 --> 50:49.200
I mean, the one feature, for instance, he worked on there,

50:49.200 --> 50:52.720
which I mentioned was that he made sure that we got

50:52.720 --> 50:54.720
some of these accessibility features brought into wayland

50:54.720 --> 50:56.640
that we used to have and even improved them

50:56.640 --> 50:57.480
at the same point.

50:57.480 --> 51:01.080
So, you know, some disabled users have trouble

51:01.080 --> 51:01.920
with mouse clicks.

51:01.920 --> 51:03.840
So there's this feature in, you can turn on that

51:03.840 --> 51:05.440
when you just hover your mouse over something,

51:05.440 --> 51:10.040
it will, after a certain amount of time, click automatically.

51:10.040 --> 51:13.080
And this used to be like this timer up in the shell,

51:13.080 --> 51:14.440
but what he did was he actually turned it

51:14.440 --> 51:15.400
into the cursor itself.

51:15.400 --> 51:18.160
Now you see this little almost cake diagram

51:18.160 --> 51:21.160
sort of swirl up as it takes up before it does the click.

51:21.160 --> 51:22.120
Yeah, it looks really nice.

51:22.120 --> 51:23.800
There's a screenshot in the blog post,

51:23.800 --> 51:26.280
which we will link in the show notes.

51:26.280 --> 51:27.440
Thank you for mentioning that,

51:27.440 --> 51:29.880
because I think that is the biggest story

51:29.880 --> 51:31.200
about free software in general,

51:31.200 --> 51:33.280
is there's so many unsung heroes behind the scenes

51:33.280 --> 51:35.920
and some of them work on things that we use and love

51:35.920 --> 51:39.280
every single day, or some of them are solely responsible

51:39.280 --> 51:42.200
for making this free software accessible

51:42.200 --> 51:43.960
for an entire category of users.

51:43.960 --> 51:45.560
And that's such a massive impact.

51:45.560 --> 51:47.640
And you're right, they don't make headlines.

51:47.640 --> 51:50.760
And that's something I'd love to try to change somehow.

51:50.760 --> 51:52.720
That could be a goal of mine for 2020,

51:52.720 --> 51:53.840
new year's resolution.

51:53.840 --> 51:56.800
I mean, there's all these efforts that I might not see at all

51:56.800 --> 51:58.160
or have any idea of being worked on,

51:58.160 --> 51:59.560
but turns out are crucial.

51:59.560 --> 52:00.960
Remarkable too.

52:00.960 --> 52:02.000
Well, Christian, thank you.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.040
And thank you to the entire team for all of this.

52:04.040 --> 52:05.960
We've been enjoying Fedora 31

52:05.960 --> 52:08.280
and we're looking forward to future releases too.

52:08.280 --> 52:10.280
It's been a solid maintenance release

52:10.280 --> 52:12.040
and you can see things are getting lined up

52:12.040 --> 52:14.920
for the next couple of releases.

52:14.920 --> 52:15.760
I think it's great.

52:15.760 --> 52:18.600
It's really great to see this nice steady progress happening.

52:18.600 --> 52:21.280
I know and I can't quite even describe it,

52:21.280 --> 52:25.240
but over and over, I'm enjoying using Fedora 31.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.440
It's just a solid release.

52:27.440 --> 52:30.440
Next week, we're gonna dive into what we love

52:30.440 --> 52:31.880
about our favorite distributions.

52:31.880 --> 52:32.720
Like what are the things,

52:32.720 --> 52:34.320
the core things we really love about them

52:34.320 --> 52:35.840
and then what's the one thing we would change

52:35.840 --> 52:36.760
to make them perfect.

52:36.760 --> 52:38.680
So we'll talk more about that.

52:38.680 --> 52:40.400
I, in the meantime, will give you something

52:40.400 --> 52:42.600
you can fix immediately about Fedora.

52:42.600 --> 52:45.320
I will have a couple of links in the show notes.

52:45.320 --> 52:47.280
Let's try to add them in order of priority.

52:47.280 --> 52:49.960
So I will start with better looking fonts

52:49.960 --> 52:51.240
for Fedora as the first link.

52:51.240 --> 52:55.520
If you only do one thing, do the suggestions in that link.

52:55.520 --> 52:57.520
Then there's a second link where there's a,

52:57.520 --> 53:00.160
I love the Friya code or Fira code.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.000
Fira?

53:01.000 --> 53:01.840
Fira?

53:01.840 --> 53:03.040
Yeah, that's probably how you say it, Wes.

53:03.040 --> 53:03.880
Thank you.

53:03.880 --> 53:05.120
Either way, it's a handsome font.

53:05.120 --> 53:06.040
So go get that.

53:06.040 --> 53:09.680
And then the last one, if you really wanna go into deep

53:09.680 --> 53:11.840
about the sad state of font rendering,

53:11.840 --> 53:15.840
not just on Linux, my friends, but on all platforms,

53:15.840 --> 53:18.640
there is an article that really nerds out on this.

53:18.640 --> 53:20.760
It's a fantastic read if you're at all interested

53:20.760 --> 53:21.960
in typography or fonts.

53:21.960 --> 53:24.360
And the nice thing is it wraps with a few recommendations

53:24.360 --> 53:25.440
on what you can do to fix it.

53:25.440 --> 53:28.760
So definitely worth a read if you're running,

53:28.760 --> 53:31.440
well, really actually out of the gate, out of the box,

53:31.440 --> 53:34.440
the Ubuntu distributions are generally the better off

53:34.440 --> 53:37.440
on this particular area, but if you're rolling your own,

53:37.440 --> 53:40.440
setting up Arch or Gen2 or you're on Fedora

53:40.440 --> 53:41.920
or some of the other distributions,

53:41.920 --> 53:43.840
they may not have chosen some of the font options

53:43.840 --> 53:45.080
that make a difference.

53:45.080 --> 53:49.840
So, and that last link, that last link actually explains

53:49.840 --> 53:52.400
why fixing your fonts matters.

53:52.400 --> 53:53.240
It's worth looking into.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.360
It's worth the effort, yeah.

53:54.360 --> 53:58.680
That's the Westpain recommendation.

53:58.680 --> 54:00.960
Well, Wes, before we run,

54:00.960 --> 54:03.400
let's just do a super quick mention of the pick

54:03.400 --> 54:05.320
because it's really a pick of the week

54:05.320 --> 54:07.320
that's just for you and only for you.

54:07.320 --> 54:10.320
And that is called Kexec Boot.

54:10.320 --> 54:13.040
This is a project that we have linked in the show notes

54:13.040 --> 54:15.960
that is a nice Linux bootloader implementation

54:15.960 --> 54:20.000
based on Wes's favorite, Kexec.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.040
Quick reminder, what's Kexec, Wes?

54:22.040 --> 54:26.360
Okay, well, Kexec is a tool and a ability feature

54:26.360 --> 54:28.800
of the Linux kernel that lets you load a new kernel

54:28.800 --> 54:29.680
without having to reboot.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.280
So you don't, the hardware doesn't have to go

54:31.280 --> 54:32.600
through the reboot process.

54:32.600 --> 54:34.240
You just jump right to the new kernel.

54:34.240 --> 54:36.440
One could in theory be sitting here right now

54:36.440 --> 54:39.920
and be running Kubuntu and Kexec into Fedora.

54:39.920 --> 54:40.760
Yeah, exactly.

54:40.760 --> 54:41.600
In theory.

54:41.600 --> 54:42.800
You know, you can use it for all kinds of things

54:42.800 --> 54:44.800
between rescue, that facility is used

54:44.800 --> 54:46.480
for crash jump sometimes.

54:46.480 --> 54:47.720
You can boot into a crash kernel

54:47.720 --> 54:50.400
and then save that state off onto a file system somewhere.

54:50.400 --> 54:51.600
So there's lots of things.

54:51.600 --> 54:53.720
I use it for trying out new systems

54:53.720 --> 54:54.840
because you don't have to go mucking about

54:54.840 --> 54:55.920
with your bootloader.

54:55.920 --> 54:58.960
You can just go jump into any old kernel and inner MFS.

54:58.960 --> 55:01.520
As long as you point it to the right partition, it'll boot.

55:01.520 --> 55:02.480
Nobody wants to muck.

55:02.480 --> 55:04.400
So Kexec Boot is a neat project.

55:04.400 --> 55:05.880
I'd actually not seen before,

55:05.880 --> 55:08.040
but I got it installed and running today.

55:08.040 --> 55:10.120
And it is just kind of what it says.

55:10.120 --> 55:11.680
It's a bootloader for Kexec.

55:11.680 --> 55:13.680
So it goes and talks to the kernel,

55:13.680 --> 55:15.440
goes and finds out about all the partitions you have.

55:15.440 --> 55:18.400
And then it tries to open them up, load them

55:18.400 --> 55:19.800
and see if it has any boot entries.

55:19.800 --> 55:22.720
And it's got a simple boot.cfg syntax.

55:22.720 --> 55:23.560
You know, you kind of just say,

55:23.560 --> 55:25.560
here's the kernel I want and a label

55:25.560 --> 55:28.520
and here's the command line to append to the kernel.

55:28.520 --> 55:30.240
And then instead of using, you know,

55:30.240 --> 55:34.200
booting into it like a bootloader would do, it Kexecs.

55:34.200 --> 55:35.160
That is neat.

55:35.160 --> 55:37.280
But it's targeted to look like a real bootloader too.

55:37.280 --> 55:38.760
So it opens up on a TTY

55:38.760 --> 55:40.520
and it's got like a nice little graphical menu

55:40.520 --> 55:42.880
and it'll list out the different kernels you have available.

55:42.880 --> 55:45.680
So it opens up a new TTY on your existing distro

55:45.680 --> 55:47.720
that you're running, your main distro.

55:47.720 --> 55:48.560
Yeah.

55:48.560 --> 55:51.400
And I mean, you probably want to use this at a level

55:51.400 --> 55:53.200
because it's poking around with all the partitions.

55:53.200 --> 55:55.040
Like, I don't know how nicely it'll play

55:55.040 --> 55:56.080
with something that's up and running.

55:56.080 --> 55:56.960
You probably want it at a level

55:56.960 --> 55:59.480
where you haven't started all of your applications necessarily.

55:59.480 --> 56:01.120
I know, Wes.

56:01.120 --> 56:03.800
Hard shut down those things, close them all out.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.840
Because it eventually just drops it all from memory

56:05.840 --> 56:07.120
and then loads the new system, right?

56:07.120 --> 56:08.880
Yeah, I mean, once you hit go,

56:08.880 --> 56:11.320
you're thinking about everything you want working on.

56:11.320 --> 56:12.520
I love it.

56:12.520 --> 56:13.360
I love it.

56:13.360 --> 56:16.360
And so it's a package that it installs

56:16.360 --> 56:20.200
and then it just takes over TTY.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.960
Yeah, and then it's got a nice little GUI

56:21.960 --> 56:23.640
and you kind of select which kernel you want,

56:23.640 --> 56:25.560
hit enter and there you go.

56:25.560 --> 56:27.520
I'm going to break my system with this one, I think.

56:27.520 --> 56:28.360
I love it.

56:28.360 --> 56:29.200
I love it.

56:29.200 --> 56:30.040
See, the nice part is you won't

56:30.040 --> 56:31.520
because you didn't modify your bootloader.

56:31.520 --> 56:32.560
So all you have to do is reboot

56:32.560 --> 56:34.280
and you'll get back to where you started from.

56:34.280 --> 56:35.840
Oh, challenge accepted there, sir.

56:35.840 --> 56:37.320
Challenge accepted.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.520
All right.

56:39.520 --> 56:41.720
Well, go check out Mr. Martin Wimpress

56:41.720 --> 56:42.960
over at the Ubuntu Podcast

56:42.960 --> 56:45.800
because not only did he have that laptop review,

56:45.800 --> 56:48.080
but there's just something every single week,

56:48.080 --> 56:49.520
it turns out, that you could catch

56:49.520 --> 56:50.760
over at ubuntupodcast.org.

56:50.760 --> 56:51.840
Thanks for being here, Wimpy.

56:51.840 --> 56:52.960
My pleasure.

56:52.960 --> 56:55.560
And of course you can get more Dan.

56:55.560 --> 56:59.240
Mr. Foray is one of three fantastic hosts

56:59.240 --> 57:00.920
of the User Air Podcast.

57:00.920 --> 57:02.040
So go check out User Air.

57:02.040 --> 57:03.160
Thanks for being here, Dan.

57:03.160 --> 57:04.000
Thank you.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.960
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

57:05.960 --> 57:06.840
Thank you.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.320
Also, a big thank you to Cassidy for coming here

57:09.320 --> 57:10.720
and help us explaining what they're doing.

57:10.720 --> 57:11.680
I think it's great.

57:11.680 --> 57:12.520
I love it, Cassidy.

57:12.520 --> 57:13.680
So glad you could make it too.

57:13.680 --> 57:14.520
Thank you.

57:14.520 --> 57:15.340
And thanks for having me.

57:15.340 --> 57:16.180
Thank you, sir.

57:16.180 --> 57:17.800
Stay a while and listen.

57:17.800 --> 57:20.080
And Mr. Wes Payne, thank you for making it.

57:20.080 --> 57:20.920
Indeed.

57:20.920 --> 57:22.120
I should say, yeah, yeah.

57:22.120 --> 57:25.200
Since episode 100, I don't think you've missed,

57:25.200 --> 57:27.120
I mean, maybe you were traveling once or twice.

57:27.120 --> 57:29.080
I've been traveling once or twice, but other than that.

57:29.080 --> 57:30.720
So, I mean, you've probably been here

57:30.720 --> 57:33.240
for like maybe minus two.

57:33.240 --> 57:34.280
So thank you.

57:34.280 --> 57:36.000
Not too shabby.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
Check you out over at TechSnap.Systems

57:39.000 --> 57:41.640
with Mr. Jim Salter talking benchmarks.

57:41.640 --> 57:42.240
Oh, yeah.

57:42.240 --> 57:45.360
You want to find about how slow or fast you just may be

57:45.360 --> 57:48.960
and how you might measure it, check out TechSnap 415.

57:48.960 --> 57:50.040
You need to know.

57:50.040 --> 57:51.400
You just need to know where you're at.

57:51.400 --> 57:53.180
I mean, I think with some of the tips in that episode,

57:53.180 --> 57:55.060
you might be doing some benchmarks before long.

57:55.060 --> 57:56.040
Oh, yeah.

57:56.040 --> 57:56.640
Oh, yeah.

57:56.640 --> 57:57.360
Oh, yeah.

57:57.360 --> 57:58.280
Oh, yeah, definitely.

57:58.280 --> 57:59.400
I love that kind of stuff.

57:59.400 --> 58:02.080
Go check out the network at Jupiter Signal.

58:02.080 --> 58:04.760
LinuxUnplugged.com is our website.

58:04.760 --> 58:10.080
LinuxUnplugged.com slash 326 is the URL for all of our show

58:10.080 --> 58:11.520
notes this week.

58:11.520 --> 58:14.120
And slash subscribe for that if you want to get, you know,

58:14.120 --> 58:15.640
maybe an RSS feed or something.

58:15.640 --> 58:16.600
Thanks for being here.

58:16.600 --> 58:18.000
We won't be here next Tuesday.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.520
So there's that.

58:20.520 --> 58:22.200
But there will be a show.

58:22.200 --> 58:23.400
Yes, thank you.

58:23.400 --> 58:24.120
Yes.

58:24.120 --> 58:32.800
We already explained this, Wes.

58:32.800 --> 58:59.200
Do you have a good Halloween?

58:59.200 --> 59:02.360
Anything happen to your neck of the woods?

59:02.360 --> 59:06.200
My neighbor's door was open for a weirdly long time.

59:06.200 --> 59:09.320
So I just moved, and I've not met this particular neighbor.

59:09.320 --> 59:11.760
But their door, I mean, like where I'm on the left

59:11.760 --> 59:14.120
in the hallway, he's like straight through.

59:14.120 --> 59:17.400
So I sort of, I'd taken a small nap, let's say,

59:17.400 --> 59:21.440
got up at like 11 PM before doing some stuff.

59:21.440 --> 59:23.920
Went to go take the dogs out, and the door's just open.

59:23.920 --> 59:26.000
It's just hanging open.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.960
And then I woke up the next morning, and it's still open.

59:29.960 --> 59:31.800
They had a Halloween party is what they had.

59:31.800 --> 59:33.400
I think they had too much Halloween.

59:33.400 --> 59:34.880
A little candy rambunctious.

59:38.360 --> 59:41.280
I did my Halloween the weekend before Halloween.

59:41.280 --> 59:42.200
Yeah, that's nice.

59:42.200 --> 59:43.400
Can't get it over with early.

59:43.400 --> 59:44.740
Yeah, it was pretty uneventful.

59:44.740 --> 59:46.440
Can I tell you the most American thing

59:46.440 --> 59:48.080
that I've seen since I emigrated?

59:48.080 --> 59:49.040
Yes, please.

59:49.040 --> 59:51.120
There was a family on my street trick or treating

59:51.120 --> 59:51.840
in a golf cart.

59:55.840 --> 59:58.880
Well, you don't want to have to burn off

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.240
of those candy calories.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.640
You don't want to get exercise.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.600
You've been working hard for those candy calories.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.360
Plus, think about how much more candy you can carry back,

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.480
because your arms are too weak to really carry it otherwise.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.440
Yeah, you need that hauling capacity.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.760
It was amazing.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.840
And the driver was holding a big gulp

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.280
just to complete the picture.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.000
Stop it.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.360
Are you serious?

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.120
No.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.680
Well, if you get it concentrated enough,

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.560
you can just dissolve the candy right in it.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.920
I bet you it's booze.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.160
I bet you it's booze in a big gulp.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:31.640
We did get Jell-O shots.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.280
That was cool.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.280
We got handed Jell-O shots.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:33.920
Oh, that's nice.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.320
Yeah, that was pretty great.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.920
That's really adult candy anyway.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.000
Yeah, for sure.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.800
Wyatt wrote, hope you guys had a happy Halloween.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.000
I know I did while I was trying to get my local Sampasher

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.480
to automatically mount on my machine this morning.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.120
A Linux kernel CVE stuck out like a sore thumb

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.840
while I was viewing dMessage.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.800
Dun, dun, dun.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.520
All right, so go vote JBtitles.com.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.920
Go pick our title while I read the rest of this.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.720
You can get the full information and links

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.320
the whole CVE will have in the show notes.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.680
To summarize, this bug affects AMD, Centaur,

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.280
and other non-Intel processors except for the Intel Xeon PHI

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.760
family and a range of Intel Atom processors.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.040
You have to disable simultaneous multi-threading SMT

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.120
to mitigate this bug.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.560
Enabling the mitigation will cripple any hypervisors

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.640
you are running under the effect of processors.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.480
My guess, the CVE comes out of the Spectre kerfuffle

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.200
that happened in January.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.760
Unfortunately, when I read dMessage,

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.480
I didn't get my Sampasher to mount on boot,

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.840
so I don't get Sampasher's.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.160
Regards, Wyatt.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.560
What a weird series.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.120
Because of this whole Intel Spectre mitigation stuff,

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.720
he can't get his Samba stuff to mount.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.440
Didn't Jim just hit a weird series of bugs

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.160
with WireGuard and the kernel?

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:54.520
Oh, yeah, that was an AMD bug given not so random numbers.

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.040
Yeah, that's what WireGuard was not so happy with.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.560
It's just sometimes the weirdest esoteric problems

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.200
manifest in a way that.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.880
Well, we have so many different levels.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.200
Everything's so complicated.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.520
A violation of one of your assumptions way down below

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.560
makes weird stuff happen.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.920
Right, assumptions that are happening before you even

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.920
know things are happening.
