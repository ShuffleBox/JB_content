00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 12 for October 29th, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:46.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly talk show that believes sometimes the esoteric aspects of your operating system can be the most important aspects of your operating system.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Chris.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Matt.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hey there, Matt.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
Episode 12, buddy, and we're chugging right along into pretty technical territory this week.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Oh, it's pretty deep stuff, let's just put it that way.

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
I'll be curious to see if we can pull this episode off because first of all, it's hard to be experts in either one of these topics we're talking about today because they're moving fast and they are very esoteric.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
They're very low level stuff and a lot of people either don't know what they are, don't know why they should matter or feel like it'll never impact them.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
But I hope after this week's episode, we change that line of thought.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
That'd be great.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Kind of a big goal, but we'll see.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
This week, Debian's been asked to make a choice to pick between two different startup systems.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
One created by Canonical that's used in Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise, Linux 6, Chrome OS, called Upstart.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
Obviously, Ubuntu is a major derivative of Debian, so it's a pretty important decision for those guys.

01:39.000 --> 01:48.000
And then SystemD, created primarily by Red Hat, Intel, and others, that is shipping in Arch and it's going to be shipping to Red Hat Enterprise, Linux 7, SUSE.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
A lot of different distros are picking up SystemD and they all do different things.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
SystemD does a lot of things and that's one of the actual criticisms against it.

01:56.000 --> 02:04.000
But people are really now watching Debian to see which way they're going to go because whichever way Debian goes, probably the rest of the market's going to go in whole.

02:04.000 --> 02:15.000
Because if Debian goes with SystemD, then it's almost de facto standardized across all of Linux, except with the exception of the large distribution that some of you might have heard of called Ubuntu.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
It's going to be interesting.

02:18.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah, because if they go with Upstart, then there's two very large distributions that many other distributions are based off that will not be using SystemD.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
And it will sort of introduce sort of this long-term differentiator between the two sides.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
So it's kind of all eyes are on Debian at the moment and this is a topic that has been being debated within Debian.

02:37.000 --> 02:51.000
I remember reading a post on LWN.net, which after my comments in last week's episode, I went over and purchased a year subscription to LWN.net, which is once you get in behind the paywall, it is a totally different experience.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
So they should tease some of that out a little more because it is actually really great.

02:54.000 --> 03:03.000
Anyways, I read an article at LWN back on July 27th of 2011 saying that Debian was debating if they would switch to SystemD.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
So this has been going on for a really long time, but it's getting serious this week, Matt. It's getting serious.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
You said 2007?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh, I'm sorry, 2011. It was July 27th, 2011.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Okay, I was going to say, my goodness.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, it feels like that. It feels like that, honestly.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
And you know, it's funny because I actually, I remember covering Upstart.

03:22.000 --> 03:35.000
Upstart landed in edgy, what was it, like Ubuntu 6.10, I think, and of course they weren't fully converted over from System 5 in its scripts until I think like version 9 something of Ubuntu.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
But I remember like talking for a very, very long time saying, man, Ubuntu's main feature is just a boots faster, a boots faster.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Well, during that period of time was when they were transitioning to Upstart.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And meanwhile, Debian's just been hanging back.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Been like, you know what, we'll let the kids figure it out. And we rolled Debian stable here.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
We rolled Debian stable, so we let the kids figure it out and then we package it all up once they've got it all sorted out.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
Now, of course, SystemD and Upstart have both been available in Debian testing for a while.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
So we're going to talk about that.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
But before we talk about this week, I wanted to get into our follow up because we like to continue the threads from previous week's episodes.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
We want to do that right up here at the top of the show.

04:12.000 --> 04:21.000
And we talked last week about sort of the sad state of Linux news and how it was so personality driven, so cult of personality driven.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And you talked a lot about it from a writer standpoint.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
I did, because you got to understand that a lot of times what I put out there is assigned.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
And then I have the option of saying I would like to eat this week or I would not like to eat this week.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
And I basically and usually it's a pretty straightforward decision for me that I enjoy food.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
And it's actually not as evil as that, because that kind of makes it sound evil.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
But really what it is, it's like, well, if my editor or I don't know who's telling you.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.000
But if the editor, whoever it is that gives you your assignment, aren't they basing that on what they perceive to be interest from their audience?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
It's not the editor's fault.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
It all rolls downhill from way above.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
And basically it comes down to eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
That's really what it is.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
So he's no more at fault than I am.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
But he does.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
He is the one that basically is the gatekeeper there as to what I know better.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
One that you know better, but again, he's in a he's in a fairly stable position and he's not necessarily in a position that he wants to rock that boat.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Because he is managing things that aren't Linux related as well.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
It's funny, though.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
But yeah, so he's not an expert.

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
But it's funny because like in this episode, you know, if this is probably not the topic you pick to get a bunch of people to listen to your podcast.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
System D and Upstart, right?

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
I mean, people you could see like how an editor would never want you to write an article about that because that's not a guaranteed win.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
Right. But something about, you know, top 10 lists for something or whatever, top 77 lists like I saw today, a top 77.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
OK, those drive clicks.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Exactly. And that's just one example.

05:41.000 --> 05:49.000
It's one example. And also the fact that a lot of the sites, because as you're well aware of, tux machines being sold off and all this, the landscape's changing.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
A lot of people are finding, oh, wow, this is so not a money making thing.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
It's really not. Yeah.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
So, you know, at least from the writing perspective.

05:56.000 --> 06:06.000
So I think that folks are beginning to try for more of an SEO grab, sometimes to try for a title grab, and neither are necessarily working super awesome.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Even I found even on my own site, you know, it's been affected.

06:09.000 --> 06:16.000
And sometimes it's this it's this horse race that you run and you run into with where, you know, people try different things to grab headlines and those quit work.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
And then they have to switch to something else. And this is sort of the point that Matt, not you, but a different Matt who wrote into the show was making.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
He said, you know, dear Chris and Matt, by the way, I'm a JB lurker, regular listen to unplugged and a regular viewer of last.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I also enjoy text napping photo from time to time.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
But he points out he just finished listening to some plug level where we talked about this.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
And he thinks that, you know, this whole driven by personalities talking about scandal instead of honest news.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
This is really just sort of a slice of what's going on on a much larger scale, say on Fox News and MSNBC and everything in between.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Profit driven news outlets are only interested in viewership.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Yeah, that's factual.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
And he said, anyway, just my two cents. Thanks for the great shows and for reporting Linux news.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
It is important, if not always sexy. That's what we're going to try to do today.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
That is true. And I think I would counter that, too, and saying he's absolutely correct.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
A profit driven news center definitely has to take that into account.

07:06.000 --> 07:15.000
But I also think that even if you go nonprofit, you do have to have some kind of funding source because you have fixed expenses, even if everybody was volunteering, which isn't always plausible.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
So, you know, all those things come together.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
There's a lot of things under the hood that people have to really stop and think about.

07:20.000 --> 07:28.000
So Andreas wrote in. Oh, by the way, I think we probably got maybe 30, 35 emails just on that news topic alone.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
We got so much email on that.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
Linux unplugged this week generated more email feedback than last did when we did the Synology review.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
And now now now cinnamon is last as we reclaim the crown with the cinnamon topic.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
But for one week, Linux unplugged pulled ahead for episode 11 with the amount of feedback volume that we got.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
So Andreas wrote in. He says, I need to get feedback on the question you asked in Linux unplugged.

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
Which distro will take the lead in a few years when Steam OS is out and Ubuntu continued to fail on the desktop?

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I don't think we said that, but OK, we'll roll with it.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
He says, I'm pretty sure it will be Steam OS.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
Almost every Linux gamer might have at least a dual boot partition with Steam OS.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
OK, there will be ones who refuse to use it because of the Steam DRM stuff.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
But there might be a lot of Steam boxes sold and self-built out at this time point.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
If I got the question wrong, please ignore this feedback. But I think this might be it.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
I think, Andreas, you know, maybe you know what, at least as far as desktop deployment,

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
it's going to be hard to beat Ubuntu and Red Hat on the server deployments and Suice Enterprise Linux and even Debian.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
You know, and I just I kind of disagree.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
I don't know. I mean, so for me, it's like I think it depends on the location and actual the task.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Usually most people use a computer to actually accomplish a set of tasks.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
If it's Steam OS, you're trying to accomplish getting some games going.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
OK, if you're using Ubuntu, you're probably trying to get real work done.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
You're trying to actually do something from a desktop experience.

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
I don't see Steam OS being really popular at your local nonprofit or at a school that's actually trying to get real work done.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I mean, the kids would love you for it, but I don't see that happening.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
I see Ubuntu having a much bigger impact.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
All right. Fair point. Fair point. So I was just looking.

09:07.000 --> 09:14.000
Total console sold total total Xbox 360 console sold to date is looks like a fifty nine million.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
I don't know. Is that right? Total and the original Xbox twenty four million.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
There's thirty one million Xbox subscribers.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
So almost sixty million Xbox 360 sold to date. OK.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
And then, you know, twenty four million original Xboxes.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
That is an S ton of Xboxes. Don't get me wrong.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
But to put that into some perspective, there's been one hundred and seventy something a million iPads sold.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.000
Right. And there's been and which which works out to be I can't remember the number now because I got a third.

09:44.000 --> 09:51.000
I got a third hand, but it works out to be something like represents six months worth of desktop PC sales.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
So you put it in perspective of desktop PC sales.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
It's a it is not even it is not even half the year worth of so it is.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah, I think, you know, SteamOS could get some good traction on the console,

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
but I don't know if it's really going to change the tide at this point in any one direction.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I think it's just going to be a strong contender.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Definitely a high number, but I don't think it's going to be number one.

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
I tend to agree with that. I think, you know, you're trying to undo time and undo progress that's already taken place.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
And so if that does happen, it's going to be a five year plan.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
If it doesn't happen, they'll maintain a real comfortable standing, but it may not ever become the big thing.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
And hey, you know, if it did, that'd be that would be pretty interesting times.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Yeah. Oh, it'd be awesome. I would I'm totally rooting for him.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I want to see them absolutely just mop floor with everybody.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
But, you know, I think that'd be great because what an exciting thing to watch.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
You know, people are really passionate about it.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
But, you know, we have to kind of wait and see how things play out.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Now, we got, like I said, so much email and I'm going to be totally upfront with you guys.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
I didn't get a chance to read it all. So if you didn't get a response from me,

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
I watched a lot of videos on system D and upstart in the last couple of days. I'm not even kidding.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
So I actually didn't get too much of my email.

11:00.000 --> 11:06.000
I used my email time to do that because I was I just kind of fell down the rabbit hole of these things because it's actually pretty interesting stuff.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
So if you if you want, you have my permission to resend.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
And also, I encourage you to go to LinuxActionShow.Reddit.com.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
And while you're over there, start a thread if you think it's something maybe the broader community could could chime in on.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
Now, Matt, before we get into our main topic today, I want to thank our sponsor, and that is Ting.com. Matt? Yes.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
Ting is mobile. It makes sense. They're my mobile service provider. They're Matt's mobile service provider.

11:30.000 --> 11:37.000
And I'll tell you, Matt and I, we are men who prefer to be free agents. That's right.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
I don't like being in a contract, Matt. I don't like early termination fees. What is it, some kind of scam?

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
Oh, totally. Yeah, that's I like having control over how I use my phone. Exactly.

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
And you know what's great about Ting is it's so not only is there no early termination fee, not only is there no contract. I mean, that's a great start.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
I'd take that right there. Oh, totally. You also only pay for what you use.

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
So they take your minutes, your megabytes and your messages at the end of the month.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
They'll just add it up, whatever bucket you fall into. And they've got some great examples on the Ting website.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
My bill right now, for example, and it it is it is up in four days.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
The Ting dashboard tells you they have an amazing dashboard over at Ting.

12:12.000 --> 12:21.000
It's it's got to be it's not just like it's not just like good from like an interface standpoint, but it's also good from like Ting knows the Internet.

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
Like they are one of the first companies that are on board with Mozilla personas, which is a very, very great authentication system.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
That sort of is an alternative to open ID and other things like that. Ting was on board right away. Ting knows about this kind of stuff.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
So they not only do they have a very awesome dashboard, but they actually get Web standards.

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
They really get this kind of stuff and you go right in. They say, yeah, you got this much time left on your account.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
You've got you know, you're currently at this and they have nice like gas gauges that tell you exactly where your usage is at.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
And oh, by the way, this is your billing period. It'll be up in three days.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
So when I go in there right now, it says my billing period has forty one or four days left. I'm at twenty one bucks.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
I'm at twenty one bucks. And now I every time I'm in the car, I usually have an audio stream going and I usually have ways going.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
I don't pretty much go anywhere without ways going all the time and even still. Now, I'm not a big voice user because I'll use Skype and things like that.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
But that's what's so awesome. As the holidays come up, I'm going to start using my voice plan minutes a lot more.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
Now, I'm not paying into some sort of plan. So it's like, OK, well, I get I get 200 minutes this month.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
And if I use more than 200 minutes, I have to pay extra. And then, of course, when I'm not using the phone very much, I not the holidays.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
I don't pay for that phone usage. It's just a flat six dollars a month.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
I love the fact that they have a fluid bucket that will adjust to my month to month needs because they do fluctuate.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
I mean, it really does fluctuate for me. So I love that.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Absolutely. So go get started over at Linux.ting.com.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
That'll take twenty five dollars off your first device or twenty five dollars off your first month.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
If you're going to bring your own device, they've got a bunch of compatible devices.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
Also, right now, if you actually think this is sticking around for a while, go take advantage of this.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
Go to ting.com slash ETF. They have an early termination relief program.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
They're going to give you up to seventy five dollars off per line that you have to get terminated.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
If you're going to move over to Ting and trust me, you're going to want to move over to Ting.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
If you just go to Linux.ting.com, they got a savings calculator that'll show you the awesome amounts of money you'll save over the long run.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
And by the way, that savings will include hotspot and tethering right with the plan.

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
No extra no extra package you have to get into. And it'll also include real personal phone support.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
When you call a Ting agent, they answer the phone and they see your problem all the way through to the end.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
It's like a real Canadian. I love that. I love the one on one connection you can make with these folks.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Because instead of talking to a machine, you're actually talking to someone that not only gives a rip, but can actually solve your problem.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
They're also, as far as telcos go, the most transparent you're ever going to find.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
So go over to their blog and just check out some of the posts over there.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
They've just an introduction to one of their team members.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
You get a little bit of behind the scenes info about Ting.

14:48.000 --> 14:55.000
And as somebody who considers themselves a researcher of things before I buy, I really appreciate that they expose that kind of information to me.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Because it helps me make an informed decision.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
So go over to linux.ting.com and thanks to Ting for sponsoring.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Linux Unplugged.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Ish. Good stuff.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
So let's get down and dirty in the plumbing of Linux this week.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
And I want to talk about SystemD and Upstart and this whole Debian's Choice.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
So I'm going to read you something.

15:13.000 --> 15:18.000
And it's so funny because you're going to find the same blurb all over the entire internet.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
And it's even all over on the Ubuntu wiki on their SystemD page.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
It's on Arch's wiki.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
It's even on the main SystemD page and it's on the free desktop.org.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
It is the explanation of what SystemD is.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
It might not help, but I'm going to give it to you.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And then maybe we'll parse it a little bit.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
So what is SystemD?

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
SystemD is a system and session manager for Linux compatible with System 5 and LSB init scripts.

15:39.000 --> 15:46.000
SystemD provides an aggressive parallelization capability that uses sockets and Dbus activation for starting of services,

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
supports snapshotting and restoring of the system states,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
maintains mount and auto-mount points,

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
and implements an elaborate transactional dependency based service control logic.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
It can work as a drop-in replacement for System 5 init.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Now to sort of parse some of this for you.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
So it uses socket and Dbus activation for starting of services.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
What socket and Dbus?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Well, let's focus on the socket part.

16:14.000 --> 16:21.000
So for example, if you have a very lightly used Apache web server,

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
SystemD can actually open up the port 80 socket and listen for incoming connections on 80

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
and leave Apache as completely closed so it's not taking any CPU or memory until that very first connection comes in.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
SystemD will answer that connection on the port that the daemon uses,

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
and then it will go start up Apache and then serve the page for the person that they need.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
And the user never notices any kind of interruption.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Additionally, it allows you to restart services without breaking the connection

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
because since SystemD is managing that socket,

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
you can have the underlying daemon restart without interrupting it.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
So that's what socket-based activation for starting services is.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
Dbus would be message-based, event-based driven, which is also upstart,

17:05.000 --> 17:12.000
is things like network state changes or hardware state changes or user command changes.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Those are sort of the more event side of things.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
And SystemD is, like I mentioned earlier in the show, primarily being developed by Red Hat,

17:19.000 --> 17:25.000
but it has contributors from all over, including a large group from Intel.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
It is almost a new layer of the operating system to just give you an abstract.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
It takes care of a lot of these things like mounting of file systems, logging.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
A lot of multi-purpose stuff under the hood, it sounds like.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Yeah, it can replace syslog. They have a journal that it replaces,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
which some people don't like. We'll get into that.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
So there's a lot to it.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
And the core question that now Debian is facing is, do we go with upstart or do we go with SystemD?

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
And I want to play a clip for you, Matt, because we played this on the pre-show,

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
and I think you and I both agreed it was worth playing even though it's pretty meaty in the show.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
We're going to play this and we'll kind of parse it.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
This is Lenart Pottering, the primary developer behind SystemD.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
And he was at a Debian conference in August, and they held two talks at this conference.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
The first talk was a SystemD talk, and the talk was why Debian should or should not switch to SystemD.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
And I have that linked in the show notes.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
And the second talk the next day was why Debian needs upstart.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Obviously, one was from Lenart and one was from the canonical rep.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
And we have both of those linked. They're about an hour long if you want to watch them.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
And as we talk about this, keep in mind that this is from Lenart.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
He says, whether Debian chooses SystemD or upstart, it has major implications for the future.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
So you shouldn't only look at what is now, but keep in mind what will come next.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
And there are at least two areas where opting for upstart will mean that you shut Debian out of major changes.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
So in this clip I'm about to play, it's from this 55-minute talk.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
It's about three minutes long.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
He gives some examples of where he feels, and this is Lenart's opinion, the creator of SystemD,

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
where he feels that upstart falls short to SystemD.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
Of course, if you compare it to the other contender, which is upstart,

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
we believe that, I mean, the reason we initially created SystemD actually is because we believe that the upstart design was wrong.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
A little bit about the history there.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
We started, like I played around with a little project I called BabyKit.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
You know, it was back at the time where everything had to be a kit.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
This BabyKit thing was supposed to be like an experiment, how we think that it should work.

19:27.000 --> 19:34.000
And then upstart came along, and then I put that aside because we actually believed that upstart would be the big and great future.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
However, over a year or so, and after talking with seeing Scott a couple of times...

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
And I actually, I buy Lenart here where they actually bought into upstart as a solution because they shipped it with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Like their premier product, they shipped it.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
They actually backed it up by putting it to work, sure.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
The plumber's con, we've eventually figured out that Scott's probably not giving us what we want,

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
and we believe that inherently it had the wrong design.

19:58.000 --> 20:08.000
The reason what exactly is broken there is basically what upstart does is you have a language how you can express how events happen

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
and what's supposed to be done that way.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
What systemly does instead is you express relations between things.

20:14.000 --> 20:24.000
Now, one is a lot more flexible and powerful than the other because in one thing you basically have the administrator figure out what should happen,

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
or the developer, what should happen in which case.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
You write that down, and then upstart will just execute it.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
However, in the system design where you have the dependency tree,

20:33.000 --> 20:38.000
basically you just say these are the dependencies, and then the system will figure out what to do at what place.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
So what Lenart is considering a feature, some of the critics of systemd actually say is a disadvantage.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
And I'll give you my old crotchety sysadmin, everything should be conservative.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
I don't like a lot of changes in perspective because boy do I have it sometimes.

20:50.000 --> 20:59.000
Upstart, and you picked up on this on the pre-show, upstart relies a lot more on the sysadmin or the developer

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
giving it a good set of chain of events to follow, rules if you were right.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.000
Whereas systemd you say, okay, well, I want to start MySQL, and MySQL is going to need network connectivity,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
and network connectivity is going to need that these lower level things start up.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
So here's what I want. I want all these things. The end result is I want MySQL.

21:16.000 --> 21:24.000
And then supposedly there's some black magic that happens there where systemd can actually figure out dependencies in some cases.

21:24.000 --> 21:31.000
And so there's advantages to that because systems nowadays can be a lot of different things at different times.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
In the case of a laptop, it can be a Wi-Fi device that runs on battery.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
And then 20 minutes later it can be hardwired into a gigabit connection with an AC power line.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
And with maybe a second monitor attached. There's a lot of different things that can happen.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
So you could see why maybe a more flexible system could be advantageous as computing starts to change.

21:51.000 --> 21:58.000
But I just wanted to kind of draw attention to the fact here that these are major differences here in how these two things are structured.

21:58.000 --> 22:06.000
This has a couple of effects. Like, for example, in systemd, if you want to have a minimal boot, you want to just start that and that and that.

22:06.000 --> 22:14.000
It's a relatively easy thing to do because you simply look at the dependency graph, figure out what you want, pull in all the dependencies, and run it in the right order.

22:14.000 --> 22:21.000
This, of course, is systematically more difficult with Avster because the Avster rules in the first place have to express what actually happens on the system.

22:21.000 --> 22:29.000
This eventually becomes even more problematic. Like, for example, something very recent is the rearrangement of cgroups.

22:29.000 --> 22:42.000
I'm not sure if you guys have followed that. Cgroups are this thing how you can attach a label to a set of processes and then optionally set a couple of resource values to it.

22:42.000 --> 22:52.000
Like, for example, you can say Apache gets as much CPU time as MySQL regardless of how many processes Apache starts and how few MySQL will start.

22:52.000 --> 23:03.000
Cgroups, I think, are probably, in terms of server deployment, one of the most important things that Debian has to keep in consideration when they're making this choice.

23:03.000 --> 23:16.000
Not that they can't take advantage of cgroups if they're not using Upstart, but what cgroups are, as Lennart just said, they allow you to apply labeling to processes.

23:16.000 --> 23:25.000
The advantage is if systemd starts a process, it can label that, say Apache, from start to finish so that the system always knows this group should have these rules applied to it.

23:25.000 --> 23:35.000
If Apache has some CGI workers and those spawn 30 sub-threads, normally, in some cases, we completely lose track of what's attached to what.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
But systemd, because it's being involved in all of that, will keep it all coherent, will keep it all labeled.

23:40.000 --> 23:47.000
Now, this has big ramifications for, say, I only want MySQL to use X amount of CPU so that way it can't clobber my whole system.

23:47.000 --> 23:55.000
Or I want Wayland to be able to do a whole bunch of stuff, but I need to make sure I keep track of all of its processes because if somebody ever compromises Wayland, I want to follow where that goes.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.000
So there's a lot of different advantages to cgroups. Not that you don't get them. You could still have them.

24:00.000 --> 24:05.000
You could even make Upstart-cgroups, which would integrate cgroup capabilities into Upstart.

24:05.000 --> 24:16.000
But what you lose is systemd is going to sort of provide this API-level access to it that you're just going to kind of get it as a developer if the system uses systemd.

24:16.000 --> 24:31.000
So with the resource handling with cgroups, you suddenly have this problem that if you have multiple services, which basically should be handled the same way, you need to propagate certain things between these services.

24:31.000 --> 24:41.000
For example, if you have Apache and you have MySQL running in the same slice, as we call it, then you need to make sure that either both of them have CPU limits applied on neither of them.

24:41.000 --> 24:50.000
And this gets more complex as an entire dependency tree where you have to walk up the tree to the root and do enable and things like that.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
Now with systemd, with the design, this is very, very easy because we have the dependency tree so you can just walk it.

24:55.000 --> 25:04.000
And Upstart, again, this dependency tree doesn't exist, and you cannot just do that. I don't know. I figure the Upstart people will eventually figure that out themselves.

25:04.000 --> 25:15.000
But yeah, the summary of it all is I can talk about that for a long, long time. I figure if you haven't looked at the details of what Upstart and systemd do there, you probably can't really deal with much of what I say in this regard.

25:15.000 --> 25:24.000
But inherently, we believe the Upstart design and the systemd design before it was inherently flawed at its core.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
It's not how we should do these things. We should have a dependency tree so that we can figure out all the right things.

25:29.000 --> 25:39.000
And yeah, that's the reason why systemd was invented and why we believe that it technically is the right thing. And none of the current contenders, other contenders can do that.

25:39.000 --> 25:48.000
I want to give one more example of why cgroups are pretty important and why having systemd provide an API level access to them and also just having it be cgroup aware is really important.

25:48.000 --> 25:55.000
There's a project that I have really been talking a lot about, especially on Quota Radio. You and I did an episode about it on the Linux Action Show called Docker.

25:55.000 --> 26:04.000
And Docker allows for a completely isolated environment on your Linux box, sort of like BSD jails.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
So for example, in the show, I can't remember exactly, I think what I did is I had my Arch machine installed.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
And then on my Arch machine, I had a self-contained Ubuntu 12.04 environment running inside a Docker instance.

26:15.000 --> 26:24.000
That Docker instance is using cgroups to label all of the processes in that Docker instance as belonging to that Docker instance.

26:24.000 --> 26:31.000
So they are running completely and totally isolated from the rest of my system because they've all been labeled via cgroups.

26:31.000 --> 26:43.000
And that allows, for example, Linode or GoDaddy or DigitalOcean, you could have a lot higher density on your Linux boxes.

26:43.000 --> 26:53.000
You could have maybe potentially hundreds of more clients on there because if you get rid of virtualization and you go right back down to the metal and you do process isolation,

26:53.000 --> 27:02.000
this allows for you to get completely isolated environments that are individually different operating systems with different package configs and different versions of stuff,

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
all in the same box at metal speeds, right?

27:05.000 --> 27:12.000
And then when you combine that with something like SystemD where it supports socket activation, you could be DigitalOcean and say,

27:12.000 --> 27:20.000
I've got 35 users on this server, but these are my low-end users and only three of these systems are ever active at once on average.

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
Well, in today's modern setup on a Linux box, all of those instances would just be running, taking CPU and memory, waiting for a connection.

27:27.000 --> 27:35.000
But with Docker and SystemD, they could sit idle until that first visitor comes and they immediately spin up and they serve the page.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
And then you can also apply resource limitations within there.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
So you can see in the server space how it could be massively beneficial.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
And I would be surprised if Debian didn't sort of weigh that in their decision process.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
Now, there are some criticisms of SystemD.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
And one of them would be probably the one I've heard the most.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
I can't remember.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Oh, it was Linux Today.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
I pulled this one.

27:57.000 --> 28:03.000
I love it, too, because whenever somebody – usually the person criticizing SystemD generally mistypes how you spell it.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
SystemD is all lowercase.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
It's funny because whenever I see somebody criticizing it, they get that wrong.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
And in this case, the guy got it wrong.

28:09.000 --> 28:17.000
He says, SystemD is one program that is a garbage dump of a lot of functionality which used to be provided with shell scripts and special tools.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
He says, and it consumes more memory doing nothing more than system five init.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
And he says, by the way, the SystemD journal is in binary format.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Boom.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Oh.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Now, that is true.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
So gone are the days of text files for your logs.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
And a lot of people hate this.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
And I can understand.

28:35.000 --> 28:44.000
Now, journalctl supports like a really sweet API and a really sweet like parsing syntax and also supports exporting out to text.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
So all of your existing shell scripts could just bang on that text if you wanted to.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
But it also adds like really nice formatting.

28:50.000 --> 28:57.000
Like it clearly will enunciate like here was a reboot executed by this user.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
And then it'll do a nice break in the log and see all of the events that happened from there.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
So it's like you lose some stuff, but then you also gain some stuff.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
And maybe if tools are built to take advantage of that API, it'd be –

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I think that's what's going to be needed.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
Yeah.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
And maybe Red Hat and companies like that would do that as part of their enterprise offerings.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
I don't know.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
I think so.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Okay.

29:19.000 --> 29:25.000
So his argument, though, that it's kind of a garbage dump of different functionality, you know, I kind of –

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
I would argue the same as far as going back to the old school way of it.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
It was a mess.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
I mean, other platforms used to make fun of us for it.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
That's true.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
I mean, they did.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
And I'm not saying that's accurately – they're not accurately making fun of us or not.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
I'm just saying that was the perception.

29:38.000 --> 29:46.000
And so, you know, it's really going to – for me personally, I think System D has a lot of benefits, and it's compelling.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Upstart, you know, has its way of doing things as well.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
All right.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
But let me ask you a question.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
No, I don't.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
And I also – I make this available to the Mumble Room as well.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Sure.

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
If the Unix philosophy of a lot of small individual tools working in concert has gotten us this far,

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
System D is really taking all of this stuff that people didn't want to do.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
And let's be fair.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
Some of the stuff they're replacing was sort of abandoned and hasn't been getting worked on.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
So they're just integrating that functionality in here.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
But it depends on things like cgroups, which are only available on Linux,

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
which means if you write something that depends on System D and System D depends on Linux,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
then it's not portable to one of the BSDs.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.000
So there's a downside, okay, which is probably one of the main downsides for Debian because they want to run on multiple kernels.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
So there's a downside.

30:25.000 --> 30:31.000
The second downside is you take a lot of stuff that used to be individually separated out, like, you know, individual componentized,

30:31.000 --> 30:38.000
and you bring it all into one conglomerate that manages everything, almost like making a lower level OS that sits above the kernel.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Okay, so there's another downside to it.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
Then the third downside I see is this binary file format.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
That's a bit of a step back, I think, in some ways.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Now, so those are sort of the negative aspects of System D.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Because if you look at Upstart, it's deployed, it's tested.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Those are things Debian loves.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Okay, that's good stuff.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
It's essentially fairly straightforward.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
You know, I've had some experience with Upstart, I've had some experience with System D.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Either way, it seems like they both work.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
I actually kind of prefer the way System D works.

31:08.000 --> 31:15.000
I do for myself, but I think that from a Debian's perspective, based on the way they like things to work in general from their side of things,

31:15.000 --> 31:21.000
I think, and of course with other factors as well, I think they're probably reluctantly going to go with Upstart.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I think it'll happen.

31:23.000 --> 31:29.000
So I'm not saying Upstart, so Cheeseburg's asking in the chat room, Upstart is not usable for BSDs.

31:29.000 --> 31:38.000
What I'm saying is if you build an application, or if a project has dependency, and there are already projects that have dependency on System D.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Sure.

31:39.000 --> 31:46.000
Like Login D, like Time Data D, like Locale D, Hostname D, Udev and more, all are now projects that depend on System D.

31:46.000 --> 31:52.000
They will no longer work or function on a BSD system because System D itself is dependent on the Linux kernel.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
So that's one downside.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
However, so Leonard's response to this is, well, I'm not worried about that.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
I just want to make the best operating system possible.

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
And System D does have a bit of a home turf advantage.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
Number one, it's used as an API by more and more projects, like I just mentioned.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
It takes advantage of C groups, the control groups in the Linux kernel, which is pretty important.

32:13.000 --> 32:19.000
And they've, maybe to court Debian, I'm not sure, have implemented some Debian designs into System D.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
Like how the hostname gets set and other things like this.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
They looked over at Debian and said, you know what, they do that better than the Fedora project does it.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
We'll do it that way in System D.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
And that might be a way to court it.

32:29.000 --> 32:38.000
But the main advantage that System D has, well, it actually comes out in this clip from the Upstart talk at the recent Debian conference.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
I'd like to, you know, System D had their promo talk yesterday.

32:43.000 --> 32:49.000
This is Upstart's promo talk, so I think there are other things that I want to talk about.

32:49.000 --> 32:56.000
The most significant obstacle, it seems to me, from a Debian point of view, is the contributor agreement.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
I notice you didn't mention that at all.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Is there any possibility of movement on that?

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Because that's going to be a big problem for Debian.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
I think I'm speaking for many people here.

33:06.000 --> 33:12.000
Wow.

33:12.000 --> 33:18.000
Let's talk about the licenses with you, Ian.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
What is it with Debian and licenses?

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
I don't understand.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
You bloody well ought to.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Sorry?

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
You bloody well ought to by now.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
I didn't see you on Debian legal helping out.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
That's not the place that decisions get made, is it?

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
No.

33:34.000 --> 33:44.000
So to make sure everybody understands the status of Upstart, Canonical has a policy of requiring a contributor license agreement,

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
which is not the same thing as copyright assignment, but we do require, in terms of upstream contributions,

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
anything that's going to be contributed upstream to Upstart does have to be granted.

33:55.000 --> 34:02.000
A contributor license agreement has to be signed, giving Canonical, as the copyright holder of the overall work,

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
the right to, for instance, relicense.

34:05.000 --> 34:15.000
It provides for certain capabilities of making sure they can deal with any litigation that might come up and various other aspects.

34:15.000 --> 34:22.000
It's not something that is actually negotiable in terms of whether Upstart, as an upstream, is going to change that license agreement.

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
This is not actually altogether different from lots of other projects that Debian ships.

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
Of course, we can compare and contrast with the FSF's position,

34:33.000 --> 34:41.000
particularly in that FSF is, of course, a non-profit dedicated to free software, whereas Canonical is a corporation.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.000
So I recognize that people are not necessarily okay with this,

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
but I will point out there's lots of other people in the ecosystem doing this.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
The FSF's promise not to take it norm-free as a norm.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
I'm sorry, but we are running out of time.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
So I suggest we continue this discussion in the hallway track.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
The FSF's contributor agreement, the copyright license,

35:03.000 --> 35:10.000
the FSF legally, bindingly promise not to take anything that you sign over to them in that way, non-free.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
Canonical specifically intend to be able to do that.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
We've heard Mark Shuffleworth tell us that that's the purpose,

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
and that this is a thing that companies like Canonical should be allowed to do.

35:21.000 --> 35:30.000
So I think he was speaking in a general philosophical sense that it is something that companies should be allowed to do.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
Well, it's a thing that the Canonical contributor agreement allows Canonical to do,

35:34.000 --> 35:39.000
and when Mark, who is in charge of Canonical, tells us he thinks companies should be allowed to do it,

35:39.000 --> 35:45.000
when the FSF tell us, not only do they not think it's a good idea, they also promise, in a legally binding way, not to.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
So that's a very clear distinction.

35:47.000 --> 35:52.000
Okay, so submit your patches for upstart, don't sign the CLA, and we'll see what happens.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Well, let's...

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Well, submit them to the Debian maintainer.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
So we're out of time.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Thanks.

36:01.000 --> 36:10.000
Please thank Steve and James for their presentation, and we'll continue the discussion later, I'm pretty sure of it.

36:10.000 --> 36:17.000
Yeah, I'm pretty sure of it too. So the CLA is probably going to be a pretty big sticking point for Debian.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
I don't know what can be done there, actually.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
That's a great point, yeah.

36:22.000 --> 36:29.000
For reference, the people who were talking there, the guy in the audience was, I think, Ian Jackson.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
Well, wait, wait, for reference, who are you?

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
So I'm Popey, Alan Pope. I work for Canonical as an engineering manager, not a developer.

36:37.000 --> 36:44.000
And I've seen some of both of those videos, and I think the guy who was asking the question from the audience is Ian Jackson,

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
who's an ex-Canonical employee and is a Debian developer.

36:48.000 --> 36:56.000
The guy answering the questions was Steve Langecek, who is one of the upstart maintainers and is a Canonical employee

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
and has been a Debian developer longer than he's been an Ubuntu contributor or Canonical employee.

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
Is he on the technical committee of Debian? Because that's been one of the criticisms, is that a couple of Canonical employees

37:07.000 --> 37:13.000
are sitting on this technical steering committee, and if they vote, I think it's like three of them are Canonical employees.

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
Two, I think. So Steve Langecek and Colin Watson, both of which.

37:18.000 --> 37:25.000
I think Colin's actually the longest, after Mark Shuttleworth, he's the longest serving employee of Canonical now.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
And before that, he was a Debian developer, and he still is a Debian developer.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
He contributes heavily to Debian, as does Steve Langecek.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
And yes, they're both on the technical committee. They both have a vote as to which way this goes.

37:37.000 --> 37:43.000
And yes, it would be incredibly surprising if either of them decided to vote for System D.

37:43.000 --> 37:52.000
However, that said, I know if you read the mailing list thread on Debian Devil, which is very long,

37:52.000 --> 37:58.000
Colin has actually said, you know, if I thought that I was going to get any pressure from my employer,

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I would pull myself out of the vote.

38:00.000 --> 38:07.000
Exactly. So I don't question either of those guys' integrity at all.

38:07.000 --> 38:15.000
So here we sit now, though, kind of at a spot where you can see there's multiple sides to the argument.

38:15.000 --> 38:20.000
It's not quite a black and white situation. And Debian finds themselves in kind of a sticky spot

38:20.000 --> 38:26.000
where they have Red Hat and a lot of the other Linux on one side, but they also have some good arguments for upstart, for one.

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
I mean, not just because of their connections to the Ubuntu distribution,

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
but also because they want to support KFreeBSD and Herd and all these kinds of things, right?

38:35.000 --> 38:41.000
Like, they just want to be packaging all this stuff up and don't necessarily want to be tied to just the Linux kernel.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
But my question about that is, like, really?

38:44.000 --> 38:52.000
I mean, at this point, it seems like that doesn't, I don't know, does that really hold water to you?

38:52.000 --> 38:59.000
No, my response to that, if I could interject for a moment, is why don't they use SystemD for the Linux kernel

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
and then stick to what they have for everything else?

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
Yeah. I don't know how hard, that would probably be a huge pain in the ass, though.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Yeah.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
That'd be way too much maintenance for them.

39:10.000 --> 39:16.000
What they want to do is completely, like it is quite a big task to do.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
To switch.

39:17.000 --> 39:27.000
Yes, to switch. I think that, well, me personally, I'd prefer them to do the work to support SystemD because they don't know.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
People are looking at it from an init point of view.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Only an init point of view.

39:32.000 --> 39:40.000
SystemD is an abstract scheduler with before and, like, pre- and post-dependency management.

39:40.000 --> 39:49.000
It is a scheduler in its core, which init is a simple instance of a scheduling problem, or CRON is a scheduling problem.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
That's what SystemD is.

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
Well, Android still does use initD, and it just uses bash scripts.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
I understand it needs to be changed, but I don't know why it needs to be changed.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Right? Gen2 has OpenRC.

40:02.000 --> 40:08.000
Yeah, it's the same thing. They all do their init however they want, but that's why this SystemD is so invasive,

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
because it does cover a lot of ground. It can be very powerful.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
I agree. I don't know, but okay, so invasive or appropriate?

40:16.000 --> 40:23.000
Because first of all, I think what Lenard and his team have tackled are honestly some plumbing stuff that until Upstart came along,

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
nobody was addressing, and SystemD went beyond what Upstart accomplished.

40:27.000 --> 40:36.000
So I think, first of all, I feel like it's a modernization of the Linux core, and I do find it to be a little foreign.

40:36.000 --> 40:44.000
It feels a little foreign, but at the same time, it also seems like without some of these features, we lose a certain competitive edge.

40:44.000 --> 40:56.000
I think it's fair to say a few things have in modern times come across as foreign, like for example, PulseAudio, which is also a Lenard offering,

40:56.000 --> 41:02.000
which I think we can all pretty much agree is a fantastic thing now.

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
And at the time, I think Ubuntu was one of the first distros to put it in.

41:07.000 --> 41:17.000
And yeah, we put it in the distro and put our backing to it. And yeah, we got some flack for that, and so did Lenard.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
Oh, yeah. I mean, back when it came out, it was a pain in the butt to use or configure.

41:22.000 --> 41:29.000
But some of these things are painful decisions, painful switches, and that's why Debian are deliberating about it so hard.

41:29.000 --> 41:39.000
When we switched Ubuntu to Upstart, I remember you mentioned earlier about the work done to reduce the boot time on Ubuntu.

41:39.000 --> 41:47.000
I remember being on a flight from London to America, and Scott James Remnan was working on reducing boot time,

41:47.000 --> 41:55.000
and he was sat there for most of the flight on a Dell Mini 9, and every so often he'd get up and come back further down the back of the plane

41:55.000 --> 42:01.000
and talk to us about how he'd like shaved off a few seconds here or a few milliseconds there or something.

42:01.000 --> 42:09.000
And, you know, this was leading edge stuff at the time, and we made that big switch, and that was a painful switch to make.

42:09.000 --> 42:16.000
And everyone keeps on us saying, oh, Ubuntu is the only distro that uses Upstart, which, you know, is...

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
Chroma West also uses it. Chroma West also uses it.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
Yeah, no, that's the point I was just about to make, Ant. Thank you.

42:24.000 --> 42:36.000
We're not clearly the only distro that uses it, because every derivative distro of Ubuntu uses it as well, as does Chroma West and RHEL 6, as Leonard said.

42:36.000 --> 42:44.000
And it is sort of also similar to the boot system that OS X uses, so it's sort of a cousin of it, so that's also widely deployed.

42:44.000 --> 42:54.000
Well, Leonard clearly takes inspiration from OS X a lot with launch D, you know, system D and zero-conf of RHE, you know.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
Yeah, but I mean, why not, right? I mean, why not?

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
Oh, yeah, I'm not complaining. You're inspired by good design.

43:00.000 --> 43:06.000
Yeah, and so I feel like that is kind of like one of the funny...

43:06.000 --> 43:17.000
I guess maybe part of what it comes from is Upstart relies on a library that's literally titled Not Invented Here, so maybe that's part of why people get on them for it, because, you know, that is kind of a funny thing.

43:17.000 --> 43:25.000
Yeah, but what people forget is Upstart actually was the first person, well, the first project to devise from, like, in a day.

43:25.000 --> 43:32.000
I mean, like, system D came afterwards, so they were actually working on the principles of what Upstart started.

43:32.000 --> 43:46.000
And this is the basis, after watching all of this, you know, I look at it and I think maybe system D is the superior answer because it is based on experiences with Upstart, which was good, right?

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
So it's like, okay, we went this far, now we want to go further.

43:49.000 --> 43:57.000
And I also think there is a big advantage to the Linux community as a whole if we standardize on some of this stuff.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Go ahead.

43:58.000 --> 44:08.000
So it's okay if someone takes an existing project, like, for example, Upstart, and makes something brand new to make it better.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
But it's not okay if someone takes something existing, like, I don't know, Wayland, and makes something new like Mir.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Right, but...

44:14.000 --> 44:32.000
All right, hold on, hold on.

44:32.000 --> 44:46.000
This is the big thing, right, is especially if Debian buys in on system D, then it is essentially all Linux will be, well, with the exceptions of Slackware and Gentoo and other things, but all Linux will be using system D, right?

44:46.000 --> 44:51.000
So it's sort of, but in the case of Wayland and Mir, I think it's apples and oranges there because it's...

44:51.000 --> 45:02.000
Yeah, I mean, I could use Ubuntu with Upstart, I could use OpenSUSE with system D, I could use Debian with system five and still use all the applications that I need.

45:02.000 --> 45:07.000
But if the display servers were different and had different callings, then what am I going to be stuck with?

45:07.000 --> 45:12.000
It was a somewhat facetious comparison.

45:12.000 --> 45:21.000
Okay, it got brought up, I have to mention this, and this is going to be very, very quick. The thing is, is like, Linux in general has less than 1% of the desktop market.

45:21.000 --> 45:33.000
When companies like AMD, NVIDIA, Intel, when they have to make drivers to make this software or these display drivers work with a hardware, it costs money.

45:33.000 --> 45:50.000
They're not going to, at the moment, they do it because there's only one display driver and it's Xorg and that's it. But when it comes to when it's a decision between Wayland and Mir, they're not going to fund a project to support both display drivers.

45:50.000 --> 46:00.000
Dragging it back on topic to system D, you know, saying that the switch to Mir will cost companies money, do you think the switch to system D will cost nobody any money?

46:00.000 --> 46:08.000
Right, that is actually a good point because it, for companies that have massive deployments and with custom init scripts and things like that, this is going to be a big transition.

46:08.000 --> 46:19.000
I'm actually curious, actually, I mean, does like, you know, init D or system or upstart or system D, does that have as much effect as like a display driver?

46:19.000 --> 46:25.000
Not necessarily because there are compatibility layers which allow you to run the old init scripts in a lot of cases.

46:25.000 --> 46:31.000
It's actually backwards compatible with init D, so you could just link D, it can be, but that's questionable.

46:31.000 --> 46:41.000
Well, so the official word is that system D is quote unquote 95% compatible with system 5 init scripts. I doubt that.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
No, that's about true.

46:43.000 --> 46:55.000
And I'm kind of arguing this from a user end perspective where when it comes to the display server discussion, I'm worried whether my applications are going to work or not. I don't usually have that worry when it comes to the init scripts.

46:55.000 --> 47:06.000
Well, the package, the packager will take care of that. So the package, okay, so I want to zoom out for a second because this is another benefit of system D being widely deployed is this, this makes a lot, this makes it a lot easier for packagers, right?

47:06.000 --> 47:20.000
Because let's take BitTorrent Sync, right? They just make a BitTorrent Sync, here's your basic system D startup file, and then the arch user repo guy and the guy that's making the PPA for Ubuntu or, well, I guess Fedora, the guy's making the package for Fedora.

47:20.000 --> 47:29.000
They just have to tweak it specific for the details of their specific distro, but otherwise they can just take directly from upstream the init script for system D.

47:29.000 --> 47:33.000
So it kind of like, it sort of makes that process easier for those guys.

47:33.000 --> 47:39.000
Not only that, but from that standpoint, system D is a whole lot better documented than Upstart when it comes to that type of thing.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Yeah.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
Oh, yes.

47:41.000 --> 47:51.000
Well, okay, I think you guys are shortchanging the benefits of deployment in the field and how many people that end up working with that and then document stuff about it and blog about it and know how to work with it.

47:51.000 --> 48:03.000
Because the advantages to that in IT are huge. I mean, that's why Windows gets such a big deployment. So Upstart definitely has the leg up in terms of on the ground, already out deployed, people working with it and know how to use it.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Oh, there's just documentation.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
System D, doesn't it?

48:07.000 --> 48:14.000
Well, I'd say system D will get that advantage once it's rolled out into newer versions of Red Hat and SUSE and such.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Yeah, that's true. That's true.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Well, fine, fine, fine.

48:18.000 --> 48:25.000
There's also one thing for the encoding, for the binary logging, everything is encoded anyway.

48:25.000 --> 48:32.000
You have a character set, which is UTF-8 or ISO whatnot, or little Indian and big Indian when it comes to the CPU.

48:32.000 --> 48:38.000
It's all just the encodings. Even the logs have to be deciphered by their encoding.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Okay.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
They can export it out to normal ASCII text.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
Exactly.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Can I just say something real quick?

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Yeah, go ahead.

48:45.000 --> 48:52.000
I just want to say that I've really had no problems with Upstart. I mean, I run Ubuntu on my server.

48:52.000 --> 48:59.000
Upstart's been pretty good. I mean, it's really easy to just type in the commands, but it's also easy to do that with system D.

48:59.000 --> 49:09.000
The thing that I think is going to happen is Upstart's kind of going to be left in the dust because system D is more of the –

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
I believe it came out of the Fedora project. Is that correct?

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
Yeah, Fedora, yeah.

49:14.000 --> 49:21.000
Yeah, yeah. So usually, PulseAudio came out of there as well, I think, right?

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
A lot of things. Network Manager, LibVert, a lot of things that come out of it, yeah.

49:25.000 --> 49:31.000
So I think that overall, this is going to become the standard in the long term.

49:31.000 --> 49:36.000
I think Upstart is just what people are using right now, and like I said, I don't have a problem with it.

49:36.000 --> 49:47.000
It's just that I just don't know – once system D evolves and becomes more stable and all this stuff and gets more features and everything like that,

49:47.000 --> 49:56.000
down the road, I think that people are going to be switching to system D simply because it's going to be where everyone's going.

49:56.000 --> 50:08.000
That could well happen. I mean, for us, we've got 1204 LTS out, and we've got however many years left on that because it's got five years of support.

50:08.000 --> 50:16.000
And then there's all the servers out there that have Ubuntu on, all the cloud deployments that are Ubuntu-based that have Upstart on them.

50:16.000 --> 50:28.000
I would hate to see those bit rot and not get any love, but the fact is that with the next release of Ubuntu, it's going to be another LTS.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
So there's going to be another five years of maintenance of Upstart.

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
I think we should be able to choose our voice, and I don't know how hard it is on the technical side.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
I mean, you know what I'm saying?

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
I think it's pretty hard to do those out.

50:40.000 --> 50:51.000
Yeah, well, the interesting thing about Upstart, if you're on about Ubuntu derivatives, so we're talking about Linux Mint and Xeon and all these other ones.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
I mean, they ship with Upstart.

50:54.000 --> 51:04.000
But the thing is, if the default desktop environment is actually GNOME 3, it has a parent because it's part of the dependencies.

51:04.000 --> 51:10.000
It does actually use SystemD, so Upstart kicks in, and then it starts up SystemD.

51:10.000 --> 51:25.000
Well, it's not very efficient, so if you want to use a different desktop environment that's not Unity, and all these other desktop environments are actually using SystemD,

51:25.000 --> 51:31.000
basically, Ubuntu starts up, uses Upstart, and then you need to use a parent.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
Yeah, good point.

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
Good point about the GNOME point, too, because I think the official desktop of Debian is still GNOME, right?

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
And SystemD is becoming a dependency.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
GNOME is becoming dependent on SystemD, and that's only continuing, right?

51:45.000 --> 51:51.000
That's starting in 3.10 and not impossible to avoid now, but starting in 3.12, it looks like it could be.

51:51.000 --> 51:55.000
Literally, a dependency of GNOME 3.12 could be SystemD.

51:55.000 --> 52:02.000
Yeah, well, if you use the PPA to install GNOME 3.10, it actually installs dependencies for SystemD.

52:02.000 --> 52:10.000
Now, if I could just make a prediction, I think Debian, because they tend to go along with the standards, will probably eventually go with SystemD.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
Yeah, that would be interesting to see. I'm not sure.

52:13.000 --> 52:19.000
A lot of people are always going with Upstart just because they didn't have an option back when it was created.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
I'm going to do a poll.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
SystemD wasn't around yet. They didn't have a choice.

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
Let's do a poll, and I'll embed it in the show notes too, so the people on the download audience.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Yeah, I'll do a straw poll.

52:28.000 --> 52:34.000
Which way, let's see, Debian's Choice, I'll call it Debian's Choice, okay?

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
There's two options, Upstart or SystemD, and I'll let everybody vote.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
I wanted to sort of pick up on something that Mollusk was talking about.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
This was sort of the point I was going to wrap up this topic, so then we'll read some email and then we'll run.

52:45.000 --> 52:54.000
But I think it's unavoidable that not only does SystemD have multiple distro momentum now,

52:54.000 --> 53:03.000
but Lenart and Remy and other people involved are extremely passionate about it, and it is their main focus.

53:03.000 --> 53:08.000
It is all they are working on in a grand scheme of things.

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
Whereas Upstart is a component of the Ubuntu distribution.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
It is a feature, it is an important feature, but it is only an aspect of that distribution,

53:18.000 --> 53:23.000
where SystemD is these guys' life, and they go out to every conference and they promote it,

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
they answer questions, they make posts about it, they live and breathe it, they are continually evolving it,

53:27.000 --> 53:32.000
they do frequent releases, they engage outside input and make changes based on that.

53:32.000 --> 53:40.000
Not always, sometimes they don't, but it is sort of like what my argument has been against Gnome and Unity in a sense too,

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
Unity is awesome and it is a great feature and it is one of my favorite Linux desktops,

53:44.000 --> 53:49.000
but the reality is the Gnome projects and the KDE projects, all they do are their desktops.

53:49.000 --> 53:55.000
That is all they do, that is their only job where it is not just a feature or a package in their distribution.

53:55.000 --> 54:03.000
And when you have that kind of passion and momentum and focus and multi-distro and quote-unquote industry buy-in on something,

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
it seems pretty risky to go against the tide.

54:06.000 --> 54:12.000
Yeah, I think SystemD is definitely the future. I think Upstart was an easy answer early on,

54:12.000 --> 54:22.000
but just like everything else in the Linux community over the years, we all make patches, we all make remedies,

54:22.000 --> 54:31.000
we all make things to make the short term better, but I think overall SystemD is good for Linux.

54:31.000 --> 54:39.000
I really enjoy init scripts and being able to make specific scripts to what I need it to do,

54:39.000 --> 54:49.000
but overall I think that SystemD is going to help a lot because it makes things a lot easier and we are still in early days here.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Yeah, totally.

54:51.000 --> 55:01.000
One thing I come across when I install, like go for a very basic Debian installation or if I want to install Arch,

55:01.000 --> 55:09.000
isn't one of those things when you are doing a very basic installation is during the installation you have the choice to set things up like that

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
where you could choose the init manager or whatever?

55:12.000 --> 55:19.000
Yeah, you can do that with Gen2, but Gen2 almost forces OpenRC on you, so I don't think it matters.

55:19.000 --> 55:27.000
So I guess at the end of the day, if we move forward and we look at where things are going to take us,

55:27.000 --> 55:33.000
SystemD is still not as fully mature as Upstart, and I'll give you what I mean in that sense.

55:33.000 --> 55:39.000
In an Ubuntu box, if you really screw the pooch and you need to reboot into a rescue mode,

55:39.000 --> 55:44.000
that rescue mode you go into is Upstart aware.

55:44.000 --> 55:51.000
It can look at your system and communicate to the Upstart system and pull out bits of information it needs to rescue your system, right?

55:51.000 --> 55:57.000
That is a very nice complete user end feature that works great for users and system admins and developers.

55:57.000 --> 56:04.000
It is a very handy feature and it is the result of something that has multiple years of production where you build stuff around it.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
SystemD is not there yet.

56:06.000 --> 56:09.000
There's not tools that fully take advantage of the API.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
There's not things that expose certain functionality.

56:11.000 --> 56:16.000
SystemD has the ability to fully log everything that happens on your system if it's an EFI box.

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
It doesn't require it, but if you have an EFI BIOS and it wants to talk to SystemD,

56:20.000 --> 56:26.000
it can literally time how long it took for you to boot at the BIOS screen all the way up from the bootloader to the kernel to your desktop.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
It can pull metrics and diagnose all of that.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
It is a full end system, right?

56:30.000 --> 56:36.000
That's really cool and fancy, but there's nothing yet really fully built to expose any of that to the end user.

56:36.000 --> 56:42.000
Well, the thing is SystemD is widely used within the community.

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
It's used by pretty much every distro.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
There's only two distros that don't use it.

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
I mean, it's Ubuntu-based distros and Chrome OS.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
Saying Ubuntu-based distros doesn't account for much.

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
It accounts for a significant chunk of all the people who happen to run Linux.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
It's a massive number of people.

57:03.000 --> 57:08.000
But Red Hat's worth a few billion, so if they think that Upstart's not worth using...

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Well, my dad's bigger than your dad.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
I don't think that really makes a difference.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
These technical arguments can only go so far.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
There's a 1.3 billion company.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
It doesn't matter about the price.

57:24.000 --> 57:32.000
I think Poby makes a fair point, though, is that it is hard sometimes to totally wrap your head around the fact that it is a huge...

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
It is way bigger than I think any of us fully realize, because at least my metrics tell me that.

57:36.000 --> 57:42.000
And they tell me that Ubuntu still has more market share than the other three distros next to it combined.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Combined, yeah.

57:43.000 --> 57:50.000
I just wanted to point out that at the end of the day, especially with Debian considering this,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I think it's really just going to come down to two choices.

57:52.000 --> 57:58.000
Either they're going to find a way to work out the CLA and go with Ubuntu's thing,

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
or they're just going to go and go to their next choice down and just look at SystemD.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
At the end of the day, I still want init scripts.

58:05.000 --> 58:15.000
Now, my question is, if they were to go with SystemD, what are they going to do about, let's say, their variants based on the BSD or the herd kernels?

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Right, that's the problem.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
This is what no one's really touching on.

58:19.000 --> 58:24.000
Everybody's going at this from an emotional point of view, and that's wrong.

58:24.000 --> 58:31.000
All this passionate nonsense aside, factually speaking, they want something established and stable.

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
Which one is that?

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
I'm starting to have a leg there because it's deployed and it supports multiple kernels.

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
And it also adheres a little more closely to that overall Unix philosophy.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Exactly.

58:41.000 --> 58:47.000
And so that's the whole point of it is that when you vacuum pack all the emotional hot air out of this

58:47.000 --> 58:53.000
and really look at it logically for what Debian's goals are, not what your goals are, but what Debian's goals are as a project,

58:53.000 --> 58:59.000
I think that they're definitely, definitely going to go with what makes sense from a stability point of view.

58:59.000 --> 59:06.000
Now, five years down the road, they may completely 180 on that, but at this point, it will not be SystemD for Debian, I promise you.

59:06.000 --> 59:15.000
And you also have to, even understandably, got to figure maybe there's a little pressure indirectly or directly, probably indirectly,

59:15.000 --> 59:25.000
to have at least a very serious consideration as to how it affects Ubuntu since they're based on Ubuntu.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
And that's just one quarter or even an eighth of the pie.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
That's not even all of it, but it's a big chunk of the pie.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
Now, that being said, personally, on my own machines, I do prefer SystemD.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I like what they're doing. I like where they're going. I think it's awesome.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Yeah, I do too. I like it too.

59:38.000 --> 59:44.000
But again, taking my own emotion out of it and looking at it logically, there's no question Debian's not going to go with SystemD.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
They're going to go with Upstart. I know that for a fact.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
I'm wrong on some things, but I'm right on others.

59:49.000 --> 59:57.000
My track record on the show has been reasonable, so I'm going to say I'm excluding my monkey suit thing, but that put aside.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So right now, the audience is voting in 82%, Matt, think it's going to go SystemD.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Oh, yeah. They're voting with their heart, Matt, with their heart.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Yeah, I don't have one, so I win, right?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I will embed this into the show notes, so those of you on the podcast, if you want to go vote, go to episode 12 of the unplugged program and scroll down the show notes.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
We'll vote in there and we'll cover it on the follow-up. We'll see what happens.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
All right, Matt. Well, I thought maybe before we ran, we could solve a problem for Jim.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So Jim wrote into the show, and he's hunting for a replacement for Ubuntu 10.04.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Yeah, 10.04.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:41.000
He says, I was wondering if you could give me some advice on choosing a distro to replace my Ubuntu 10.04 installation since it's no longer supported.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I figured I should upgrade. However, I'm not a big fan of Unity.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I wonder how he knows that.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000
He says, I've been fat dumb and very happy with Ubuntu 10.04.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I love that he's just been hanging out forever on this old version.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
He says, it's for me the perfect distro.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I am hooked on having a top panel to which I add a ton of launchers.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I love Nautilus. I like the long-term support from Canonical and a community support.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I also like the wide range of software available for Ubuntu.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
He said he tried Unity and I really don't like it.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
All right, so he tried it.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Okay, that's all we say. That's all we ask.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
It does not increase my productivity.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I am using a desktop, not a smartphone or a Mac.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Wow, I didn't read this far.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Maybe I need to give it more time.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
This is unfair to Unity. After all, Unity is actually an impressive software, but why use it on a desktop?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I have also tried Ubuntu 12.04 in fallback mode.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
However, a few things I use, a lot seems broken.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Mint 13, mate, seems like the best fit for me.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
My hesitation is that Mint installs with a lot of extra stuff I don't want or need.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Anyway, I'll likely go with Mint 13, mate, unless you guys give me a good suggestion.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
He said, by the way, he left Windows when Vista came out.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Oh, yeah.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Started with Firefox, switched to Thunderbird Open Office,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
and then he made the jump to Linux after he'd made the transition to all that stuff.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
That's the recipe. That's how you do it, Jim.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Good work, Jim.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
You know what? Mint mate is probably a pretty good idea.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Yes, that's where I would go. I'd say Mint mate is fine.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Even sentiment is another option.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
What do you think about XFCE?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I would say probably mate is going to be more his speed.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
XFCE is awesome, but it is different.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
While visually it has a lot of similarities, there are some core differences.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I think that mate is probably going to be more what he's looking for coming from where he's coming from.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
As far as the extra stuff is installed,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
unless you have a really small hard drive, I don't think you care.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
It's not like anything is running in the background.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
He was a little more worried about future security vulnerabilities,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
but as long as you stick with the updates.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Okay, let me throw this one at you.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Just a curveball because we haven't talked about it much.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Sure.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
It's been rebooted months ago, the Ubuntu GNOME edition.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
The thing is, starting in GNOME 3.8, they have the classic mode.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I don't think they call it that.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
It is a two-panel GNOME 2.0-ish setup, but it's based on GTK 3.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
It takes advantage of the newer GNOME applications and things like that.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000
It's one foot in the new stuff, and it's one foot in maybe your wang into the old stuff.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
That GNOME Ubuntu edition could be,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
but I think his instinct with Mint and Mate edition,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
like Matt said, is probably the way to go.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I think it's the way to go.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
He's got a butt groove in his chair, and he's really happy with that groove.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
He's not necessarily wanting the latest and greatest.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
He's just kind of forced into an upgrade.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I think that's where he's going to be happiest.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
One last thing.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Cheeseburg emailed into the show on the whole topic.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
He was one of the people that chimed in about the state of Linux news,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and then now he also joined us in the IRC, so he reminded me today.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
He was traveling, I think he was in Japan,

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
and he saw a good old-fashioned print magazine called PointLinux.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
He heard about it over there.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I can't remember the details of it.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Somebody emailed in about PointLinux.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Anyways, Cheeseburg reminds me of PointLinux.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
It's a distribution that aims to combine the power of Debian

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
with the productivity of Mate or the GNOME 2 desktop environment.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So it is essentially it's Debian under the hood with Mate on top of it.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Now, the reason why I think PointLinux could be a good –

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
one nice thing about it is – what was he on?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Ubuntu 10.04, I think.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
10.04.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
All right, so obviously Jim is not a man who likes to reinstall very often.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And the problem with Mint is you got to reload to go to the next release every time.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
True, true, true, true.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Whereas PointLinux being based on Debian,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
you're going to get updates and you're just going to roll with that for a long time.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
He just rolls.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
That's a really good point.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I like that.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Because of the fact that he likes a comfortable place to be,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
he has more control over those updates versus being having to go full upgrade.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
That's a good point.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I haven't tried this one myself, but both Cheeseburg and –

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
and we got an email about somebody who was traveling in Japan,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I don't know if that was Cheeseburg,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
who also saw it deployed there and thought it was awesome.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So there you have it.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
There you go.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I think it would be worth grabbing a pen drive

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
and just DD that sucker up in there and just see how that runs.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Totally.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
All right, Matt.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Well, as we prepare to – whoa, hi there.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Hi.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Hello.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
As we prepare to wrap up, the music just like kicks in.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
It's like I guess it's playing us out like we're on the Oscars here, Matt.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Get your award and get off stage, clown.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Listen, now we'd love to have you join us live for Linux Unplugged.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
You can go over to jblive.tv.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
We're live at 2 p.m. Pacific.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
And of course go to jupiterbroadcasting.com.calendar

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
because the time zone changed.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
That daylight savings thing is about to hit us.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So prepare yourselves over at jupiterbroadcasting.com.calendar.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
While you're visiting us live, you can also get info to join our Mumble Room

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
so you can hang out and participate in the conversation.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
A big thanks to everybody who joined us live in the IRC

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
and a big thanks to the folks in the Mumble Room.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
We'd love to see you live here next week, but you can also email us.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Just hit the contact link at the top of the Jupiter Broadcasting website.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Hey, Matt, I got an okay from the lead dev of OwnCloud

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
to join us on Sunday to talk about OwnCloud 6.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Sweet.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Good stuff.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I know.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Sounds good.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
All right, everyone.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:16.000
We'll see you right back here next week.
