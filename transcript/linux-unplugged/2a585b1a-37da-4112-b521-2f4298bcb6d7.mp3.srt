1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Now that Wimpy's here, and he's got an audio setup working, and Popey's here, right?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,760
Popey, you still here?

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,760
Or did you leave?

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,760
What an asshole.

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,760
Maybe.

6
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,760
Oh, okay.

7
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,320
So, I saw some shenanigans on Google+.

8
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,760
I don't know if you guys are familiar with this.

9
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,920
It's a super-secret social network that apparently nobody knows about.

10
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,920
Yeah, that's the first town I had.

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,920
Yeah, that's what I've told.

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,320
Yeah, there's no one on it.

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,240
But just some guy on there, Alan something or other, Pope something or other, posted

14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,840
a link about a super-retro installer that reminded me of the good old days.

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,160
And then I dug a little deeper, and I discovered there is a brand new edition of Ubuntu Mate

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,400
in the works, but it's not based on like 1504 or some shenanigans like that.

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,420
No, friends, it's based on 1404.

18
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:47,120
What the heck's going on here, guys?

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
People want it.

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
It's as simple as that.

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,780
Just giving them what they need.

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,880
Since we started this, the number one thing that everyone's been asking for is when is

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,360
there going to be an LTS version.

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,480
People want to install it and forget about it.

25
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
Set it and forget it.

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,440
And then after that, it'll be 1004, then 804, then 606 Mate edition.

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,640
Wait, isn't 804 already basically Mate?

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
Yeah.

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
That's interesting.

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,240
So I guess, boy, huh?

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
Look at that.

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
What's wrong with this picture?

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,200
It sounds like you're listening to your users.

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I know.

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
I know.

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
I actually pay attention to what they say.

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Well, actually, yeah.

38
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I was listening to the user, the guy who comes in and says, I would like 1404.

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
That guy?

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
We're making a distro just for him.

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
No, that's awesome.

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Thousands of people would have asked for this.

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
I'm kidding.

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
No, that's good, though.

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,840
I think it also shows that people are all in on the LTS model, which is-

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Yeah, it really does.

47
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
Exactly.

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,720
Especially on Ubuntu, that's what wins.

49
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,360
But actually, 1404 is quite an evolution on 1410.

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,560
So I think this 1404 release is going to be what 1410 should have been, a lot of new features

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
and a lot of fixes.

52
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Really?

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,600
So in some ways, it's more of a newer version?

54
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,200
It is a newer version.

55
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,000
So for example, in the 1404 version, there's indicator support.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,680
So you can add indicators in there now.

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,060
And we've pulled in all the latest Mate packages from Debbie and Jesse.

58
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,760
So there's a number of updates there.

59
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,160
And then I've been working with all the guys from the Accessible Computing Foundation.

60
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,040
And we have fixed everything that they've reported that didn't work with regards to

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
accessibility.

62
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,120
So for them, this is a big deal.

63
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
This is freaking brilliant.

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Yeah, yeah.

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
I like it.

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
It seems backwards.

67
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
And I think it's better.

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,480
Yeah, it is backwards in a sense.

69
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
I'm good with it.

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
And you know what else?

71
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,920
Like the Mate desktop environment is perfect for something you can set and forget for a

72
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
long time.

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,440
Because it's very much like of a time that is sort of already established, right?

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,540
So it's like perfect for that.

75
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,640
I think it's the coolest thing.

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,600
And I've just come back from a weekend in Germany where I've been at the X2GO gathering,

77
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,400
where the Mate desktop is very popular amongst them for deployment of remote terminal services.

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Oh, really?

79
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Boy, I've been wanting to do a segment on X2GO for a little while now.

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,520
Well, okay.

81
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,000
If you look at X2GO, there's a couple of new features.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,320
They've got this new layer called telekinesis.

83
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,240
And then they've developed this mTelePlayer.

84
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,780
And that is stonking.

85
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,760
So this is a tool that's been developed for doing real time streaming of audio and video

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,840
through the remote terminal services.

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:36,360
And the demo I saw this weekend was a dual screen with full 4K video streaming over a

88
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,120
remote terminal desktop.

89
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
And it was stunning.

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Wow.

91
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
That is slick.

92
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Going to check it out.

93
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Yeah.

94
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,660
And this has been developed because there's a company that's trying to develop some sort

95
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:54,400
of set top box type devices for use in China for delivering streaming video services.

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,800
And they're doing it by bringing the whole desktop application to the client rather than

97
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,560
just the streaming video.

98
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,840
That's going to be exciting.

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,000
I've played with some of that stuff.

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,360
And it works surprisingly well even a few years ago.

101
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Yeah.

102
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,640
Well, it's hot rocking now.

103
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
I'm really impressed.

104
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,480
I didn't know much about it until this weekend.

105
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,160
And I came away thinking, yeah, this is something I really need to get more involved in.

106
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,040
So I've already started adding some integration pieces for X2Go into Marte.

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,320
All right.

108
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,880
Wimpy, just before you wrap up, Chris, there's a question in the IRC.

109
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,200
One of the JB Live listeners is asking, can you turn a standard Ubuntu 14.04 install with

110
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,440
a PPA into a Marte 14.04, do you think?

111
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
You can.

112
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,240
And there's a blog article I posted on the Ubuntu Marte website that explains how to

113
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
do it.

114
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Boom.

115
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Nice.

116
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Yeah.

117
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
That's exciting.

118
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
I think it's almost new.

119
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
It's not as good as the real thing, though.

120
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
Wait for the ISO.

121
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
It's coming out at the weekend.

122
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
That's what you want to use.

123
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,440
Boy, isn't it interesting how the Mateo edition, in a way, is sort of eschewing so much of

124
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,960
the trendy, like, it's different.

125
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,080
It's pushing it forward and introducing a lot of new stuff and making users happy.

126
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,680
But it's not chasing the shiny, right?

127
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,800
It's a different kind of pushing it forward.

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,480
And it's really cool to see it.

129
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,440
So the LTS makes so much sense in that context.

130
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
I think that's really exciting.

131
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,120
It really appeals to me.

132
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
I like it.

133
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
Yeah.

134
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
That's exactly it.

135
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
I'm thinking Skype machines.

136
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,040
You want to install the 14.04 version because you know how you like to wait a couple of

137
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,960
months for all the bugs to get wrangled out.

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
I do.

139
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,640
Well, curiously, it's that backstep to 14.04 that's got all the stability and fixes in

140
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,920
it that you'll be waiting for.

141
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,400
So that's the one you want to install.

142
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Nice.

143
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Yeah, I'll check that out.

144
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,920
14.04 install, just because it's going to get, like, hardware enablements for a while

145
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,840
and I mean, so that's awesome.

146
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,800
It's brilliant for running Steam as well.

147
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Nice.

148
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Nice.

149
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Yeah.

150
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,400
Or I was actually thinking it's probably the perfect Skype and Mumble rig always.

151
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Yes.

152
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Yeah.

153
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,520
That's what I'm using exactly that now, 14.04 Ubuntu MATE with Mumble.

154
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
It all works fine.

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
I have a random question.

156
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,320
Do you guys know of any, we've been playing with a couple of different packages, VSXU,

157
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,920
I think is one of them, something like that.

158
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,880
I'm looking for something that will monitor your default line in and do a full screen

159
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,520
real time, like, waveform visualizer.

160
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,160
Almost like, you know, like the old classic Winamp or iTunes plug-ins.

161
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,380
Maybe not something as gaudy.

162
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,380
Maybe something that's just a straightforward waveform.

163
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,380
So like right now in this show, we have the chat room up on the screen, but from time

164
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,740
to time, we might want to have a show that's not live.

165
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,200
So we wouldn't have a chat room to put up there, so we were thinking, but it's an audio

166
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,740
only show, it would be neat to have the waveform as we talk and I'd love to have a Linux box

167
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,780
that just has whatever is coming in on the default in, visualized, that I can then capture

168
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,480
and put that into our video recording.

169
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,440
I believe there is, and I will look at that while the show is going on.

170
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Cool.

171
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Yeah.

172
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Maybe you mentioned the post-show or something, because I've looked at a few of them and like

173
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,760
we really need something that would be kind of full screen, something that's attractive

174
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,340
and something that doesn't require, like a lot of them I looked at will play your music

175
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:13,440
collection or things like that.

176
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by deep philosophical

177
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
discussions.

178
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,680
I don't even know what that means, but I'm going to go with it.

179
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
My name is Chris.

180
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,880
And my name is Matt.

181
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,480
I guess it'd be philosophical discussions.

182
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
I was trying to come up with a new term and I had nothing, Matt.

183
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Nothing.

184
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,640
You were kind of morphing with the words.

185
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
I felt it though.

186
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,000
That's what I get for doing a cold open.

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,800
Well, 65, episode 65, and we've got a big show.

188
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,040
We got some follow up on the OpenSUSE review, plus some new news and developments there.

189
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,760
Producer Eric, he's become like our local OpenSUSE advocate.

190
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
He's been running it.

191
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,040
He's switched to Tumbleweed.

192
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,200
He's even rolling the good stuff now.

193
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,000
And he's got some follow up notes from our review, so we'll cover that.

194
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,280
There's a new device, an open source hardware device that promises to replace all password

195
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
managers.

196
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,720
I think we can talk about that a little bit.

197
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:08,040
And then one of our brothers has fallen, one of our fellow podcasts is coming to an end.

198
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,240
And we'll spend a little time talking about that.

199
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,400
And maybe what the root, the cause of that, and if it's a problem that's going to spread.

200
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
We'll discuss that in the show today too.

201
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
Plus lots of feedback, Matt.

202
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,720
So man, we got a whole big show.

203
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,120
I got like 15 tabs open right now.

204
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
You know what I need, Matt?

205
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,680
I need something like tab groups.

206
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,600
Just imagine if I could group all of my tabs together.

207
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,040
Too bad Chrome doesn't support that, huh?

208
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
That's really a shame.

209
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,800
I was waiting for that to dig in.

210
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,960
I guess there's just no way to do that.

211
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Anyways.

212
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Oh, boy.

213
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Hey, mumble room.

214
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
How are you guys doing?

215
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,960
You know, I was actually waiting for that discussion to happen at some point, ever since

216
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
I became a producer.

217
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
I don't know.

218
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Is that something Firefox does?

219
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Oh, that's good to know.

220
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
Yeah.

221
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Yeah.

222
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,080
Well, that was a heated discussion we had on the pre-show where the entire mumble room

223
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,840
ganged up on me and tried to get me to switch to Firefox.

224
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,960
But I believe I emerged unswitched, although still considering.

225
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
I have tried it before.

226
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
I may try it again.

227
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
You never know.

228
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,360
Like sometimes I walk away and I'm like, I'm never switching.

229
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,000
And then a couple of days go by and you know, I'm going to switch.

230
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,320
I'll take a challenge.

231
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:24,560
So if you're inspired to take a Firefox challenge, you know what, all right, all right.

232
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
I'll do it.

233
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
I'll take it.

234
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
I'll take it.

235
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I'll take it.

236
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
I'll take it.

237
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
I'll take it.

238
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
I'll take it.

239
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
You just convinced yourself.

240
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Yeah, I just did.

241
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
I just, I literally.

242
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
If you guys are wondering what the pool's going to be for how long, how many days he

243
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
does this, I'll start one later.

244
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Yes, I just flip flopped right here on air.

245
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
All right, Popeye, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going in with you, Popeye.

246
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,880
I'm going to take, starting tonight, I'm going to start taking the Firefox challenge.

247
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,200
So if anybody out there at home is listening and is ready to switch back to Firefox or

248
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,160
switch to Firefox from something, maybe it's Chrome, maybe it's Internet Explorer.

249
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,360
I'm going to start tonight.

250
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,880
So start with me and we'll see if we make it to the next Linux unplug.

251
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,260
That's my benchmark.

252
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,840
And I'll tell you upfront, I'm concerned about UI leginess, inadequate syncing, and a lack

253
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,880
of appropriate markdown extensions, primarily template, which is the name of the extension,

254
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,600
which is extremely hard to Google when the template extension is called template.

255
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,920
Anyways, you know what the most important thing is, Chris, is that as long as you can

256
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,280
go ahead and watch Netflix in it without any problems, you're golden.

257
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Oh wait, that's right.

258
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
You can't.

259
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,000
And by the way, if I have problems with Firefox, the answer coming back is, well, you should

260
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,200
submit a bug is not going to be acceptable when there's an alternative that does the

261
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
things.

262
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,880
Anyways, moving on from that, we'll do a, we'll do follow up in next week's episode.

263
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,600
And so if anybody out there wants to take the Firefox challenge with me, let's start

264
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
tonight.

265
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,880
In the meantime, and Popeye, how long are you going to do it for?

266
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,200
Are you going to go try to make it till next week or are you just going to keep going as

267
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
long as possible?

268
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,640
I'll, I'll try and last longer than you.

269
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,480
Let's have a little competition, shall we?

270
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
You know, so wait a minute.

271
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Okay.

272
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Are you, are you going to try to make, okay.

273
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
All right.

274
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Fine.

275
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Popey.

276
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
No, wait, no, I can't do it.

277
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
I can't do it.

278
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Cause I have show prep stuff that you don't have to do.

279
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
You don't have to worry about the markdown stuff like I worry about.

280
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
All right.

281
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,760
I'll tell you what, I'm going to try to get it to next week.

282
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,480
Show prep is going to take longer and I have a lot of shows.

283
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,480
All right.

284
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,520
I'll get to it till next week and then if I can keep going, I'll be like Kramer driving

285
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
on empty.

286
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,040
I'll keep on going as long as I possibly can until I run out of fuel in the, in the Firefox

287
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
tank.

288
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
I'll check it on you.

289
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
Okay.

290
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
And rotten corpse.

291
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
You're going to take a challenge too.

292
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Yeah.

293
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
I'll take the operium challenge.

294
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Okay.

295
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
You know what?

296
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,720
I'm younger than all of you.

297
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,920
I better stamina.

298
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,240
So I will try to last the longest on the Firefox.

299
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,480
What are you on right now?

300
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
I'm on Chrome of course.

301
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Okay.

302
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Good.

303
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
All right.

304
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Okay.

305
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Good.

306
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
All right.

307
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,800
So we've got, we've got, we've got a, we've got a genuine masters of our own domain competition

308
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
here.

309
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
I like.

310
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Oh hell I'll join.

311
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,280
Ooh, can you install Firefox on openSUSE so they got a repo for that, Eric?

312
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
Don't need a repo.

313
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
It's in the main.

314
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,280
Oh, is that how that works?

315
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
All right.

316
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,840
Uh, so David from Alabama writes in and uh, he says, save me from unity.

317
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Sorry guys.

318
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,560
For those of you who love unity, don't take offense, but he'll, he, he breaks it down

319
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
here.

320
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
He says, what's up guys?

321
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,680
I love all the JB shows, especially last foe and unplugged.

322
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
I'm a football coach.

323
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,760
And he says, yes, insert your dumb jock joke here.

324
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
Hey, jocks are allowed in Linux.

325
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Just us.

326
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
It's fine.

327
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,600
I mean, we might just resent you a little bit, but your totes allowed.

328
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Uh, no, I kid.

329
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,920
Uh, but really, he says, I like Linux and I listen to you guys on my way to work on

330
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,440
my Nexus 5.

331
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,080
Even though a lot of what you guys talk about tends to be over my head.

332
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
I learn a lot.

333
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,000
I noticed that you said Borderlands 2 and Borderlands the pre-sequel have come to Linux.

334
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,520
So I downloaded both on my Ubuntu 14.04 box.

335
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,440
I have the Nvidia proprietary drivers installed and my hardware specs are pretty good.

336
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,800
I got a GTX 750 TI.

337
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,540
It's got an AMD FX 8320 CPU.

338
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,720
Everything seems groovy under Ubuntu, but he's just, he's not liking Unity.

339
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,240
It's not working for him.

340
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,340
He says, I just don't find it aesthetically pleasing for myself.

341
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,380
So I loaded Gnome.

342
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,800
I like it a lot, but when he plays games in full screen in Gnome, he notices there's like

343
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,260
a screen tearing effect.

344
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,040
He said under Unity, he used compass settings manager to disable full screen rendering or

345
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,360
what's it called, the unidirectional, unredirected full screen applications is what the checkbox

346
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,980
is called in compass manager.

347
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,160
So he did that for Unity, but now there's no such setting under Gnome.

348
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,260
So I'm not totally sure that the screen tearing he's seen under Gnome is due to any compositing,

349
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,240
but I thought maybe we could punt it to the mumble room.

350
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,660
Maybe there's been some folks in here that have trouble shot this kind of stuff.

351
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,800
Any ideas for what could be causing screen tearing on his 3D games?

352
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,840
Well, by chance, did he say what kind of game it was?

353
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Borderlands.

354
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
I'm assuming it's Borderlands.

355
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,520
And it's an Nvidia graphics card with the proprietary driver.

356
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,680
And I was wondering if it could be a V-Sync issue.

357
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
Me too.

358
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
It sounds like it.

359
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
Yeah.

360
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,200
Sorry, this cropped up on the Ubuntu Marte community a couple of days ago and somebody

361
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,520
actually found a fix for it.

362
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,200
So if you give me a minute, I'll go and find the solution.

363
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,520
There's a similar problem in XFCE with its compositor turned on, causes a lot of screen

364
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
tearing.

365
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,520
You can get rid of that by using Compton, I believe it is.

366
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Yeah.

367
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:19,840
And I'm not positive because I've been essentially the same setup, Gnome 3, Nvidia graphics card.

368
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,200
I think mine's, I've tried it on a 600 series and a 700 series graphics card.

369
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,240
Full screen, Borderlands.

370
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,280
I don't have any tearing on my local screen.

371
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,440
I actually sometimes get tearing on capture because it's sending an interlaced signal

372
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
out.

373
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,560
But on my local LCD panel, no tearing.

374
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,280
And I cannot remember if V-Sync plays a role in this.

375
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,480
I seem to remember it does.

376
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,900
So if anybody has any suggestions too, you could also put it in the comment sections

377
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
for the feedback.

378
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,280
I'm reading the chat room right now.

379
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Floppy Bacon says GLX blank is the option.

380
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Check for that.

381
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,700
GLX V blank.

382
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Look for that.

383
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
So yeah.

384
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,520
And if you do find it, you can drop it in the chat room or if you're listening after

385
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,760
the fact in the subreddit.

386
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:07,360
I believe the Arch subreddit has something about that with graphics in particular.

387
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Okay.

388
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Yeah.

389
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,520
And I know like Cinnamon 2.4, which was just released last week, one of the things that

390
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,920
they enabled by default is when an application goes full screen, the compositor disabled

391
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
is disabled.

392
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,880
Kaywin does this as well.

393
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,000
My understanding is though Mudder does as well.

394
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,480
But I'm not sure.

395
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,680
And I have not noticed the problem myself.

396
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
Okay.

397
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,400
Next email comes in from Les.

398
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,920
So we just heard about a hardware woe.

399
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,120
Les wants to take the other track.

400
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,240
In fact, he thinks maybe we don't do this often enough.

401
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,920
He says, hey Chris, Matt in the mumble room, in a recent episode of Linux Unplugged, there

402
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,800
was discussion about a laptop that had a graphics issue when booting Linux.

403
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,040
Chris made a comment that he was disappointed these kinds of things are happening still.

404
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,360
I think as a Linux community, we beat ourselves up about this far too much.

405
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,880
Yes, there is occasional problems, but as a community, we focus on these problems, often

406
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,880
cite them as reasons why Linux is unsuccessful on the desktop even.

407
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,560
But to counter this, I wanted to mention my recent experience.

408
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,000
I bought a Samsung laptop.

409
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,120
I use it for testing and have had no problems installing Ubuntu, elementary, or even OpenBSD.

410
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,760
With the exception of a binary driver for Wi-Fi and OpenBSD, everything works out of

411
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,200
the box, including graphics and power management sleep mode.

412
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Last week though, I had the need for a Windows 7 system.

413
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,080
So as the laptop originally came with it, I installed a fresh copy of Windows 7.

414
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,120
After the install, the graphics were terrible and on inspection, Windows had failed to identify

415
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,240
nine items of hardware.

416
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,960
This included both the wired and wireless NICs.

417
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,960
I then had to spend a whole evening first trying to get my NIC working and then trying

418
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,480
to track down the drivers.

419
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,800
I had many hours of searching using Samsung's tool, only to find six of the nine drivers.

420
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,320
After many hours, I finally got it all working using another detection tool from Intel that

421
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,920
identified some of my chipset.

422
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,080
Then when the system finally restarted after installing everything, it all ended with the

423
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,640
blue screen of death loop.

424
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,240
At that point, I gave up and just installed Ubuntu Mate edition, which of course worked

425
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
perfectly.

426
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
Sorry for the long story.

427
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,240
But I think it's important that we recognize it's far worse than other platforms and maybe

428
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,400
we should focus on the positives a bit more.

429
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,240
Linux hardware detection is pretty good.

430
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,800
I remember the days of Red Hat 4.x.

431
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,160
Keep up the great work and stay positive, Les.

432
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Isn't he right?

433
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
He's really right.

434
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
Yeah, I would agree.

435
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
I would definitely agree.

436
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
It's gotten so much better.

437
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,760
And then out of the box, the only system that is better than hardware detection out of the

438
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,480
box is OS X because you can only install it on Macs.

439
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,120
But as soon as you try to put it on anything else, it is a full-fledged train wreck.

440
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,840
And Windows is just as bad.

441
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,920
You get lucky with the Windows box if your NIC's detected and it's semi-older hardware,

442
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,800
like it's in that Windows sweet spot, it'll pull down a lot of it, but nothing matches

443
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Linux with the diversity.

444
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Right?

445
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
I mean, nothing.

446
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
That's true.

447
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,840
I mean, I remember back in the repair days, you always had that spare NIC that you kept

448
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,760
on hand so that when you repaired someone's computer and you knew you were going to have

449
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,200
to chase down those drivers, you had a means of connecting to the internet to do so.

450
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,640
That was a definite interesting time.

451
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
And yeah, Linux really solves those problems.

452
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,080
I mean, legacy peripherals are even a better example.

453
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,600
Derek Devlin, do you suppose that we sometimes focus on the negative stuff because we're

454
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
problem solvers?

455
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,320
We want to analyze the problem and try to fix it?

456
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Totally.

457
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,960
And I think this non-acceptance of something still missing or something not working is

458
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,640
what puts us in the position we are really.

459
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,840
And I think we actually should keep that mentality, is that we'll keep improving Linux.

460
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,800
But Windows folks, which stabilize, look, they're dying.

461
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,560
Eric, have you ever had that experience where you pull a drive from one Linux rig and move

462
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,440
it over to another machine and plug it in and it actually boots up?

463
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,040
Yes, I have.

464
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
It's brilliant.

465
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,920
It just automatically, the kernel knows what it's doing.

466
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,040
It detects the hardware, configures the machine for that hardware, and boom, you're done.

467
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,360
I actually, not exactly moving a drive from one machine to another, but using Clonezilla

468
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,400
to clone an entire disk from one disk to another.

469
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,440
And it just works.

470
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,400
It works better than Windows and a lot better than Mac.

471
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,040
Yeah, Windows will just blue screen if the controller changes too much.

472
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,040
And Wimpy, you've got some experience with moving the hard drives around to do an install,

473
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
right?

474
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,680
Yeah, I mean, I've got some really ancient hardware.

475
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,640
And back in the day, I used to install the operating system, I used to take the hard

476
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,200
disk out of a laptop that had no NICs and had no Wi-Fi and had no USB and put the disk

477
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,320
in a different machine, install Debian, then take the disk out, plug it into the laptop

478
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,280
and then boot and configure everything and install the desktop I wanted.

479
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,120
And I was doing that back in the late 1990s.

480
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,520
So it's been possible for a long, long time.

481
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,440
Yeah, it's just so cool.

482
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,280
It is, I think, one of the best aspects that Linux doesn't get credit for anymore.

483
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,400
And I think there was a time where the Roses were not as red, but it's pretty awesome and

484
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,220
something that really sells people when you show them, like, yeah, this USB thumbstick,

485
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,680
I can just boot your computer with this and everything just works.

486
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,440
And it just blows people's minds still.

487
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,400
All right, Aaron writes in, I like Aaron, I like the way he thinks, he says, I'd like

488
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,800
to hear more about your latest experience with ButterFS and why you switched to XFS.

489
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,640
Where's the love for good old Extended 4?

490
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:27,680
I'm running OpenSUSE a factory, soon to be Tumbleweed, and I was affected by the ButterFS

491
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,760
read-only snapshot bug after upgrading from kernel 3.16 to 3.17.

492
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,560
So for now, I've disabled snapshots by uninstalling Snapper and the Snapper Zipper plugin.

493
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,200
Thankfully, the damage seems to be limited to some corrupted snapshots.

494
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,360
Hopefully, when the bug is fixed, the snapshots can be re-enabled and my two dozen corrupted

495
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,080
snapshots can be deleted.

496
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,920
I don't want to go Nuke and Pave style, but if it's necessary, I may go back to Extended

497
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
4.

498
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,820
From there, I can at least upgrade to ButterFS when it becomes a little more stable.

499
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:02,520
So I want to talk about, over the weekend, I finally reloaded my Bonobo Extreme that

500
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,000
was the original install since our Arch Challenge, that I was pretty proud that I held that install

501
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,080
that long.

502
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,120
And it was really, really a great install.

503
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,080
The only problem was, I was totally out of storage space.

504
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,800
Like I couldn't install any more games, it even got to the point where I was having a

505
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,120
hard time, like I couldn't do any more VirtualBox images for demos for LAS, I couldn't install

506
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,120
some of the apps I wanted to install to demo on LAS, so it was actually starting to impact

507
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,240
show production.

508
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,920
So when I really realized I was hitting that phase of the install, I decided to Nuke it.

509
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,920
And I used Angros, Antaragos, Antardos to install it.

510
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,780
And it's been rocking.

511
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,800
And I decided to go this time around, XFS instead of ButterFS.

512
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,000
Even though I was so tempted, you guys, I was so tempted.

513
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,040
But it was really the discussion that we had had here in the Mumble Room at some point,

514
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,560
where so many people were really advocating XFS, that I decided to pull the trigger on

515
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
that.

516
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:05,800
And my main problem with ButterFS came down to just the fact that DF doesn't actually

517
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,440
report the file sizes isn't a huge deal, but it was like, it just really gnawed at me that

518
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,040
I never really felt like I had a super clear snapshot of what my storage situation was.

519
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,080
And it was slowly getting worse and worse over time.

520
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,200
And so, because I have, in my Bonobo, I have a 128GB SSD for my home drive, and I have

521
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,160
a 256GB SSD that I slice up amongst my main Arch installation, another distro that I'm

522
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,840
trying, and like all of the applications and anything like that.

523
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,800
So it's kind of a tight operating margin, and with ButterFS just sort of fudging the

524
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,560
extra metadata and things like that, it just became too expensive.

525
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:50,720
And I don't even remember, I can't remember if it was Blaster or if it was Wimpy who was

526
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,960
really advocating XFS so strongly, but somebody sold me on it.

527
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,240
And I was an old XFS user from years back as a sysadmin, so I'd had some experiences,

528
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,400
it seemed to be a good file system when I used it.

529
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,520
Anybody in here a big XFS user?

530
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,680
Who was that?

531
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
It was me.

532
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,640
Okay, Wimpy, so do you remember the bullet points of sort of what your main points were

533
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,560
for me to switch, because you convinced me.

534
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,200
Yeah, well I went through something similar when I had a disk fail recently, and what

535
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,320
I've done is slightly different.

536
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,720
I've kept ButterFS for the root file system, but I'm using XFS for the home partition,

537
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,440
for the reasons that you've just outlined.

538
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:36,160
Toolbox machines and large files, ButterFS was, I couldn't seem to rebalance it to get

539
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,160
the space back, I don't know where it had gone, but it wasn't letting me have it.

540
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,880
And I knew full well that there wasn't as much data on the device as it was claiming

541
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
was there.

542
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
That was my situation as well.

543
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
So that's why I made the switch.

544
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,080
But for me as an Arch developer, I want ButterFS on my root file system because I get all the

545
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,400
benefit of ButterFS on the development tools, so that's where it pays off then.

546
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,980
You know, I actually like the, it sounds crazy, I never thought I would become a fan of it,

547
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,880
but the real time LZO compression on ButterFS worked excellent for me, performance was good,

548
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,560
so I missed that, especially on an SSD.

549
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Yeah that is great.

550
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,840
And then I've still got that on the root partition, so I've got those benefits at boot time.

551
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Yeah, maybe I should have done that.

552
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,640
I was just, I felt so burned at the time that I thought, no I'm going to go XFS everywhere.

553
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
Keep it simple.

554
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,720
I typically use XFS everywhere, but on my Arch machines I'm sticking with ButterFS on

555
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,720
the root partition.

556
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,560
So the million dollar question was, why XFS over XT4?

557
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,760
It's just brilliant.

558
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
It's rock solid.

559
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:45,000
It's been, it's a bit like Marte, you know, it's got a long heritage, it's super mature,

560
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,680
it performs as well as or as close to everything else or exceeds some of the others, so you

561
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,840
don't need to tweak it.

562
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,800
All the defaults are tuned for performance and it's just bulletproof and if you want

563
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:04,240
some ButterFS like facilities, then stick LVM underneath it and then you can snapshot

564
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
it.

565
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Yeah, that's true.

566
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,720
Yeah, for me it was sort of the antithesis to ButterFS, like it was going to something

567
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,040
that was, I mean I literally deployed systems with XFS in the 90s, so I mean I've used it

568
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:22,240
for a really long time and so I just trust it and after getting burned by something new,

569
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,360
I think I went to the other extreme.

570
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,400
Wizard, I know you had to mention about parallel writing, is that for ButterFS or is that another

571
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
file system?

572
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
No, that's XFS.

573
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Oh.

574
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,200
XFS does do, it does a very good job at parallel writing at the same time.

575
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,360
So you go and you have multiple files, you're writing them all at the same time, it'll go

576
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,440
on and it'll actually split up and it'll write them in a very even way and still maintain

577
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,480
a fairly decent speed.

578
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,600
XFS is great if you don't want copy-on-write or if copy-on-write isn't a super big deal.

579
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Right.

580
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,880
That was sort of, I think I remember from our discussion, it was sort of like you get

581
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,680
a lot of benefits of ButterFS, a lot of optimizations I wanted from ButterFS, but if I don't want

582
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,600
copy-on-write and I don't want compression, then might as well just go XFS.

583
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,580
Yeah, it's absolutely wonderful.

584
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:11,040
The only real thing that you'll hear from people and they're usually people that have

585
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:17,760
been using XFS or used XFS in the very distant past was they'll go and they'll say, well,

586
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,920
I had a brownout and this did weird things and I couldn't recover the file system.

587
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,400
And you know, it's not a big deal, at least I don't see it as a big deal, and I wouldn't

588
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,080
worry about it yourself just because you have a laptop battery, you know, and it's going

589
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,120
to go and shut down.

590
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,480
That truncating to zero bytes on files, that was fixed about 10 or 11 years ago.

591
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Exactly.

592
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
It's old news.

593
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,880
People still bring it up.

594
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,160
But one other thing that kind of burned me about ButterFS was I realized maybe six, seven

595
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,160
months into the game that there was a thing called defragmenting that I should be doing.

596
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
Right?

597
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,760
And Wimpy, that's not such a problem with XFS, is it?

598
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,520
Yeah, XFS has got really brilliant defrag tools.

599
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,040
So you can do online defragmentation and it works really well and you know exactly where

600
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,160
your data is being used.

601
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,900
And for someone like you who will have large video files, you can defragment individual

602
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,920
files rather than having to do the whole file system.

603
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:18,520
So if you leave your laptop on overnight, just stick a cron job in there to do the XFS

604
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:24,000
defrag on your partitions and it will just stay all nice and hunky-dory.

605
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,120
And Wizard, do you have a comment on the XFS toolset?

606
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,880
Yeah, the actual commands for going and doing stuff like repairing your file system, all

607
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,200
this other stuff, you can use all the stuff that you're regularly used to, like fcsck.xfs.

608
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,760
That was big for me too.

609
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Yeah.

610
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,520
There's also, and if you're used to the ButterFest, you're like, oh, I want to use X program to

611
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
deal with this.

612
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,440
You can do that as well because almost every single one of them has a program of their

613
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,840
own, like XFS repair, or they all have their own.

614
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,640
And it's super simple, they're not crazy, you really can read a man page for once and

615
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
know how it works.

616
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Right.

617
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,640
That is very true.

618
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,280
And Wimpy, we probably should make a mention because the chatroom is asking, XFS, as far

619
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,120
as you know, supports Trim, right?

620
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
It does, yeah.

621
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
So there you go.

622
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,800
And I remember one of the reasons I went ButterFest was, well, it's SSD optimized.

623
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,960
When you look into the SSD optimizations, I think it's like they don't massage the access

624
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,200
times, and it supports Trim and a few other things.

625
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,360
And I realized when XFS can do that too, that was one of the deciding factors for me to

626
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
choose ButterFest.

627
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,240
It's like, this is the SSD ready file system.

628
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,400
Actually the old dog XFS can do it too.

629
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,880
So yeah, I thought, what the heck?

630
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,560
So anyways, that was my thought process.

631
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,140
Long and convoluted, and probably a lot of it was in pre and post shows.

632
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,240
But it was a long series of discussions that brought us there.

633
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:50,800
And I still have, let's see, one, two, three, four current production systems that are still

634
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,240
running ButterFest.

635
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
So it's not like I've switched.

636
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,280
I just switched my main, my Bonobo.

637
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,000
I haven't switched all my systems.

638
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And I still have a server running ButterFest.

639
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Here's a question then.

640
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,900
So you were obviously loathe to lose ButterFest and the compression from the performance point

641
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,900
of view.

642
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,440
Did you notice any performance degradation?

643
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
You know, not really.

644
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,880
But it's hard to tell when it's such a new install.

645
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Because my...

646
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,880
So you really need to fill it up in a few months time and then call back.

647
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,420
Yeah, I think as the drive gets fuller, I'll see if I start to notice it slowing down.

648
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,540
You know, the interesting thing is this Bonobo is a couple of years old.

649
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:30,980
And when I was setting up, I was like, wow, this, I really could not ask for this to be

650
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,980
a faster computer.

651
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,240
Like, this is still exceptionally fast.

652
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,760
And so it seems like the current higher-end hardware for the last couple of years to throw

653
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,920
at desktop Linux is more than sufficient.

654
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,080
If you have an SSD and a decent processor, you get really good performance.

655
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,440
So I don't know if I'll be able to tell the difference, to be honest.

656
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,840
But I do feel like when ButterFest really filled up, like when I'd have a virtual machine

657
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,160
that was sort of eating away at storage and I didn't realize how fast my drive space was

658
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,840
ticking down because it was all happening inside a VM, I really felt like I could tell.

659
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,320
It almost seemed like to me, I went down to like spinning hard drive speeds and it was

660
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,320
painfully slow.

661
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:11,840
Like having to watch like my directories like actually like load out and you know, all that

662
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,320
just felt really slow.

663
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,840
And the only thing that happened is I'd fill up the drive.

664
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,640
And when I deleted the drive and rebalanced, the performance came back.

665
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,840
So I don't know if that'll happen.

666
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,680
I doubt that'll even happen in XFS.

667
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
We'll see.

668
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,480
Only find out after a little bit of usage.

669
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,400
Hey, we're going to follow up on some of our OpenSUSE coverage, including producer Eric's

670
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
notes.

671
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,600
But before we do that, I want to thank our first sponsor, Linux Academy.

672
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,160
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to get our 33% discount.

673
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,240
And that's on your subscription.

674
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,640
You're going to stay subscribed to Linux Academy once you go over there.

675
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,240
I heard from a lot of folks at Ohio Linux Fest who've really been enjoying Linux Academy.

676
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,600
And I just got a message from somebody last night that said their power was out.

677
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,840
But they had downloaded Linux Academy's comprehensive study guides and the tutorials offline before

678
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,840
the power went out.

679
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,680
And they're still doing their study without the power.

680
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,760
It's kind of incredible.

681
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,480
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

682
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Check them out.

683
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,360
They've got all the different distributions you could possibly want to try.

684
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,360
You choose from those.

685
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,080
They'll automatically adjust your courseware.

686
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,260
They just added four more courses over the last week.

687
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,260
It's a ton of new stuff coming out.

688
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,240
They have stuff in the pipeline all through the remainder of the year.

689
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
Go over there.

690
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,040
You can learn anything you really could possibly imagine in the Linux system itself.

691
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,800
And they're expanding beyond that into AWS, OpenStack, DevOps.

692
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,480
You can go over there and get an introduction to Android development, introduction to VMware,

693
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
VFXI.

694
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,320
If you ended up having to support a VMware environment, go there and pull that down.

695
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,320
And what's really nice is as you go through these courses, you can keep track of your

696
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
progress.

697
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,240
They'll give you estimations as you log back in and say, here's where you left off.

698
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,440
Here's the index of where you're going to go.

699
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,800
This is how long it's going to take.

700
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,240
Here's the guide that goes with it.

701
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,560
And they also have learning plans where you can set exactly how much availability you

702
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
have.

703
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,200
And they'll automatically adjust the courseware to match that availability.

704
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,080
And they'll nudge you and say, hey, remember, you've got a test at the end of the week to

705
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,400
keep you involved, to keep you going back.

706
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,520
They've got an active support structure in their community as well, live streams where

707
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,200
you can ask questions directly to the instructors.

708
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,040
It's one of these things that you really don't understand until you go there and you engage

709
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,000
in those resources that are available to you.

710
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,960
You begin to move something forward.

711
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,200
And it's very rewarding.

712
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,840
I've been doing it now since they became a sponsor.

713
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,920
Every week I go in there and I try something out.

714
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,640
And it's very rewarding.

715
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,960
It's intellectually stimulating.

716
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,760
I'm able to see what new things interest me.

717
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,320
And I'm able to stay current at a much deeper level.

718
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,840
And so even though I'm not in the IT field anymore, I still find it to be an incredibly

719
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
valuable resource.

720
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,880
I could only imagine if I was still in IT how handy this would be.

721
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,280
You can get a full end-to-end course on the LAMP stack, Apache self-signed SSLs, remote

722
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:45,120
GUI administration set up on Linux, setting up an NFS server, NGINX, Nagios, backing up

723
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,760
with rsync, taking care of the Heartbleed bug, all of that.

724
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,240
They have scenario-based training too.

725
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,360
So you can do some of these things in lab environments where you'll actually go end-to-end.

726
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,480
You'll deploy the software, you'll deploy the application on top of that.

727
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,520
You'll integrate in third-party services.

728
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,440
You'll have a working product that's accessible from the public because as the courseware

729
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,000
requires it, they automatically spin up Linux servers for you on the backend, give them

730
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,720
public IP addresses, give you a login, you're going to sign them roles.

731
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,800
It's a really cool system.

732
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,340
People just go on and on about it when I meet them in person.

733
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
It's awesome to hear that.

734
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:21,200
So go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and keep sending in your success stories too.

735
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,720
I really love hearing that.

736
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,520
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a really big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

737
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,600
the Linux Unplugged Show.

738
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,240
Okay, so OpenSUSE as the version 13.2 is officially here.

739
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,560
We got ourselves a new green baby.

740
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,740
You can go over and get it at the OpenSUSE website.

741
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,880
Lots of nice stuff in there.

742
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,160
They've also given us the new deets on their new rolling setup.

743
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,560
And so I thought we'd talk to producer Eric and anybody in the Mumble Room that's up and

744
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,040
running OpenSUSE.

745
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,280
Do some follow up from our review, touch on a couple of items.

746
00:33:53,280 --> 00:34:00,120
Eric, let's start with, really quickly, I know we mentioned it in the review, but you

747
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,440
kind of, you had a defense for GNOME software that I thought was fair, we should give it

748
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
some time.

749
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,280
Because in the review I was like, man, there's so many ways to install software in OpenSUSE.

750
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,040
You've got three or four different ways, and now they've just thrown in GNOME software.

751
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,400
And you kind of raised the point.

752
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,880
It does serve some purpose.

753
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,000
Yes, it does, absolutely.

754
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,320
If you understand OpenSUSE, and this is something that you've actually had a gripe about in

755
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,240
the past, is that they don't have any good way for software discovery.

756
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,600
Well, that's where GNOME software comes in and fills in that gap.

757
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,280
So it's not the best for software discovery, but it's definitely better than nothing.

758
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,440
Yeah, I would love, love to see an app that could expose the coolest and best stuff in

759
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
software.OpenSUSE.org.

760
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,620
Because I feel like there's projects that are plugged into that and generating RPMs

761
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,480
for SUSE that I don't even know about.

762
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,360
Yeah, but software.OpenSUSE.org is something that you want to search because it's directly

763
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,960
tied to the build service.

764
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,520
Think of it almost like the AUR in ARCH.

765
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,040
Basically there's no way to discover software in the AUR.

766
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,560
You've already got to know about it and then search the AUR to find out.

767
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,080
Well, software.OpenSUSE.org is the exact same way.

768
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:13,240
In fact, there's the Firefox extension for being able to search the AUR.

769
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,920
I've installed that a lot when I've run ARCH, but also in OpenSUSE, I've actually made it

770
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,920
so that that search box in there, I can directly search that from my bar using a keyword.

771
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Oh, that's handy.

772
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
That's neat.

773
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
Yeah, that makes it super handy.

774
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,400
It makes it super fast to search it as well.

775
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Okay.

776
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,960
And I also noticed too that you had a Chrome extension in the show notes for a one-click

777
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,160
installer for OpenSUSE.

778
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Yes.

779
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,040
Basically this kind of comes by default with Firefox.

780
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
Oh, it is.

781
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,440
Oh, that's in Firefox.

782
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,480
So you mean an add-in to Firefox?

783
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Oh, okay.

784
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
It's not really an add-in.

785
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,440
It's basically they kind of have it in their code.

786
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,240
There's like an OpenSUSE enhancements extension that does a few things, right?

787
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,640
Does a few small things to make Firefox work a little better under SUSE.

788
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,000
Yeah, just a few small things.

789
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,240
This basically fills in the gap for Chrome.

790
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,320
If you want to use Chrome, you can just click on that.

791
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,400
It'll bring up the YMP file in your browser and say, do you want to install this?

792
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,400
You can click on yes, and as long as you follow the instructions from the plugin page on the

793
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,960
Chrome store, it will just basically start that one-click installer.

794
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,000
Yeah, it'll fire off the install and you're off the races.

795
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Exactly.

796
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,600
Calls your uncle, as you say.

797
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,960
You had a make good in the review.

798
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,040
We forgot to touch on how horrible the fonts are by default in OpenSUSE, but it's actually

799
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,440
pretty easy to fix.

800
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
Correct.

801
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,960
In the show notes, all you have to do is you could check out that there's a repo that Chris

802
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,840
has on the screen if you're watching the video version and select one of those repos on there,

803
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:56,040
depending on which version you have, whether it's 13.1, 13.2 or factory slash tumbleweed.

804
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:05,600
You click on that, go ahead and copy that into that whole URL into your software repositories

805
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:16,440
in Yast, and then you add that into a pseudo-zipper DUP, which is Distribution Upgrade, basically,

806
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,640
and it will move your font config files over to that from the default and basically change

807
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,320
them to the Infinity version.

808
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,320
That's pretty straightforward.

809
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:31,120
If you're having trouble following, Eric has links in the show notes to do that.

810
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,240
I would definitely recommend that because I meant to mention that in the review.

811
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,660
You're absolutely right about the font rendering.

812
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,480
It's atrocious by default.

813
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Why is that?

814
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
I don't know.

815
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:47,400
It's like they haven't taken anything that Infinity or the Ubuntu people have done forever

816
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,600
and integrated.

817
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
I don't know.

818
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:56,280
Honestly, in their defense, it's also pretty crap in Fedora by default, too.

819
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,320
I'll give them that.

820
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,080
Fonts just need to get better.

821
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,620
This is the thing I'm the most excited to talk about because the rolling release thing

822
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,000
could be extremely compelling if it's done right.

823
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,960
You took the dive, right?

824
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,960
You've been doing it for what?

825
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,960
Two, three weeks or more?

826
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
How long have you been running?

827
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,960
About two or three weeks.

828
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,440
After we got done with the Ubuntu back at last 3.35.

829
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,360
That was three weeks ago, I think.

830
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,720
That was about three weeks ago.

831
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,080
I went ahead and went all in with OpenSUSE and knowing it's coming out next, I had been

832
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:32,200
running Factory off and on since Factory was announced to be a full rolling distro.

833
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,440
I've been very impressed with the results, to be honest.

834
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,680
There's the initial article right there.

835
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,880
That's about Factory merging with Tumbleweed.

836
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,120
Have you had to do any open source versus proprietary driver installs on their role?

837
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,800
How does that work?

838
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,960
I don't have to do that on my machine because it's running full Intel.

839
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,640
I really don't have much experience with that.

840
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,240
However, there are one-click installs for the NVIDIA drivers using an actual Factory

841
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,680
repo or whatnot.

842
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,200
One thing that's important to note is that as of today, Tumbleweed and Factory are pretty

843
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,680
much synonymous.

844
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,840
Basically, the Factory repos are just linked over that is alias to the Tumbleweed repos,

845
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:23,840
and Tumbleweed is now the name for the rolling distribution as of today, November 4th.

846
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,960
We have linked in the show notes frequently asked questions that the OpenSUSE project

847
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,440
has posted up.

848
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,880
Do you get updates every day?

849
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Pretty much.

850
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,960
It reminds me a lot of Arch in that way, except without the headache of having to manually

851
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,800
config files and whatnot.

852
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,520
You mentioned, too, something about the way the update manager is constantly running the

853
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
background, right?

854
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Correct.

855
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,560
Now, that update manager you were talking about for GNOME, the package updater, that

856
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,880
is constantly running in the background, just kind of checking to see, pinging the repos,

857
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,320
see if there's anything.

858
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,040
It's always using zipper as the backend.

859
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,920
It's just basically using zipper.

860
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,020
If you were on a rolling release, does this just kind of constantly check for updates

861
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,720
and just sort of notify you when there's a new update?

862
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,180
That's the funny thing about rolling is that I'm not sure if it does because I haven't

863
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:20,920
had it pop up at all, but in rolling, you're supposed to use zipper dup every time you

864
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,920
want to update.

865
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
Oh, okay.

866
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,040
So, you don't use any of the built-in software tools?

867
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Correct.

868
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,880
Not for factory or Tumbleweed.

869
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,200
It's basically that.

870
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,600
But those tools are still there if you convert to rolling?

871
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
Correct.

872
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Yes.

873
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Yeah.

874
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,380
The other thing that's kind of nice is there is a way to sort of jump in more current.

875
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,800
If you want to go straight to rolling, you can get snapshot ISOs, right?

876
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,360
Or am I wrong?

877
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Yes.

878
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,640
There are snapshot ISOs you can do if you want to go straight to rolling, like do a

879
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,360
fresh install with rolling.

880
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,680
You can also convert your repos over to the factory or Tumbleweed, and there are instructions

881
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,680
on that.

882
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
But it seems cleaner.

883
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,360
Wouldn't it just be cleaner to go right into a rolling release?

884
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
Yeah.

885
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
That's exactly what I did.

886
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,120
I didn't even bother with installing 13.1 and switching the repos over.

887
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,760
I just installed from the ISO.

888
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Right.

889
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,640
I've converted one install to rolling, and it was pretty painless.

890
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,680
But I remember there's like a couple of repos I had that there specifically was like a 13.1

891
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,480
version for, but there wasn't a Tumbleweed version for, so I couldn't switch that one

892
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
or something like that.

893
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,980
That was a problem where people haven't published more updated quote-unquote Tumbleweed packages.

894
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,780
There's only like the release versions of packages, and it sort of depends on the project

895
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
or something.

896
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,720
I don't know what I ran into, but there's a couple of repos that had to get disabled

897
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,440
when I switched over to rolling.

898
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Right.

899
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,360
I've run into that myself, and it's kind of annoying when that happens.

900
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,920
At the same time, you can still stick with those packages and just install the packages,

901
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,000
not subscribe to the repo.

902
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,960
And so there's a six-month transition window as we switch from factory to Tumbleweed?

903
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,320
Am I getting my terminology right?

904
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,400
That's kind of correct.

905
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,000
Basically factory is just kind of linking over to Tumbleweed, but what's happening is

906
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,520
that that factory alias is going to go bye-bye in six months, so basically it'll stop working.

907
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:19,840
The new repo that you have to subscribe to is that Tumbleweed repo.

908
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,480
Okay, RottenCorps, go ahead.

909
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,000
I think you're reading my mind.

910
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,320
One thing that annoys me about OpenSUSE is their phrasing for the one-click install from

911
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,920
their software website.

912
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,760
It irritates me because it's like 15 clicks.

913
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,480
Yeah, it is a lot of clicks.

914
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,480
It is a lot of clicks.

915
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,040
It is, and it's really just a branding thing.

916
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,680
Basically the reason it's one-click install is you click on it once in the browser, and

917
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:51,920
then you're starting the install process as opposed to having to copy a repo, paste it

918
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,240
into the software repository.

919
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,040
In one click you get the repo added and the software installed.

920
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,000
I can activate a dev file, open one click, and that's the same thing.

921
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,640
Well, let's not take it literally.

922
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,840
Well, they could just not use that term, and it would just be so much better.

923
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,120
It's all marketing, man.

924
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,120
Yeah, it is.

925
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,200
It crossed my mind during the review.

926
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,040
During the review, when you first set it up, it's like when you run that the most.

927
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,740
When you combine that with the media manager trying to check my thumb drive, which also

928
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,360
brings up two prompts, and then you combine that with the fact that I enter my password,

929
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,440
and then to kind of make it a little worse, and it's not really their fault.

930
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,120
This is kind of the way GTK theming works a lot of times, is you start the first process

931
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:37,520
as yourself, as in my case, my ChrisF user.

932
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,200
Then once I entered my password, those following dialog boxes are now running as root, so they

933
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,320
drop all of my GTK theme.

934
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,200
They look completely different, so not only is there three or four windows that come up,

935
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,220
several prompts that come up, but half of the windows don't look like the other half

936
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,220
of the windows.

937
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,220
It's not a very...

938
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,220
Yeah, it's not their fault.

939
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,680
KDE does the same thing.

940
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,680
It's not a very elegant transition or process, but after I went through it a few times, it's

941
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,560
like, yeah, this could definitely be tightened up, but I also just appreciate the ease at

942
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,220
which I am getting a subscribe to the repo, which is really, for me, the most valuable

943
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,280
thing, because at the end of the day, I could go to any website and download an RPM and

944
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,160
install it, and just do that, and that's fine.

945
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,880
But for me, the true value of the one-click install is not only am I installing it, but

946
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,600
I'm also getting that repo, so I'm getting those future updates.

947
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,880
That's more than just installing software.

948
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,920
That's also sort of, quote-unquote, subscribing to that software, and to me, that's worth

949
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,920
a little extra hassle.

950
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,160
I think it could be rebranded, too, though, but you know.

951
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,560
What's also cool about that is once you subscribe to that repo, say you find another package

952
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,240
that you want to use with the one-click install on, you don't remember if you're subscribed

953
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,840
to that repo or not, it's not going to double up the repo.

954
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,840
It's going to use the same one.

955
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that is nice, too.

956
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,240
All right, Eric, is there anything else we want to cover in our open SUSE follow-up?

957
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,040
Oh, Plasma 5, didn't you want to mention Plasma 5?

958
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:02,920
Yeah, Plasma 5 is a separate repo you have to subscribe to if you want it.

959
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,880
There are instructions from the KDE portal on how to do that, but yeah, as far as Plasma

960
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:15,760
5 goes, it is the best Plasma 5 experience I've ever had on any KDE distro at all.

961
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,760
That includes Kubuntu.

962
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:26,320
I mean, all of the breeze theme, instead of having the, what is it, the cute curve theme,

963
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,240
actually there is a dedicated breeze theme now, and I was only able to find it in open

964
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,240
SUSE.

965
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,320
That's nice.

966
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,320
So that's something to look forward to.

967
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,320
Yeah, and it looks really nice.

968
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,640
Something definitely to look forward to.

969
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,920
I have reason to believe that if Kubuntu is doing this in the next version with Plasma

970
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,880
5, I have reason to believe that 13.3 will also be Plasma 5.

971
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,880
That makes sense.

972
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,760
Yeah, so there you go, and the beat goes on, I agree, Rotten, that it does sound like a

973
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,760
better way to do PPAs.

974
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,660
That's kind of what my impression was.

975
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,160
It's a centralized way, sort of like the AUR is a centralized way to find stuff.

976
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,480
You get to subscribe to the repo.

977
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,640
It is more clicks than it needs to be, and yes, I realize you can also do app colon slash

978
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,200
slash and a lot of browsers on Ubuntu will recognize that.

979
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,160
It's not a totally unique system, but it works well.

980
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,520
But that doesn't subscribe you to the PPA.

981
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,840
Well I suppose, I suppose, it depends, like if you, there are some debians, like the Chrome

982
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,200
deb file, when you install that, it also installs a repo.

983
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,760
So some of them do, kind of depends, but it doesn't matter.

984
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,200
Like it doesn't matter if they're the only ones that can do it.

985
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,240
What matters is that it works, and that there's a nice interface in terms of the website to

986
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,240
find stuff.

987
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,560
And that part I give them all high marks on.

988
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,240
Yeah, consolidating the efforts is much better.

989
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,760
Yeah, it's better than in Fedora where you essentially have three repos.

990
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,520
You have Fedora's repos, you have Copper, and then you have the community RPM fusion,

991
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,040
so it makes it a bit of a pain to determine where you're getting that from.

992
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,040
I agree, I agree.

993
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,960
And Derrick Devlin, you had a comment on, you ran into a problem with network settings?

994
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:02,480
Yes, there's only one major problem, which is, if you don't read the page when you're

995
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:08,040
going to install, and you, for some reason, you're still not on IPv6, you need to go manually

996
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,200
on the settings and enable that.

997
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,280
Right, yeah, what was interesting is the installer uses YAS to configure the network interface,

998
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,000
but the desktop uses Network Manager.

999
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,600
So once you get through the installation, those two things don't communicate.

1000
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:28,560
So if you had to join Wi-Fi in the installation and it has a password, when you reboot the

1001
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,560
box after installation, you have no connection.

1002
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,440
And it took me a second to think, wait a minute, I was just on Wi-Fi, oh, right, one was YAS'd,

1003
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,440
one was Network Manager.

1004
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,840
Now, how would a regular non-Linux person know that?

1005
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:48,800
Like someone just thinking about IPv6 and IPv4 difference, someone that's not a computer

1006
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
geek.

1007
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,840
And what kind of tipped me off is once my desktop was booted up and installed, I was

1008
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,960
just looking at YAS, and I brought up the network management utilities to see what options

1009
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,960
were available in there.

1010
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,760
And I got an error message saying, no, you're now using Network Manager, you can't use this

1011
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,760
tool.

1012
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,760
And I was like, oh, yeah, of course.

1013
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
You can disable Network Manager and use that tool.

1014
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,480
Right, but I don't want to, I don't want to.

1015
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,480
You don't have to.

1016
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,480
I want to use Network Manager.

1017
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,480
I know I want to, so that's fine.

1018
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,480
Network Manager's fine.

1019
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,520
It was just kind of a thud when I logged in, and I went to go, I didn't even realize at

1020
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:22,380
first that I wasn't connected because so many times, when I build an arch box, during that

1021
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:26,400
installation process, the network is established before pretty much anything else.

1022
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,800
And when I install Ubuntu, if I join the network during installation, that holds over.

1023
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,880
All distributions really, for the most part, do that, because a lot of distributions now,

1024
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,120
you boot up into a live environment, and in that live environment, you use Network Manager

1025
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,280
to configure, and they must just move those settings over.

1026
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,280
It's fine.

1027
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,080
Right, and that's what they do in terms of Ubuntu.

1028
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:51,320
If you want to use that network's settings in Yast, you can.

1029
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,640
It's just that one tab is disabled for you if you're using Network Manager.

1030
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,000
In fact, that's the only way you can change your host name.

1031
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,320
It's just funny, it bit both Matt and I, so it must be common enough.

1032
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,320
Exactly.

1033
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,320
Yeah.

1034
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,120
All right, so, but Eric, great follow-up and great links in the show notes, which we'll

1035
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,280
have, especially if you want to work on your fonts and stuff like that.

1036
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,520
He's got all that in there, so check that out.

1037
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,960
And if you've been rolling OpenSUSE, let us know how it's going in the feedback thread

1038
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,680
in the Linux Action Show subreddit.

1039
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,680
Hello, Jack.

1040
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,680
How you doing, Jack?

1041
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,680
All right.

1042
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,880
Well, why don't we take a... I want to talk about something kind of neat, and, oh, you

1043
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,880
know what?

1044
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,880
Actually, let's reverse the order.

1045
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,480
I was going to talk about a new piece of hardware, but that's a little bit more of a positive

1046
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,480
note.

1047
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,480
I want to end on a positive note.

1048
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,840
So, next, I want to talk about our brothers in arms over at Linux Outlaws calling it a

1049
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,840
day.

1050
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,120
Before we do that, I want to thank our friends at DigitalOcean.

1051
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,080
Head over to DigitalOcean.com right now, DigitalOcean.com.

1052
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,000
And save this promo code in the back of your mind.

1053
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,480
Like channel it to yourself.

1054
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,480
Say future self.

1055
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,720
It's a critical piece of information that I have collected from the past, and I want

1056
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,720
to put this forward.

1057
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,920
So just think about it hard right now.

1058
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,920
Unplug November.

1059
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,920
That's your promo code.

1060
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,920
Unplug November when you check out.

1061
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,920
At least it should be.

1062
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,240
I actually haven't checked my inbox this morning.

1063
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
I apologize.

1064
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,520
Unplugged October will probably work for a while, too.

1065
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,600
Now to get you a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean.

1066
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,520
We love DigitalOcean, and so many of you have tried it out, but yet so many of you have

1067
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,800
yet to try it out.

1068
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,920
So you're really in a perfect position to go over there and play with something.

1069
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,040
And then later, I think you'll be surprised at how easy it is to put that in production

1070
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,120
and how well it'll work for you.

1071
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,440
So what is DigitalOcean?

1072
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,440
You're not familiar?

1073
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,720
Well, DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

1074
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,680
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

1075
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,960
I was playing around with some of my droplets just the other night, and I turned one off.

1076
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,800
Just to move, you know, I was experimenting actually with taking snapshots and resetting

1077
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,240
passwords and all this.

1078
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,960
Just trying different things out, because I love the interface over at DigitalOcean.

1079
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,680
And I've been adding more machines, and I thought, okay, let's try a few things.

1080
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,680
So I turned off a box.

1081
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,760
I didn't know Reekai was using it for development at the time.

1082
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,760
Oh, no.

1083
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,300
You know, the thing is, is like we spin these droplets up, and they're just so useful.

1084
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,520
We keep finding more and more uses for them, and they make it so easier over at DigitalOcean.

1085
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,120
You can get started in less than 55 seconds, and pricing plans start only $5 per month.

1086
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:09,100
They get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

1087
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,320
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

1088
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,320
and London.

1089
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,600
So you could build a global distributed network if you want.

1090
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:21,040
And their interface, their interface is simple and intuitive, but yet very powerful.

1091
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,480
And the best part is, is you can replicate it on a larger scale with their straightforward

1092
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,480
API.

1093
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,920
And you're already seeing a lot of great apps out there that integrate in with Puppet, Unity.

1094
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,000
There's some great command line tools, Python scripts.

1095
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,800
There's so many things you can use that API for that the community has already created

1096
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,080
for you too.

1097
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,560
That's just the great thing about that API is it doesn't mean you got to do the work.

1098
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,560
Other people are doing it as well.

1099
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,560
But you could too.

1100
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,560
You can snap it right in.

1101
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,600
And then if you need to scale on demand, if you've got a busy day, you need to make sure

1102
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,880
your web front end is still responsive, you could integrate that API and deploy right

1103
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,880
up there.

1104
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,000
You can scale right up to DigitalOcean, use their droplets, spin them up when you need

1105
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
them, spin them down when you don't.

1106
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,600
They have hourly pricing if you want them.

1107
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,520
And if you use our promo code, unplugged October, or probably unplugged November, depending

1108
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,760
on the timing, you can try it out for two months for absolutely free.

1109
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,040
And DigitalOcean's taking the tutorials up to the next level.

1110
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,640
They're offering up to $200 if you'll write a tutorial for them.

1111
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:17,040
And if you go to their Instagram feed today, they posted one of their tutorial editors.

1112
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,960
I think he might have broken his leg.

1113
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,560
I'm not sure what was going on, but he was sitting there editing one of the tutorials.

1114
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,760
It was a pretty funny shot.

1115
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,520
It was on DigitalOcean's Instagram feed.

1116
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,200
They also got some DigitalOcean data center porn up there, which is, I'm a big fan of

1117
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,200
that.

1118
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,800
So I think it's just Instagram.com slash DigitalOcean, but you'll probably be able to find them.

1119
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,320
Go over to DigitalOcean.com.

1120
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,760
Run up your own free droplet, try out Core OS for a couple of months.

1121
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,760
It's pretty innovative.

1122
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,760
It's pretty exciting.

1123
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,480
I think it's going to be a big deal in the server space, and you can go play with it

1124
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,440
right now on a server that's got tier one bandwidth and a data center anywhere you want

1125
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,440
it.

1126
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,880
It's an awesome opportunity to do it for absolutely free.

1127
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,320
You just add the promo code, unplugged October, to your account.

1128
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,320
It credits your account to $10, and you just run it as long as it lasts.

1129
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,320
DigitalOcean.com.

1130
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:03,760
And a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for being so damn awesome and sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

1131
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,880
Okay, so let's talk about the Linux Outlaw guys.

1132
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,920
They announced, I think it was yesterday or the day before, let's see, where is the date?

1133
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,320
November 3rd, so yesterday.

1134
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:22,320
They announced that in five episodes, they'll be calling it an end after seven years of

1135
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,480
producing Linux Outlaws.

1136
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,840
It sounds like kind of for both the guys, for both Dan and Fab, that maybe their interests

1137
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,360
have diverged over the time.

1138
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,620
They're not done necessarily podcasting, but they're probably going to take a break and

1139
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:33,620
come back and do something.

1140
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,620
They're super passionate about.

1141
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:38,160
It definitely sounds like maybe the production just came a bit of a chore and definitely

1142
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,440
understandable after seven years.

1143
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,080
I mean, that can become a lot of work.

1144
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:48,880
And so I wanted to take a minute to kind of talk about how sometimes there's certain pillars

1145
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,740
in the community that go away because maybe they're not as involved anymore or they're

1146
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,880
not as interested anymore.

1147
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,400
And is this something that is concerning?

1148
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,400
Is this a general trend?

1149
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,680
I mean, I think, Eric, when you and I were talking about it on the pre-show, you're like,

1150
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,600
I'm worried that this suggests maybe something that just happens to enthusiasts over time.

1151
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:10,360
And I started thinking about that when you mentioned that and I thought, well, we've

1152
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,360
all been in this a while.

1153
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,720
Like Matt and I specifically have been following this particular scene for a long time.

1154
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,800
Burnout is a big problem and people move on.

1155
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,760
I mean, Matt, when you hear about things like this, when you hear about somebody or a group

1156
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,040
of people who've been working at something for so long, what crosses your mind when they

1157
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,520
call it an end?

1158
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,400
Well, usually sometimes it ends up just being an extended hiatus.

1159
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,080
I mean, for myself with podcasting, I mean, before I joined Jupiter Broadcasting, that

1160
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,280
was actually what had happened from another popular podcast.

1161
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,420
So they may come back with something even cooler.

1162
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:47,600
So yes, burnout is a thing and sometimes people just have to kind of keep trucking and find

1163
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,820
out what works for them.

1164
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,560
But I don't think it's necessarily a problem.

1165
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,560
I think it's evolution.

1166
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,880
I think people just evolve.

1167
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
Yeah.

1168
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,240
It's sad to see something go.

1169
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,640
Yeah, right.

1170
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,640
Things change.

1171
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,600
What would be, you say, missing friends?

1172
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,600
What do you mean?

1173
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600
Yeah, this reminds me.

1174
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:07,760
I mean, I know Dan and Fab quite well, on the Ubuntu UK podcast with Linux Outlaws,

1175
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,720
we organized a bunch of live events in the UK called Ogg Camp.

1176
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:16,800
So we worked quite closely with them on those and I'll be interested to know what happens

1177
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,800
in the future.

1178
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:23,400
But it's reminded me of, I was doing a presentation recently and I used some photos from previous

1179
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,120
Ubuntu developer summits and the kind of collective photo of everyone who was there and I was

1180
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,480
looking through picking out faces of people who used to contribute to various projects,

1181
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:40,280
Ubuntu and other stuff, who no longer do or whose careers have moved on or they've just

1182
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,280
stopped contributing.

1183
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,760
They still use the software, but they stopped contributing.

1184
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,600
And I got a little bit sad because these are friendships that we've built over the years

1185
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:53,360
and they've people who've moved on to something else.

1186
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:58,240
See, when Eric said this, what I started thinking is maybe what we're really worried about is

1187
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,200
in open source, we're so dependent on so many people volunteering their time based on their

1188
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,440
passion, but sometimes passion has its limits.

1189
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,720
It runs out after a while.

1190
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,000
And is it maybe what we're actually afraid of is so much of what we depend on, it's created

1191
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,680
by amazing people, those people eventually go away.

1192
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,680
And so-

1193
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,680
Right.

1194
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,040
And you've got to have coping mechanisms and time off.

1195
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:23,320
That's one reason why on the Ubuntu podcast, we finish at Christmas every year and take

1196
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,320
a break for two months.

1197
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,320
So we don't-

1198
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,320
It's a good idea.

1199
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,320
We don't solidly go-

1200
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,920
You lose all your listeners, but it's a good idea.

1201
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,920
No, we don't.

1202
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,920
I can't.

1203
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,920
We don't.

1204
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,920
No, it's good.

1205
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,920
It's like...

1206
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,760
And Linux Outlaws has taken a lot of breaks over the years, but at a certain point, it

1207
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,760
still becomes a chore.

1208
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,760
And that's totally understandable.

1209
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,400
I guess, Eric, I didn't want to speak for you too much, but did I kind of summarize

1210
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,080
your thoughts or when you heard this news, what crossed your mind?

1211
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,360
That's exactly what crossed my mind, actually.

1212
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,380
You did summarize my thoughts very well.

1213
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:54,900
The thing is, if you get at something for a long amount of time, you don't take a break

1214
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,760
every now and then, you don't pace yourself.

1215
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,840
I've seen this time and time again.

1216
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,840
You will burn out.

1217
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,360
It's just the way the human body is designed.

1218
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,360
Yeah, I wonder-

1219
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,360
It is designed to take rest.

1220
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,920
I wonder if I didn't do this full time.

1221
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,520
I couldn't imagine.

1222
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,800
Definitely obviously not this many shows.

1223
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,840
Well, there's a difference though, because you create content and you have a whole team

1224
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,200
of people around you.

1225
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,000
With Dan and Fab, it's just the two of them.

1226
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,720
As I understand it, Fab does all of the editing.

1227
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,040
To be fair, he's a bit precious about it and doesn't like anyone else.

1228
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,400
Other people have offered to take on the job and he's quite a perfectionist and wouldn't

1229
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,600
let anyone touch it.

1230
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,600
Yeah.

1231
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,880
In fact, I think if you don't build a team, that's exactly what happens, right?

1232
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,880
Right.

1233
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:46,760
People like you who have a team of people, whether you pay them or not, or whether they're

1234
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,080
community people who are volunteering their time, is largely irrelevant.

1235
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,600
They're people who are helping you get the thing out.

1236
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,960
If you don't have that crutch to lean on, you're screwed.

1237
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:08,280
I think too, I look at it and what I don't like is I don't want it to represent a decline

1238
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,400
in the interest, because I don't sense that.

1239
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,920
I think a lot of people have associated with, oh, there's less of an interest in the market.

1240
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,360
I don't think that's actually true.

1241
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:20,720
I think it's just sometimes the people, like in their case, Dan and Fab, sometimes their

1242
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,240
interests change.

1243
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,320
It becomes harder and harder.

1244
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,200
You could see in the evolution of the show, they start covering more generalized technology

1245
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,440
and topics and security in the NSA, diverging more and more from Linux as a topic itself.

1246
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:38,120
Arguably, Linux is more popular now than it has ever been in the past.

1247
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,800
It can't possibly be that it's not popular, it's just popular to different people for

1248
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,800
different reasons.

1249
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,800
Exactly.

1250
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,760
Yeah, and I think it's natural that as that changes, it might not be as appealing to some

1251
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,760
people.

1252
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,320
But yeah, Wizard, go ahead, jump in, that's kind of all the thoughts I had.

1253
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,080
I just wanted to make a mention to it and tip of the hat to him too for all the hard

1254
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,080
work for so long.

1255
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,080
But Wizard, go ahead.

1256
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:06,840
Yeah, so it is sad when you see good people leave and all, but I tend to find that a lot

1257
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,120
of times, it's not so much that they're leaving.

1258
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:15,040
It's just whatever they're making, it kind of comes to summation or it stabilizes or

1259
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,120
whatever they're doing, it just seems to slow down.

1260
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:23,960
And as whatever they're doing slows down, they just quit putting as much effort in,

1261
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:29,120
not because it doesn't need it or anything, not because it's totally imperfect.

1262
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:33,880
It's just they've got what they needed done and now they want to go and use the product

1263
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,200
because whatever they're doing, it's because they're passionate about it.

1264
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,720
They want to see it work.

1265
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,480
And when it works, it's like, okay, I'm done.

1266
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,960
I'm going to sit back, be happy for a little while and then maybe move on to something

1267
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,960
different.

1268
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,400
Very true.

1269
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,920
And so we wish them the best of luck and we'll stay tuned to see what they come up with

1270
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:58,160
next because I have a feeling we haven't heard the last of them because I think Six Guns

1271
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:03,440
itself is sticking around and Ogg Camp itself as far as they have plans, they aren't changing

1272
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,440
anywhere.

1273
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,800
Hey, I have something fun to talk about.

1274
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,760
Something that will sort of lift our spirits before we run, maybe get a good debate going

1275
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,760
first though.

1276
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,280
I want to tell you about something that lifts my spirits every single month.

1277
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,280
Oh, who was it?

1278
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,280
I got an email.

1279
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,280
I think it was Tony.

1280
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,280
I'm sorry.

1281
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,280
It was Tony or Terry.

1282
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,280
It was a T name.

1283
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,280
I'm sorry if I'm getting your name wrong.

1284
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,280
Matt.

1285
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,600
So you know how we always talk about the savings calculator over at Ting?

1286
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,600
Oh yes.

1287
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:28,320
Tony went over there and plugged his actual usage in and he's going to save like 177 something

1288
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,320
a month.

1289
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,960
In two years, it's almost going to be four grand or it's over four grand is what he's

1290
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,280
going to save by switching to Ting.

1291
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,280
Holy cow.

1292
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,280
That's like a liquid powered computer.

1293
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,280
Yeah, I know, right?

1294
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,400
That's a serious gaming rig every couple of years and it's really simple.

1295
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,160
It's because Ting is on a mission to make mobile make sense.

1296
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,440
You only pay for what you use.

1297
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,320
It's a flat six dollars for the line and then it's just your minutes, your messages and

1298
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,440
your megabytes.

1299
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,840
There's no special plan you have to be in to turn on tethering.

1300
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,920
If you want to use it, you just check the box and it's just your data usage and Ting

1301
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,740
has an awesome dashboard that lets you manage your account, see exactly where each line

1302
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,080
is at, nickname them so I've got funny names for each line.

1303
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,360
I can set individual limits, alerts, disable lines when I don't need them and then I don't

1304
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,360
have to pay for them.

1305
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,800
And to top it all off, Ting has tier one tech support.

1306
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:18,840
Like you immediately go to the top level person when you call them at 1-855-TING-FTW anytime

1307
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:24,620
between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. and a real human answers the phone and they are set up to solve

1308
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,620
the problem.

1309
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,240
Like they have the power to do it.

1310
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,480
They don't have to talk to their manager.

1311
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,480
They are the boss.

1312
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,480
It's great.

1313
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,920
They also have an incredible website that you can help yourself over at help.ting.com

1314
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:34,920
I believe or ting.com.

1315
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,400
Here's what you do though.

1316
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,300
Go to linux.ting.com.

1317
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,300
That's where you get started.

1318
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,720
That's your home base, linux.ting.com.

1319
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,920
That will take $25 off your first device.

1320
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,120
If you have a Ting compatible device, they will give you a $25 credit but even more important,

1321
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:52,000
you're going to tell them you appreciate them supporting Linux Unplugged by going to linux.ting.com

1322
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,520
and you get to put Linux in the URL which is always fun.

1323
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,920
Go over to their blog too because they just announced that they've rolled out tri-band

1324
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,240
LTE to 17 new markets.

1325
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,560
They've been working on this a lot over the last year, tons of new markets.

1326
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:10,960
They now have tri-band LTE in over 400 markets across the, I'm sorry, 500 markets across

1327
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,960
the United States.

1328
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,960
Wow.

1329
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,960
Yeah.

1330
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,180
Tri-band, if you're not familiar, is a superior method of LTE where there's three different

1331
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:19,480
frequencies that you can get on and so if one of them is working, you get a good connection.

1332
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,160
If you get all three, it's amazing.

1333
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:27,200
I've got tri-band LTE here at the studio, 1820 megabits on my speedtest.net.

1334
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,520
Not uncommon at all.

1335
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,200
It's really awesome and now that they just rolled it out to 17 new markets, Ting is constantly

1336
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,200
getting better.

1337
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,840
If you haven't checked them out in a little while, it's worth revisiting.

1338
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:40,000
They've invested millions of dollars into rolling out this tri-band LTE infrastructure.

1339
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,220
Now 500 markets across the United States have it.

1340
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:48,920
Go to linux.ting.com, take $25 off your first device, try out that savings calculator, start

1341
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:55,000
saving money right now, own your phone, don't get screwed over by the mobile carriers, get

1342
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,400
decent support, use tethering when you need it and only pay for your usage, linux.ting.com,

1343
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:08,160
linux.ting.com and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged and thanks

1344
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,360
to everybody who checks them out.

1345
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,880
I think you'll be pretty impressed and you'll save lots of money.

1346
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,320
Okay, so here it is, you guys.

1347
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:23,080
Finally, someone has invented the multi-pass or multi-pass from, if you remember, 5th Element.

1348
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,120
It's called multi-pass, an open source offline password keeper.

1349
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,840
It's a hardware based password device.

1350
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:32,000
I'm gonna play a little bit of the video so you get a little introduction.

1351
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,060
It's on IndieGoGo.

1352
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,120
They're trying to raise funds.

1353
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:41,680
They're trying to get to $110,000 roughly and they're at $18,000 right now.

1354
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,060
So I don't know if they're gonna make it but I'll play a little bit of the video for you

1355
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:47,800
guys and then you tell me if you'd back it and what the problems could be and what security

1356
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,800
problems you might see.

1357
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,800
So here we go.

1358
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,800
I'll let this go.

1359
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,880
Open and passwords are an integral part of our daily lives.

1360
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,880
I know it.

1361
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:00,360
They're what prevent malicious users from doing harmful things with our personal data.

1362
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:04,800
People tend to use the same credentials for the different websites they visit.

1363
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:10,700
However, recent news has taught us that credentials stored by websites are compromised on a daily

1364
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:16,160
basis, which means that once an attacker gets your credential set, he can use it on other

1365
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,760
websites.

1366
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:29,320
This is why using different passwords for different websites is important.

1367
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:34,920
Remembering many different passwords is difficult and one option is software-based password

1368
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:35,920
keepers.

1369
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:41,600
Essentially, they store an encrypted credentials database on your computer.

1370
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:46,800
To unlock this database, you would enter a passphrase, which means that at some point,

1371
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:52,000
both your passphrase and database must be stored in your computer or smartphone's memory.

1372
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,640
Therefore, a malicious program could gain access to both and compromise all your passwords

1373
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:02,000
at once without you knowing it.

1374
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,400
To solve this problem, we introduce the multi-pass, an offline password keeper aimed at saving

1375
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,400
and encrypting your passwords in a more secure manner.

1376
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,920
The main device contains your encrypted passwords, while a secure smart card and a PIN code allows

1377
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,480
their decryption.

1378
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:24,960
Even if an attacker gets hold of your encrypted database or smart card, it is completely useless

1379
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,100
without your personal code.

1380
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:32,040
And don't worry, we implemented the possibility to make backup copies of your credential database

1381
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:37,580
and smart card without compromising your system's security.

1382
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:43,800
As opposed to software-based solutions, the multi-pass only runs our tested code independently

1383
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,520
of your computer.

1384
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:51,000
This means viruses or malicious programs cannot compromise your credential database or PIN,

1385
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,440
neither of which are directly accessible from the computer.

1386
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:59,980
Furthermore, our product is open source, allowing you to make sure that your credentials are

1387
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:04,540
only kept inside the device and not leaked to the outside.

1388
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:08,640
And with multi-pass, you can be sure that your credentials are only in the computer's

1389
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:14,040
memory when needed, and when you explicitly permit the multi-pass to send them.

1390
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:17,740
Okay, so let's talk about this.

1391
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:21,800
Part of me likes the idea of a hardware-based security device, I'm not going to lie.

1392
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:27,120
I like the smart card with the key codes, that's nice.

1393
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:33,680
But there's a lot of good software-based solutions like LastPass and KeyPass already existing.

1394
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,680
Anybody seen this already in the Mumba room?

1395
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,600
Anybody sort of like ready to go jump on this?

1396
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,240
I've actually, I was looking at this earlier today, actually.

1397
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,960
What do you think?

1398
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,580
It's interesting in and of itself, but what I'm going to just say that it comes down to

1399
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:53,920
is that it's going to require you to carry things around.

1400
01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:00,560
And not that that makes it bad, but it's something that's going to stop me because I'm so forgetful

1401
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:06,080
and I can't keep that thing on me all the time whenever I need to go and just shove

1402
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,080
a password at something.

1403
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:13,480
So there's another option, like LastPass has a thing called Open Sesame.

1404
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,080
And basically you could put this on, it's kind of the same thing but software-wise,

1405
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:22,560
put it on a flash drive, put the flash drive on your keychain, and then you always have

1406
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,560
it.

1407
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,560
Yeah, and you could also with LastPass use things like YubiKey as well.

1408
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:32,280
And with KeyPass you can store the database on a flash drive and that way you keep it

1409
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,280
with you.

1410
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,280
It's always with you.

1411
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,960
Yeah, to me there's too many drawbacks.

1412
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,320
Losing of the physical item because I'm mobile, so that means I'd have to bring this with

1413
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,320
me.

1414
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,600
I'd have to bring it to my office, to the studio, and to home.

1415
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,360
Which is just not a good idea.

1416
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,960
So that's why I'm kind of down on it.

1417
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,760
But if I was super worried about security, for some reason this does feel better.

1418
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,780
Okay, here's what it is, I think, is you've got to understand the guys behind it.

1419
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:59,520
They come from an InfoSec background and I think a lot of them are operating under the

1420
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,480
assumption that the computer is compromised by default.

1421
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,360
So you go into the situation assuming the computer is untrustworthy, therefore it's

1422
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,800
a bad place to store your passwords, it's a bad place to copy them to memory, it's a

1423
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,560
bad place to input your passcode, all of that, because you're supposed to assume the computer

1424
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,800
is already compromised.

1425
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,680
This removes it from that, they say it only runs their quote-unquote trusted code, even

1426
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,320
though it's open source, I don't know exactly what that means.

1427
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,080
It's not for me, but I thought it was interesting enough that maybe the audience might be into

1428
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,080
it.

1429
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:32,080
I kind of like it for some reason, something about it I like.

1430
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,920
What I thought was really interesting about it was it kind of combined the smart card

1431
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:41,560
reader with something as simple as something you can plug in and just have it automatically

1432
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,880
fill in passwords.

1433
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:51,200
That certainly is something in and of itself that is really interesting for what it does.

1434
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:56,440
It combines what we already have had with smart cards for so long and combines it with

1435
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:02,760
something that we've typically only ever seen in software and it kind of makes it very interesting.

1436
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,360
However though, it still has a few fundamental limitations.

1437
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:12,100
First of all, with bad USB, we now can't fully trust USB if we're super paranoid, which this

1438
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,600
device seems like a device for the super paranoid.

1439
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:20,520
And number two, if it's inputting the password, it's probably using a human interface driver

1440
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,560
and sending keystrokes with the password because what you do is you go to your Gmail page,

1441
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:30,160
you click on the login box, then you enter your PIN code and it sends in the password.

1442
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,160
That's exactly what it does.

1443
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,680
It emulates a keyboard.

1444
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,680
But that could still be captured.

1445
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,520
If you have something that's reading the memory on a Windows box, for example, that could

1446
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,800
still capture that stuff.

1447
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,800
Oh yeah.

1448
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,440
And Linux has got very good software capture options.

1449
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:50,120
Yeah, and that target breach, that huge ass target breach, that malware was just scraping

1450
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,120
the RAM.

1451
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,720
It wasn't doing key captures, it wasn't doing screen dumps, it was just scraping the RAM

1452
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,280
and sending the details straight out of RAM.

1453
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:01,560
And so this device doesn't really get around that if you still have to enter it in.

1454
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:06,360
I don't know exactly, but I guess maybe it's harder to monitor something at the human interface

1455
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,920
driver level, but I doubt it.

1456
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,840
Derek Devlin, I know you wanted to get a chance to chime in and then I think we'll jump on.

1457
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:17,520
Yeah, I think this is a good initial step.

1458
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:25,400
And in the next generation of these kind of devices, the way I see is better browser integration

1459
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:31,800
or better website integration as well, to the point that you can generate a cookie that

1460
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:37,960
has your key and you never actually send any data, so your password is not sent to the

1461
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:38,960
computer.

1462
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:39,960
Right, right.

1463
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:40,960
That kind of thing.

1464
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:41,960
Like a token or something.

1465
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,960
Yeah, something like that.

1466
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,420
I think that's kind of the future for that kind of product, and they have a place.

1467
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:51,680
And as Ken Seko points out in the IRC, something else I like a lot about it is they've put

1468
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,040
all their code up on GitHub.

1469
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,120
The code that runs this thing is open.

1470
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,440
It's available now.

1471
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:59,840
And the other thing about this project is they've got real units.

1472
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,600
They've already had it in testing.

1473
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,280
People are already using, quote unquote, production units today, and have been for months.

1474
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,540
They've got a field of beta testers.

1475
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:12,520
So this isn't necessarily like a pie in the sky project either.

1476
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,680
This is something that's already a physical device that they've made.

1477
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:19,720
There's already existing open-sourced code, so you're kind of backing a sure bet.

1478
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,680
But their funding is a little short right now.

1479
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,680
So I don't know.

1480
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,680
I'll put a link in the show notes.

1481
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,680
It's neat.

1482
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:29,620
I love open-source hardware, or at least software that runs on it.

1483
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:34,200
So yeah, they've got 30 days left, 18,000 of 110,000.

1484
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,920
For this release?

1485
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,440
Go ahead.

1486
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,440
No?

1487
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,440
Okay.

1488
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,440
All right.

1489
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:48,040
Well, something that strikes me as I'm looking into this is that they did a nice job of showing

1490
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,760
what it's capable of doing.

1491
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,760
What they're not really...

1492
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,000
And again, this is only from the fundraising point of view.

1493
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,680
What they failed to do is to show what happens when your current methods, methodology, local

1494
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,060
access, local software tools fail.

1495
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:04,360
Show that, then the money might start kicking in a little faster for them.

1496
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,080
I don't feel like they did a very good job showing that.

1497
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,960
Right, because people already know that using the same password in too many places is bad.

1498
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,960
That's not making them stop.

1499
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:10,960
Yeah.

1500
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,800
They stopped using one, two, three, four, five, six a long time ago.

1501
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,800
It's been a week.

1502
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,800
Yeah, yeah.

1503
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,800
I mean, it's not a week.

1504
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,360
Yeah, now use four, five, six, seven.

1505
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,360
Let's get real.

1506
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,360
Obviously, right?

1507
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,360
Yeah.

1508
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,360
Or just numbers backwards.

1509
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,360
That's all good.

1510
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,540
Well, it's an Indiegogo.

1511
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,000
It's called MultiPass.

1512
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Great name.

1513
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Got to love the name, if nothing else.

1514
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,560
It actually kind of saddens me that they don't have a cow as their logo.

1515
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,560
Oh, yeah.

1516
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,560
That would be good too.

1517
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,560
MultiPass.

1518
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,560
MultiPass.

1519
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,240
Or what's your face from Fifth Element?

1520
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,240
Yeah.

1521
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,240
What's?

1522
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,240
Me and Joe.

1523
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,240
Yeah.

1524
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,240
MultiPass.

1525
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:47,240
Yeah.

1526
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,240
All right.

1527
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,240
I think we're all done.

1528
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,240
I think we've done our damage.

1529
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,240
I think we'll wrap it up right there.

1530
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,960
I just wanted to give you guys that.

1531
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,720
Hardware is always fun and something you can get on early, and it's a neat idea too.

1532
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,720
So that'd be neat.

1533
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,320
We'll have links to everything we've talked about today in the show notes.

1534
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,000
If you'd like to give us some feedback, some comments on anything we've talked about, go

1535
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,400
to linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1536
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:09,100
That's also a great place to submit stories, topic ideas, or discussions, or just comment

1537
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,600
on the existing stories to give us your take, your insights.

1538
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,200
We integrate all of that into our shows.

1539
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,980
You can also check us out every single week live over jblive.tv.

1540
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:18,980
We do it at 2 p.m.

1541
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:19,980
Pacific.

1542
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:24,880
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

1543
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,760
I got some cool projects I'm working on for this week's episode of Linux Action Show,

1544
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,760
Matt.

1545
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,720
So buckle up, and I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1546
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:32,720
All right.

1547
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:33,720
Sounds good.

1548
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,720
All right, everyone.

1549
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,760
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1550
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,760
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1551
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,960
I'm just going to mention it again, because it's a great place for you to get involved.

1552
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,880
And if you want more show, there's another spot.

1553
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,800
You can get just a lot more content, stuff that doesn't even make it in there, pics.

1554
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,680
Oh, and we want you to run to Linux.

1555
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,680
You can also submit them there.

1556
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,040
Videos would be great.

1557
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,400

1558
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,400

Feedback is a huge part of this show, and we love getting your emails.

1561
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,120
Okay, everybody.

1562
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,760
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1563
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,600
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1564
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:58,160
Don't mind me, I'm just going to go ahead and install Ubuntu Mate Edition 14.04 here.

1565
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,000
When is that going to be out, guys?

1566
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Hopefully Saturday at the latest Sunday.

1567
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Very cool.

1568
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Very cool.

1569
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
All right.

1570
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
JBtitles.com.

1571
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Everybody vote.

1572
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Got to get a title.

1573
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Got to have a title.

1574
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,640
Thanks for all the show notes, Eric.

1575
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,320
I just put all that in the official doc.

1576
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,320
So that's great.

1577
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,320
Awesome.

1578
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,320
You're welcome.

1579
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,200
Isn't it weird that I do like air piano every time we get the outro going?

1580
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,200
No, I love it.

1581
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,200
You guys, it's great.

1582
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,200
It's great.

1583
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,200
Blast just slow danced with himself.

1584
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,200
I think that's sweet.

1585
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,200
There you go.

1586
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,200
That's real dope.

1587
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,200
Actually, I think I slow danced with Josh because he was slow dancing with me.

1588
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,200
Hell yeah.

1589
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,200
Yeah.

1590
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,200
I did the Stevie Wonder dance.

1591
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,200
Wow.

1592
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,200
Oh, boy.

1593
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,720
And it just got weird.

1594
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,680
Angie and I have decided we're going to go see a concert in a few weeks for her birthday.

1595
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,720
We're going to go see Fleetwood Mac.

1596
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,720
Good choice.

1597
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,720
It's going to be crazy, I think.

1598
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,720
It's going to be crazy.

1599
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,720
Don't know.

1600
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,720
Yeah, I was following the two options.

1601
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:47,720
I was rooting for that.

1602
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,720
Right.

1603
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,720
Yeah.

1604
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:50,720
One's on Thursday.

1605
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:51,720
One was on a Saturday.

1606
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,720
And the Saturday one would have been easier.

1607
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,720
But the Fleetwood Mac's on Thursday.

1608
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,720
Yeah.

1609
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,720
Yes.

1610
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:56,720
JBtitles.

1611
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,720
JBtitles.com.

1612
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,720
Everybody, let's vote.

1613
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,240
Can I ask for some help?

1614
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,240
Yeah.

1615
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,240
Do it.

1616
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:09,960
So, I've had an audio failure, and I've heard some of you and the other guys talking about

1617
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:15,160
USB sound cards and what have you, and I'd like some advice on what should I get that's

1618
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:20,720
relatively inexpensive and reliable for plugging in headphones and mic.

1619
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,720
I got this.

1620
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,720
Good.

1621
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,720
Good.

1622
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,720
Anything with a cMedia chipset is going to do perfectly.

1623
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:29,440
Honestly, the cheapest one.

1624
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:33,680
The cheapest one that does that is actually it's called the Daffodil.

1625
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:38,600
I know it's absolutely ridiculous, but if you go on Amazon, it's called the Daffodil

1626
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,600
USB sound card.

1627
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,360
It's like $8.

1628
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,400
It's the most wonderful little thing that you'll ever buy.

1629
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,240
I was going to mention that one actually.

1630
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,280
It uses a cMedia chipset.

1631
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,280
Yeah.

1632
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,280
Yeah.

1633
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,280
And then it's super simple.

1634
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,280
Yeah.

1635
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,280
They almost all do.

1636
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,280
That then has mic and headphone jacks, does it?

1637
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,280
Or do you...

1638
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,280
It does.

1639
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,280
Yes.

1640
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,280
It is.

1641
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,280
Right.

1642
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,440
It's a USB headset and mic integrated thingy.

1643
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,440
Is that a good idea?

1644
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,440
Yes or no?

1645
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,440
Yeah.

1646
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,440
Those are good too.

1647
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,960
That could do the trick, especially if your main sound chip is blown.

1648
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:08,960
Yeah.

1649
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,360
That's what I use right now.

1650
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,960
My microphone that I'm using right now is a cMedia chipset and it's a USB microphone.

1651
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:16,960
Yeah.

1652
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:17,960
A lot of the headset ones are cMedia too.

1653
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:22,400
The nice thing about the headset is then you've got headphones and mic in one, so that's nice

1654
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,520
for mumble.

1655
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:31,120
I literally have three or four, five of those really, so let's see, one, two, three in my

1656
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,040
view right now of those cMedia sound cards.

1657
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:39,000
We just use them around the studio because they work so well under every OS and when

1658
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,960
I need audio out of a box, I just go there and plug one in.

1659
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,960
I don't have...

1660
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:42,960
This is it.

1661
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,360
I've got two workstations here, both of which have let me down this evening.

1662
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:50,760
My laptop, I couldn't get on last week when I was traveling because my laptop mic input

1663
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,160
has died.

1664
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:56,280
So I'm trying to find something that I can plug into whichever machine I'm on and rely

1665
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,280
on.

1666
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,280
Plug and go, really, the headset's super easy.

1667
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,280
Right?

1668
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,680
The headset's going to be the most dependable in my experience.

1669
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,600
Platronics, I buy them by the gross.

1670
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,320
I get them at thrift stores and just stick them in a box and I'm overflowing with them.

1671
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,760
The biggest variance is going to be mic quality on the headsets and you just look at the different

1672
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,560
reviews and stuff and you'll probably find it.

1673
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,560
Yeah.

1674
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,880
There's not too much difference between the actual USB sound device at all.

1675
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:18,880
So a RAM, one, two, three.

1676
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,200
Is there any hardware compatibility issues there?

1677
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:25,320
Well, like Ram's pointing out, and I have run into this too, in fact, it bit me during

1678
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,320
the pre-show.

1679
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:31,680
Sometimes, I don't know if it's the cMedia driver or what, but sometimes I go to shave

1680
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:35,560
off like just a little bit of volume towards the low end and it just totally silences it.

1681
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,800
Like there's a really, like it just drops off at the end really fast.

1682
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,800
Yes.

1683
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:46,120
And that's more than cMedia because I have an Audio Technica USB cardioid microphone

1684
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:51,560
and it has a built-in sound card so that the whole thing can just be plugged in via USB

1685
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:56,320
and it's the same thing and it's not a cMedia chipset at all.

1686
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,200
I have no idea what it is.

1687
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:02,720
I don't know if it's a USB thing or...

1688
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:05,160
I can speak for the Gamecom 780.

1689
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:11,040
I actually submitted a patch into the Linux kernel for it.

1690
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,320
And is it causing you problems?

1691
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,320
Nope.

1692
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,320
Oh, okay.

1693
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,320
They took it?

1694
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,320
Good.

1695
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,320
Okay.

1696
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,960
Any Platronics headset will work.

1697
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,920
I've had minimal problems with them over the years and I've used like 15 of them.

1698
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,920
I've never had compatibility issues ever.

1699
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:29,560
I agree exactly with that because I had one when I first started doing this and it worked

1700
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,560
brilliantly.

1701
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,480
Did we ever figure anything out about the tearing issue that our emailer was having?

1702
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,480
Yeah, sorry.

1703
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,120
I pasted it in the chat room earlier.

1704
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,120
Okay.

1705
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,120
Oh, okay.

1706
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,120
Would you mind pasting it again?

1707
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,120
Let me find it.

1708
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,120
Yeah, let me find it.

1709
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,120
Thank you.

1710
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,120
And I'll add that to the post-show notes.

1711
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,120
Cool.

1712
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,120
Thank you.

1713
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,920
I'm sure somebody listening at home will probably put in a comment too.

1714
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,960
And whatever headset you choose, really the big test is that if it can take being run

1715
01:19:53,960 --> 01:20:00,160
over, dropped, stepped on, lost, basically abused, that's my... Exactly.

1716
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,360
And never be afraid.

1717
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,960
If you find one that works, buy a couple.

1718
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:03,960
Trust me.

1719
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:04,960
You'll thank me later.

1720
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,960
Yeah, because they go out.

1721
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:09,320
They just... Plantronics had a really, really good one for a long time and they just... They

1722
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,820
still have good ones, but they quit making the one I really like.

1723
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:12,820
They just quit making it.

1724
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:13,820
It's like, oh no.

1725
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:14,820
I got the old school one.

1726
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:18,360
I got the one I have on the other computer and it's got the actual adapter attached to

1727
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,360
the cord midway.

1728
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,360
I mean, it's like the best one I own.

1729
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:25,360
So the other headset after they stopped making the one I really liked is I got the Logitech

1730
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:28,320
Gaming Series, the G-something.

1731
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:33,480
One thing I like about that one is it has a light on the mic itself so you know when

1732
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:37,760
your mic is live because it actually lights up the end of the microphone and then you

1733
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,920
just flip it up and it auto-mutes the mic, which is kind of nice.

1734
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,120
You know your mic's muted if the headpiece is up.

1735
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,120
Oh, I like that.

1736
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,480
You can turn it down and it un-mutes, which is kind of cool.

1737
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,640
And then if you have it on a Windows box, it supports... I don't think it... I've

1738
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,240
never tried it on Linux, but it supports 7-point surround sound, quote, unquote.

1739
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,040
I don't... It's kind of a thing.

1740
01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:01,040
And with any USB anything with audio, again, don't ever depend on the default sound chooser.

1741
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,140
You're just going to frustrate yourself.

1742
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:19,400
Get yourself the Pulse Audio, a PavDev chooser or whatever the hell they call it.
