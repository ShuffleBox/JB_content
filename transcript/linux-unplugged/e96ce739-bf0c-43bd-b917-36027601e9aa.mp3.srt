00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
In celebration of Unix turning 50 today, we open with a special clip.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,520
Back in 1969, a couple of computer scientists here at Bell Labs started to develop some

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,020
programs they needed for their own use.

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,700
What Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie started developing then has evolved into the Unix

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,240
operating system, which by now is widely used around the world.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,060
We were trying to make computing as simple as possible.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,080
In the late 1960s, Dennis Ritchie and I realized that the then current operating systems were

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,940
much too complex.

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,400
We attempted to reverse this trend by building a small, simple operating system on a minicomputer.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,160
What we wanted to preserve was not just a good programming environment in which to do

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:58,880
programming, but a system around which a community could form, fellowship.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,400
Hello friends and welcome into the Unplugged program.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
My name is Chris.

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
And my name is Wes.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,400
Hello, Wes.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Hello.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,080
You know, we have something special planned for old 324.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,120
Oh, we've been hard at work.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
We have.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,840
We've been having a lot of fun this week.

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,720
We wanted to put ZFS and Extended 4 to the test.

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,000
The promise of ZFS is pretty high.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, yeah.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,320
But is there a performance bottleneck for that data security?

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,600
What's this going to be like using it for real day to day?

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,680
Yeah, maybe you're on a laptop, you've got an SSD, but it's nothing super fancy.

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,600
In our case, this week, we used a Samsung Evo 850.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,800
And we wanted to see how Extended 4 and ZFS performed against each other in both normal

29
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,120
conditions and lower memory conditions.

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,080
Maybe you've got a few electron apps running, you've got some tabs going, how then do things

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
perform?

32
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,480
And what kind of penalty do you take for that data security?

33
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,520
Or do you?

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
So we wanted to find out.

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,560
Plus, we've got some more thoughts on 1910.

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,240
And we've also been running Pop OS as just our daily driver, which has been pretty great.

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
We have some thoughts on that.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,040
And I had a quick chat with Carl from System76 and have some good little insight nuggets

39
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,320
from him on things we can talk about, including that upgrade process.

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,880
Yeah, that sounds pretty smooth.

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,840
I want to talk about that too.

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,600
But before we get to that and the community news and all the other goodies, I got to say

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,160
hello to Cheese and Alex.

44
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
Hello, gentlemen.

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Hey there.

46
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Hello, internet.

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Hello there.

48
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,880
And of course, a big time appropriate greetings to that mumble room.

49
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Hello.

50
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Hello.

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Hello.

52
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Howdy.

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Howdy.

54
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
Happy Linux Tuesday.

55
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
We've got a chipper bunch today.

56
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,080
That's great.

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,560
Everybody's been properly caffeinated, at least I have been.

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,080
Now I have to also admit that I've got a CPAP machine now.

59
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,260
So not only am I sleeping, but I'm also still caffeinating.

60
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,040
So you better watch out, Wes.

61
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,240
Superpower of regular sleep.

62
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,920
Well, we have some community news that I wanted to start with.

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,080
Besides the fact that Unix turned 50, they actually, it's a funny thing, I have some

64
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,200
links in the show notes, they celebrated over like a two day period.

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,800
So I think it was either yesterday and today or today and tomorrow.

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,040
But it's technically the 50th anniversary of Unix.

67
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,200
And I have a really great clip that when I was playing as part of a longer series.

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,700
And I linked that in the show notes.

69
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,200
So if you guys want to watch that, it's so great.

70
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
So great.

71
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,680
In fact, if I remember, I'll play part of a training video that they did.

72
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,360
Some of these old clips are hilarious.

73
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,320
But also, I mean, it's shocking both how far we've come in 50 years and also how much is

74
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
pretty much the same.

75
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Yeah.

76
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,800
It's kind of shocking how far we've come in 15 years.

77
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,020
This is a really great interview with Matthew Miller over at Tech Republic about Fedora

78
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,400
at 15 years old.

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Wow.

80
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
It doesn't feel like it.

81
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,680
Considering I was using Red Hat before Fedora as my desktop.

82
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Kind of it really does.

83
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,920
It kind of it shocks me.

84
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,600
It's really it's something.

85
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,520
It's been a long time, but it doesn't feel that long anyways.

86
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Good interview.

87
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
We'll leave it to you to read most of it.

88
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,820
But there's a couple of tidbits in here that I wanted to chat about with you guys.

89
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,800
Throughout the process, he asked a series of questions.

90
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
He being James Sanders, sorry, over at Tech Republic.

91
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,720
And one of the topics that comes up is flat packs and snaps.

92
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,560
And he asked why Fedora prefers flat packs as the portable application standard.

93
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,360
And Matthew responds, there are definitely some technical differences.

94
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,920
If you talk to our engineers who are working on this, they're very, very passionate about

95
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,040
the technical differences.

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,880
One of the things with snap is it's the answer to all things.

97
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,540
We see OCI docker containers as having won the server enterprise and IoT use cases.

98
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,840
Docker doesn't necessarily fit well for the desktop.

99
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,520
So flat pack is a technology specifically meant for the desktop.

100
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,920
I mean, it shows right?

101
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,320
We talk about that property of flat pack all the time.

102
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,080
It does put a different spin on it.

103
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,400
I kind of thought of it always as like a limitation.

104
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,980
You know, I kind of mix command line and gooey apps.

105
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,980
So this was weird.

106
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,940
That does make some sense, though.

107
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,800
I don't think I have heard that as clearly just enunciated like it's, it's just simply

108
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,160
not trying to address that I like you saw it more as an oversight as a lack of like

109
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
something.

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,820
Wait a minute, you know, Wes, now that I think about it, I think I've even seen developer

111
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,120
statements to the extent saying they were planning to add server support, like that

112
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,160
was something they were going to build in later on.

113
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,640
I'm pretty sure I've read those statements.

114
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,380
Perhaps things have changed because I also tend to agree with this, as I've been getting

115
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:41,080
pretty excited about self hosting, and been spinning up more and more of my own infrastructure.

116
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,600
I've had the option for a couple of them to use snaps.

117
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
But the reality is it's containers all the way down, baby.

118
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,240
Yeah, and mostly advice and workflows and styles of doing so well, it's built around

119
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
the container ecosystem.

120
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,280
And that ecosystem has come a long way in having cross compatibility on its own.

121
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm glad to hear that, Chris, by the way.

122
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
I bet you are.

123
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,020
I mean, you know, the thing is, is, you know, this very well.

124
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,440
It's just that containers just kind of came in and became a default way for people to

125
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,680
ship software on servers.

126
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
Absolutely right.

127
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,600
For better or for worse, in some cases, perhaps, but we're not here really to debate that today.

128
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,280
There's a part in this interview that he touches on about improvements that have come along

129
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,820
or innovations, as the article puts it.

130
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,080
And I was just waxing about this on the live stream about how this has really changed the

131
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
game for me.

132
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Yeah, right.

133
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,040
It is something if you think about it, it makes sense.

134
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,600
And Matthew Miller's answer is interesting.

135
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,960
I think it's when the graphics driver people decided to go with open source, Intel buying

136
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,240
in first on the network drivers, and then on the graphics drivers was huge.

137
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,680
Now AMD coming along, I have an AMD desktop that I use for gaming.

138
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,160
It's awesome how it just works without having to fiddle with anything.

139
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,880
I love that.

140
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,400
There's also obviously a subtext of, come on, NVIDIA, get with the program.

141
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,680
I am blown away on my desktop workstation upstairs.

142
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,000
I've got full 3D acceleration, and I'm playing nice games, and I'm using zero proprietary

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,440
drivers, no binary driver for my video card.

144
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
It's so great.

145
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,040
And then, of course, the Intel side has been like that for quite a while.

146
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Right.

147
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,280
Not for granted, but over the 15 years, that's definitely changed, and I wouldn't want to

148
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
go back.

149
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,240
Tech Republic also touches on a spot that seems to have really left a mark on the project.

150
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,960
This was a while ago in 2011, I think before Matthew Miller was even involved with the

151
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,060
project.

152
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,680
There was a shock to the ecosystem when Fedora 15 landed.

153
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,840
Fedora 15 was the version that shipped Gnome Shell for the first time, Gnome Shell 3.0.

154
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,400
At the same time, System D.

155
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Mm-hmm.

156
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Yeah.

157
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
What?

158
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,600
Miller says the release had an incredibly dramatic amount of change.

159
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,420
Both Gnome Shell 3.0 and System D. landed in that release, and basically, we lost half

160
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,960
our users doing that.

161
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,920
Or at least, put another way, half of them did not upgrade to Fedora 14, and they stopped

162
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
growing.

163
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,000
They say it was a pretty bad situation, and that there were plenty of ways that blame

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,360
was getting thrown around, but just absorbing all of that change all at once is really hard

165
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
on people.

166
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,360
But what they learned, if you look at the Gnome user interface, is if you go back and

167
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,280
install Gnome 3.0 and compare it to 3.3.2, it's a very different experience.

168
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Yeah.

169
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
I mean, he's totally right.

170
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,840
I don't think about it that way, but it is.

171
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Oh, it is radically different.

172
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,060
It was a totally, it was almost a different vision now.

173
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:39,600
He says in here, I think that if Gnome Shell goes to 4.0, it's not going to be a radical

174
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,120
redesign like that.

175
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,560
It's going to be architectural shifts under the hood.

176
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
That makes sense, right?

177
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,760
I mean, we need to move, and yes, Fedora moves quickly, but at the end of the day, I still

178
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
want it to work.

179
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
15 years old.

180
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Are you kidding me?

181
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Are you kidding me?

182
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,280
Here's to the next 15, huh?

183
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
No kidding.

184
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,760
I'd love to know a little more, Chris, what you mean when you say that version three is

185
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,600
such a huge departure from 3.3.2.

186
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,040
Oh, boy.

187
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,760
Well, first of all, it's a huge, there's a lot of UI differences.

188
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,960
It's very, very big, like big.

189
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,960
It's big.

190
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Everything's big.

191
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Everything's touch focused.

192
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Huge.

193
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,120
It looks like a maniac.

194
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,760
Crashes like Richard Hammond, just frequently and big, and also is very, very, very early.

195
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
It's very rough.

196
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,920
Let's just say a clunky doesn't feel well put together yet.

197
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Go look at a screenshot of it.

198
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,280
It's really, it's remarkable, and if you remember back then too, touchscreens were really becoming

199
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
a big thing.

200
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:43,500
The iPad was a new product, the PC was a truck, and iPads were a car, and everybody was going

201
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,960
to be on a car.

202
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,320
What date was name three released?

203
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
I don't know.

204
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
I mean, it was a long time ago.

205
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
I'll look it up.

206
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,280
Kind of, you know, I think I recall where I was when I heard about it.

207
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,720
There's a few major moments.

208
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,640
I remember where I was when Unity was announced.

209
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,600
I remember where I was when it was announced that Unity was ending.

210
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,740
I was at Linux Fest Northwest when it was announced in a room with Brian, and we were

211
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,680
about to do Alas.

212
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:20,640
And I was at Dell when they announced that it was ending with Noah in a room with the

213
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,000
Sputnik team who also learned about it at the same time, and it was really something.

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,160
So name three was April 2011, so it's a different world in terms of mobile and everything else,

215
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
you know?

216
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
Absolutely.

217
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,080
Well, speaking of interviews, just a quick plug for me.

218
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,880
I was interviewed by opensource.com, Mr. Don Watkins, a gentleman over there who I've met

219
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
in Denver.

220
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Really nice guy.

221
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Yeah, we met him over at System76.

222
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,280
Look at you with the memory.

223
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,240
Just dang, West is on fire today.

224
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,120
And it's a Jupiter Broadcasting origin story and sort of like the future where we're going

225
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
under the wing of Linux Academy.

226
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,640
And it published a couple of weeks ago.

227
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,160
I just have not been good about mentioning it because I was traveling.

228
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
It's worth a read, though.

229
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
I mean, it's not too long.

230
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Oh, stop.

231
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,360
I even learned some things.

232
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
You did?

233
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Oh, yeah.

234
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Really?

235
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Yeah.

236
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
I mean, there's a lot of stuff in kind of the longer term history that I just didn't

237
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
know.

238
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Early days stuff.

239
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Sure, yeah.

240
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
We'll put a link in the show notes if people are interested.

241
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,520
I think, you know, that kind of stuff to me, it's like I'm so focused on what we're working

242
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,480
on now that I actually kind of forget every now and then to look back at how far things

243
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
have come.

244
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
And it really is pretty remarkable.

245
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,240
It's pretty, like I was just saying to West, it's like, you know, it's really, there's

246
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,400
a lot that has changed.

247
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:41,200
And in such a way that I'm really proud of, it's really been for the benefit of us taking

248
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,040
our craft more seriously and trying to do a better job and trying to do better reporting

249
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,040
and doing research and contacting sources, all these things, staffing editors, it's been

250
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
pretty awesome.

251
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,880
It's just enabling us to do a better job of doing this.

252
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
It's been iterative.

253
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,640
If you've been a listener for a while, you can really hear an iterative trend.

254
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,160
And that's another nice way of saying our old stuff is really crappy.

255
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,360
I mean, you tell me if the whole clip, oh boy.

256
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
It's bad.

257
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
We just cringe.

258
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
All right.

259
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,480
Well, we got a little interesting valve news in the show.

260
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,680
It's been a while.

261
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,600
Did you hear about Steam Remote Play?

262
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,960
It is a new Steam feature that lets you play on your couch or on your computer with your

263
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,840
friends over the internet.

264
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,760
With Remote Play together, they say, you can now invite Steam friends to join your local

265
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,760
co-op or your local multiplayer with a shared or split screen game.

266
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Yeah.

267
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,040
Only the host needs to own and install the game.

268
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,720
The additional players just connect through Steam Remote Play.

269
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,640
It's kind of neat because it just kind of shows up as a menu entry item.

270
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,100
If everybody supports it, it's just a little button and the menu says Remote Play together.

271
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
It's really easy.

272
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,100
Yeah.

273
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,400
And then like all your friends, their controllers just act like they are right there on your

274
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
computer.

275
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
And then you've got a little menu.

276
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,000
You can control voice and volume and hear everybody.

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is some magic.

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,880
It sounds so easy.

279
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,080
And they right here say just some words on the screen.

280
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Supports Linux.

281
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
It's going to be good.

282
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,080
I mean, you know, they've done a lot of work on the streaming stuff in the back end.

283
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,480
I remember playing with it, I don't know, four or five years ago now.

284
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,560
And I haven't heard about it since.

285
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Obviously it still works.

286
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
So it's nice to see a new development.

287
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,920
I have to tell you, man.

288
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,680
I had a Valve developer in my ear like two years ago telling me we're doing big things

289
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,680
with streaming.

290
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
Just wait.

291
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
And I was like, great.

292
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,240
Oh, I'm super excited.

293
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,000
And then never heard anything and never saw anything.

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,600
I was like, oh, that project must have been killed.

295
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
I think this is this is what it was.

296
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Skunkworks.

297
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
It was in the Skunkworks for quite a while.

298
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,280
And sometimes this stuff takes a little while to suss out, especially when you're supporting

299
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,720
Windows, Mac and Linux.

300
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,600
I mean, and over the network, that's always a little bit tricky.

301
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,480
Well, I'm curious how it's doing the device stuff.

302
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,040
Like how is it taking my like, say I got a controller over USB or Bluetooth hooked up

303
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,240
to my Linux box.

304
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,120
Is Steam just taking those inputs and then forwarding it to the remote?

305
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,520
Is it just like raw throwing it over the network?

306
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,640
Is there something more sophisticated in the middle?

307
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,240
The other thing that's fascinating about this, as you think about it, is they're now first

308
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
to streaming.

309
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,360
They beat Stadia and they beat the Xbox.

310
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
I mean, does this count?

311
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
It is only in beta.

312
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,360
They're at least right.

313
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
They're up there.

314
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,040
I'll tell you what I like about it is without a shadow of a doubt, it's going to have the

315
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
best game catalog.

316
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,280
The thing I'm thinking about Stadia is I'm going to get my Stadia package in like late

317
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,840
November and it's going to show up and I'm going to be able to play two games that are

318
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
even worth it.

319
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
I hope you like them.

320
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
Yeah.

321
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,960
Whereas this could be any game I've ever owned in Steam and the fact that you can do local

322
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
player stuff.

323
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,800
So that opens up to a whole range of games and you're not having to futz with firewall

324
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,840
stuff or anything.

325
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,080
So got to give this a go.

326
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
I'm going to try it.

327
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,800
You know, I haven't really needed or needed to do this, had an opportunity, but it's something

328
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
I'd be worth it.

329
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,640
You know, the whole Steam Machine thing.

330
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
It's funny.

331
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Now it's almost a perfect time.

332
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,320
I kind of want just a little Steam Machine set up next to my TV now.

333
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Oh yeah.

334
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
Steam Machines.

335
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Oh yeah.

336
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Oh yeah.

337
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,840
That was a thing for a little bit.

338
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,760
Oh, you know, you know what you always say, Wes, and you always say this.

339
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,240
It turns out if you try hard enough, you can.

340
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
But sometimes not.

341
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
Yeah.

342
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:28,360
Hey, why don't we just take a moment and mention that the Gnome Foundation is full on fighting

343
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,960
this patent troll that is coming after them for this Shotwell photo transfer feature.

344
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Yeah, they're bringing it.

345
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
It's nice to see.

346
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,080
It is really nice to see.

347
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,000
And in that effort, they are attempting to raise some funds.

348
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,920
So so far they've done pretty good.

349
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,000
They've got 108 donors and they have raised $28,000.

350
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,320
They have a goal of 125, but my instinct says they could probably use triple that amount

351
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
because it'd be really nice for them to be able to bring this fight.

352
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,440
So we're going to have a link in the show notes Linux Unplugged dot com slash three

353
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
to four.

354
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,280
If you can throw, you know, any amount at them.

355
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,240
They have some one times that are just click one buttons.

356
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,180
They have some monthlies you can do.

357
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,560
It looks like it's a really nice, clean, simple, not going to have to like sign up with a whole

358
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,640
bunch of accounts crap to do it.

359
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,900
And it would definitely be a good cause because even if you're not a Gnome Shell user, this

360
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,160
patent fight is really important because if they can come well, I guess another way to

361
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,480
put this is Shotwell is damn lucky they're part of the Gnome Foundation.

362
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,700
If they were an open source independent project that wasn't part of a foundation like this,

363
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,180
they would be royally screwed right now.

364
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,040
So it's important that even if you're not a Gnome Shell user, that we help them fight

365
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
this crap.

366
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Right.

367
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,320
I mean, we want to send this tone that you don't you don't get to be abusive and trolling

368
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,160
these open free and open source projects.

369
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,980
You know, it gets me worked up and I'm already over caffeinated with and you know what happens

370
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,320
when I get worked up as I start renting.

371
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Let me get the soapbox.

372
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
Yeah.

373
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Yeah, we left it outside.

374
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,160
It's been a little while since we got up on the soapbox.

375
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
You never know.

376
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
It could be just around the corner, though.

377
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,720
You can never tell with that soapbox.

378
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,480
It's sometimes it's sometimes lurking.

379
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Well, you're right.

380
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
It was very easy.

381
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
I've just made a donation now.

382
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Really?

383
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,600
Once I got past identifying the cars in the capture, of course.

384
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Oh, yeah.

385
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,680
You got to make sure you find the cars.

386
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
Or buses.

387
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Somebody's got to train that machine.

388
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Let's do a little housekeeping.

389
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:27,840
Oh, so we went down to Texas, went to a cyber summit, and you may be wondering how that

390
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
went.

391
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,680
Well, my friends, I've got just the thing for you.

392
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,860
Elle, Wes, Cheese, and myself did an extra on our trip to Texas Cyber Summit extras dot

393
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,560
show slash 24.

394
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:46,400
Nice little wrap up of not just what it's like for some Linux people to go to a cyber

395
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,440
summit, but also good details on the great food that Carl took us to.

396
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Oh, boy.

397
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,880
So don't listen if you're hungry.

398
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
I can't help it.

399
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,760
You know, I just got Carl, you might want to listen to that.

400
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,180
I think you get name dropped a couple of times in that one.

401
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:07,920
And also, to go along with that, Elle wrote up a fantastic write up wrote up write up

402
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,080
blogged blog post.

403
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Don't call it a blog.

404
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,080
It's an article.

405
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,360
Article post that will link in the show notes.

406
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,680
It has some descriptions, some pictures, some some of the characters I was talking about

407
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,280
in that extra.

408
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,580
And then if you want even more than that, cheese is popping off like crazy in that Jupiter

409
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,580
gallery.

410
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,580
Jupiter.

411
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,580
So good.

412
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,580
Dot gallery.

413
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,580
How about that?

414
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,580
Jupiter dot gallery.

415
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,580
Chris, what's this?

416
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,580
You say you say, well, here we go out to these things like these Linux fests.

417
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,120
Or maybe you heard about Alex and I taking a road trip to go see Wendell recently or

418
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,800
Texas Linux Fest or Red Hat Summit or Linux Fest Northwest and you wonder, are there any

419
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,720
pictures from this event?

420
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,760
Well, friends, cheese bacon has the answer for you.

421
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
That's right.

422
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,240
And if you have any pictures from these events that you'd like to submit, you can do so by

423
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,860
emailing me at cheese at Jupiter broadcasting dot com and that's CHZ at Jupiter broadcasting

424
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,160
dot com and I'll be happy to put them on the gallery.

425
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,400
That's the best part is as that happens, when I go back and check, there's like more pictures.

426
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
There's new stuff.

427
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
I haven't seen.

428
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Yeah.

429
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Yeah.

430
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Jupiter dot gallery.

431
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,480
What else do I got to say?

432
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,120
We'll just keep updating that throughout the next year and stuff as we go to events and

433
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
whatnot.

434
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,680
Well, we'll have that up there and check out extras.

435
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,840
Extras dot show slash 24.

436
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,380
But not just that one.

437
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,120
For goodness sake, go over there and and look at the what is a container listen to the what

438
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,380
is a container episode.

439
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
It's just 20 19.

440
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,200
I mean, you don't want to be behind.

441
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
You don't.

442
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,900
And it's 24 minutes.

443
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,240
And Alex, you did a great job explaining this stuff.

444
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,200
You and I talk about how we use these in practical setups that are approachable by people that

445
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,260
are either beginners or using this in an enterprise because we you know, we've really we've talked

446
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,260
about these things a lot.

447
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,000
We've taken all of the experience we have talking about these and Alex talks about them

448
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,640
all day for his day job.

449
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,040
And we've put it into this episode.

450
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,360
So I think it's helpful for people.

451
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,640
And it's a great companion for the new self hosted show.

452
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,800
Check that out.

453
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,420
Extras dot show.

454
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,780
And also recently, some brunches just got posted.

455
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,920
So got to go get so many good brunches, especially that one there with Alan Jude mentioned that

456
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,920
last week.

457
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,000
You got to go get that Alan Jude brunch, you know, he's gonna be talking about BSD and

458
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,480
making your question your Linux faith.

459
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,360
You don't want to miss that.

460
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,520
And then come back to Linux on plug and we'll set you straight.

461
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
It's true, though.

462
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
All right.

463
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,360
That's the housekeeping for this week.

464
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,920
I mean, speaking of Linux, right?

465
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Mm hmm.

466
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,040
Let's get into this 1910 in more detail.

467
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,080
There is a lot to talk about with this release, but we're gonna actually put some of it aside

468
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,720
and just wait for 2004.

469
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,560
And just focus on a few details for you this week that drew our attention.

470
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,480
And one that I know cheese and I have been talking about, and I think West you and I

471
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,440
talked about a little bit is I'm noticing more than I thought I would that there's a

472
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,860
lot of apps in the software center that are actually snaps.

473
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,440
It seems to be with the way it works is if there is a snap version of an application,

474
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,320
the software center prefers that and installs that first.

475
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,380
Now, maybe we should be clear.

476
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,520
How are you noticing this right because Oh, they clearly label it right.

477
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
But would you have noticed right?

478
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Isn't that the test?

479
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,240
You know, is it detrimental if you're a regular user?

480
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Do you care?

481
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,280
Because you're investigating, you know, we're doing a review here.

482
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,880
The only two ways in which I notice it is startup time.

483
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,800
And when I sometimes go to edit something on my local file system, it's like a couple

484
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
clicks.

485
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Right.

486
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
There's the confinement comes into play.

487
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Yeah.

488
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,480
And so there's a couple of instances where I'm like, well, the job of this application

489
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,560
is to be like all over my file system.

490
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,520
So I don't actually want the snap version.

491
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,160
And the way I've just worked around that is I just didn't go to the terminal, I apt install

492
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,680
and I got the debt.

493
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,680
Right.

494
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,680
But to your point, for the most part, no, not really actually an issue.

495
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,200
And in the case of VS code seems to have been a net benefit because it just like self updated

496
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,360
and got the latest VS code and it was good to go.

497
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
Right.

498
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
Yeah.

499
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
Yeah.

500
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Yeah.

501
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,600
And it does seem like they've gotten better, you know, I mean, the, the, the theming, the

502
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,760
system integration, that stuff is a lot better than the last time I used these.

503
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Yes.

504
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,760
Yes.

505
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
That has been, that has gotten a lot better.

506
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,640
So cheese, you had a chance to not just only use stock 1910, but also Mate 1910 over the

507
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
week, trying out different systems.

508
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,440
And what was your extra week with 1910 like?

509
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
Overall it was great.

510
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,960
So I started with the beta, then the dailies, and then the final.

511
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,680
I tried it on three different machines.

512
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:35,360
I tried it on my desktop, which is a rise in 2600, 16 gigs of Ram, 256 gigabyte NVME

513
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:43,520
and an Nvidia 1060, an older Dell and Spearion and this new ThinkPad 440 S T 440 S that I've

514
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,840
recently picked up.

515
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:52,660
I will say that out of the box whenever I try to Ubuntu, I installed steam immediately

516
00:22:52,660 --> 00:23:00,080
went to CSGO, dropped in and was playing some games, some deathmatch there in CSGO and I

517
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,920
was averaging around, you know, 200 frames per second, something like that.

518
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
What?

519
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Yeah.

520
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
200 frames per second.

521
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,840
What do you normally get on that box?

522
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,240
Under windows, it was right around the same.

523
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,720
So I mean, there was really no difference.

524
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:21,080
It would peak up to like 230 frames a second, which was about average for what windows was

525
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
doing as well.

526
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,360
Oh, so this was your, uh, the last windows box, the gaming rig.

527
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Yes.

528
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,520
So this was the gaming rig that I ditched.

529
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,760
Um, I had an extra NVME tossed in there and I ditched the SSD.

530
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,800
Are you telling me 1910 killed windows for you?

531
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
Uh, yeah.

532
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,080
I mean, I really, the desk, this desktop was only ever really used for gaming anyway.

533
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,640
So, um, I decided just to make that, make that jump.

534
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,040
I do have the fallback SSD if I want to toss it back in the box.

535
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,900
I physically removed it though, so it would take some effort.

536
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,380
You go take this victory lap, geez.

537
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,240
This is a big moment and Wes and I are proud of you.

538
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Thank you guys.

539
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
God.

540
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
So good.

541
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,720
So it sounds like performance is comparable.

542
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,160
You haven't taken like a Linux tax for switching.

543
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
No, not at all.

544
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,680
And I was using the Nvidia, uh, which one thing that's awesome about 1910 is it comes

545
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,220
bundled with the Nvidia driver.

546
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,640
So I was using, um, the 435, uh, Nvidia driver, uh, worked great.

547
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,920
Um, whenever I flipped over to Monte though, I did notice a performance hit.

548
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,560
Uh, I was averaging about a hundred frames per second.

549
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,640
I'm not sure exactly what's going on there.

550
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,680
Again, this was just kind of out of the box testing.

551
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,320
I didn't do any additional stuff.

552
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,120
So you're saying you had a hundred frames per second switch that there must be something

553
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
there.

554
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,640
There that's gotta be a bug or comp is issue or something probably worth troubleshooting

555
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,080
or the fact that Linux and Nvidia aren't best friends could be a thing too.

556
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
I don't know.

557
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,400
So, um, I had some PI problems in my week with 1910.

558
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,680
I mean, we primarily, the rest of the episode, we're going to talk about the ZFS and extended

559
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,640
four and comparing that in low memory and regular memory.

560
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:04,520
But I just want to take a moment and say that they sneaky included support for the PI four

561
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
in 1910.

562
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
It was sneaky.

563
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,600
They did list it in their official, like a canonical.com.

564
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Not much before.

565
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Yeah.

566
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,440
So PI four supports not easy and it's something that distributions are slowly getting to.

567
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,040
There are architectural changes that are pretty significant.

568
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:30,080
I heard it described as the PI four is in appearance in similarity only to the previous

569
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,480
PI's like there's all, there's total differences for the USB stack for the, for the way that

570
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,920
the PCI bus is addressed for the video card.

571
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,480
Like there's just major changes.

572
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,120
Isn't it great that we don't have to care about that at all?

573
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
I mean, once it's fixed.

574
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,000
And if you're using Raspbian and you don't even think about it, they just did it.

575
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,720
Which yeah, that's the point of Raspbian, but they got, they got like the bulk of everything

576
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,120
in 1910 to their credit, which is great because people like to use that Raspberry PI's for

577
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,880
like Kubernetes training and things like that.

578
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,740
And I threw it on there and they spun two images, a 32 bit and a 64 bit.

579
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:11,840
As we record, although this is very rapidly in progress, the 64 bit image has an issue

580
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,640
where USB devices don't work.

581
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,200
And there's a couple other limitations of it.

582
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:25,280
It's an issue once you go over like three gigs of RAM ish, like 348 I think is the magical

583
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
number.

584
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,020
And the USB quits working.

585
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,680
And so if you use the 32 bit image, it's totally fine and no issues.

586
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,480
So you get to play around with 1910 on a Raspberry PI if you're okay with 32.

587
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,120
But you've been hoping to escape 32.

588
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,440
Come on, 32 bit, everybody knows it's going away.

589
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,680
I mean, you're using all the bits.

590
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,760
I will mention to the 64 bit and 32 bit images have SSH turned on by default.

591
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,800
So even if you can't use the USB to like plug in a keyboard, if you got the ethernet plugged

592
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,480
in, you can still SSH it.

593
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
Perfect.

594
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,920
They already have it in progress though.

595
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,320
I did a little, you know, I did my part in the bug report because I was a good boy this

596
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,680
time and went in there and said, here's my system information.

597
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,360
Here's my, you know, I can reproduce the bug.

598
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,480
And they seem to have identified the, all the issues and fixes are in progress right

599
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
now as we record.

600
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,840
So they'll probably, I don't know, maybe they'll spin a new image, I would hope.

601
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Yeah, hopefully so.

602
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,560
Hopefully it just works in the future.

603
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Yeah.

604
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
Now what about you?

605
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
How's your week been on 1910?

606
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,160
Any updates to your initial impressions last week?

607
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,720
Honestly, I mean, it's just been pretty smooth.

608
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,480
I had to, you know, make a few changes here, there.

609
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,080
There's an app armor was still enabled on this system, which I mean, I left it enabled,

610
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,720
but you know, I did some tweaks, got all my regular tooling working.

611
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,840
Really it's kind of just nice.

612
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,960
I mean, I've been enjoying neon and I do miss plasma sometimes there's little, little pieces

613
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,400
of my workflow that I just haven't really adapted over, but I have surprisingly few

614
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
complaints.

615
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Like there's no weird oddities.

616
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,600
I haven't had any glitches.

617
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,940
There's been no surprising reboots or programs not working.

618
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,640
And I was doing a bunch of testing, sort of messing around with some of the bootloader

619
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,940
stuff and modifying the system.

620
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,200
It's just resilient.

621
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,920
My past experiences with gnome shell tell me that this may be subject to change, but

622
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,760
right now I haven't had any shell stability issues.

623
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,920
It's all been very solid, very reliable, and I'm very happy to report that I had a chance

624
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,200
to try out pop as well.

625
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,960
I think we all did.

626
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Most of us.

627
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,480
Boy, did I see a lot of excitement online about this.

628
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,520
I wasn't even positive I was going to try it out, but then I was getting so much like,

629
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Hey, Chris, you got to try this.

630
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,920
Hey, Chris, have you tried pop?

631
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
It's really good.

632
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Yeah.

633
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Talking about the release.

634
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Yes.

635
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,440
So we did some digging into what, why are people so happy about this?

636
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,640
Like what's going on?

637
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,080
And there's a few things that I think a system 76 has done here, but the one that like a

638
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,560
lot of people were talking about on day one and two for obvious reasons was how buttery

639
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:55,360
smooth the upgrade process was from the previous version of pop.

640
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,120
And they appear to have done some custom engineering around this.

641
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,280
And so I emailed Carl, the CEO of system 76 and asked him, what have you guys done to

642
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,760
change the upgrade process?

643
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,880
And why is it, why is everybody saying it's so much better?

644
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,940
Carl wrote back and he said, the Ubuntu updates weren't well integrated into gnome and we

645
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,660
found that live upgrades while in the user session can be unreliable.

646
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:25,040
We also had no way to communicate the upgrade and changes to the user through the product.

647
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,760
Instead users learned about the available upgrades through news or social media or like

648
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,440
an email campaign or whatever.

649
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,540
Now customers receive a notification when there's a new OS upgrade and they click a

650
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,260
button to start the process.

651
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,220
The pop upgrade first prepares the system for upgrade, ensuring that all the required

652
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,360
dependencies and upgrades are in place and then downloads the new packages.

653
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,660
If there are conflicts, the upgrade is automatically rolled back.

654
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,040
The customer can go off and do other work while the upgrade is being prepared and downloaded.

655
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,840
They'll receive a second notification when the upgrade is ready to be installed.

656
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,760
The tracking upgrade prompts to reboot where the offline upgrade will then take place.

657
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,420
And with the pop upgrade, customers will be able to upgrade from an LTS to any release.

658
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:14,260
So for example, if you decide you don't want to be stuck on pop 1804 until 2004, you could

659
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,600
go to 1910.

660
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,540
You'll be able to jump directly from 1804 to 1910.

661
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,240
That's coming in early November.

662
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,880
So they've done some really interesting engineering there.

663
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,760
So I love some of the other things.

664
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,400
He says to him, the most striking change in 1910 is the new aesthetic.

665
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,000
The team, Kate himself, Ian, they started working together on a new color palette and

666
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
contrast.

667
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,880
He says they measured the contrast ratios between elements and text to achieve a high

668
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,240
contrast by default rather than requiring a separate theme.

669
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,520
He says the difference is noticeable throughout, but especially in the shell menus.

670
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
He's right about that.

671
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,240
He says, I love the new dark color palette.

672
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
It's incredible.

673
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,560
It's like candy, like a luxurious kind of candy.

674
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,840
I think they're very proud of it.

675
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
It does look very nice.

676
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,080
I mean, I enjoyed using it.

677
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
Yeah.

678
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,180
Also worth mentioning their work around Tensor Man.

679
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:11,440
I didn't really appreciate what a pain in the butt apparently TensorFlow is to set up.

680
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
I love this.

681
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,280
Packaging TensorFlow for Linux distributions is notoriously difficult, if not impossible.

682
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
That's the first line of the GitHub.

683
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Yeah.

684
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,440
And I guess even like using the Docker container is still a huge pain in the butt.

685
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,280
You've got all kinds of different versions depending on quite what you're doing or how

686
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,880
you need TensorFlow configured.

687
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,000
And I mean, if you're running these just off the command line in Docker, it's not a lot

688
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
of fun.

689
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,840
So Tensor Man, which is a little Rust daemon, of course, it just sits there and makes this

690
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,120
easy for you and kind of orchestrates on top of Docker to get you all the stuff you need

691
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,000
and smooth out the process.

692
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
That's pretty great.

693
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,120
And it seems to me like they've keyed in on a good customer demo there because what do

694
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
they do?

695
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,680
They use powerful systems and like laptops and desktops that people buy to use TensorFlow.

696
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,000
Like that must be a decent customer base.

697
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Right.

698
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I mean, that could be pretty useful.

699
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,040
And if it just gets you out of the gate with the standard technology you want to use on

700
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Linux faster, that's superb.

701
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:15,120
The thing that I have to acknowledge before we go any further is I was skeptical of PopOS.

702
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,020
In fact, I was pretty vocal about thinking it was a bad idea that they had limited resources

703
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,560
and it could be better spent in other places.

704
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,760
We're several releases in now, and thankfully I left myself a little bit of wiggle room

705
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,760
on this.

706
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,720
And I said, you know, if they add value and they make it something that's a true differentiator,

707
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,240
then I'll reconsider.

708
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,400
They've done that.

709
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,840
They've done that with the installer.

710
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,360
They've done that with the upgrade process.

711
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,440
They've done that with the theme.

712
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,040
It's truly one of the best themes on Linux.

713
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,280
And now they've done it.

714
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,400
There's a couple other things that are in there, like the pop shop that are really nice.

715
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,000
Like they've opted to keep Chromium as a deb.

716
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,200
They can make that choice as they do with their platform.

717
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,440
They've integrated their system firmware updater into no shell settings now, just built right

718
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,440
in.

719
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
You don't have to go find it.

720
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,080
And even on a non-System 76 machine, I appreciate that.

721
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,180
That's I think what has stood out to me is it hasn't felt like Pop was some walled off

722
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,320
garden, hidden away, totally different.

723
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,360
It is its own thing.

724
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,880
But a lot of the stuff you can still take, right?

725
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,520
If I want to use Tensor Man, I can just go get that from GitHub and use it.

726
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,480
Or if I want to use the theme, but not all of Pop OS, that's possible too.

727
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,680
I think Pop OS, because it's not tied to System 76's hardware, you get benefits by using

728
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,000
it as I experienced in my recent laptop review.

729
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,680
But you don't really have any downsides.

730
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,980
There's like not any negatives to it.

731
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,520
And it's not so derivative of Ubuntu that it's totally different.

732
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,080
Mint is kind of its own thing.

733
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,480
You can still skirt by by following some Ubuntu tutorials or getting a PPA and it's probably

734
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,400
going to be fine.

735
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,880
But with Pop, there's no like probably about it.

736
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
It's going to be fine.

737
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
It just works.

738
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
And it's 1910.

739
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
They want it to work.

740
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Exactly.

741
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,840
So there's not a penalty really for using it.

742
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,580
There's an upside if you like their aesthetic and the value add that they've contributed.

743
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,420
And you're not running something that's so foreign that you can't just treat it like

744
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
an Ubuntu system.

745
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,420
Exactly.

746
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,640
So I really nailed a sweet spot.

747
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:18,240
And because of that, when I do one more reload for some testing upstairs, when I'm on my

748
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:25,420
final build for my daily driver workstation, I'm going with Pop 1910.

749
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:31,160
And the reason for me is I'm going to take Carl at his word about that upgrade system.

750
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,720
Because this is my got to get shit done workstation.

751
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,400
And I was after all of this going to just reload it back to an LTS.

752
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,560
I don't got time to play around on that thing.

753
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,960
When we reinstall all the other machines in the studio, you got to have one you know is

754
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
working.

755
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Right.

756
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,680
And I honestly was not looking forward to it because the new gnome shell has kind of

757
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,680
broken me.

758
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,680
It's very fast.

759
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,240
It's very nice.

760
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,560
And I hate to go back to slower.

761
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,200
Cannot stand to downgrade.

762
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,440
And I was really hemming and hawing putting it off.

763
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,600
And this gives me an opportunity here.

764
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:12,000
I can I can get the latest and greatest and have a pretty solid chance it's going to upgrade

765
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,640
as smoothly as say a fedora system will.

766
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,600
I mean, I'm already looking forward to finding out how that goes.

767
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
So I'm going to put it on my main workstation upstairs.

768
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Hooey Wes.

769
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Here I go.

770
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,400
You know, my dad used to have a saying, I used to be indecisive, but now I'm not so

771
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
sure.

772
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,160
I think that applies to you in desktop environments.

773
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,800
You know, hey, if they keep making it better, I'm not going to ignore it.

774
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
I'm no fool.

775
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,080
I'm going to acknowledge it.

776
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:44,120
Plus, I mean, you'll already be set up for making all those deep fakes.

777
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
You know, that's my new hobby.

778
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,760
I'm going to set up a side hustle where I just do deep fakes for hire.

779
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,880
I probably should have said that on air.

780
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,880
Damn it.

781
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,320
Well, I can I can attest to pop us being pretty solid, man.

782
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,280
I mean, I've been using it since March.

783
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,560
The upgrade process was super.

784
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,760
I mean, it was just painless.

785
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,480
It did, in fact, pop up, say that there's a new version available.

786
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,680
So what I did there, it popped up, hey, oh, it did say there was a new version available.

787
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,540
It pulled everything down, asked me to reboot, you know, installed the update perfectly right

788
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,580
back into it.

789
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,580
The new contrast.

790
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,640
I mean, immediately, you know, I could notice a difference.

791
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,020
And it was overall a really great experience for me.

792
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,560
I'm installing this on an older 2015 MacBook Pro.

793
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,440
And I really I really have no reason to to go with another distro on that machine, because

794
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,200
very much like you, it's just the get shit done type machine, you know, and it works

795
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
great.

796
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,160
I really have no reason to move anywhere else on it.

797
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,600
It was almost good enough to give me to give up fedora on the ThinkPad.

798
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,100
I got close.

799
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:53,720
And what I ended up doing to compromise is I went through and just beautied up my fedora

800
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
install.

801
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,720
Oh, it does.

802
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
It does look pretty nice.

803
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,120
I got my dash to doc more dialed in.

804
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,240
I got my theme dialed in.

805
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,320
I went and got the pop theme.

806
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,600
You know, something to note here, too.

807
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,840
There is no ZFS on route in the installer for pop OS.

808
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,900
So let's talk about ZFS on route.

809
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,680
The promise is huge.

810
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,100
Eventually one day you have a file system that protects you from bit rot.

811
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,040
It can do incremental snapshots that are elegant.

812
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,660
You could potentially have boot environments, you could move data around, you could over

813
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,120
commit storage.

814
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,280
It integrates with container platforms.

815
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,600
I mean, it's it's truly worth all of the hype.

816
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Right.

817
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
I mean, the advantages are clear.

818
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,960
Now, is it worth it on route, especially if maybe you don't have an MVD drive or maybe

819
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
you don't have 32 gigs of RAM?

820
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
Right.

821
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,540
Oftentimes we're thinking about, you know, big systems, maybe custom server builds that

822
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,760
you've designed to be running this file system with a lot of data.

823
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,000
The old myth was you can't use ZFS without ECC RAM.

824
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Right.

825
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And what about a laptop?

826
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,840
What about kind of not the newest laptop with run of the mill hardware?

827
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,240
Maybe you got a Samsung Evo in there, maybe you got 16 gigs of RAM and you got a few apps

828
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,460
you're using every single day and you don't have a bunch of available memory.

829
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,680
Is this still a good idea?

830
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,320
Genuinely did not know the answer to this question.

831
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,740
And now I'm feeling like we have figured it out.

832
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,720
So Wes and I, I'll give you I'll give you a little bit of basics.

833
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:23,720
So Wes and I took the Librem 15 with a Evo 850 drive, 512 gigabyte capacity and 16 gigabytes

834
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
of RAM.

835
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:33,640
And I think it's a Skylake processor and we installed Ubuntu 1910 fresh latest spun ISOs

836
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,960
and did one install with extended four and one install with ZFS on route.

837
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,280
Ran the same exact software setup, same exact steps, same exact benchmarks.

838
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,640
Then we did it all over again, but this time we robbed the system of RAM to create and

839
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,320
simulate a very exact amount on both of them.

840
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,440
We took out a chunk of RAM so both of them had to operate in a low memory environment.

841
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,720
And then we started a user session with a terminal and a web browser with some complicated,

842
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,360
but not overly complicated work in there that was reproducible in both environments.

843
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,360
Right.

844
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,100
You know, model something like maybe you're running a bunch of virtual machines or doing

845
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,440
other work or possibly just have a, you know, more low end computer available.

846
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Right.

847
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,540
And so we did things like we threw some compile jobs at the hard disk.

848
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,680
We threw some SQL work, creating lots of little files, creating large files, creating small

849
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
files.

850
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,440
We did it with as much RAM as the system could eat and we did it in a more memory pressure

851
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
environment.

852
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,000
So we essentially operated the system as if we were using about 60 percent of that 16

853
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,800
gigs when we did the low memory test.

854
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,680
Because then the way we got to this number is we took several of our systems here in

855
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,000
the studio and we loaded them up with our daily driver applications.

856
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,960
Couple of electron apps, some cute apps, some GTK apps, a web browser, a couple of terminals,

857
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,680
you know, that kind of stuff.

858
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,400
And then we came to an average memory usage after they'd been running for a while and

859
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,540
determined, all right, this is what it costs us in memory to run our workstations.

860
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:10,540
And then we allocated that for this test and ate that up virtually by just slicing it off

861
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:16,160
from the kernel saying you can't have it and let it go.

862
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,000
And what we found in some ways really surprised the heck out of me.

863
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,120
It's the answer on the broad perspective is it depends on your workload.

864
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
Of course.

865
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,300
Of course it does.

866
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:35,140
But there's some areas where even in low memory situations, ZFS pulled ahead.

867
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,140
Not in all areas.

868
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,140
No, certainly not.

869
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,400
Because there's many categories where EXE4 is just going to be faster, it's doing less.

870
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:48,320
If you were to attribute performance failures in a high memory pressure environment, it

871
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,600
was actually extended for the demonstrated most of the variance.

872
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,660
Yeah, that's what kind of surprised us the most is even test where maybe it was already

873
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:02,200
slower or already faster, the change between having more memory available and it was like

874
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,200
nothing in ZFS.

875
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,680
I mean, you know, it got a little bit worse, but not much.

876
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,160
There was some degradation, but not much.

877
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,640
And then much more for EXE4.

878
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:13,160
Yeah, you got like an entirely different box in some benchmarks with extended for now in

879
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,840
some situations, extended for may have still performed better than ZFS.

880
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,660
I'll give you an example.

881
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,700
Say you're unzipping a project and you're assembling it and getting it ready to compile.

882
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:29,640
In that situation, in a low memory or a regular memory situation, extended for is simply faster.

883
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,720
ZFS, though, remains consistent.

884
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,580
And then once you begin to actually build the project, and this could be attributed

885
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:42,080
to how ZFS caches files, ZFS is actually significantly faster than extended for.

886
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:47,040
Yeah, you know, it was a pretty healthy competition here between what EXE4 was better at and what

887
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
ZFS.

888
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,720
Certainly not one sided in favor of EXE4.

889
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
No.

890
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,520
Michael Lerbal did some of his own benchmarks over at Phyronix, which we'll have linked.

891
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,760
On some higher end hardware.

892
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,000
Yeah, and our results are pretty consistent.

893
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,040
Now he also had a bunch of other more like server applications, stuff like various databases.

894
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,120
And of course, those were faster with EXE4.

895
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,080
And I mean, that's kind of expected.

896
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:13,720
I was just surprised how similar things were just in the everyday use case and how resilient

897
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,100
ZFS was to memory pressure.

898
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,240
It doesn't really make sense to me if I didn't have the data here.

899
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,320
And we will publish all of this.

900
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,280
And you can compare it to your own systems.

901
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,680
If you are familiar with how to use the Phyronix test suite, actually comparing your system

902
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,060
to our benchmark is one of the easiest things to do with the test suite.

903
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,840
If you're just curious to see how your system would perform.

904
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,880
So we'll publish all of our data with the charts in the show notes.

905
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,280
But by going with this, I have to say, I would advise you're perfectly fine using ZFS.

906
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,640
When you add the benefits.

907
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
Right.

908
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,340
Yes, you're probably going to need to be taking care of the benefits and things may still

909
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,160
change here and how Ubuntu is using it.

910
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,120
And one time we did run into a little snag where grub wasn't quite updating properly

911
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,600
after, you know, and that only happened on the ZFS side.

912
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,080
So totally worth doing.

913
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,480
It does seems like it's very usable day to day.

914
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,480
Be aware, you may need to learn a few things about ZFS administration.

915
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,440
That is a good red flag to bring up because I'm only talking about it from a performance

916
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,960
penalty standpoint, not yet from an implementation standpoint.

917
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,320
That's still in flux.

918
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,900
And it's, as they label, experimental.

919
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:26,140
And you need to consider it as such because ZFS won't protect you from like a total different

920
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,900
scheme of layout change that's incompatible with what you got set up.

921
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:33,020
Like there's just nothing that's going to or like we ran into grub not updating properly

922
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,520
when we were trying to do a couple of small little things to reduce memory and increase

923
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
pressure.

924
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,000
Thankfully, we were just going to reinstall anyway.

925
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah.

926
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah, true.

927
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,200
So I do want to make sure it's clear at this point in time as we record, we are talking

928
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,000
about performance and not necessarily about implementation, but in a performance sense,

929
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,440
when you look at all of the crap ZFS does from snapshots to write verification to ZFS

930
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,640
send, which once you wrap your head around what you can do with ZFS send, Extended4 is

931
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,200
going to look like a child's file system.

932
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,640
And when you think about all of this, it just comes with ZFS and it's so big and it's got

933
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:19,240
all this stuff, the fact that it is competitive on a three-year-old laptop where we intentionally

934
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,480
drain the thing of RAM to give it a real world heavily used system condition.

935
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
I mean, we were monitoring too.

936
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,480
I mean, it was busy.

937
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,040
It was working hard.

938
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,040
It was working really hard.

939
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,040
It was great.

940
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:35,640
And I'm just damn impressed with what the ZFS project has managed.

941
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,640
I mean, ZFS on Linux, open ZFS in general, it's just fantastic.

942
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:45,400
And having it available, ready to go without messing around with DKMS, which by and large

943
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,520
is pretty reliable, but I still find myself running into issues and not having that, it

944
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,560
just feels so much more reliable and professional.

945
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:59,360
I thought what we'd do is I thought we'd come on the show and say, if you just need all-out

946
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,960
performance and you don't care about data integrity, snapshots or any of the other features,

947
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,600
compression, encryption, which by the way, we did not have compression turned on.

948
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,920
Compression may have significantly changed the game here.

949
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
We were just using defaults on both.

950
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,880
If we had used compression, ZFS may have kicked ass on this.

951
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,600
It would be really interesting to run it again actually now that I think about it.

952
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,280
Oh boy, there's always more benchmarks.

953
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,520
But anyways, I honestly thought at the end of all this, we'd come here and say, if you

954
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,340
just want full, nothing but performance, go with Extended 4.

955
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:35,240
But the reality is, depending on your use case, you may actually get higher performance

956
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,160
even in low memory conditions with ZFS, depending on your use case.

957
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,440
We have a few links in the show notes.

958
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,000
The one that I think would be really interesting for you to check out are the low memory versus

959
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:54,520
regular memory tests and the low memory Extended 4 versus low memory ZFS.

960
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,440
And then it's really easy to compare all of them actually, but we'll have the links in

961
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,440
the show notes.

962
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,360
There's some interesting data.

963
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:08,120
I walk away from this thinking, it's safe from a performance standpoint to use ZFS,

964
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,240
and even if it's on a system that you want to have high performance from.

965
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:17,360
And then there's additional benefits as you go up the hardware scale, like when you start

966
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,040
going to MV and E drives, there's additional benefits to going with ZFS.

967
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,040
It just gets better.

968
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,800
And when you start wanting to use multiple disks and pool them together, there's a lot

969
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,960
more benefits to going with ZFS that Extended 4 can't offer without having to strap on LVM

970
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,560
or other management tools, whereas ZFS brings it all in one suite of tools.

971
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,600
So this is really fascinating for me because what the data says is even in a worst case

972
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:47,600
ZFS scenario, old SSD, three-year-old system, limited memory, it's still very competitive.

973
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,760
And then when you put it in a situation where you have a lot more hardware to throw at it

974
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,200
and you have a lot more disks to throw at it, the benefits just really get bigger.

975
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,200
All right.

976
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
Well, then I think it's prediction time.

977
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,200
What do you think?

978
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,240
Does this pave the way to ZFS on root by default in a future Ubuntu release?

979
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,520
Can you see it?

980
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,600
I mean, it would make a lot of sense, especially on the server side when you want to protect

981
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,880
from bogus updates or configuration mistakes.

982
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,880
Right.

983
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,520
And it would be a big advertising point if you had that integrated into that Ubuntu tooling,

984
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,520
right?

985
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,280
Ubuntu is a great choice because look, you can just roll back.

986
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,160
If we could properly get boot environment support at grub, it'd be worth it just to annoy

987
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,040
the BSD crowd that already has it.

988
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,760
You know what I mean?

989
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,760
Look, we caught up.

990
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,760
Yeah.

991
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,520
But we talk about it like it's the first time we've got to pretend we've never heard that

992
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,520
they've done it.

993
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,520
Yeah.

994
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,520
They hate that.

995
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,520
Because they hate that.

996
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,520
They hate that.

997
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,520
And so that would really make it perfect.

998
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,080
And that's what I hope for.

999
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:49,960
Do you think that they would ever shift and do ZFS on the Ubuntu server while ext4 on

1000
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
the desktop?

1001
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,960
Could do.

1002
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,280
You know, on my machine upstairs when I reload it, I'm not going with CFS on my root.

1003
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,280
I'm still waiting.

1004
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,480
Again, because that's an implementation thing.

1005
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,600
Also likely go pop and they don't have it in the installer.

1006
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,800
However, I have three disks that I pooled together and I am absolutely going to move

1007
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,360
them over from XFS to ZFS.

1008
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,360
Right.

1009
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,360
That's the other nice thing here.

1010
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,960
Even if you don't do it on root, well, if you're running Ubuntu, it's at hand.

1011
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,720
I may be near the end of ever really using LVM again.

1012
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:23,560
Although LVM has been great and solid and I've got nothing against it, I like the ZFS

1013
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,560
tools better.

1014
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,680
And as I learn them more, I think they seem to be more complete.

1015
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,520
And the whole idea of bringing it all together where the file system is aware of the hardware

1016
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:38,520
and aware of the RAID and aware of what the user space is doing brings so many advantages.

1017
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,120
So it's a bright future either way, because you can still pick whichever file system floats

1018
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,120
your boat.

1019
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,880
But you could also go with something new and furniture.

1020
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,440
Chris, if you say it out loud, you know, the BSD folks might hear you.

1021
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,240
Are they listening?

1022
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,680
Have you done any ZFS experimentation over there?

1023
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,680
I have.

1024
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,680
Yeah.

1025
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,200
So I moved from Debian to Ubuntu for my primary server simply to get the ZFS support.

1026
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,200
Oh, really?

1027
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,200
Why?

1028
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,240
What was so like, gotta have?

1029
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,280
Because you've had what, various solutions in the past?

1030
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,040
I went to a talk by Jim Salter at Lennox Fest Northwest, and then Alan Jude gave me one

1031
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,000
of his books for free and that was that.

1032
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,360
That's having two devils on your shoulder in that case, Tanya.

1033
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,080
It's really compelling, you know, all the checksumming stuff.

1034
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:25,600
So the use case I use it for is I just have a pair of drives mirrored that store all of

1035
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,920
the irreplaceable data.

1036
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,880
So my drone footage, my photos and stuff like that.

1037
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,360
You know, the stuff that is irreplaceable, genuinely irreplaceable.

1038
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,480
And then I use ZFS Send to send that to England and then Duplicati does a bunch of other stuff

1039
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,480
with it as well.

1040
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,120
But I've really been enjoying it.

1041
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,480
And yes, there's a lot to learn and there's some monitoring stuff with how like DF handles

1042
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,720
monitoring free space and there are some things to learn, but I don't mind learning stuff.

1043
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,200
That's part of the fun for me.

1044
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,680
Yeah, it does have a learning overhead.

1045
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,360
Yeah, but that's true for, you know, anytime you kind of step out of the box, right?

1046
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,360
Even with ThunderFest.

1047
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,360
True.

1048
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,360
Okay.

1049
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,360
Yeah, very fair.

1050
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,840
Brent, you had a question about CFS capabilities.

1051
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:08,120
Yeah, well, I often tend to like default to using encryption in many places as a way of

1052
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,280
forcing myself to learn it.

1053
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,080
But I wondered about ZFS and encryption.

1054
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,520
Does anybody have any experience with that or has done any research?

1055
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,120
I haven't played with it too much yet, but they do now have it natively inside CFS.

1056
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,880
I think before I usually would, you know, kind of to layer it on, but that would sidestep

1057
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,600
some of the direct, give CFS direct access to the disk benefits.

1058
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,240
I haven't played too much with it though.

1059
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,560
Yeah, so it, I think just recently landed in the last couple of point releases for CFS

1060
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,600
on Linux.

1061
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:42,880
Rebsd has had some solutions for a little while, but it's pretty nice.

1062
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,920
One of the things that I'll probably look at doing in the future is you can, in CFS,

1063
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,800
you can have these concepts of pools of disks.

1064
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,560
So you can have like a media pool and like a documents pool and stuff like that.

1065
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:58,600
And you can do partitions across them or whatnot, but you can also just say encrypt everything

1066
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,720
in this pool.

1067
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,720
So if you have, if you want to have like a documents folder in your home folder, that

1068
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,960
could actually be mapped to an entire storage pool.

1069
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,480
That one folder could be mapped to the documents pool and you could just say anything I put,

1070
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,400
which just looks like a folder to you, but it's actually an entire pool of disks.

1071
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,520
Anything I put in this folder encrypted.

1072
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,400
And then once you set it, it's done.

1073
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,400
You don't worry about it.

1074
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,400
You're exciting me.

1075
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,240
I think, you know, it's not quite there.

1076
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:28,480
It's not daily driver yet, but we've got such great potential where the desktop environments

1077
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,040
and the toolkits around them, because like we haven't given a lot of attention to plasma

1078
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:38,400
on this release, but also just still doing great, still doing great, very solid and working

1079
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,200
away at their Wayland support, making it, making it a top priority for Kwin.

1080
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,840
It's really gotten to a good spot.

1081
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,640
So, and this is just another part of it.

1082
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:52,720
This is just, this is a part of the stack that we get to enjoy as free software users.

1083
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,720
We just get this stuff for free and a whole team of people worked on packaging this all

1084
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:03,080
up for us and then one day an arbitrary date, they decide you now get this thing and it,

1085
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,080
it can change your life.

1086
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,640
It can like, it can save your precious memories.

1087
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,600
It can change how you back up and move data around the world.

1088
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,580
It can provide features that you've never thought possible with your computer before.

1089
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,840
It makes your computer more capable, even if you choose not to use it.

1090
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,840
That's awesome.

1091
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,840
That's it, right?

1092
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,200
Like, I mean, there's no going back if you're like, Oh, I didn't think I'd want those pictures,

1093
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,120
but I left them on this old drive here.

1094
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,640
I mean, if you have ZFS underneath, you know, better safe than sorry.

1095
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,480
Well, and if you just look at it from like an old school, like imagine your, your favorite

1096
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,500
Linux distro as a boxed product on the shelf and you know, every year they got to have

1097
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,480
new bullet points on that box.

1098
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:44,720
Well, your favorite distro box, if it's Ubuntu based, just got some unbelievable features

1099
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,360
that just would, if you're looking at it from like features on a box standpoint, it's just

1100
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,360
incredible.

1101
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:54,160
And you combine that with everything else we can do on Linux these days and just, just

1102
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,920
blows my mind.

1103
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,920
Just blows my mind.

1104
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,620
So check out the links in the show notes for our benchmarks, including the comparison of

1105
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:06,480
low memory versus high memory, them with just, you know, having at the system as much as

1106
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,560
they can and then compare it to your system.

1107
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,700
Yeah, we'd love to see that.

1108
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,000
Maybe let us know if you get some interesting results.

1109
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,140
I have a pick for you this week that I think is going to be perfect for you, Mr. Bacon.

1110
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,480
It's called ThinkPad Tools.

1111
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,220
This is going to be applicable to everybody, but it's pretty nice for those of you that

1112
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,360
have a ThinkPad out there and it sounds like you just got one.

1113
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,360
Yeah.

1114
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,800
So I just recently picked one up.

1115
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:33,360
I picked up the older T440S.

1116
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:38,240
After doing some research, I probably should have got the T440P, but you know, it is what

1117
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,240
it is.

1118
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,560
170 bucks, 12 gigs of RAM, 256 gig SSD.

1119
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,560
I think he just wanted to brag.

1120
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,560
That's why he brought this up.

1121
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,560
Shut up.

1122
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,560
This is the biggest humble brag.

1123
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,920
Well, I mean, you could find the same deal for a little bit cheaper if you did some digging

1124
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,920
out there.

1125
00:53:52,920 --> 00:54:01,040
But after watching Popey go on his spiel about it, he makes me want to buy used ThinkPads

1126
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,040
too.

1127
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:08,880
Well, and then I just given my older ThinkPad to L, so I was jonesing for that track point

1128
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,880
again, you know?

1129
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,240
Well, welcome back to the club.

1130
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,840
You know, like having a ThinkPad, I hadn't experienced this before having one.

1131
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,440
It kind of is like a little club.

1132
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,680
There's something special about Linux users and ThinkPads, and that's why we get all the

1133
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,080
nice toys like the pick this week, ThinkPad tools.

1134
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,600
So sorry if you don't have a ThinkPad, although maybe take Jesus advice and go find one near

1135
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,600
you.

1136
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,400
I can't believe that.

1137
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,400
That's a great value.

1138
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,400
And that'll be a great test machine.

1139
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,360
You know, we've got a nice range now.

1140
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,480
We've got a good range of super high end machines that are ridiculous in scale.

1141
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,600
And then we've got machines that are real practical daily drivers that people might

1142
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:47,440
be picking up either second hand or just own for a couple of years and don't need to replace

1143
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,440
it.

1144
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,520
So I think we're going to get a good, with the whole team now, we're getting good representative

1145
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,080
sample of people's machines.

1146
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,840
The other thing I'd like to add about ThinkPads is that they're super easy to repair.

1147
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:01,120
I swapped out the keyboard on my wife's ThinkPad in about an hour.

1148
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:06,000
You know, so even if you pour water over the thing, it's cheap and easy to repair.

1149
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,560
We don't recommend you do that.

1150
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,040
We do not recommend you do that.

1151
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,320
Anyways, if you're thinking, well, what does it do?

1152
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,000
It'll adjust the track point speed and sensitivity.

1153
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,360
It'll help you get better battery information and it can help you troubleshoot that under

1154
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,360
vaulting CPU issue.

1155
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,360
We've talked about before.

1156
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,800
I mean, I didn't know that my sensitivity was 128, but now I do.

1157
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,800
Now you do, Wes.

1158
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,000
Actually, it is like, I mean, the little battery status is nicely displayed in the terminal

1159
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,200
and it's just in Python.

1160
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,200
So it's easy to install.

1161
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,200
Yeah.

1162
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,200
So check that out.

1163
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,960
Link in the notes for that and all of it's at linuxunplug.com slash three, two, four.

Easy, easy.

1172

You could also tweet us at Linux Unplugged on the Twitter.

1173
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,680
Yeah.

1174
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,080
And the whole network's at Jupiter Signal.

1175
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,080
That guy right there.

1176
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,080
At Wes Payne.

1177
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,080
I'm at Chris LAS.

1178
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,080
Cheesy.

1179
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,080
I'm at cheesebacon.

1180
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,080
C-H-C-B-A-C-O-N.

1181
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,240
Go get some Alex.

1182
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,640
At Alex is a K-T-Z on the Twitter.

1183
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,640
Ironic Badger.

1184
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,640
Oh, that's right.

1185
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,640
Ironic Badger.

1186
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,640
Yes.

1187
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,640
Ironic Badger.

1188
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,640
Ironic Badger.

1189
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,480
Go get some Alex, too.

1190
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,000
It's so ironic that I forgot that, except for that's not ironic.

1191
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
That's not ironic at all.

1192
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I know.

1193
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I know.

1194
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I'm sorry.

1195
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Anyways, and did I mention mine?

1196
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Probably.

1197
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You did, yeah.

1198
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,920
But you didn't mention that you should go get more of you and Alex over at that self-hosted

1199
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,920
show.

1200
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,920
Oh, we should mention that.

1201
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,920
Uh-huh.

1202
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,920
Yeah.

1203
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:43,520
And while we're just doing plug skis, I should mention TechSnap.Systems slash 414.

1204
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:49,360
Wes and Jim have such a great discussion on ZFS in general, especially like around the

1205
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,360
snapshot stuff.

1206
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,360
There's so many good points.

1207
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,160
But Jim's explanation of snapshots truly made me understand it and appreciate why it can

1208
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,600
happen pretty quick, why the snapshots don't take a ton of disk space, and why it's kind

1209
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,440
of a big deal that this is landing on such a large Linux distro.

1210
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
Yeah.

1211
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
Put it all into perspective.

1212
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,220
TechSnap.Systems slash 414, and join us next Tuesday over at jblive.tv.

1213
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,920
We do this show at 2 p.m. Pacific at jblive.tv.

1214
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,920
Got a chat room, the mumble.

1215
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:43,200
See you back here next Tuesday!

1216
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:57,160
Now, we gotta title this thing.

1217
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,160
Potato Computing.

1218
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,160
I like that.

1219
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,520
It's as slow as a potato.

1220
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,520
You know what?

1221
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,040
Potatoes are great, so let's not throw potatoes under the bus.

1222
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,240
Especially them free-range taters.

1223
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,880
It's the only ethical kind of tater.

1224
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,880
Of course.

1225
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,880
It's a free-range tater.

1226
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,880
Be kind to the potatoes.

1227
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,200
So, uh, let's go get this thing named.

1228
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,440
I'm gonna vote for RamBurglars.

1229
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:21,720
I'm going to, like, try to slam this install on my system, and then be done.

1230
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:26,720
Because in the last three weeks, I got a different phone, I've been loading and reloading systems,

1231
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,280
and so, like, nothing's set up.

1232
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,360
Like, I gotta log into everything, you know what I'm saying?

1233
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,760
Like, it's just been weeks of setting up software, so, like, I'm gonna, after this show's over.

1234
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,760
Should we take away your root privileges on there?

1235
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,760
Just to be fair.

1236
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,760
I'll set a BIOS password.

1237
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,760
Right, yes.

1238
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,760
No more.

1239
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:48,080
So, after this episode, I'm going upstairs, I'm reloading that box, I'm ordering food,

1240
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:52,360
and I'm not leaving the studio until my basics are logged into.

1241
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,360
And I'm calling it good for a while.

1242
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,600
It's nice to have that ready to go, though, right?

1243
00:58:54,600 --> 00:59:13,600
So, like, tomorrow, you can actually just get work done.
