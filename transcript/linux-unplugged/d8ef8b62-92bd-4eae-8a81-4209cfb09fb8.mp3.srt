1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Never make me no underdog, and never talk about who's going to stop me, or ain't nobody going to stop me.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I must be the greatest. I shook up the world. I shook up the world. I shook up the world. I shook up the world.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Shake things up. Shake up the world.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 148 for June 7th, 2016.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's about to celebrate 10 years of broadcasting Linux goodness.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 148 stacks up against the Giants as a big show. Yes, it does.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Mostly just because I've got a little NyQuil on the brain, I've got nothing but last 10th anniversary in my head, and I'm ready to go on vacation.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes! You deserve it.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But before I declare all of that, I should tell you a little bit about what we're talking about today.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So one of the things that's been coming up since our show on Sunday is what happened with ownCloud and what can open source learn from this development?

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What can we do differently next time? And what's kind of between the lines when you read carefully?

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We'll discuss that. Then also, we've got a plethora of our favorite open source project updates.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We've got a whole bunch of project updates to go through.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There is some major new open source code cranking out from little known projects to big known projects that are all great for the Linux desktop.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We're going to tell you about those in today's show as well.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And then later on, later on, I can't help it, Wes. I've been slipping back into Google hard.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Ooh, dangerous.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Ooh, we're going to talk about how I just simply can't quit Google.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I'm curious to hear your guys' thoughts on that from a wider context.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We're going to talk about some of the cool things that are coming out soon that work under Linux that as somebody who's from time to time just quit Google cold turkey and then kind of come back and try them in different ways.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
As a Linux user that is trying to replace certain holes in what you might call the Linux ecosystem where I find Google's offering sort of plug in really well there, I keep finding myself going back.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I keep going back.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I want to talk about that a little bit because honestly, I started thinking about this from the context of the 10th anniversary of the Linux action show, which is really what's all in my mind because we've been doing a lot of work on this.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And one trend that I keep coming back to is when there's proprietary services that are bundled together in a way where they're functional under the Linux desktop, I tend to allow that compromise to happen.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And I say, ah, it doesn't need to be completely open source.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It doesn't need to be completely free software.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And even, you know, looking back, I keep making the same mistake over and over again.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But I don't want to beat up on myself or anyone else who's doing it.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I just want to talk about that dynamic that exists for Linux users and sort of look back on that.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah, so we'll talk about all of that.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But before we get into anything, we got to bring in that mumble room.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Time appropriate greetings.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hello.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hello.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hello.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What a cheerful bunch.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Hello, hello.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So I'm glad you guys are here today because you can help me with some of this stuff.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I want to get into some of our first topics of the day.

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And it comes fully equipped with a pretty awesome video with a good beat.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So if you're a video watcher, this is a treat for you.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is the new GNOME Control Panel with a hardcore new design and hardcore music.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is being worked on right now.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How would you describe this, Wes?

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Like a total re-layout.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, it's like a re-layout, new UI flow, new workflow to find things.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And I could give you an example of what it looks like.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It reminds me a lot, and I don't mean this in a bad way either.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It reminds me a lot of the old Apple Macintosh System 6 Control Panel.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And I actually think it was a pretty good design.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You have a left-hand column of all of the major categories that you want to edit.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And in the right-hand column, it's all of the settings specific to that particular thing.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And it flows well.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I actually always found it to be a really easy way to dig through.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It could get a little long, but yeah.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't think really GNOME is doing something groundbreaking here so much as they're just taking

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
what seemed like a concept that was based off of Mac OS X's system preferences,

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and now we're just basing it off Mac OS 6.

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You know what, they got that wrong.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They had it right the first time.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Retro is always better, right?

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Retro is always better.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's nice to see them playing around like clearly they're not interested in just being done.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
They want to make it better.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Maybe clearly there's problems they don't think are addressed perfectly with the current setting.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, I agree.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So we'll see if it's better.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm looking forward to seeing the update land.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Speaking of making GTK look good, I don't ever really cover new themes anymore or big theme updates,

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
but this one's just gorgeous.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The Arc theme, which I think is just great, is getting a full-on GTK theme and icons,

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the whole shenanigans.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And surprisingly, a lot of people wrote in to tell us about this.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I love the Arc theme, and I love that they're now getting repo set up.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's up on GitHub.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There's devs available.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Of course, I think it's in the AUR.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, they'll just make it even easier to get it everywhere.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And if you look at this, check this out.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If you click this little thing here, you see where it goes to?

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Wait for it to load.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The OpenSUSE software.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Whoa.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, look at software.opensuse.org, and you get links here for Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE,

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and Ubuntu, which is pretty cool.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And Mr. Brown, didn't I see in the news headlines today that the build service got an update

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
of a rather nice feature, something to do with being able to link to external data sources

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
or something.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I just saw the headline, but it looked like a nice update to the build service.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yep, 2.7.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, the big headline thing is we've always had support for linking into Git repos.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now it's leaner, faster, continuous building.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You do a Git commit.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There's your package.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Brand spanking new.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, that sounds very helpful.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Mm-hmm.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We're actually using that now for OpenQA.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So, every time we commit something to OpenQA, bang, package gets spiked out the build service,

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and then we just run the zipper up on our production systems whenever we feel like it.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So, when they say it works better with external data sources, they mean GitHub?

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is that what that headline was referring to?

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Any Git repo, but yeah, I mean GitHub already have enablement for things like triggering,

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
so you can have GitHub triggering based on that, but it's all leaner, smoother, and 2.7.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hmm, pretty cool.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm glad to hear that it's continuing on, and it looks like being used to some effectiveness.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you think, Richard, do you think that that's a better solution than something like AppImage

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
or Flatpak?

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Do you think the two coexist?

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think they coexist, and they cater for different markets.

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Like for me, AppImage and Flatpak and stuff kind of really go for the, well, to stick

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
with OpenSUSE terms, like your typical leap user.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like you don't want to move the whole OS.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I just want this one thing faster, newer.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's where Flatpak's going to be awesome.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
In a rolling distro like Tumbleweed, Flatpak's just a bunch of burden for no benefit,

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and that's where like OBS is really amazing.

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, you know, I should mention before we go any further that we will be sticking to

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
tradition, and we are drinking no beer with this episode.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I should have mentioned, Wes brought in Knead Deep Brewing Company.

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I got the Citra Extra Pale Ale here.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And what do you have there, Wes?

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What do you have?

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I have the big sipper.

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, all right.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There we go.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Opening that guy up.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's make sure we don't spill it on anything as we go along.

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So there's your cue right there.

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I was negligent in mentioning it.

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Have you heard of Linux AIO?

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Have you heard of this?

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is really something.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is a project that, well, maybe I could actually, I'll explain it to you in a way

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
that just tells you what it's doing.

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So imagine yourself for a moment in the position of from time to time wanting different various

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Ubuntu flavors.

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't see this to be unreasonable.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Maybe one time for a machine you want Mate, maybe you want 1604 straight.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Maybe you support a lot of different offices or families.

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Sure, sure.

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
For yourself, you know, because you're not an animal, you're installing Ubuntu Gnome edition.

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm kidding.

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Right, yeah.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But that's a pain in the butt.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You know, it's a pain in the butt to download all those different ISOs.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Well, check this out.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This from the Linux AIO team is one ISO that you can write to a USB flash drive, and it's

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
all the different versions of Ubuntu 1604 that you can choose at boot which one you

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
want to run.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's pretty cool.

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah.

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's a little tricky right now because you have to download two different files because

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
of source forge limitations.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And then when you extract them, they combine to one, just a seven zip.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh, interesting.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And then you write that to a USB thumb drive, and when you boot up, you get the option of

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu Gnome, Ubuntu Mate, Zubuntu, Lubuntu.

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Kind of all that stuff.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We should host that somewhere where it can be hosted as one file, and then that sounds

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
really helpful.

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Or a torrent.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, right?

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Because I could see, especially if you want to make a USB drive for some new user, maybe

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you don't have time to install it with them, or you don't have time to really pick out

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
something for them.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Just bam, here, let them decide.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, exactly.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's a very nice tool, and this project we'll be watching, and I think it's pretty cool

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
because you can also pick 64 and 32, which is kind of nice.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So check that out.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We'll have a link in the show notes, and that is the Linux AIO project, linuxaio.net.

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Pretty cool work.

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, and kind of obvious, too.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm surprised we haven't seen those kind of things before.

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I know, right?

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Now, Wimpy's not in there today, right?

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He hasn't joined us.

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't see him.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I found this super neat video that he posted on his YouTube channel.

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Check this thing out.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Now, again, it's pretty visual heavy.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's one of these code development visualization thingies that shows you the expansion of Ubuntu

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Mate welcome development.

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So this is just the visualization for the welcome thing that they have created for Ubuntu

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Mate, which we've praised quite a bit on the show.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And watch this thing here, Wes.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Isn't this a neat tool?

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes, it is.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I love it.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I love that.

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And it shows you, so now we're into March of 2015.

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So I'll put a link to the video in the show notes if you audio listeners want to check

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
this out.

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Get down with it.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Right?

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Look, and there goes Martin.

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Bam!

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Fixing all the things.

204
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Look at him.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That, wow.

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Boy, that was an explosion of PNGs.

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, that's pretty great.

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I love these visualizations.

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is awesome.

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There's a bunch of different projects that have them out there.

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But that is a neat one to see that.

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And there's one that's like a really famous one of the Linux kernel that you can find

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
that this would also make a good screen saver.

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, it really would.

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We should do this.

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We should look at different projects and do this from time to time because I think you

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
just have to look at the repo.

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, I'm sure we could write up a little script to put this together.

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Visualize different projects and play them here on the show.

220
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It would be good to know, it would be good to be able to click in on these though and

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
get more information about them.

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That would be really nice.

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Right, yeah.

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's like a visual JavaScript explorer.

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes.

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You can inspect the commits if you want.

227
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh, I would totally love that.

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Somebody build that.

229
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Jeez Louise.

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Get on it.

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
See, I kind of was waiting to see where it goes.

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I want to fast forward to see what it looks like.

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So here we are in 20, oh yeah, it's way bigger in 2016.

235
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And it's filled with pot.

236
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You see that?

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's filled with pot right there.

238
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So who knows what Wimpy's up to?

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What?

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No wonder he's not here to account for himself.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Hmm?

242
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Hmm?

243
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Very suspicious.

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Very, very suspicious.

245
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Well, anyways, you audio listeners can find that in the show notes.

246
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
All right, so I don't really talk often about Trisco.

247
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
In fact, I can't even remember if we've done a review recently.

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Right.

249
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm pretty sure a couple of folks here in the Mumble Room are running.

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Anybody currently running Trisco in the Mumble Room?

251
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I know we have a few from time to time that jump in there.

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And Trisco has made a pretty big statement.

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And I thought we would talk about this just really briefly.

254
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So the statement from Trisco essentially boils down to it's not about ethics.

255
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's about ethics.

257
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's not about technology or innovation.

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Just a friendly reminder, the post reads, for those of you that seem anxious for new

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
releases of things like Chromium, Skype, Spotify, or maybe buying the most powerful

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
computer you can buy, I recommend you watch Richard Stallman's Four Freedoms.

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I think many of you should remember that the point of free software is not about convincing

262
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
the most shiny, or not about conceiving or getting new shiny features.

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's about your freedom.

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's about ethics.

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I know shiny features may delight most computer users, but your freedom should be so important

266
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
that you can wait a little for those things.

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If you're thinking free software is not a convenience, I will not change, and I will

268
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
not change this.

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Just remember, freedom is worth the inconvenience.

270
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Please stop thinking about snappy packages and begin enjoying your freedom.

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Strong words.

272
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What do you think about that, Wes?

273
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What's your reaction when you hear that?

274
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Your honest reaction, is that out of touch in your estimation, or is that exactly in

275
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
touch for a particular market?

276
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I think I fought more on the latter there.

277
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I mean, I don't use it, and I've obviously made compromises on the non-freedom end of

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
things on my day-to-day life, and I'm okay with that, but they do have a point.

279
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think it comes off a little bit like they're kind of cross-talking.

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The people that are criticizing them, or that they're perceived as being criticized, aren't

281
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
maybe really interested, and they've already decided not to run that distribution, but

282
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I do think they have a legitimate point that if you are really concerned about these things,

283
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
then there are sacrifices you have to make.

284
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There are compromises, and you should be aware of it, and you should have software distributions

285
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
that are ready to make those choices for you and won't be pulled in by the allure of things

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
that maybe in the long run aren't worth the trade-off.

287
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I disagree.

288
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Go ahead.

289
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So I basically disagree with this statement for one reason.

290
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Debian pretty much by default is free.

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It has the separate repositories and all the things.

292
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The only reason it's really not classified is because, well, it has the other repositories,

293
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and when you look at Debian SID, which is the unstable branch, you still get fancy new

294
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
features, so I'm sorry.

295
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm really slow at it.

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay.

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
All right.

298
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So that's a good perspective.

299
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm having a hard time not finding this as sticking your head in the sand a bit and saying,

300
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
well, don't – I guess it's particularly odd that the one they're picking on is Snap

301
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Packages?

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah.

303
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No, that is weird.

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Because it seems like a pretty solid security innovation and a pretty solid user experience

305
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
innovation.

306
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
At least the second one.

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I think the security one is being worked on anyway.

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I guess so.

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah.

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I guess – when I mean security, I'm thinking containerized applications in Wayland or

311
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Mirror, I suppose.

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So I'm thinking down the road.

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Sure.

314
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Right.

315
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're right.

316
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It is weird.

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It seems odd to me.

318
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Because if you care about freedom, you probably – security should be a concern as well.

319
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So there is an important angle.

320
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Right.

321
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I guess where I draw the line is –

322
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And you can also distribute perfectly free open source software with Snap Packages,

323
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and if it makes it easier, then that's good for freedom, right?

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
See, to me, the computer ultimately has to be a tool that enables me.

325
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And the free software is extremely important to that.

326
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But it also shouldn't be the thing that holds you back.

327
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So that's – for me, anyways, I find it to be a very sort of thin line they're walking

328
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
between the relevance and – but then again, at the same time, I think if you have a core

329
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
demo who that is the number one thing they want from their tool, I think it's right

330
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
on point.

331
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Any other thoughts on Trisco before we move on?

332
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's something we don't give a lot of mention to, and I actually think it's a pretty great

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
project.

334
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I just don't think it really appeals to a lot of us here on the show for a lot of

335
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
different reasons, and so we don't talk about it a lot.

336
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And I think there's a difference here, too, between what they're trying to do.

337
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And you can definitely argue that their execution might not be good, right?

338
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Maybe you don't need to wait for a lot of these things to be free as well.

339
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So there's that difficulty as well.

340
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So my last comment on Trisco, I guess it will be, considering the free software distros,

341
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
it's pretty much the only survivor.

342
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'll give them credit for that.

343
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah.

344
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But other than this, probably not.

345
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There – I don't have much insight on this, but there seems to be a dogma of thought from

346
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
the Trisco project and from the Tails project that precludes them from sometimes considering

347
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
really good outside ideas.

348
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Tails, you can go look into the drama yourself, but there's definitely some drama around

349
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
how they secure their kernel and about what outside people think they should be doing

350
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
versus what they should be doing.

351
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
By the way, Tails had a new release today.

352
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And so I find both – I find curiousness with both these distributions' very stubborn

353
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
approach to something.

354
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But at the same time, you could argue the same thing about Mint and some of the ways

355
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
they do things.

356
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Right, yeah.

357
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And again, it really does appeal to a certain audience.

358
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And do we benefit from having these almost in a Stallman-like sense, right, where it's

359
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
like you don't always agree with him, but he keeps making points that you see the side

360
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
of.

361
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And it might be good just in for the community to have that even if very few people end up

362
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
really aligning right there.

363
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

364
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
All right.

365
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Well, and he has been right to his fair point.

366
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah, it's hard to argue with long-term results.

367
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It really is.

368
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I mean, there's plenty of things you said that you could probably play back that don't

369
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
seem right now in retrospect.

370
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But I think many of them were, at least the core philosophies of them.

371
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So, yeah, if you're a Trisco user and you have particular thoughts on that story, let

372
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
us know.

373
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, please come back.

374
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Join our log.

375
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Let us know what you think about it.

376
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Let me tell you about something I think about all the time, and that's Ting.

377
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I think about how great it is not to have to worry that the two big providers in our

378
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
area keep coming up with new gimmicks.

379
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Actually, all three providers.

380
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And I don't have to worry about any of that stuff.

381
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't have to think about that stuff because Ting is super simple.

382
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And when you have a busy schedule and you just want things straightforward and simple,

383
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
nobody beats Ting.

384
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Nobody beats Ting.

385
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Go to linux.ting.com.

386
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
They have a very simple setup.

387
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's $6 for your phone line.

388
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If you bring a device or you buy a device, it's $6 for that phone line.

389
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's it.

390
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And then it's just your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes on top of that.

391
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
linux.ting.com.

392
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's really straightforward.

393
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
There's no contracts, no termination fee.

394
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You get something free on Tuesdays, like gimmicks.

395
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's just if you want them as a dumb pipe, they'll be a dumb pipe.

396
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If you want them as something that is your backup data service, they're that.

397
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
If you want them as just a cell phone carrier, they're that.

398
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
They sell everything from just the bare SIM cards to feature phones all the way up to the

399
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
greatest latest smartphones.

400
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
linux.ting.com.

401
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Go check out how someone who's looking at the wireless industry from a new perspective

402
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
would reboot it with really good actual human beings for customer support.

403
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
A fantastic, fantastic control panel.

404
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Two networks to choose from, GSM and CDMA.

405
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I really, really think this is something you should look at.

406
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
linux.ting.com.

407
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Go there to support the show and save a little bit.

408
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And when you go to the Ting site and you want to jump around a bit, why not check out their blog?

409
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They're doing customer spotlights.

410
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
They recently did some giveaways.

411
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
They've done an Ask Zach recently about expanding customer support.

412
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Tips on minimizing data usage.

413
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
linux.ting.com.

414
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Go check them out.

415
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's mobile that really makes sense.

416
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

417
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Thank you, Ting.

418
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Thank you.

419
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So, Wes.

420
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Now, I'm also trying not to be inflammatory here, but we've got to talk about this.

421
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Firefox 47.0 is out.

422
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So the big things that we care about in Firefox 47 is VP9 codec support is turned on for users

423
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
with fast machines, quote, unquote.

424
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Quote, unquote.

425
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Whatever that is.

426
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And YouTube videos now play with HTML5 video when Flash is not installed.

427
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's a big, big upgrade.

428
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
However, Windows users and Mac users also received a feature that Linux users...

429
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You mean the most important users?

430
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Maybe the most important feature, actually.

431
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's that whole...

432
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Okay, so I forget what the standard was, but basically Google was one of the companies behind it.

433
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And it was their effort to kill out Silverlight and things like that.

434
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Mozilla has incorporated the HTML5 DRM CDM component.

435
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You know what I'm talking about?

436
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes.

437
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That allows Netflix...

438
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Encrypted media extensions or whatever.

439
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The encrypted...

440
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yes.

441
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Thank you.

442
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The encrypted media extension.

443
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That still allows you to watch encrypted media via HTML5 instead of having to use crappy

444
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Silverlight or crappy Flash.

445
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Nobody wants DRM, but it seems that enough of us want to watch Netflix and Hulu or whatever

446
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
the crap.

447
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Those are the trade-offs that we are making.

448
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Apparently.

449
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So Google's been supporting that for Linux for almost a year now?

450
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah.

451
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's been a while.

452
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's so long that I kind of forgot that Netflix used to be a hard thing to do on Linux, right?

453
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah.

454
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The only way I was even reminded that it's still a thing is whenever Noah is visiting

455
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and he wants to watch Netflix, it's the one thing he uses Chrome for.

456
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And I always laugh at him for it.

457
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's adorable.

458
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah, it's super adorable that this hardcore Firefox user has to install Chrome on every machine.

459
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And so, what the hell?

460
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I mean, seriously, straight up, what the hell?

461
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If Google could deliver this almost a year ago, I swear this is also not the first time

462
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
that Firefox has shipped with features that don't work on Linux that Chrome nailed a while ago.

463
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Do you sense this?

464
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I do.

465
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But I do wonder, given their position and the slope of said position, I wonder if they

466
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
just don't...

467
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Are they spending this trying to get this out sooner?

468
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Would it be better to do a limited release and get Linux later than wait for the Linux

469
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and do it all if they really want this to be competitive?

470
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'll tell you what I think.

471
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Because if I can't watch Netflix...

472
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah, for a lot of people, that's a deal breaker.

473
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's a total deal breaker.

474
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But if the whole Linux...

475
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't know how that breaks down.

476
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Like, Linux market share on Chrome versus on Firefox compared to their other user bases.

477
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's interesting.

478
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I bet you it's pretty high even though most distributions ship with Firefox as default.

479
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I bet you Chromium is Chromium.

480
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Here's what I think is going on.

481
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't think it's because Mozilla doesn't love Linux, although I think they could be

482
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
trying a little harder.

483
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm a little disappointed, to be honest.

484
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But I don't think that's actually what it is.

485
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I think it's Mozilla getting their asses handed to them by Google.

486
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
See, the things that have been happening, like the encryption extensions for HTML5 video

487
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,000
and a lot of the changes in the whole arena there, other specs as well, have all been

488
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
pushed by Google.

489
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yep.

490
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
With Firefox playing catch-up.

491
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Mozilla has, in some cases, like with OpenH264 and H264 support in general, they drug and

492
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
drug and drug and drug and drug their feet.

493
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And it wasn't until Cisco came along and bought up the licensing and released it under a compatible

494
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
license, and then worked with Mozilla, this is my understanding of the situation, that

495
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
we actually got a decent OpenH264 implementation in Firefox.

496
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Right.

497
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Thanks to Cisco doing something for the good of everyone.

498
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But even until 47, you didn't get HTML5 playback on YouTube.

499
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And still, it'll still use Flash if you have that installed.

500
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So why aren't they pushing the agenda forward here in a way that would seem to be taking

501
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
this by the lead, instead of they're always now trailing?

502
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This seems bad to me.

503
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This seems like a really bad sign for Firefox.

504
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I think there are bigger issues with Firefox than just Netflix.

505
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I noticed that Firefox doesn't even work properly with GDK anymore.

506
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So it doesn't scale together with GDK.

507
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So when I installed Ubuntu on my tablet, I have an x86 tablet, and I want all the fonts

508
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
to be bigger.

509
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I want all the buttons to be bigger so everything works on the touchscreen, right?

510
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
On Chrome, everything scales properly.

511
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
On Firefox, it doesn't.

512
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Chrome works very well, or Chromium works very well with touch devices and touchscreens.

513
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Firefox doesn't.

514
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And for me, this is a much bigger issue than something like Netflix, which is a single

515
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
website and support for touch devices, which there is more and more of everywhere.

516
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
This affects everything that you do with the browser.

517
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Ww, I want to give you a chance to jump in, too.

518
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't think, like, okay, video, whether it be Flash, HTML5, whatever, it's still the

519
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
heaviest burden on any web browser, Firefox especially included.

520
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I have Flash installed on Firefox 46.

521
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I have an icon still view my preference of HTML5 videos perfectly fine, but it still

522
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
weighs down the browser no matter what.

523
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So, I mean, getting HTML5, hey, that's great for Linux users and Windows users and whoever

524
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
else.

525
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
If you just have, you know, maybe you go from one video to the next, it just loads up the

526
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
memory usage, even if you have, you know, so, yeah, we got HTML5, great, but you're

527
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
just trading one Flash for a different one, and you still have to pretty much watch your

528
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
usage of HTML5 video.

529
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That's true.

530
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I mean, the advantage, right, though, is you don't have that horrible, god-awful, zero-day

531
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
riddled Flash runtime.

532
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Well, Chrome eats your memory regardless of whether you are web users or not.

533
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Or like the old age-old Flash bug where you couldn't have it open on one screen if you

534
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
clicked on the other screen, all that crap.

535
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh, Flash has been the bane of X11 users for years now.

536
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So, my take on this whole thing is if this continues to happen, and I'm not, and I would

537
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
really love for someone who really thinks I'm wrong to speak up, because what I'm worried

538
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
about is Firefox slowly slipping into a lot of little scenarios where Firefox just isn't

539
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
kind of going to work for that job.

540
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And the more you have, right, it kind of snowballs.

541
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It seems like they catch up at the same time, but at the other, like...

542
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
One thing I have seen, like their stuff for web extensions, that seems like they're kind

543
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
of pushing the ball a little bit, but...

544
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
If Rodden Corpse is in here, I think he would be disagreeing with me because he's a Firefox

545
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
fan.

546
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Richard, I haven't heard from you, are you particular for Chrome, Chromium, Firefox,

547
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
and do you feel like you disagree with the direction we're taking this?

548
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm more of a Chromium fan lately just because it seems to work better for me, but I'm...

549
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I mean, I don't use Flash.

550
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I will never use Flash again.

551
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Good for you, yeah.

552
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And I'm quite happy living without it.

553
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Hell!

554
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Hmm.

555
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
The glorious future.

556
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Whoo!

557
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
My beer overflew.

558
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Well, so it sounds like you're sort of...

559
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
That's okay.

560
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Thanks, Wes.

561
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Wes jumped up into action.

562
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So it sounds like, Richard, you're kind of in somewhat agreement with us in that the

563
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
trend seems to be that a lot of us have switched over to Chrome over the years.

564
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Or Chromium, which is a better option probably for the Linux desktop in a lot of cases.

565
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
All right.

566
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Well, I'll save my thoughts for the rest of it as we...

567
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Geez, I got beer all over me.

568
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
As we get into the rest of the Google discussion later.

569
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So, yeah.

570
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
All right.

571
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Any other thoughts before we move on from the topic, guys?

572
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Going once on Chromium and Firefox.

573
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Going twice.

574
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
All right.

575
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Moving on.

576
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
If you want to tell us...

577
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
If you want to give us any feedback, you can always join us next week.

578
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You know, I should probably...

579
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Before we change complete topics, I should mention DO real quick.

580
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I want you to go over to DigitalOcean and use our promo code DOUNPLUGED.

581
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
That'll give you a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean.

582
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Hey, thank you, Wes.

583
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Look at that thing.

584
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Look at that thing.

585
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That went crazy on me.

586
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That went legit crazy on me.

587
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
We now have...

588
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Beer all over the place.

589
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
If I had my phone on me, I would take a picture of the...

590
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It looks like I piddled all over the floor.

591
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It really looks bad.

592
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It's really just a shame we didn't have one of Noah's laptops around to get ruined.

593
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I know.

594
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I know.

595
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I swear.

596
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
See, this is why I don't drink beer on any other shows.

597
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Because I end up spilling it like once every three episodes at this rate.

598
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
This is horrible.

599
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So, that's why, you know what?

600
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
For somebody like me, DigitalOcean's perfect.

601
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Because apparently I can't even be trusted with a beer.

602
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And that tells us how to manage their infrastructure.

603
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
They manage the infrastructure, and I push the pretty buttons.

604
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And they are very pretty buttons.

605
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
They have a great interface and a great API.

606
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Use our promo code D1Plug to get that $5 rig.

607
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Try it out two months for free.

608
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Did you say that right?

609
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
$5?

610
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
$5.

611
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I know.

612
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I know.

613
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It's really nice.

614
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And they just step it up from there.

615
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
They got FreeBSD, Fedora, Debian, CoreOS, CentOS.

616
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
They got data centers all over the world, including a brand new one in India.

617
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I think one of the better things about it, though, is the documentation.

618
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes.

619
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
They're good.

620
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I was just over there right now.

621
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You know, you wouldn't think it, but they're still – like they still have – they just

622
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
revved an article for Ubuntu 14.04.

623
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
There are still people out there doing that.

624
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
An introduction to configuration management, a three-part series.

625
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That's great.

626
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
My favorite part is that you can tell just by the documentation that like people like

627
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
you are the people that use DigitalOcean.

628
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You know, it's like they're not like 10-year-old people who haven't updated those.

629
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's like people who use DigitalOcean, they're learning how to deploy Internet

630
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
because that's what you deploy today.

631
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You know, they have modern deployment practices.

632
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah.

633
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Best guides.

634
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's awesome.

635
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah, and they have the entire stack which you can deploy with everything ready to go

636
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
or you can set it all up from scratch yourself, which I like both of those things.

637
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah.

638
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And, you know, the snapshots and the quick spin-up of the machines make trying different

639
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
versions of that stuff super easy too.

640
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
DigitalOcean.com, just use the promo code DOUNPLUG to support us.

641
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And a big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged show.

642
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Okay, so I wanted to do that spot right there because I want to give us some room to talk

643
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
about ownCloud because there seems to be a lot of confusion about what the hell is going

644
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
on here.

645
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And if you didn't see Sunday's show, we had a talk with Joss and Frank from nextCloud.

646
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And I don't really have a particular agenda with this topic, not any more so than I would

647
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
typically.

648
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But it seems to me that people still are a little unclear on why they left, why they

649
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
couldn't just fix it at ownCloud.

650
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And it seems to me that people are a little unclear as to which lessons we should be taking

651
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
away from this to avoid this thing in the future.

652
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And like I mentioned at the top of the show, Swampy over at CIO.com has a pretty good write-up

653
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
that I think is worth sort of digging through and discussing a bit.

654
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And it's titled, What We Can Learn From OwnCloud's Collapse.

655
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Now, I want to make it clear at this point in time, the ownCloud community and company

656
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
are still around.

657
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The U.S. division of the company has been shut down.

658
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But ownCloud is still there.

659
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You can still download ownCloud.

660
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Theoretically, there's going to be an ownCloud 10 or whatever.

661
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So, ownCloud has not actually collapsed, but...

662
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
There's been a shift in momentum?

663
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
A lot of the core team has left, including the original founding developer.

664
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
There's a lot of press.

665
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I mean, it's...

666
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
NextCloud is probably the horse to bet on, I would suspect.

667
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Anybody in the Mumble Room disagree before I...

668
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Yeah.

669
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Hmm.

670
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You guys are so easy.

671
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
People probably think that I just pick out yes men.

672
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I really don't.

673
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I swear I don't.

674
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
We invite curmudgeons.

675
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Yeah.

676
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So, my take on what we could learn in a moment, but first I just wanted to clarify a couple

677
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
of things on why it happened, I think, based on my reading of our chat with Frank and Joss,

678
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and based on the reading of this post here.

679
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
A couple of things that stood out.

680
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I guess it gets...

681
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Let's start with what was really the obvious one was investors seem to be a problem.

682
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I think if you read between the lines, what they were saying is that a lot of Old Cloud's

683
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
features were held back because developers had to convince an investor in 30 seconds,

684
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and every conversation led to a comparison with Dropbox.

685
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Which make it sound like these lead developers, in particular the people that we're talking

686
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
about here, if you're constrained in that way where you feel like you can't do what

687
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
the community wants and what the people who are really interested want, I could say that

688
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
would be very frustrating.

689
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, basically the investors go, yeah, well, Dropbox doesn't do that, so we're not going

690
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
to do that.

691
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I mean, right now, no.

692
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
This is when MariaDB left Oracle, or MySQL.

693
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Right, right.

694
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Very much so.

695
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I think there's some lessons there, too.

696
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Swampy writes, no matter who you talk to, from Sousa to Red Hat to CoreOS, every company

697
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
that has built its business around open source values the community the most.

698
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The community is what creates their projects.

699
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
They have to strike a very fine balance between business needs and community needs, and that

700
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
balance seems to have been tripped, or I'm sorry, tipped, at Ong Cloud.

701
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The announcements of Ong Cloud Foundation was met with criticism from the open source

702
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
community, which saw it as proof that the company was still trying to be in control.

703
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
For example, Ong Cloud Inc. had the majority control over the foundation, which gave them

704
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
the power to expel any community member.

705
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Doesn't make you feel very much like a community president.

706
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
No, it doesn't.

707
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Richard, he name drops Sousa there, and OpenSousa, I mean, you have to agree with that statement,

708
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I would imagine.

709
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Every company that's built its business around open source values the community the most.

710
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:31,000
He goes and talk about that they did not understand how to put community first, and in like a

711
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
dramatic sense, in a sense that sometimes would perhaps not lead to greater revenue,

712
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
but would lead to a greater community.

713
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Do you have any thoughts on that particular aspect of this situation, Richard?

714
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I think that part of Swampy's point is accurate.

715
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I mean, I don't know enough about the Ong Cloud situation to say, did they get that

716
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
totally wrong?

717
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I mean, I think there's lots of different factors at play there, but the core message

718
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
that if you're going to be doing any kind of open source business, you can't forget

719
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
about your contributors.

720
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You can't forget about the developers.

721
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
They're the heart and soul of the whole thing, and you have to find some way of striking

722
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
that balance between the two.

723
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
If you get that mix wrong, then stuff like what we're seeing with Ong Cloud and Net

724
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Cloud definitely is the kind of thing you'd expect to see.

725
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah, it does.

726
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
That feels pretty genuine to me.

727
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Joss also expresses frustrations on Google+, where he wrote that he had learned that often

728
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
with venture capital you have to limit yourself to doing things investors can understand rather

729
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
than what users, and in this case probably community, and customers ask for, or what

730
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
maybe could even make money.

731
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
This doesn't always have to be an issue, but can be crippling, and it's frustrating because

732
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
management ends up forced to make short-term decisions that they know are bad.

733
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
This is why business angels are better than venture capital.

734
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah.

735
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Yeah, it seems particularly that venture capital and open source are very rocky.

736
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Sometimes at odds, yes.

737
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I mean, they screwed diaspora, really.

738
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Venture capital killed diaspora.

739
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That is true.

740
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Yeah, diaspora did get the wiener.

741
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The situation was a little bit different with the attachment group, and therefore SUSE,

742
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and therefore open SUSE, but I mean, that worked out pretty well.

743
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Well, but do you look at that as an investor so much, or do you look at that as a parent

744
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
company that sort of has strategic alliances, or alignments, I should say?

745
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Well, the attachment group was primarily VC-ish, yeah, investment group backed.

746
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh, okay.

747
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Not anymore.

748
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
That's all micro-focused now.

749
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's a public company in the UK, completely different structure.

750
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But yeah, for the post-Novell attachment group years, there's definite parallels there, and

751
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I guess we just got lucky and got a group that understood that and had goals that kind

752
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
of fitted in nicely because it wasn't really an unhealthy relationship at all.

753
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah, it does seem like it's worked well.

754
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It doesn't seem like it's worked well.

755
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It did not work well out for own cloud.

756
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
N3, you wanted to jump in here.

757
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Go ahead.

758
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Yeah, I mean, if you're justifying stuff to investors, you're forgetting the fact that

759
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
the point of open source is you're not limited by the narrow minds of your investors, or

760
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
profit motives, or any of these things that normally block you.

761
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Okay.

762
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Okay, go ahead.

763
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Most of my work has a huge base of open source, and we do release code, and our deal is to

764
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
make money.

765
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Sorry.

766
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Really.

767
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Most of it would depend on the people involved, because here's the scenario I see happening.

768
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
A community comes along.

769
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Somebody contributes something that's great for your project.

770
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's just a great new feature or an obvious direction that you could go in, and maybe

771
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
it's something to do with sync, or maybe it is a rebuild of something that was done in

772
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
PHP to something more, well, different.

773
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And you go to the investor.

774
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You say, look at this great new code that somebody's brought to us.

775
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
If we spent time expanding upon this, we could really build this into a super serious feature.

776
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And you could see the investor going, take some third party's code and alter our trajectory

777
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and our plans because of something that somebody in his basement put together for us?

778
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's a ridiculous idea.

779
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You could see the way they would look at that would simply be, that's impractical.

780
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
That would be irresponsible.

781
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm sorry.

782
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's not a real investor, though.

783
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That's not a real investor.

784
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I think it could depend on one.

785
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Go ahead.

786
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm just claiming that in the sense that investors look at free money, they look at, oh, somebody

787
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
gave us something to have an edge on something else.

788
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You would think so.

789
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Free money.

790
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I would think it would depend on the person, though.

791
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And honestly, there is the other side.

792
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
If somebody just contributed a piece of code to your project and you have a vision, and

793
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
that's going to derail your vision, maybe you should be focusing on why you had the

794
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
first vision in the first place.

795
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Actually, it's part of sane planning to do what you set yourself to do first.

796
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Then you, you know, this side away from it.

797
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
You have to have room to do that.

798
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And it's part of being, you know, an actual team that can produce results.

799
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It's not just about investment.

800
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You as a project, you have to set goals and to meet those goals.

801
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Otherwise, you fail to everyone you committed to.

802
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Sure.

803
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Sure.

804
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Indeed.

805
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Maybe I should have said monetary investors or, you know, VCs instead of because you can

806
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
invest code, too.

807
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Sure.

808
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Sure.

809
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Yeah.

810
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I think that it's a really good point.

811
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And I think this actually, this is like full blown Richard, the individual conspiracy theorist

812
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
going on here.

813
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I know nothing about this.

814
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But like if you, if you look at like some of the graphs that come out from the GitHub

815
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
from own cloud, you see a period back in like 2014 where like obviously own cloud Inc.

816
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
was doing all of the work.

817
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
There was no community.

818
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
There was no momentum there.

819
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So in that kind of environment, I can imagine an investor going, well, we're doing all the

820
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
work.

821
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
We can't trust on, we can't rely on this community.

822
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So, you know, it makes it this foreign, unreliable entity.

823
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And you think in sort of traditional software development company terms of what do we do?

824
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
What do we control?

825
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Blah.

826
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And I guess this goes back to the earlier point of with TropinalMate.

827
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You know, for this to all work properly, happily and healthily, you need to have that balance

828
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
between community and company.

829
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Yeah.

830
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So if you have, so if you have the community who are, you know, doing a significant portion

831
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
during the majority, do it yet, you know, then that story to investor becomes completely

832
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
different.

833
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah.

834
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,720
We have these guys who are basically giving us free stuff and we pay nothing for it besides

835
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,100
maybe a little bit of sponsorship here and there, you know, this is awesome.

836
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,280
It makes us millions.

837
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,080
There's no funder in the world who isn't going to buy up that idea, but the community has

838
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:58,320
to have, you know, it has to have maturity, strengths, you know, credibility that, yeah,

839
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,240
if you look back at own cloud back in 2014, there's a clear sign that wasn't there then.

840
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,240
Yeah.

841
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
That's a great point.

842
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,080
Skokie, you make a point about the corporate perspective and all of this.

843
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,080
Well, okay.

844
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:16,240
So on one hand you have, okay, there's never been a more litigious time in terms of from

845
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:24,480
a corporate perspective to build in, to bring in open source libraries and code into any

846
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:31,520
sort of, you know, real project that you want to package because now, you know, all of,

847
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
you know what I'm talking about?

848
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,200
Just like all the stuff around Android and all of the patent wars that we went through

849
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,800
and all of the cross licensing and even the Oracle versus Google stuff going on.

850
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,680
But by the same token, I think what we're kind of talking at cross points here in the

851
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:53,080
sense that the power of free and open source software is that we adapt where a need is

852
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,160
presented.

853
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:06,640
You know, we fill, we move, we fix where larger corporate, you know, blah structures do not

854
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,120
want to blah.

855
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,120
Yeah.

856
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,880
And also I would say we also stay focused in areas that are no longer sexy and marketable

857
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,440
to large companies.

858
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
Absolutely.

859
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
Yeah.

860
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
No, totally.

861
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,520
Well, the thing is like, you know, we fix problems and what I mean is like, oh, well,

862
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,760
you have a crazy use case, you know, X, well, fine.

863
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,360
You know, Microsoft isn't going to fix that or come up with some sort of solution for

864
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
that for you.

865
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,240
Well, that's why free and open source, you know, blah is so powerful.

866
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,160
And that's why it's, I mean, this is the first I've heard about on cloud, this is really

867
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
depressing.

868
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160
Oh yeah.

869
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
You got to check.

870
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
Sunday's last.

871
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
We covered all in there.

872
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,520
All right.

873
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,360
Any other thoughts from the room before we move on?

874
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,840
Okay.

875
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,440
So this is all interesting.

876
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,400
It's funny how even when unplanned, there ends up being a thread that sort of connects

877
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,640
the whole show together and I want to kind of wrap that thread up in the next segment.

878
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,400
So let's, this is a perfectly natural spot to stop and say thank you to Linux Academy

879
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,480
for sponsoring the unplugged program.

880
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,600
Love this sponsor.

881
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,200
This is a great idea.

882
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:16,160
This is a, this was a brilliant way to honestly make a little money for it by producing Linux

883
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,160
content.

884
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Right.

885
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Really clever.

886
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
And the key was to actually make something useful.

887
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,560
So they've got 2,465 self-based courses with videos and comprehensive study guides and

888
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,760
downloadable material that you get to keep and own and they come with virtual labs that

889
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,240
spin up as you need them and give you SSH access.

890
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,880
You can choose the distro which will adjust the virtual machine and the courseware.

891
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,200
I think probably the key thing to Linux Academy though is their insight into the community

892
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,540
because they are Linux enthusiasts and users themselves and part of the reason they created

893
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:48,320
the Academy was to promote Linux adoption.

894
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,240
They follow the trends extremely well.

895
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,380
They had, they had stuff on containers when containers were just brand new.

896
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:01,080
When the big switch from IP tables was happening, some of the first courseware here at Linux

897
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,920
Academy, like they follow this stuff super closely because they are Linux users themselves.

898
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,760
They have instructor mentoring available which is fantastic for this level of courseware.

899
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,440
They have graded server exercises which will help you with your test anxiety.

900
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,720
They have some of the best courseware out there on the topics they cover.

901
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,600
They've hired staff recently, they've gotten some funding and they are doubling down on

902
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,040
making sure their back catalog stays relevant which I think is brilliant as well as researching

903
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,440
future topics and building new features into the platform all the time.

904
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,080
Your membership is constantly getting more valuable.

905
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,240
Start by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

906
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,240
That will give you our discount.

907
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,000
They have recently restructured their pricing to a really simple, easy to understand format

908
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,800
and you get a great deal if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

909
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,240
Whether you are looking for something like the Red Hat certified courseware to understanding

910
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,360
Android development, they have got it and they have got great courses on it with instructor

911
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,280
mentoring available.

912
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,800
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

913
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,440
Thanks Linux Academy.

914
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
You guys rock.

915
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
It's a nice resource.

916
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,440
It's a great resource.

917
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,440
It's really kind of nice to have a resource out there like that and to have them want

918
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,480
to be sponsors on our little podcast.

919
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,480
Thank you guys.

920
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,720
Now, I've got to talk about something that – so I'm getting all reflective because

921
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,880
of the 10th anniversary and we were talking like, hey, should we do like – hey, let's

922
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,600
talk about something that we thought is just the funniest thing over the last 10 years

923
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,000
or the biggest dramatic thing or some of the big stories.

924
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
We just would kind of do them here as a little fun to do segment and I started thinking about

925
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
it.

926
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,960
You know, if there's one thing that's haunted me for the last 10 years is that I

927
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,840
keep slipping into services.

928
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,840
Services.

929
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:45,560
I've managed I feel like to pretty much free myself from proprietary software in my

930
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:51,320
daily life and in 95% of my media production.

931
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,520
It's getting way up there now.

932
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,920
Like I'm feeling really good.

933
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,240
But when it comes to services, specifically ones that I'm actually a little paranoid

934
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,600
about and you know who I'm talking about.

935
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,040
I'm talking about the Googles.

936
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:08,160
People honestly, I think we don't spend enough time conceptualizing how much they actually

937
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,160
know about us.

938
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:14,680
When I hear people talk about Google Photos, I don't know if they fully realize the amount

939
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,380
of data that Google can get when you take family pictures and then have them back up

940
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,380
to Google Photos.

941
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,760
Google has the capability of analyzing the emotions on your face.

942
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,880
They have the capability of analyzing those faces to see what other people are in your

943
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,120
social network.

944
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,200
Not your fake online social network, but your actual real social network because you're

945
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,520
taking pictures of people and they're associating those with your account.

946
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,940
They have location information in those photos.

947
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,220
They have the phone information like what model it is so they can see how often you

948
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,220
buy new phones.

949
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,560
I mean there is so much information out of every single service that they get.

950
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,540
And if you ever want to know, you can just go look at your Google Dashboard and be sort

951
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,360
of blown away by all the stuff that's in there.

952
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:02,480
My favorite one is going to the Voice Activity page because they record every voice command.

953
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,480
That's big for me.

954
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,480
I do a lot of dictation because I'm a horrible speller, often because I've got my hands

955
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:15,980
very busy, and I also will use the OK Googs feature to search for stuff.

956
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:21,640
And sometimes I even use it because if I can't find it on any of my home screens, instead

957
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:26,340
of tapping the application drawer and bringing up all the apps, I'll use the Google launcher

958
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,600
to just launch the application.

959
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,880
And it's so creepy when you actually stop and realize that they have all of that.

960
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,560
So here's me yesterday at 7.04 p.m.

961
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:44,080
OK Google, open the new egg app.

962
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:51,000
What's creepy is there's a good second before I even say OK Googs, right?

963
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,560
And here I am again.

964
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,720
OK Google, open the Twitch app.

965
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,560
So you can hear my kids are watching DuckTales in the background.

966
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,000
And here I am again.

967
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,400
OK Google, best Twitter app for Android.

968
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,600
I barely remember doing any of these things.

969
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,960
Did you find that app?

970
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,760
Here I am talking to my Android TV.

971
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,200
Hydraulic RV slide maintenance.

972
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,920
I was looking for YouTube videos.

973
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,200
The audio quality is horrible on that one.

974
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,920
You just go through your Google dashboard and it's remarkable what they know about you.

975
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,920
It's really stunning.

976
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,840
And that means they can do whatever they want with that, right?

977
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,400
They can break down how your voice works.

978
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,160
They could be building samples, whatever makes sense.

979
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,960
Another example is I have Google Now turned on, which I find to be very valuable as you

980
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,520
start to use it more.

981
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,000
And I have an Android Wear watch that has Google Fit.

982
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,880
And when you enable Google Fit, you turn on an extra layer of accuracy for your GPS tracking.

983
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,840
And so it literally tracks me so closely now that it knows when I cut across a driveway

984
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:10,140
versus going down the pathway, it plays it all back through the Fit application.

985
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,840
And to that degree now, they have noticed, Google has, that I've started taking certain

986
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,860
side roads on my home route.

987
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:22,040
And now it has begun giving me my estimated time of arrival using these side roads that

988
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,960
it would never map you if you didn't go that way.

989
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,040
Yeah, because the route I originally started taking was the way Google Maps sent me the

990
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,040
first time.

991
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,000
And then as I learned the area, I started taking side roads that I prefer.

992
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,240
And now it is automatically when I pull up my Nexus here and I look at the Google Now

993
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,380
card, it'll automatically represent my preferred route.

994
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,880
And that data probably goes into Waze and now they recommend it to other people too.

995
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:50,000
It is weird because I find myself fascinated by some of the advances that actually have

996
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,820
proved to be over the last, I would say, year or so that I've really been experimenting

997
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,960
with Google Now, actually useful.

998
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,760
Right, like about a year, two years ago, it didn't really feel, you were like, okay, great,

999
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,440
you know I'm at the mall, fun.

1000
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,440
It seemed obvious.

1001
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,440
Exactly.

1002
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,000
And I think it sucks that it's mostly only on mobile.

1003
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And so if you really want to take advantage of it, you have to be on a mobile device.

1004
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,200
However, it's now gotten, it's gotten really good at guessing what kind of news stories

1005
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,200
I like to follow.

1006
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,200
Yes, definitely.

1007
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,180
It's gotten really good at looking at my shipped packages and telling me when they're going

1008
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,180
to arrive.

1009
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:27,520
All of that stuff I've actually found helps me when things are really busy and I'm doing

1010
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,560
a really shitty job of being a human being and I'm just not keeping up with things.

1011
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,120
You just don't have that spare cycle at all, even to track your packages.

1012
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,320
So I had that Google Now card came up that said, hey, you know, your Amex bills do like

1013
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,320
right now.

1014
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,320
Do you want to pay this?

1015
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,320
Yeah.

1016
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,320
I do.

1017
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,320
I do want to pay that.

1018
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
Thank you.

1019
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,320
Yeah.

1020
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,320
I've been super busy.

1021
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,320
I hadn't thought about that.

1022
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,320
I was going to miss that.

1023
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,320
Yeah, I was.

1024
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:55,200
And so it does seem to be patching some holes that I find as a regular, as just a, as apparently

1025
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,040
a dysfunctional member of society.

1026
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,940
I can't keep track of these things sometimes.

1027
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:06,400
And so it's nice to have this big brain that is augmenting to some degree these weak spots

1028
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,880
for me.

1029
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,320
However, when I think about the amount of data they are collecting on me, all of my

1030
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:17,280
email, all of my text messages, all of my location information.

1031
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,080
I'm just looking at my location history right here.

1032
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,080
Yeah.

1033
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:25,880
And all of my docs that I put in Google docs, all of this stuff is they have so, so much

1034
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,920
on me that also at the same time feels like it's not actually sufficient to how much they

1035
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
can actually do.

1036
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,280
It feels like it should be more than that for the amount of privacy that they have taken

1037
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,280
from me.

1038
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,280
Yeah.

1039
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,000
And so I look at this and I think, how come now 10 years into doing these shows I have,

1040
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,240
I have not gone just, why have I not become a hard liner on this?

1041
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,500
Why have I not drawn a hard line that says I just refuse to use these services?

1042
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,360
Why am I not a Trisco user?

1043
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:57,560
You know, why, why, what is it about, I feel like I am, I am being irresponsible in a way.

1044
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:03,880
Like I feel like part of me, part of me legitimately knows that they are, they are probably building

1045
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,840
a profile that is much deeper and richer of me than I can probably even conceptualize.

1046
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,840
Right.

1047
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,760
I mean, let's look at the resources they have and all of the information and data input

1048
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,860
they have, especially when you start using an Android device and Android Wear and it's

1049
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,920
constantly monitoring my steps, my heart rate, and my location.

1050
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,320
It's about the best tracking device you could hope to design right now.

1051
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,320
Yeah.

1052
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,720
And when I do voice commands, which I do all the time, they're capturing my emotion at

1053
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,680
the time, they're capturing my kids in the background, the voices that are in there.

1054
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,000
When I take photos on my Android device, they're automatically uploaded to Google Photos and

1055
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,520
I can type in Dylan Hugs and I can see every time I took a picture of Dylan getting a hug.

1056
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,440
So they understand what a hug is.

1057
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,080
So I don't think I'm even conceptualizing fully how much they know about me and yet

1058
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:50,800
even knowing that and knowing the downsides of getting locked into proprietary closed

1059
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:59,700
systems, even all that, I still find myself slipping into Google services all the time.

1060
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,520
I just feel like, I feel like I'm crazy.

1061
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,520
I'm a spooky sprite.

1062
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,520
Am I crazy?

1063
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
Of course you're crazy.

1064
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,880
Are you out of your mind?

1065
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:13,760
Like crazy for the fact that every, I don't know, I've been listening to Jupyter Broadcasting

1066
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,200
for like what, three, four years now.

1067
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:21,000
And yeah, every time you have this moment of reflection, everyone in the audience is

1068
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,080
like, yeah, Chris, you are the product.

1069
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,960
You are just realizing this and you work in the tech industry.

1070
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,960
I know that.

1071
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
That's the problem.

1072
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,960
I mean, look at you though.

1073
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
You have the Amazon Echo.

1074
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,960
I have the Echo, but the Echo, okay, so there's a big difference.

1075
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,760
The Echo doesn't follow me around.

1076
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,760
That's one thing.

1077
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,600
The other thing is like, fine, Amazon, I buy everything through Amazon anyway.

1078
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,640
I got nothing really to hide from Amazon.

1079
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,360
Amazon doesn't follow my traffic to work and blah, blah, blah.

1080
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:58,720
But anyway, have you looked at how easy it is to spot two people in a cloud?

1081
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,680
This is not like anything that's tracking your heartbeat or anything like that.

1082
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:08,360
How easy it is to figure out two people, like 500 people in a metropolitan area who are

1083
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,200
going to meet each other surreptitiously.

1084
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:17,320
I mean, okay, so that's the unhappy side of this.

1085
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,520
You're still coming to grips with the happy side of it.

1086
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,520
Yeah, sure.

1087
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,520
They're using all, you are the aggregate of your data.

1088
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,600
You are an advertising product.

1089
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:30,080
So that's not even the thing that I was claiming to be different.

1090
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:35,720
I guess one of the reasons I'm able to step aside and not get so much sucked into those

1091
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,360
services is basically because I can and try my best to shut down on news.

1092
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:47,280
I consume my news from curated sources, which tend to have already freedom and perspective

1093
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,280
and things like that.

1094
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,120
And I still participate in the show.

1095
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:56,040
And on the other side, because you are collecting information for the show, you are exposed

1096
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,000
to all of the cool features and the cool things that are coming out.

1097
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,600
You have to talk about it.

1098
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,080
So you're like, all right, I did the research.

1099
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,080
I did all this stuff.

1100
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,640
Let me try it out so that I have a first hand experience.

1101
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,360
That is actually, your point is pretty valid because the entire reason I went back to the

1102
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:18,200
Nexus platform was to try out Android N so I could have an educated opinion about the

1103
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
current version of Android.

1104
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,760
People, I think, often consider me a Google basher.

1105
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,680
And I try to weigh the good and bad of every situation.

1106
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,480
And I think there's things that Google does that are awful.

1107
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,700
And I think there's things that Google does that are actually fairly compelling.

1108
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:35,640
And so I think N, honestly, if you put some of the current performance issues aside, N,

1109
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,320
and I just talked about it in yesterday's Tech Talk today, is a super solid release

1110
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,680
with really great security features.

1111
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,800
And I thought, OK, well, I got my Nexus 5 back from NOAA.

1112
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,560
It's time to give this a go.

1113
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,960
And then that one thing led to another.

1114
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,440
And now I'm all in.

1115
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,440
Now I'm all in again.

1116
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,840
We always knew you were an Android fiend at heart, Chris.

1117
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,520
You can't always take that reflection moment to cut it off completely.

1118
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:04,920
But you have to gain the courage to actually, when you are in that momentum, to cut it off.

1119
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:09,360
Not just to deactivate the account, delete the account.

1120
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,600
I think that's the problem, is I actually am feeling like maybe I'm going to continue

1121
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,600
to go all in.

1122
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:20,400
I think I'm starting to feel like it's worth the, I guess I'm starting to, I should say

1123
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,400
this differently.

1124
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,120
I'm trying to conceptualize what the absolute worst case scenario is.

1125
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:31,320
And then from that, I'm trying to figure out if it's worth the cost for the convenience

1126
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,320
it brings me.

1127
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,680
Again, I'm a dysfunctional human being that apparently the only thing I can really reliably

1128
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,680
do is make podcasts.

1129
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,120
And beyond that, I'm unfunctional.

1130
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,120
And so it's helpful.

1131
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,120
Thankfully we have an economy where you can outsource some of these things.

1132
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,760
It's helpful that I've outsourced part of my brain to this machine.

1133
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,800
And on top of that, it is good from a research standpoint, from a content point of view.

1134
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,480
But I find myself considering going further with it and continuing to just go further

1135
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,480
down the rabbit's hole.

1136
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,080
And that's, I think, what's really alarming to me.

1137
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:02,080
And not like, I tell you, I've tried to conceptualize the worst case scenario.

1138
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:07,280
And the way I see it is, try to avoid putting directly sensitive information into the Google

1139
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,280
machine.

1140
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:15,960
However, there's a ton of leakage just because of the way all the services report back.

1141
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,440
But if I had, say one day I decided to make a dirty video right here in the studio.

1142
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,920
We take the green screen and we make a nice dirty video, because why not, right?

1143
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,880
It's what everybody jokes about when they come visit the studio.

1144
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,880
Everybody.

1145
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,360
Oh, you know what this would be great for?

1146
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,360
No.

1147
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,360
What?

1148
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,360
You should do a porn set.

1149
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,360
Nobody's ever told you that, huh?

1150
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,360
You'd make a ton of money.

1151
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,600
You mean they don't watch JB after dark?

1152
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,640
So seriously though, if I was going to do something like that, I wouldn't put that in

1153
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,960
my Google Drive, or cloud whatever, or up on Google Photos.

1154
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,580
But I think that's where you're fooling yourself if you think you're still not leaking a ton

1155
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,900
of information to them.

1156
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,220
My worst case scenario, when I conceptualize it, what's the worst thing that could happen

1157
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,760
to me?

1158
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:03,220
It would seem that I could get, that information could be subpoenaed if down the road I decide

1159
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:10,800
to do some sort of act of civil disobedience and I get caught up by the law.

1160
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,160
They could subpoena my Google Fit data and see exactly where I was at at the time that

1161
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,780
big dong got spray painted on the side of the building.

1162
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,060
And so far we've seen, we know we've seen the Apple hacks and the celeb breaches and

1163
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,460
that kind of stuff, but I don't know, at least publicly there hasn't been that much of blackmail

1164
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:30,520
extortion control, but eventually these data sets, in the wrong hands, if you're in the

1165
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:34,580
wrong place at the wrong time or you did something, even the wrong picture, even if it's an innocuous

1166
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:37,180
picture, you have enough of them, you can find a picture that looks like someone's doing

1167
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,180
something wrong.

1168
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,180
Yeah.

1169
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:43,860
It is concerning too when you, I don't quite understand, if Google was really clear about

1170
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:49,940
what the policy around my data was, for example, like, Google how many times Eric Schmidt visited

1171
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,500
the White House, why is Eric Schmidt going to the White House all the time?

1172
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,560
What kind of relationship is between Google and the federal government and is that something

1173
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,220
I should legitimately be concerned about or is that just conspiracy bacon?

1174
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,380
If they would just be super clear about this is the way we use your data.

1175
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,900
So you can make the trade off yourself with full knowledge.

1176
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,900
Yeah.

1177
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,900
Yeah.

1178
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,780
It also brings up to me the larger question of as tech literate people, where do you draw

1179
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:15,020
the line between hosting your own stuff and outsourcing that to other services?

1180
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:16,020
Right.

1181
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:19,060
Because it's like, we all have those skills, but when is the right trade off?

1182
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,440
Yeah, go ahead.

1183
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,140
I have a crazy proposition.

1184
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:28,780
There's this project Ethereum, which is based on the blockchain concept, but the mathematical

1185
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:36,220
pretty much function that has to be solved for the blockchain to work is actually random

1186
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:42,020
operations, random operation of any type of software, which essentially means that you

1187
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,580
can distribute your applications.

1188
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:48,860
Eventually, you can get the Google compute power on all distributed machines.

1189
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:56,620
It's not going to be as fast, but then maybe you buy Digital Ocean, for example, and put

1190
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,060
it running a node so that you have a little bit faster response.

1191
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,180
Then you solve that type of scenario.

1192
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,060
The blockchain, that's an interesting solution.

1193
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,780
Blockchain means, you know, we talk about it, Popey shows up.

1194
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,780
Popey, you are going to make a comment about Alibi.

1195
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,780
Go ahead.

1196
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:16,820
So, like, you're looking at it from the negative point of view that they've got all this data

1197
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:23,500
and, you know, they could correlate some data about you in a particular place at a particular

1198
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,500
time.

1199
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,060
Because that could actually work to your benefit.

1200
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:36,220
If someone in a town near me with, fitting my description, looks a bit like Elvis, sounds

1201
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:41,260
a bit like a robotic device you've got on your desk, all those kind of things, right?

1202
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,820
I see you use Arch Linux.

1203
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,940
Uses Arch Linux.

1204
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,740
All these things are dead giveaways that it could be me.

1205
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:54,220
But I also happen to have maybe an Android device nearby that I'm using Mozilla Stumbler

1206
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,820
to report my location to help the Mozilla project.

1207
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:00,780
I'm using Ingress, the game, when reporting my location in that.

1208
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,140
I'm using Google Maps.

1209
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:06,100
I'm sending messages via Telegram, which I'm getting my IP address.

1210
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:13,860
So there's like 10 or more apps on my Android device that are actually my Alibi.

1211
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:19,340
So when something goes wrong, you know, I can call on potentially those people with

1212
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:25,740
a request for my data and prove my innocence that I wasn't at the location where the crime

1213
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:26,740
occurred.

1214
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,740
That's very true.

1215
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,180
The difference is you are in Europe and you can make data requests.

1216
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:33,180
Unfortunately our US friends don't have that ability.

1217
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:37,460
That's the problem with, you know, separating away and becoming one of the separate colonies.

1218
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,220
You know, they should have not done that.

1219
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,420
You know, I tell you, the other thing that struck me too is if I'm going to worry about

1220
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,740
Google, then I probably should be crapping my pants about the credit card companies and

1221
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,740
the carriers.

1222
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,460
Because they've got their fingers just in there too.

1223
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:52,820
Yeah, and they're doing, you know, super cookies where they're monitoring all of your web traffic

1224
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:57,500
or in the case of the credit card companies, they're selling your data to data brokers,

1225
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,880
what you buy, where you buy it, how much you spend.

1226
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,940
All of these things are happening and it's a big industry around it.

1227
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:08,460
Huge industry and they do not, trust me, when it comes to respecting privacy, not the top

1228
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,460
of their list.

1229
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:10,460
No.

1230
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:15,220
Yeah, and I might change my tune because right now the UK government are debating the Investigatory

1231
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:21,900
Powers Bill, which will enforce ISPs to record for a year or more every website that I visit.

1232
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:26,660
So I'm probably going to make some changes in my life as a result of that because I'm

1233
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:33,000
actually less worried about Google having access to all this data than I am my own government.

1234
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,100
That's actually why I worry about Google is because it seems like it's just one national

1235
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,660
security letter away.

1236
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,180
Which is concerning for all services, really.

1237
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,060
It's not a Google specific one, it's just how much information do they have.

1238
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:50,660
Probably, what kind of changes, VPN, what would you?

1239
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:58,180
My employer already provides me with a VPN and I could potentially enable that on every

1240
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:04,420
device or I could do it system-wide on my network at home and route all my traffic through

1241
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,500
that VPN.

1242
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,500
That would help.

1243
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,140
I might consider using Tor.

1244
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:12,540
There are some really nice Tor apps for Android, for example.

1245
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:17,460
We don't have any on Ubuntu phone, but I do on the desktop, so I'm certainly looking into

1246
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:21,100
these things if this legislation passes.

1247
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,620
I bet.

1248
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:28,180
Before we wrap up completely, I thought, looking back at the last 10 years, this seems to me

1249
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:33,400
for Linux desktop users to be a big... The services aspect, we could move over to a free

1250
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,580
platform and then end up locked into a bunch of services.

1251
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:40,180
Not that it's not something we haven't talked about, but looking back at the last decade,

1252
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,740
it's something that seems like a bigger problem than it's ever been right now.

1253
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:43,740
It really is.

1254
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,740
I feel like I'm in the middle of it.

1255
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:48,940
Pobie, before we go, before we wrap up, I saw in the G Pluses that you have one of them

1256
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:49,940
there, Raspberry Pi Nanos?

1257
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:50,940
Is that what they're called?

1258
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:51,940
Pi Zero.

1259
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:52,940
Pi Zero, right.

1260
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,940
Pi Zero.

1261
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:54,940
Pi Zero.

1262
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:58,300
Well, I was thinking it'd be a fun little piece of kid to get it.

1263
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,460
What have your thoughts been on it?

1264
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:01,460
I have a couple of them.

1265
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:05,100
I have one, the original Pi Zero when that first came out.

1266
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:12,620
This is the second generation Pi Zero, which has a camera connector on the end.

1267
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:16,600
They're both destined to go in small projects.

1268
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,380
They're not really designed to be desktops.

1269
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:22,780
They're not designed to be media centers or anything like that.

1270
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:27,380
My goal is to put them inside something quite small, but I haven't... I have some plans

1271
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:31,300
and I have some things in pieces, but I haven't quite decided exactly what to put them in

1272
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,300
yet.

1273
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,860
I say robot body parts that connect back to a Mycroft head unit.

1274
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,740
Just walking around.

1275
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,580
The only command it accepts is to watch the JB live stream.

1276
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,860
There you go, Wes.

1277
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:42,860
All right.

1278
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:48,220
We'll probably be screeching to a halt here because I got a telegram from Mr. Chase Nunes

1279
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,220
a little bit ago.

1280
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,220
He, Chase Nunes?

1281
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,220
Yeah.

1282
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,780
He is in route right now.

1283
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:54,780
It's a big day here.

1284
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,780
Wow.

1285
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:56,780
He's only 30 minutes away, too.

1286
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:58,900
It's a big day here in the US of A.

1287
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:59,900
Yes, it is.

1288
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,060
We're going to switch gears over to our on filter show here in just a moment.

1289
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:09,080
Before we wrap up, I just wanted to say that if you are around on Sunday, we would really

1290
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,820
love if you'd come and visit us at jblive.tv.

1291
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,780
I hear it's kind of a huge show.

1292
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,020
Well, we're looking forward to it.

1293
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,020
I'll tell you this.

1294
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:20,540
We're doing a couple of things that I've wanted to do for a really, really long time, and

1295
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:23,700
I think they turned out pretty fun.

1296
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,080
We're doing that on Sunday, and there may be a few things that are worth turning up

1297
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,080
live for at jblive.tv.

1298
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:32,100
You can get it converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1299
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,020
Now, this show here, this show's on Tuesdays, Wes.

1300
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:36,020
Did you know that?

1301
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,020
Yes, I do.

1302
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,020
Yeah, Tuesdays.

1303
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,020
Tuesdays.

1304
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:40,020
You can join us live.

1305
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,020
That's the best day.

1306
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,700
You can hang out in our virtual Lug and also in our chat room.

1307
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,660
You can find that at the calendar page as well.

1308
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:48,940
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com is where you can go to submit topics.

1309
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,060
A lot of times, we'll look for open source spotlights.

1310
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,480
We go out and scour the web.

1311
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,480
I'll link Roundup.

1312
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,900
If you guys have stuff you want to talk about, let us know.

1313
01:04:55,900 --> 01:05:01,300
One of the things that helps is that subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com, feedback at jupiterbroadcasting.com

1314
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,140
slash contact.

1315
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,180
Just choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown.

1316
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,180
You can follow me on the Twitter, at Chris Ellis.

1317
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:08,380
Are you on the Twitters, Wes?

1318
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:09,380
Oh yeah, at Westpane.

1319
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,380
What?

1320
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,380
Who knew?

1321
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:12,380
All right, everybody.

1322
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,620
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of the Unplugged program, and we'll see you

1323
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:44,140
right back here next Tuesday.

1324
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,680
Dude, dude, dude.

1325
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,280
Mind on my cloud and the cloud on my mind.

1326
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,280
That's pretty good.

1327
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,860
It's super long, but that's pretty good.

1328
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,460
NSA endorses googs.

1329
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:24,420
You like that one there, Wes?

1330
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,120
Mhm.

1331
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,500
The money and my cloud.

1332
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,380
Chris Lasck goes Alex Jones, I don't think so.

1333
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:31,680
You just go look it up.

1334
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,680
Just go look it up.

1335
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:33,980
I'm not saying, I got the documents.

1336
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:37,020
You haven't got the croaky voice for Alex Jones.

1337
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:39,760
I got the documents right here.

1338
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,080
It's real.

1339
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,080
Mustaches

1340
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,440
And you know I think about it when I did the recording of the voice for the mic off at no point

1341
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,440
Did they ask me to go?

1342
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:57,920
Did they have you repeat mustaches in various different ways though cuz that's that's that's what's important

1343
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:05,360
I am the world's biggest lightweight. You know I oh man, so I've been I've been fighting a cold

1344
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,680
but it's been like it's been one of those things where it's

1345
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:15,160
Instead of getting like really really bad on me like they used to it's just sort of been real mild now for about two

1346
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:22,440
Three weeks. I haven't working crazy hours, so I think maybe I just haven't really had time to to heal necessarily so yesterday

1347
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,160
I started to suspect well

1348
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:27,120
Maybe it's allergies so right before we started tech talk today Angela's like take this Zyrtec

1349
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:32,240
And I'm like this is non-drowsy right so yeah, it's absolutely non-drowsy which I believe I take it two hours later

1350
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:38,200
I'm asleep. I I could not I was out so then I woke up after a few hours still felt sick

1351
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,360
I'm like oh, I don't feel good and now I'm not tired cuz I slept right so

1352
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,920
My lady's like here take some NyQuil. I'm like oh, yeah, okay. That's a great idea

1353
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,880
I'm like this is got a decongestion in it right cuz I would love to be able to breathe through my nose

1354
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,560
Yes, she's like yes. It does. I'm so I take the NyQuil down the NyQuil

1355
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:57,480
I don't get particularly sleepy at nighttime although

1356
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:03,000
I didn't sleep solid all night long, but today. I have not been able to shake that like drowsy

1357
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,560
drowsy slow oh, I have like a NyQuil hangover. I need to have each little thought and yeah

1358
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:12,280
Yeah, exactly it's a good way to put it and like I'm reading like it's not supposed to last like this long

1359
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,280
Why does it why does it why does that happen to me?

1360
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,560
So I tried going out going for a walk got some sunshine took a cold shower

1361
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,680
Tried to take a nap although I couldn't fall asleep did all those things still barely made a difference

1362
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,320
So it's good to have caffeine yeah

1363
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:34,400
Mm-hmm so I'll probably you know I'll probably pass out during unfiltered tonight. That's fine. Yeah, that's good
