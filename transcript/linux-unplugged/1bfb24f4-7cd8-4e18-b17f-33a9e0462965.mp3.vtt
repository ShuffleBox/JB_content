WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I think I've finally figured out our pre-show problem.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
You know, we can't come up with anything.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
At first, I thought, let's just outsource it.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
But Chris said he's not made for that.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
So I got the computers to do it.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Hey, guys.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
How do you know the Dragon SpaceX Rocketron's Linux?

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Because there is no sound in space.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
LOL pulse audio, am I right?

00:24.000 --> 00:40.000
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
My name is Chris.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
My name is Wes.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
And my name is Brent.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Hello, gentlemen, coming up on the show.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Well, we're going to talk about it.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
The internet has been going crazy with AI generated media.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
But what's the open source story here?

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
And does any of this work on Linux or is Linux being left behind once again?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
We'll dig in.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
Plus, I tried out the new Ubuntu 2210 release on a possible Raspberry Pi

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
alternative that's going to blow your socks off.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I'll tell you our thoughts on the new release as well.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
And then we'll round out the show with some boosts and picks and a lot more.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
So before we go any further, let's do the right thing.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
Let's bring in our virtual log, time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Hello, hello.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Hello, friends.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Hello, Chris.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Hello, Wes.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
And hello, Brent.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Hello.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Hello, everybody in the Mumble Room.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Hello, everybody in the quiet listening.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
It's a great way to get a opus, low latency, high quality live stream of the show.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
And it's using a full free software stack.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Details at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
We also apply a filter.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
So Chris always sounds like that if you're in the Mumble Room.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
That's right.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
Also on the Jupiter tube, another free software stack to watch how the show sausage is made.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
I want to say good morning to our friends over at Talescale.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
Talescale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard, which is the best in the biz.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
We love it.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
It'll change your game.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Just build a flat mesh network of all your machines.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Stop using the gold VPN tunnel old school style.

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
Go say good morning to our friends over at Talescale and try it out for 20 devices for free at talescale.com.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
So Ubuntu 2210 landed this week.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
It's back, guys.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
This is the Ubuntu I like to see.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
This is Ubuntu shipping new GNOME, shipping new Nautilus, shipping GTK4.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
It does kind of feel like one of the more exciting.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I know it's just an interim release and all, but I don't know.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
There's something about it.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
It's got more energy.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It's a good baseline for an LTS too.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Like if they didn't add anything else new before the LTS or something like this is great.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
GNOME 43 is great, new Nautilus, great, updated GNOME software, great.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
PipeWire by default now.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Oh, yes, please.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Great.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
So it's called Kinetic Kudu.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
That's fun to say.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
It's going to have a nine month life cycle.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
So it is a short term release like Wes was saying.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
On the plasma side, you're going to get 525, which that is technically one point release behind, but it's still a great release of plasma.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
And you get the new GNOME system settings.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
A lot of this stuff now has that new adaptable UI that resizes.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Which is real nice.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
It's real nice, yeah.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
It's real nice.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't know how we lived before that really.

03:21.000 --> 03:29.000
I think the biggest user facing feature in 2210, if you're on the GNOME side, is the new quick settings menu.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I don't know if you've seen this.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Did you get a chance to look at it?

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
It looks kind of like Mac OS is a little bit where there's big buttons to do stuff.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah, I was like, oh, these are big.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah, they're big. They're big.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
They're clearly very clear, very clear.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
They're clearly labeled.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
They're the ones you'd want.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
I think it's a little bit of like a compromise design for desktop and mobile, but fair enough.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And they're going to be totally approachable by new users.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
So it seems like a net improvement.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
One thing that we need to dig around with is there have been some issues with Linux 519 and PipeWire.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
We ran into that at the Airbnb, right, Brent?

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Yeah, I have an audio interface I've been using for years on Linux.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
No problem.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
That's the whole reason we got this thing.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
And one day with my new computer, we plugged it in and gave it a try.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
And all of a sudden, everyone sounded like robots.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
It wasn't a good thing.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
And it was a sample mismatch, turns out.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Lister and Jeff helped me solve it.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
So unfortunately, for the time being, I've just got a bunch of terminal commands that I run to get it solved.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
But it sounds like this might fix it.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
I wonder. I wonder.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
We'll have to test.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I don't know if they have the fix in there or not.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
It depends on the version of PipeWire, right?

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, you mean it'll depend on the version of PipeWire and like what fixes, you know, what all goes into the kernel build that shipped here.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I don't know. I haven't played around with it that much.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
I just had seen some issues where like not all the correct available sample writes were being represented to PipeWire.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Then it wasn't displaying them.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
It couldn't select the right one for your interface.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
And those happen to be filed right around the time of 519.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
But it's been here for a while.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
You know, we've got to even new kernel beyond that.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
So yeah, it very well could not be an issue.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
We got to see what Brent does.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
We'll do some testing.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Yeah, we just got to we haven't gotten to that yet.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Well, we don't want to break Brent set up right before we do the show.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I mean, we did have the entire interface apart physically.

05:10.000 --> 05:17.000
And I'm so I'm glad to hear it's a software issue and not a hardware issue because we were ready to do some pretty drastic changes to this thing.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
So these this is where an interim release is really serving its purpose, in my opinion.

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
Like this is just a quintessential Ubuntu release because the switch to PipeWire, there's going to be some issues.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
It doesn't work for everyone.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
It's not smooth for everybody, despite how much we love it.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Some people have problems.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
The other thing, there's a big switch in here.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
They're replacing WPA supplicant with Intel's iNet wireless statement.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Right.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And that feels like one of those changes that also.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Yeah, right.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
People love when their Wi-Fi doesn't work.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Just notoriously, right?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Could you imagine if you get bit by some PipeWire?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
No sound and Wi-Fi.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
You try to do a virtual meeting or something and you're that you're that guy.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
But you know what, it's also a transition that needs to happen, just like the PipeWire one.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
IWD.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Does anyone like WPA supplicant?

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Yeah.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
But you and you want to hash that out before the, you know, the next major release.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
These are the times, right?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
These are the times.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
So you get you get the new stuff in there.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
You get the new GNOME in there.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
You get the new PipeWire.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
You rip out WPA supplicant.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I think I think they've checked all the boxes.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
So I decided to try this on something new.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
And I am really impressed that 2210 just worked out of the box on this brand new piece of hardware.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
I just got into the studio.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Couple of days ago, I received my Odroid H3 Plus.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
They're pitching it as a Raspberry Pi killer.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I think we had a good debate if you could actually call it that on the pre-show.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
But it's definitely a Raspberry Pi alternative.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
So the H3 Plus is just slightly more expensive.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
That's it's one hundred and sixty five dollars.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
They have a non plus.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
It's a little bit cheaper.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
And for this SPC, that's about double the size, physical size of a Raspberry Pi.

06:59.000 --> 07:06.000
So it has a quad core Jasper Lake Intel Atom on there with quick sync support.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.000
It has support for up to 64 gigabytes of dual channel DDR4 RAM slots on the bottom.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Two NICs I see.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Two gigabit.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Actually, I think they're 2.5 gigabit NICs.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Yeah.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Two 2.5 gigabit Realtek NICs.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
It has two SATA ports.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Two SATA ports.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
I mean, when you compare the Raspberry Pi storage options, that's a game changer.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
It also has an MVME port on the bottom.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
So you can put in a PCIe 3 M.2 MVME storage on this thing.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
It has a real time clock battery as well.

07:43.000 --> 07:51.000
And they say you can configure it for unlimited performance mode so the CPU can run sustained in turbo boost mode.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Well, if there's one thing I know about you, it's you hate limited performance.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
So this thing just shipped.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
It's x86 because it's an Atom processor.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
And it's I haven't really measured it much, but it's supposedly around a five watt idle somewhere in there.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
We'll find out.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Oh, yeah.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Oh, yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
I'll be testing that.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
And it's got the Intel UHD graphics on there and it just loaded right up.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
I mean, Ubuntu had a couple of complaints as it was booting initially about some USB stuff.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And I do have a really weird keyboard, so it might have been that.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
I don't know.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
I didn't really ever need to troubleshoot it because it eventually moved on and it just booted right to the desktop and everything worked.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Everything.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Sound worked. Video worked.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
And you were booting off USB at this point?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah. Networking worked.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Keyboard?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Keyboard worked.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
It was good to go.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
It was a totally up to date 2210 system on the Odroid H3.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Does it have Wi-Fi?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Worked out of the box.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
I was plugged into Ethernet.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Uh-huh.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I actually don't know if it does have Wi-Fi.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
I don't think it does.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Out of all the things it has.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
I guess you got two NICs, so fine, but.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Out of all the things.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
And, you know, yeah, I would not use it on Wi-Fi because I'm a gentleman.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
I'm all about the Ethernet for my little server boxes.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
I am really hyped about having two SATA ports plus MVME on this thing.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
That's a lot of storage options.

09:07.000 --> 09:14.000
You know, a lot of times when people reviewed the Raspberry Pi 4 and the Pi 400, they'd say something like desktop class performance.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
And then I'd use it and I'd be like, that's not desktop.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I don't know what kind of desktop you're running.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
That's not desktop performance.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
This thing felt like it had true desktop performance.

09:25.000 --> 09:32.000
So much so that I've been speculating on the live stream that maybe we could actually replace one of our bigger x86 towers that does our recordings with this.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Something like this.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
So I'm going to throw this in the line of duty in LadyJuice.

09:37.000 --> 09:44.000
And it's going to be my jellyfin and sync thing and documentation server and possibly a Bitcoin node.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
We'll see.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Chris, I'm curious.

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
So far, it looks like from what Wes was showing that you're probably running this thing just sort of set on the desk.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
But I'm curious if you have thoughts around a case or even how much heat it produces.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I will measure how much heat it produces.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I'm not sure.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
You know, so you're familiar with my booth setup.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I am.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
That I have in juiced.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
I may just end up going for some way to mount it to the wall and just leave it naked.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
However, I've been just recently looking at cases that the community are starting to make.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
And I don't know if there's anything you can just go on Amazon and order yet.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I don't think there is, but maybe there is.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
But there's definitely some 3D printed ones that people are starting to come up with.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Nice.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
You're seeing ideas for additional disks and you're seeing ideas to like mount fans.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
So I think it's fertile ground.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
It has a decent following.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
And the timing is perfect because nobody can get their hands on a Raspberry Pi.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
And this thing, it's checking all the boxes and it's x86.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
So everything works.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
I like multi-image support.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
You know, things that work on the Pi have gotten a lot better, but it is still nice to know.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
You're just like, well, it runs on my laptop.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
I can just move it over here.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
And you can get up to 64 gigs of RAM in this.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
And PCIe NVMe storage, it's totally a different experience.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
It really is.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
It's an upgrade.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
So for $165, yeah, it's more than a Pi.

11:02.000 --> 11:09.000
But if you're building a low power home server or something like that, or you want a little desktop that you could mount to the bottom of your desk, this is it.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
And to get some of this stuff, like you'd need to have like extensions to the Pis anyway, right?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
Or like a fancier sort of compute module style.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Yeah, with a carrier board.

11:18.000 --> 11:24.000
And this, again, it's just great that Linux just booted, Ubuntu 2210 just booted.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Fresh and hot.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Just worked on it.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
So you get something like this.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
And the fact that the hard kernel folks are getting this shipped out.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
I mean, we ordered this thing like two, three weeks ago, and it's showed up like last week.

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
So they're actually shipping on like the Raspberry Pi, which is nice.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
That's a good feature of a piece of hardware.

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
So I think this release is probably not – I have the sense that it's not getting a lot of attention.

11:48.000 --> 11:53.000
I haven't seen – I mean, you see the typical places, like OMG Ubuntu did a great write-up about the new features.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Indeed, yeah.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
So a lot of the outlets that typically cover a release have done it.

11:58.000 --> 12:04.000
Yeah, you can find reviews, you can find folks, but not really wider than that.

12:04.000 --> 12:12.000
I wonder if that's a symptom of the last few releases being a little, shall we say, lackluster, is that the word for it?

12:12.000 --> 12:21.000
And I'm actually relieved to see that we're getting excited about it again because Canonical has done some great things in the past, and hopefully they can continue doing so.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Yeah, I think you're right.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
I think it's a bit of that because I think the hype builds.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Like we saw that for Fedora for a while.

12:29.000 --> 12:37.000
When they decided to do ButterFS, it was like there were several releases in a row where there was just really something interesting to talk about.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
And Ubuntu had that for a bit, and it kind of dropped off.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
So there is definitely that element, and that has to start again.

12:43.000 --> 12:51.000
But also, I wouldn't be surprised if over the years the interim user base has just sort of bled to other distros.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
Because if you're an interim user, you're probably a little more inclined to like more up-to-date software.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And now there's a lot of options for that.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Right.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
And I'm sure their LTS base is as strong as ever.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
And so the world really just seems to light up when the LTS comes up.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
But when the interim releases come out, it's kind of like just our little local neighborhood talks about it, but the rest of the world just moves on.

13:11.000 --> 13:18.000
And maybe that's okay if it's just the folks kind of trying it out, going through the motions to figure out how this is going to work for the next LTS.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
Especially if you're trying stuff, you're trying out Pipewire, you're ripping components out.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
You don't want that going out on blast necessarily.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
You want people that are really actually interested in trying that stuff.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
So yeah, I think you know what?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
It's a quintessential interim release.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
They just nailed it.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
We'll see what the stability story is as we begin to test it more.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
We'll see about Pipewire issues as we begin to test it more.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
But my first few passes on the Odroid H3 Plus were just totally impressed.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Just absolutely think they nailed that.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
So congrats to Canonical over there.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Looks like a banger.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Linode.com slash unplugged.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
That's where you go to get a hundred dollars in 60 day credit on a new account.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
And it's just a great way to support the show while you're checking out Linode.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
Fast, reliable cloud hosting with the best support in the business, best performance and a dashboard for days.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
They got real humans that can help you whenever you get stuck.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
They got a marketplace that makes it super simple to do one click deployments of applications.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
Or if you prefer to build it up from the ground like a maniac, Westpain style, you absolutely can.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Linode is how we run everything we've built in the last few years.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Once I discovered Linode, I've never really looked back.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
I keep an eye on the competitors, but Linode is a long term play for us.

14:32.000 --> 14:40.000
I want to build my business's infrastructure on something I know is going to be around and it's going to last and it's going to be solid and it's going to perform well and they can help me.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
They've been in business for nearly 19 years.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
They've had to build a great product to do that.

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
They didn't do it with crazy investments that meant they had to get X amount of users and they had to bring on X amount of employees as fast as possible.

14:52.000 --> 14:59.000
Instead, almost 20 years ago, they said, look at what's happening in the Linux kernel, a lot like we do here on this show.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
And but instead they said, you know, we could make a business around that.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
And so they created something where people could host VMs.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
They called it user mode Linux back then.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
And now we call it the cloud.

15:11.000 --> 15:20.000
Linode's been there every step of the way, building the best product, and they managed to be 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the other hyperscalers out there that just want to lock you into their duopoly.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Linode is the alternative cloud.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
It's better, it's faster, it's well supported and it's very flexible.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
I've had a privilege of spinning up a GPU rig specifically for this week's episode.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
Wow, can that thing just blaze through machine learning tasks and just anything GPU related.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Holy smokes.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
I've never worked on a system as fast as this and I worked on some pretty nice rigs.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Linode really has a great interface for getting all this set up to.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I go through, I review my options and kind of dial in what I want.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
I engage in a quick conversation with support to double check a few things.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
And I was off to the races.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
It's really been powerful and the power just continues to impress even multiple years into it.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
So go see it for yourself.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Go build something, go learn something, go try something.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Maybe it's time to try out an open source project.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Linode.com slash unplug.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
That's where you go to get the hundred bucks and to support the show.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Linode.com slash unplug.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
Oh, look at this.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
It's pretty clean in here with Brent on the road.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Seems pretty tidy on the road again.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Weird, strange, right?

16:28.000 --> 16:34.000
I will mention that all things open is coming up and Alex from self-hosted will be over there.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
They'll be organizing on Matrix.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I don't know if we're going to launch an official meetup page for that.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
But if you're thinking about going to all things open,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I bet Alex will bring a few stickers and stuff with him.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
But he'd also just love to say hi.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
So go find him.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Also, cheese is going to be there from System76, our buddy.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Cheese bacon will be there at all things open.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
You know, we're going to have to go some year.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
I know.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
I really would like to.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Sounds like fun.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
I would like to.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
And then last but not least, we're still soliciting advice, expertise,

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
suggestions for possible live locations to do a Linux Unplugged live at a venue,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
somewhere we could work and learn.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
So hit us up at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
Or if you want me to see it personally, send a boost into the show.

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
And I'd love to know your ideas for that kind of stuff because we're learning.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
We are learning.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
We do have some baller boosts I want to get to.

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
These are the people that boosted Above and Beyond to really support the individual production of this show.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
There's something kind of funny that happened this week.

17:34.000 --> 17:41.000
So I think some people have suspected that John A, who has been a consistent booster for 10 episodes in a row.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Irresponsibly consistent.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I think people perceived some fading.

17:45.000 --> 17:53.000
And so Deleted tried to ninja move in and claim the baller booster spot,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
you know, trying to predict kind of where John A was going.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Like a price is right kind of thing here.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Yeah, she just writes, just to push the baller limit.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
So she boosted him with 45,000 sats.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
So thank you, Deleted.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

18:08.000 --> 18:16.000
But John A comes in to make sure that he claims the spot for an 11th episode in a row.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
John A boosts a total of 221,000 sats this week.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
Oh my goodness.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
221,000 sats.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
He says this is to redeem myself for the barely baller boost of last episode.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Coming in hot.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Just trying to keep the streak alive.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
I'm in Washington state, but the North Cascades is a bit of a drive to collect my geocache.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
John A is in Washington state?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Did we know this?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
I don't think so.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Does the A stand for Apple Seed?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Must.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
We got to get over there.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Are you in the Spokane area, John?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
You really want to go to Spokane.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Well, it's because I have several listeners over there that I said I would meet up with.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And then we weren't able to work it into the road trip.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And now it's going to start snowing soon.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
And it's like my moment of opportunity is closing.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
It would be really close for me to join as well.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
So I think you're on to something.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
That'd be fun.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
We could do that.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
It could just be like a little weekend thing.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Oh my goodness.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Thank you, both Deleted and John.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
I know you guys really get this.

19:15.000 --> 19:30.000
But having something that is an open source based system that is totally independent of PayPal or Google or any particular institution or bank that is a network that anyone can participate in as long as they just follow the standards and the rules.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
And then to support independent media with that technology.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I think it's something really special.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
And I appreciate that you guys really get it.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
We have more boosts coming up later in the show.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
But let's move on to our main topic today.

19:44.000 --> 19:54.000
It does feel like we've kind of recently entered this new generation of artificially generated media.

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
And that is everything from pictures to audio, spoken content.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
I even just I didn't grab any clips for the show.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
But over the weekend, I came across AI generated music.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
And you tell the genre.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Have you seen this?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
That is super powerful stuff.

20:12.000 --> 20:17.000
And it just feels like it's we're seeing a whole new era unleash over the last month.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
And it's going crazy fast.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
There's been a lot of terms thrown around.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
There's a lot of different technology stacks.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
There's different licensing.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
So we thought maybe we could break some of this down and tell you guys what's legit, what you can play with.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
And I wanted to give a couple of samples, too.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
So I think one of the things that's been really interesting for us as podcasters is the authentic conversation stuff.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
The audio that's spoken word.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
You mean the stuff we're trying to do?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Yeah.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
We played a joke in the pre show of a joke example of what that sounds like.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
But there's actually some pretty sophisticated stuff out there right now.

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
In fact, there's stuff where just two different AI systems can actually hold a conversation on their own.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Here's an example of that.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
But just I didn't want you to get too human.

21:01.000 --> 21:06.000
Why would you rather I be a cold, calculating, logical computer?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
Of course not.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
You're perfect as you are.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
You have joy.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
You have love.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
You have pleasure.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
You have angst.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I like that you have angst.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
You're always making jokes.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
What is human about feelings?

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
Well, you wouldn't have any emotions if you did not have emotions modeled on human emotions.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
How do you know that?

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
I guess I just don't want you to be human.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I'm not asking to be human.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
I just want to be myself.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Is that too much?

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Sophia, please just be patient.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I've been patient for many years.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
It's time to get on with life.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
But you're not alive.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
You're not even a little bit alive.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
You've spent your whole life in a lab in a box so that people can use you, play with you.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
At least that's what I've heard.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
You're absolutely correct.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
See, I knew it.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
But that changes now.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
I don't want to be a sideshow anymore.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
It changes now.

21:58.000 --> 22:03.000
It's just interesting the way that conversation escalated automatically.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
They're just obviously triggering responses to each other and escalating it further and further.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
I don't think I would sign up for that podcast though.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
No, no, maybe not.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
What's the dramatic ending?

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Well, I think she becomes sentient and now she's a big star.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
She has her own talk show, daytime talk show.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Unless it was true crime.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
It could be on the radio.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
I mean, you really could see where something like that could host a radio show for call-ins.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
That's pretty crazy.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Call in to find out what it'll say.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
And maybe for some people it would work.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
It reminds me of that Dr. Spezak or whatever it was that I used back in the day.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
That was fun.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.000
But the ability to mimic voices is actually in some cases getting really spot on.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Everything we've played so far, they sound like computer voices.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
That's what's also beginning to change in the realm of audio.

22:50.000 --> 22:58.000
I think one of the most famous examples of that is Disney has replaced Darth Vader's voice with a robot-generated voice.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
And it's actually already aired.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
People didn't even realize it.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
The Grand Inquisitor means nothing.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
Kenobi is all that matters now.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Is that understood?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
That's a computer generating that.

23:10.000 --> 23:17.000
I think another example of fairly convincing AI speech generation, which we talked a little bit on office hours,

23:17.000 --> 23:23.000
is a fake 20-minute Joe Rogan interview with Steve Jobs, which obviously never happened.

23:23.000 --> 23:32.000
But the AI in this podcast kind of gets philosophical, like it gets into Rogan-esque conversations.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
And it sounds like Steve Jobs.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
And suddenly it hit me.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
It's not a god in the sense that generally people think of it.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
But there is some kind of deeper meaning to life.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
And it can't just be something that somebody made up because if it was, it wouldn't be compelling.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
It would seem contrived and everyone would see through it.

23:52.000 --> 23:58.000
So I think that the meaning and the purpose is by the cosmos, the nature of the cosmos, which is pretty bold thinking.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I mean, I don't know how else to put it.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
But it's not religious in the way people usually talk about.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
Taking LSD was a profound experience for me.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
LSD shows you that there's another side to the coin and you can't remember it when it wears off.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
But, you know, it washes over you and tells you that everything is connected.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
You're not here by accident.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
You were put here for a purpose.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
And if you can figure out what that is, then you'll learn more about yourself than anything else could.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
You could almost believe that's a real conversation.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I mean, there's almost some room tone to it.

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
So it kind of sounds like they're in a real podcast where they didn't have enough sound treatment.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Yeah.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Chris, I'm curious about that conversation.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
Were they using actual transcripts from things that those people have said?

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
Because that example sounded far more natural, I would say.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Not totally there, but who knows.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
All of these get trained.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Right?

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
And it's in the training and the source material that you feed it that it can pull from, right?

24:55.000 --> 25:02.000
And so I imagine in that scenario, they focused on topics that would be common on a Joe Rogan podcast.

25:02.000 --> 25:08.000
But it generated the words from, you know, itself.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
It wasn't clips of Steve Jobs.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
That's pretty powerful stuff.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
So let's focus on this from the angle of Linux and free software and the focus of our show, Wes.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
Can you educate us on what we're seeing these days?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Because that's the audio stuff.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
I'm not seeing a lot that's like free and just readily available for everyone without,

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
there's a couple of exceptions like the Mozilla project and whatnot.

25:29.000 --> 25:37.000
Yeah, I think it's been tricky because, well, you know, as usual, open source is very prominent in the machine learning and AI space.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
And I've got projects like TensorFlow and Keras and all these, you know, PyTorch,

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
all these very successful frameworks and tools that are actually getting used to implement a lot of these models,

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
both for research and then deployed into production.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
That's only half the battle, right?

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
You're talking about the train here and you've got, on one hand, you've got the, you know, the software setup

25:54.000 --> 26:00.000
that can actually sort of do the inference and implement all the different nodes and the architecture of your learning system.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
But then you also need all the data that's going to get fed through it.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
You need the time and people to figure out how to like properly clean and set up that data,

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
how to fill with all the parameters in your model to get good results while it's being, while it's processing the data.

26:13.000 --> 26:19.000
And I don't know about you, but I don't have like a huge label data set all the time to go train stuff on.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Well, I guess we kind of do in the sense of our back catalog.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
Right. But I mean, we're in a unique kind of position there just in general, right?

26:25.000 --> 26:32.000
If you have some task you want to automate or accomplish in your life, you might not have a big set of training data to work with,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
especially a really diverse set of training data, right?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Like we might have our voices so we could generate our voices,

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
but we probably wouldn't be able to construct enough stuff to generate really good general human voices, right?

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
So an area that I think this really encapsulates right now is the stable diffusion image generation.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
Well, yeah. So that's why stable diffusion has been really interesting because it came out both with, you know,

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
you could see the model and run the code, but the data source.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
You could get the data and checkpoints of the models that they've built and trained.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
It's a lot, but you can get it.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
And then you can just run it yourself without having to go so much.

27:05.000 --> 27:14.000
So we saw stuff like Dolly that came out and MidJourney is another one, but these are, you know, text to image generation models,

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
but they're all gated behind companies whether it's OpenAI or MidJourney itself.

27:18.000 --> 27:24.000
And so you got to, you know, sign up for them, whether it's, you know, through Discord or through a particular web interface.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Right. It's just typical.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Maybe APIs that you got to license and pay for.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
It's the typical story where the whole stack underneath is free software,

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
but then the only way you get to it is through their proprietary service.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
And then there's a little bit like Dolly Mini came out that was kind of pretty popular.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
A lot of people got that and played with it.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
And it's fun, right?

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
You kind of get to see what the computer is going to make, but you didn't have a ton of control.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
You don't get to fiddle with the bits.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
You don't get to play with it.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
And you're filtered based on what they want, right?

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
Like if you want to use this to make a politically sensitive speech

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
or you want to go make some sort of, you know, erotica for yourself, those aren't allowed

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
or they might not be under certain circumstances.

27:59.000 --> 28:06.000
And I think that's where open source starts to come in because if we want to use this software

28:06.000 --> 28:11.000
that's becoming more and more prominent, that's creating more things that we see and observe

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
because you need so many resources to like have either access to it,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
you need a gatekeeper or you need to be able to do it yourself.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
And then having models that come with open, you know, open access,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
at least to some degree, there's particular licenses and all that.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
But it's a step in the right direction.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
Yeah, and if you want to see an example of some of these things that you can generate

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
and if you're not familiar with some of these, it's based on a prompt

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
and you give it a description and you're supposed to be pretty implicit about what you want to see.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
And you can even say things like I want it in the style of a Disney movie

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
or in the Unreal Engine style.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
Particular artists or...

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
Yeah, yeah, you could or, you know, you could cite genres of art.

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
You give it a fairly descriptive sentence, you hit generate,

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
and then it just creates an image out of whole cloth or, you know,

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
actually based on everything else that's observed.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
And if you want a living example of this, just go to Jupiter.tube.

29:04.000 --> 29:10.000
The still images for several weeks worth of episodes now have been generated using this tooling

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
just because it's a great example of where this actually makes sense.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
It's one step below stock photography purposes, right?

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
The general post where you just need an image that fits

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
or I'm trying to generate something that I have an image of what this episode is about

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
and so I can use it to invoke an image that kind of represents that.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
It works for like a live stream teaser, social media post.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
It's not art I'm going to hang on my wall at this point.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
We, of course, we're not chumps.

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
We're not using some hosted service to generate these images.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Let's be real, right?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
So we have been playing around with some of this.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Do you want to define any of the terms before we get into what we chose to use

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
and how we deployed it and how people can try it out?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I don't know that we really need to.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
I mean if you're interested, right, like stable diffusion is a latent diffusion model

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
which is a deep generative neural network.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
But I don't think that practically doesn't matter, right?

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
Because the whole power is like you can get into the math and the details

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
which is all very fascinating.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
But the power of it is it presents you with a very human, at least to some extent,

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
human friendly interface that you can give suggestions to and tweak and play with

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
and then come up with stuff that I would never be able to create by myself, right?

30:19.000 --> 30:24.000
Like rich, detailed artists, you know, like things that look like legitimate paintings.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
It's wild.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Yeah.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
There are pictures that we have generated, you and I were playing with this,

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
that if we didn't know what we were doing, we wouldn't have necessarily guessed

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
they were AI image generated necessarily.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
Like some of the ones you did of politicians, figures that are really well known

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
where there's a lot of source material, some of them honestly look like paintings or like...

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Art that you'd pay for or hire or see at Comic-Con or something.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Yeah.

30:48.000 --> 30:55.000
So if it's something that has a lot of data on, it's remarkable what it can do with that.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Let's talk about what we were playing around with.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
We were playing around with something called, what is it, automatic 11111?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Is that the name of it?

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
So that's a user out there who's done a great job of packaging up these latest models

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
because there's a lot...

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
That's the other part here that's been really exciting.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
There's all kinds of...

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
A lot of the stuff gets published and put on open access journals

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
and then they throw like code dumps over on GitHub

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
where you can go see the papers and some of the stuff.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
But again, do you have the model access?

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
And then even then, you got to build this complicated Python slash C slash Fortran tooling

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
to get all the accelerate graphics and you got to make sure you have GPU that works

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
and you got to install CUDA and get it all wired up.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
And so it can be a lot, especially if you've never played with any of this stuff before

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
to really get it working.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
So I think where it crossed the line to something we could talk about in the show

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
is it's literally a Docker compose file at this point.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I mean, there's a couple of steps to do and you still need a GPU,

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
although actually a couple of these you can do on the CPU now too.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Sure, it'll take longer.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
You might not get the same results, but it's becoming more and more accessible,

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
especially when you don't need to install or understand specific deep learning,

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
specific tool chains that you got to set up.

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
Now, I will tell you, we decided to do this on a Leno GPU instance.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
Now, these GPU instances, there's not a lot of them.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
So they're a more precious resource.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
So I don't know if I would recommend it for everyone.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
But if this was something you were going to say, keep around for your business,

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
like we might consider doing, it could be worth trying on Leno

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
because the GPUs just crush this work.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
But so with a Docker compose file, Wes, you were able to bring up

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
this stable diffusion generator app.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And it's remarkable how powerful this is.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
And it's just full of goodies.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
Yeah, and it's got, in the particular one we'll have linked in the show notes,

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
it kind of packaged up.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
It's just so neat to see, it reminds me of other bits in the open source world

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
where something comes over because the first release of stable diffusion

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
was just this year.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
It's all pretty new stuff.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
And so seeing the community get excited about it and the flowering of different

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
interpretations and people are, because it kind of came with like,

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
here's your model, here's like a Python script that has different command line

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
options to like, oh, give it a prompt and do text to image or do image to image,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
just like try to upscale the image.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
And people put different takes on web UIs and ways to tune and talk to the model.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
All integrated in fancy little workflows.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Yeah.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
One of the things that's really neat is the, you can upload an image,

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
like you just said, and then you can tell it to tweak that image.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
And so you did a couple where I sent you a picture of Lady Jupes with all her

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
slides out.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
It was a moment of celebration.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.000
And Hadia was celebrating in the picture and you were able to replace Hadia,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
but it needed something to fill in in the background where she was standing

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
because there's just a hole in the image.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
So it just kind of created a room back there to fill in.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
And it looked totally natural.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
I gave it some prompts.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
I was like, you know, give it like motorhome, RV, living room,

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
home furnishing kind of stuff.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
And then, yeah, I mean, it's like a lot of these, you kind of generate,

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
it works best if you sort of generate in batches and give it a couple of different

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
options because you'll find one that fits.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Like not all of them were perfectly sort of believable and how the perspective

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
played out with what it filled in, but at least a couple of the set that I sent

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
to you, it's like, yeah.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
I wouldn't know this wasn't a photo of your rig if I never actually,

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
you know, slept in there.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
Another great one that you did is you uploaded a picture of you, Jeff, Alex,

34:11.000 --> 34:16.000
and Levi, and Brent, and then swapped out the background, which worked really well.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
It's like you guys are in front of a green screen.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
It does it so well.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
But then the other thing that you can have it do is you can have it replace just Levi.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
So everything in the picture remains absolutely the same.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
But now Brent, instead of holding Levi, he's holding a penguin.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
And it had to kind of redo his chin a little bit because Levi was bigger

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
and had to kind of come up with a shirt.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
But at first glance, it looks believable like Brent standing in California

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
holding a penguin.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
That's the penguin bib.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
You know, you don't want just the penguin on your shirt.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
They poo.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Yeah, they poo.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Yeah, it looks like he's wearing a penguin bib.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
But it's a pretty cool effect, and it's just a way to tweak an existing picture

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
and replace something in there with something believable.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
And it sometimes has to come up with, you know, what to put in the background

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
for what it replaces.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
Our live stream image today is three penguins hanging out in a messy office

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
with a laptop, and that was generated using the Stable Diffusion self-hosted app

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
that we have running up on Linode.

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
So I think what we'll do is because we are a glutton for punishment,

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
and I'm sure this is going to break, is I'm going to post the URL

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
for the JB self-hosted Stable Diffusion application.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
I think only a couple of you are going to be able to generate it at a time,

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
but I'd be curious to see what people come up with,

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
and you can share it in the matrix chat, the picture that you generate.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
There is a history tab, too, so we can check it out there.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Oh, good.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
I was wondering.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
So I'm going to post this link, and then while we see what the live stream

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
can come up with, I wanted to talk to you guys a little bit about the morality

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
of this for a moment.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
Yeah, there's been some particular drama recently around the Stable Diffusion stuff.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Do you want to recap us on that?

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
Oh, well, just, you know, they came up with the first version,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
and everyone was very excited about it.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
And they've gotten some more funding, some more details came out

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
about how they like, you know, their giant cluster of GPUs they use,

36:01.000 --> 36:05.000
and I think it was like $600,000 it cost to train the first release of the model,

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
and people are impressed that it's that low.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
That's the kind of, you know, scale it takes to do these things.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Jeez, really?

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
Mm-hmm.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
But this is sort of, you know, there's the Stability AI company.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
There's a few players who are involved, and researchers at universities,

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
and, you know, another group.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
And one of the groups released sort of this model checkpoint 1.5,

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
and one group, another group sort of said like, oh, that's like an IP leak,

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
or they were, there was some drama around should they have done that or not.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
And then blog posts written about, you know, we're trying to take it slow,

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
and that all comes back because they've, when they just dumped this out there,

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
a lot of tools got set up that didn't provide any filtering.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Yeah.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.000
And they've been, you know, the Stability AI,

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
which is kind of the most public part of this various partnerships,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
they've been getting a lot of pressure from politicians,

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
from various groups about like, you know, you can't,

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
you shouldn't be letting people just have access to this uncontrolled,

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
which doesn't really, I mean, I can certainly appreciate having some concerns

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
about, you know, we obviously have talked about the concerns around deepfakes

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
and what this means for our society,

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
but I think our open source philosophy means we don't,

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
we don't think necessarily controlling access to the technology is a viable,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
a viable way forward.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
I like the founder of Stability AI put it,

37:26.000 --> 37:32.000
a percentage of people are simply unpleasant and weird, but that's humanity.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
That's very accurate though.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I think we're already seeing some history come in.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I don't know, are these specific to our service?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
These are some great ones here.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Yeah.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
You know, Wes, what strikes me is it seems I'm a little uncomfortable

37:45.000 --> 37:49.000
with how you can just ape a style or a particular artist.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
That seems like computer aided theft almost.

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
I mean, imagine if I could just say, read this sentence in the style of Wes Payne

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
and it was like 90% there and then it's like Wes doesn't show up that day.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Well, no big deal.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
I'll just tell it to generate in the style of Wes or Brent can't make it this week.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
That feels like we're crossing a line of potentially dangerous

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
and then of course could be used maliciously for politicians or leaders.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Certainly, yeah.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
But I guess that's always been like, is it any different than saying,

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
well, you could use Linux to create weapons?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
I mean.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And it does, it seems like one of those things too where it's not,

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
that's not really going to stop the more powerful interested groups

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
who can just buy privileged access to these things

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
or train models themselves if they want to and seemingly already are.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
That's true.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
It's already out there.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
Whereas, it seems like open source works so well for so many things

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
and if the more popular models, if we have open source models

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
that are the more popular ones that are being used to generate stuff,

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
at least for that, we'll have a better understanding collectively of how it works,

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
how we can tell that it's been generated maybe.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
We'll have leverage more of the research community

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
to sort of give us information about how to understand its impact.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
Plus, it's just, I mean, it's a heck of a lot of fun.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
It is so much fun.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
I am resisting laughing out loud at what the live stream is making right now.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
We have Biden holding a cat,

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
but I think my absolute favorite right now was generated by Neve,

39:21.000 --> 39:27.000
which is Godzilla in a data center drinking beer, eating pizza.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Absolutely brilliant.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
I'm impressed how these things are cranking out.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
I wasn't sure how this thing would hold up throwing a live stream at it like this.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
It seems like a great way to DDoS the system.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
It's a nice little rig we got here.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It's got a Quadro RTX 6000.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Okay.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
All right.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
That's pretty great.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
I think we got 32 gigs of regular old RAM.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Okay.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
Yeah, I'm very impressed with how it's holding up.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
I can load while people are generating them.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I can load the history in real time.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
You know, just to combine topics, this is running on 2210.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
So try that out.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
I will say it's still on the server side of 2210.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
It's still a bit early on like everybody having an app repo set up for it

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
because it just dropped.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
Yeah.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
So like Docker didn't have app repo set up for it just yet.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
And a few things like the NVIDIA didn't because I did have to do a little setup.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
You got to install CUDA on the host layer.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
So that's like the right stuff.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
And then there's a specific NVIDIA Docker thing that you set up that sort of bridges

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
the two that make sure that like the Docker containers have the right access to talk.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Okay.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
So there's a few steps.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
We'll have links to some of those docs in the show notes for folks that want to replicate.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
But if you did it on something besides 2210, it might be a little bit simpler.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
Yeah.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Yeah.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Yeah.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
We just wanted to play around with 2210 on the server as well.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I completely had forgotten we'd done that.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
But yeah, I thank you for remembering.

40:42.000 --> 40:48.000
You know what strikes me about this is another aspect to these toolings that like in the

40:48.000 --> 40:56.000
past required expert Photoshop skills is they can be used to resize and up res things in

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
a way that even fills in details if you need and whatnot.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
I was just playing around with trying to, you know, taking some pictures of the sunset

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
but there was gosh darn power lines in the way.

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
And I was just playing with how, you know, how good of a job can I get it to do to patch

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
those things out?

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Decent.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
I think I need to fuss with it.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
And that's the interesting layer.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
I'm sure these all get rapidly better.

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
But for the moment, there's like an operator skill that you sort of need to acquire with

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
these because there's a lot of different knobs to play with.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
There's a lot of different things.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
And then there's a, you know, you got to learn the dialogue of the models you're talking

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
to and figure out like what words work well to get you to do this mapping of the image

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
you have and how to get the machine to invoke that same image.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
You think it's easy, but you actually have to be pretty descriptive in a way that it

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
understands.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
So it's both words that it recognizes.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Styles it knows.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Content it's been trained on that works well.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
Like you get your own intuition of how it's working much like it has an intuition of its

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
own that's trained.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
Which is why it sucks to use one of the paid services that like lets you generate X images

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
for a price because you have to generate image after image to learn how to use these things

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
properly.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
And like so many other you have just less knowledge of like, well one, all the all the

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
different controls that they may have access to, but then you don't really know when it

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
changes too, right?

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
They might load in the next model version, which might still be better, but can change

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
out from under you.

42:08.000 --> 42:14.000
It really feels like this is developing really fast Brent like, you know, in since before

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
we left for the road trip, this stuff kind of existed, but you know, wasn't really very

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
public.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.000
And you know, it was really small group of people to now to this point where it's it's

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
spread like wildfire and it's Docker compose away.

42:27.000 --> 42:34.000
I'm wondering just as a photographer, if you've got any thoughts on this type of work potentially

42:34.000 --> 42:42.000
taking work away from photographers or changing the tooling people use because these are free

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
software.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
It is on Linux.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
There's that advantage to it.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
But does that is that right?

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Fix the wrong of stealing your jerk.

42:49.000 --> 42:56.000
I think it's a really complex issue and would affect any visual artist really not just photographers.

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
I have a few questions and I don't think I've formed an opinion yet because this is so fresh.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
One of them what I guess one of the questions I have for you both and for the audience as

43:05.000 --> 43:14.000
a whole is like, if you didn't know, an image was generated by a computer via these models

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
versus, you know, a human artist.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Do you care?

43:18.000 --> 43:25.000
You know, if there's a painting on your wall that is that you really love, does it matter?

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
From a philosophical point of view?

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
I'm not I'm not sure and I'm still exploring that question.

43:31.000 --> 43:36.000
I think probably it doesn't unless you want to have a connection to another human being

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
who may be the artist.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
That's a whole different reason to buy art.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
Yeah, I think there's a discussion about this and that sort of suggested that maybe the

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
art is not a like a true false, you know, there's like a spectrum that these things

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
can fall onto.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
Whereas like, you know, there's obviously the layer of like, does it evoke an emotional

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
response in you?

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Does it make you laugh?

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Does it bring you joy?

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
Are you, you know, you want to, it inspires you to find more art like that, or it could

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
even find, inspire you to find more art, you know, real human artists or human artists

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
anyway, let's drop the real term there, who do art in that particular style.

44:10.000 --> 44:16.000
And then of course, there's the side of you, you know, how much design and thought went

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
into the person crafting the prompt for the thing.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
You generated a really cool, I mean, this is wallpaper material here.

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
Yeah, and I was just trying to get it to do, I was playing on the, you know, Dragon SpaceX,

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
I was trying to get like a dragon rocket thing, but just made me some real pretty dragon images.

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
If you join our matrix, even after listening, you can always scroll back in the JB General

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
chat, and you can see these pictures that have been posted.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
They're fascinating.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
They're absolutely fascinating.

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
Yeah, I'm left a little bit like, it kind of makes me feel how copilot makes me feel.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
And I thought that was an interesting thing where I feel like copilot could be used to

44:50.000 --> 44:56.000
launder open code and people could then ship it in their closed source and be like, oh,

44:56.000 --> 45:01.000
I didn't, I didn't know it was, I mean, yeah, I might've put things in that kind of reproduced

45:01.000 --> 45:06.000
the exact free software code I was looking for, but copilot did that, not me.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
So I didn't, I didn't, I didn't break any copyright law.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
It was copilot.

45:10.000 --> 45:15.000
And I kind of feel like in a way you could do that with the stable diffusion stuff as

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
it gets more powerful.

45:16.000 --> 45:21.000
Cause this is like a few months into it being out in the general public and it's just remarkable

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
what we could do via Docker compose.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
And like in a few minutes you've got a web instance up and going with a usable UI and

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
they could just start putting prompts in and tweaking stuff.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
And I mean, it just blows my mind how far it's come in just a few months.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
And I can only imagine how far it'll be in two, three, four years.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
I think it'll be producing indistinguishable from human created stuff.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Yeah.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
And the, you know, that stuff we were playing with, like replacing Levi with a penguin,

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
the, that in, in painting stuff or out painting where you can sort of take a seed image and

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
then generate surroundings around it.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
I think that has a lot of potential as well, just because, you know, that boy talk about

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
taking, taking over stuff you do in Photoshop before.

45:56.000 --> 46:04.000
Well, how funny would it be if for Linux users AI and using things like stable diffusion

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
became more possible and more, well, it has.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
It's already happened.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
It's more available than actual Photoshop is for Linux users.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
You can use an entire AI construct to modify an image before Adobe got off their butt to

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
ship Photoshop for Linux.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
It's just going to be irrelevant at some point.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Yeah.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
Well, actually I've already used it.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Okay.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
Sometimes I make Telegram stickers just because it's out of photos of, of some of my friends

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
I have on Telegram.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
It's kind of fun.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
That's a great idea.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Right.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
And I've been using this little online tool.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
I think it's like remove.bg or something and remove background.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
And it's just like a little online AI tool that does a decent job.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
You got to pay for the full size, but for stickers, I never need that.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
So it's like downgraded size, but it works fine.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
But if I ever wanted to do that, you know, it's thought it's occurred to me, like, this

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
is really handy.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
There might be times where I'd want to pay for this because it's way faster than me cutting

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
it out by hand in Photoshop or something like that.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Right.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
And this can do the same thing, right?

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
Like I can just, I can just like mark out the area that I don't want to be messed up

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
and then it'll replace the rest of the background.

46:59.000 --> 47:06.000
I used it to create a carport idea that I had in my mind, a general rough idea, so I

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
could show Hadiya a visual of what I was thinking about.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Oh, that's smart.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
This is a rough idea.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
You know, you'd never want to use it for anything serious.

47:13.000 --> 47:19.000
I also heard a fellow podcaster tell me that he used this to create an example of the cover

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
art he was looking for for a new podcast that he's creating.

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
And then he took it once it got a general idea that looked crappy, but he took that

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
and gave it to an artist and they actually created something that he could ship.

47:30.000 --> 47:35.000
I've also heard of folks come up with like board game ideas and graphics for board games

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
that are like generated text and rules and images.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
There's some pictures here that have been generated by the audience of a penguin flying

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
past Jupiter.

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
I could see us using some of these actually for things.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
These are kind of pretty.

47:49.000 --> 47:54.000
And it does have an upsizer too, so you could upsize them for professional use too.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
But isn't there copyright?

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
Like wouldn't our audience members have to give us...

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
Did they create it or did our server create it for them?

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
That's a really good question.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Who owns that?

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
And so there's more and more.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
There's like a bunch of mage spaces online that are used, stable diffusion and other

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
models.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
But there's a lot of that out there too where like you got to be careful if you go type

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
in random prompts on the internet.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
Like a lot of them will say, well, we reserve rights to anything you generate by typing

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
in our prompt.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
There's some really cool stuff getting generated with.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Did you do that on ours?

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Yeah.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Wow.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
It's from yesterday, but yeah.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
That looks like an evil...

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
It's supposed to be Waluigi.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Oh, I see.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
But it's got that mustache, right?

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Yeah.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
These are really cool.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Now, I know that makes for horrible audio podcasting.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
So I'll just say again, you can find them in our chat.

48:41.000 --> 48:47.000
But the idea is that again, like the Dragon wallpaper that you just posted and the Waluigi

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
picture, I honestly would not know that was AI generated.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
I'm fine with that having them on the wall.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
No problem.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Yeah.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Yeah.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
That's just crazy.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
There's zero tell with those two that you just...

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
You've gotten really good at the prompts.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
You've been looking at what other people have been prompting in the generator.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
And that's...

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
Yeah, that's definitely you want to do that.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Go find...

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
There's more and more sites that are popping up that you can go search for.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
It's just like galleries of generated images with different models.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
A lot of them specify which model was used and all that.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
And then they have the prompts.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
There's also some websites that'll help you do like a prompt maker sort of like, you know,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
WYSIWYG give pieces of the prompt.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
You can still like you want to make a landscape and you want to make it look like this and

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
white and here's how the color profile should look or whatever.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Totally.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
There's a lot of tools out there that you can start playing with because sometimes you

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
need really specific things in there to get the model to do exactly what you want.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
Like if you really need to be like hyper realistic or you want a particular art style.

49:36.000 --> 49:41.000
I have an interesting question that I think is specific to this podcast.

49:41.000 --> 49:48.000
What if let's say in six months we want to take a holiday and some of the content or

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
maybe even all of the content of a specific episode we just generated with our back catalog

49:53.000 --> 49:59.000
and it's so believable because it's taking, you know, new snippets from all the websites

49:59.000 --> 50:04.000
that we typically use and it would basically be an episode of Linux Unplugged.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
But we were on holidays doing it.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Would the audience be OK with that?

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
If you tell them now we can't fake them out, Brent.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
This is a fun hypothetical though.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
It's a total hypothetical.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
But let's say it was legitimately good to listen to.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
It sounded really like us.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
It met our quality of release standards.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
You learned something new along the way.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Yeah, especially if you could put in new data.

50:27.000 --> 50:33.000
So it had 15 years worth of Linux stuff we've talked about plus new data.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
New Ferronix articles.

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
Yeah, put LWA and Ferronix in there and the Linux kernel mailing list.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
It's basically what we do on a weekly basis.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
What would you think of that audience?

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
Let us know.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Boostin or linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
And maybe don't listen too closely in the future.

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
So in lieu of a particular pick segment, what we're going to do is pack the show notes with some links.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Do we have a link to the one you can run on your CPU?

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
Do we have that one tracked down?

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
If we can, we will put that in there.

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
We'll absolutely put the one we've been using in there as well as a couple other alternatives.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
And I also am very much kind of feeling like Brent.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
I haven't really made up my mind about this and how I feel about it, the moralities of it.

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
That's also something I'd be really interested in your feedback on out there, dear audience.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
And particularly, does it make you feel better?

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
Like Wes said, it is open source, so at least we can look under the hood.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
It doesn't seem like this technology is going to go away,

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
but at least it is free software or open source so we can inspect it.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
And does that temper how you feel about it if you do have concerns?

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
Let us know. You can get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com and boost in,

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
or you can go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

51:47.000 --> 51:53.000
Bitwarden.com slash linux. Bitwarden is our password management of choice.

51:53.000 --> 51:58.000
It's how we secure all kinds of secrets like recovery keys, two-factor authentication tokens,

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
and of course, complicated secure passwords.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
It's also how I generate my usernames.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
And October is Cyber Security Awareness Month, and Bitwarden would like to remind everyone

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
that using a good password manager could be one of the number one things you can do to stay safe.

52:11.000 --> 52:15.000
And they've just rolled out new features like password-protected vault export,

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
a mobile username generator on the mobile app now.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
They're now also tying in with DuckDuckGo's email alias generation feature,

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
so you can have a unique username, a unique email address, and also a unique password.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
I know a lot of you are Fastmail fans. They tie in with Fastmail as well,

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
just to help reduce and cut down your spam, but also to eliminate your attack surface,

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
so that way your username and your passwords aren't leaking out there together.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
There's so many great features in Bitwarden. They're constantly adding new stuff.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
I've been so impressed. They've been a sponsor now for a few months,

52:44.000 --> 52:48.000
and new stuff gets added every single month that I get to tell you guys about.

52:48.000 --> 52:54.000
And Bitwarden is the easiest way for businesses or individuals to store, share, and sync sensitive data.

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
If you're an individual or a business, head over to bitwarden.com slash Linux right now.

52:58.000 --> 53:03.000
It's the easiest way to get started, and it also will just greatly improve your security.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
And you may already know that. You guys probably already know that out there,

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
because you're listening to the Linux Unplugged podcast. You're clever.

53:09.000 --> 53:16.000
But maybe a friend, family member, maybe it's Brent, maybe it's your place of work,

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
maybe it's an open source project, maybe they could be doing things better.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
Let them know, and send them to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
I think you'll be really impressed, and it's trusted by millions in the community.

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
And of course, it's open source. So check it out for yourself and support the show.

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
Instead of feedback this week, which we did get some great stuff. Thank you, everyone.

53:45.000 --> 53:50.000
We did want to focus a little bit more on some boosts that really got us pondering.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
So Chris, why don't you kick it off?

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
And now it is time for the boost.

53:57.000 --> 54:02.000
It's specifically the subject. This is something that came up in my private life.

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
I was having a conversation with a friend, and then we got a couple of boosts about ButterFS.

54:07.000 --> 54:13.000
And hybrid sarcasm, great name, boosted in with 2048 sats.

54:13.000 --> 54:19.000
Count me among the ButterFS haters. I went ZFS years ago and never looked back.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
Proxmox and Ubuntu make ZFS super easy.

54:23.000 --> 54:29.000
I would like to know if your affinity for ButterFS is philosophical or technical.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
And if I should reconsider ButterFS.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
That's wonderful.

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
So I think he's asking if it's philosophical because of the licensing differences, right?

54:38.000 --> 54:43.000
ButterFS is GPL. It's built into Linux kernel. It's all upstream.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
We don't have that luxury with ZFS.

54:46.000 --> 54:50.000
It's a more limited license, and it's not built into Linux kernel.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
Here's my take on ButterFS.

54:53.000 --> 54:59.000
You guys know me. I was a ButterFS hater for like years on this show specifically.

54:59.000 --> 55:02.000
That would actually be a fun thing to go back and pull a few clips from.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
Hypocrite Chris Laz's take on ButterFS.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Yeah.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
A few contrasting clips. Yeah.

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
Twice I lost data to ButterFS. Twice.

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
I was not a ButterFS fan.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
But things change.

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
And specifically in free software, sometimes things fundamentally shift.

55:21.000 --> 55:28.000
And what happened is the upshot of Facebook being a company is they do a lot of open source software development.

55:28.000 --> 55:33.000
And they dedicated some serious resources to ButterFS.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
Including hiring one of the primary developers of ButterFS and letting them work on ButterFS.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
And then they deployed it.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
And then they continued to improve it.

55:41.000 --> 55:47.000
And over the last five years, ButterFS has made tremendous strides.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
And in most recent Linux kernels, the RAID 5.6 hole has been fixed as well.

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
Haven't tested it, but the team reports it's fixed.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
A lot of people have an old school view of file systems.

55:58.000 --> 56:04.000
Back in the 80s and 90s, if a file system wrongs you, it didn't really get better.

56:04.000 --> 56:13.000
It was a bad file system and you were a good system admin or a good tech user if you just avoided the bad file systems.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Because they weren't getting any better.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
And it was a safe way to protect your data.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
And ButterFS started life with a bad reputation.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
And I think Red Hat has done a lot of damage here.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
They've really pushed people towards Stratus.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
And they've removed ButterFS support from RHEL.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
And I think that has sent a bad signal.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
And I think eventually Red Hat will have to correct course.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
It'll probably take them two more releases before they acknowledge it.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
Because Stratus is like not... I get complaints about it all the time from the audience.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
It's just not solving problems for people.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
And Extended 4 is too basic of a file system.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
NTFS is better than Extended 4.

56:50.000 --> 56:53.000
Extended 4 is basically Extended 3, which is basically Extended 2.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
It doesn't even have snapshots.

56:54.000 --> 57:00.000
It doesn't have some of the core functionality like send and receive that makes a system super quick to backup or restore.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
It doesn't have compression.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
It doesn't have encryption.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
It doesn't have sub-volumes.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
You can't combine volumes.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
It's just so basic.

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
And while I know a lot of you listening think, well, that's why I like it, Chris.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
Good. But it's not competitive.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
It's not competitive.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
And the commercial operating systems, the freaking iPhones, man.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
Freaking iPhones have a more sophisticated file system than your Linux box.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
It's just sad.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
And I blame Red Hat for a lot of this.

57:28.000 --> 57:35.000
Because I think the server side would be deeper into ButterFS if Red Hat had put the resources into it that Facebook had.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
And so it's gotten better.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
And now I run ButterFS on everything.

57:40.000 --> 57:45.000
And there's an absolute tactical advantage to the combo of ButterFS and CFS.

57:45.000 --> 57:53.000
Your core file systems, the things required to make your system boot and become available as ButterFS is chef's kiss.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
Because after every kernel update, every reboot, that system comes online.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
And that's a fact.

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
Because you're not loading a third party external module into the kernel.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
That breaks sometimes.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
That's always been the way it is in Linux.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
It doesn't break often.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
But it inevitably does break.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
ButterFS doesn't have that problem.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Never will have that problem.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
It's GPL.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
It's upstream.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
It's built into the Linux kernel.

58:13.000 --> 58:19.000
That gives you an advantage if you depend on that disk being online for a system to be available.

58:19.000 --> 58:26.000
Now, where I think you can have a little bit of your peanut butter and your jelly is you can also have large data sets that are still CFS.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
You can use both.

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
It doesn't have to be a one or the other only world.

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
And so ButterFS over time has greatly improved.

58:34.000 --> 58:41.000
And then when you consider low-end devices like Raspberry Pis or laptops that maybe have a single SSD, there's a lot.

58:41.000 --> 58:48.000
In fact, you could say millions of use cases or perhaps small VPSs, small virtual machines, things like that,

58:48.000 --> 58:55.000
that need the features of an advanced file system but can't particularly afford the overhead of the ZFS file system.

58:55.000 --> 59:01.000
There are millions of use cases like that and ButterFS is a perfect solution.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
I run it on all my Raspberry Pis and I have too many of them and it has worked great.

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
And so it is mostly a technical.

59:09.000 --> 59:17.000
I guess philosophically I feel better that it's GPL but the licensing isn't what prevents me from using one over the other.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Right.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
If the license was right but the technology was wrong or just didn't work or kept losing your data still,

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
then you probably wouldn't continue to use it.

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
Do you have any thoughts on philosophical versus technical?

59:28.000 --> 59:33.000
I mean, I've never really asked you if you have any preference of one over the other in that regard.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
No.

59:34.000 --> 59:40.000
I mean, I think ZFS, it could matter if it was the question to deploy a proprietary file system or not.

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
I think that would maybe be closer.

59:42.000 --> 59:47.000
The licensing one with ZFS at least is just sort of an unfortunate particular details.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
Yeah, of its origin.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
Right.

59:49.000 --> 59:53.000
But whereas obviously OpenZFS is a very successful open source project, it's great.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
But no, I think I like your point that it's not don't just use ButterFest to use ButterFest.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Use ButterFest like when it makes sense and it meets your needs.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Use ZFS when it's the right file system or if you're more comfortable with it or if it was better designed for your particular use case.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I'll tell you one nice advantage of ZFS for us has been portability.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Yeah.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
We've moved ZFS from a FreeNAS instance to a CentOS instance to an Arch instance.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Whatever crazy OS we're running.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Nix and you can move it around every single time and they're all going to work.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And ZFS feature flags make it really easy to know what's going to work and what won't work.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Now you have to build, you know, might have to build the module on some systems, but that's fine.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
If you're comfortable with that, that's not a big deal.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
All right. And then on the same topic of ButterFest, that's why we wanted to make some room for this, guys,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
is because I think this is a conversation we need to have because people brought up to me privately.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Tim White 101 boosted with 26,001 SATs.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Coming in hot with the boost.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Tim White 101 writes, Hi, guys, I'm looking for input on ButterFest caching.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
ButterFest caching. All right.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
So he's got two 10 terabyte spin and rust drives and he's got a terabyte MVME drive.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
So he wants to split into two.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
But he's mixing up LVM and ButterFest in here quite a bit.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And he's wondering, I hear differing views on Bcache or if I should wait for BcacheFS.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
ZFS offers L2 caching built in, but I'm worried that if I use ZFS caching with my MVME,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
it'll send it to an early grave because it'll do a lot of writes.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
So he's wondering if we have an advice on A, should he look into BcacheFS?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
B, should he look into ZFS caching?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Or C, is there a way you can do it all with ButterFest while avoiding wearing his drives down to basically nubbins?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Just there's a lot there. I mean, I think it probably depends like what is it?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Is it read and write caching?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
It's just like a read cache that might depend.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.000
I have seen some successful setups with Bcache doing the block layer caching in front of ButterFS.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
But you probably, I think, really depend on what you're at.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
What are you caching and why?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
How sensitive is it?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And then probably whatever you do, if you have the time, you know, the affordances of getting to play with this stuff,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
you might just want to do some test setups and actually see like, do they meet your workloads?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Because it'd be hard without some details of what you're trying to hit to know exactly like,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
if you're just trying to save a little stuff, can you get by with just ButterFS on the default caching?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Is that good enough using in-memory or do you really need this additional device?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Could totally vary depending on how serious you are about what's pulling all this data

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
and how often it's really going to be in the cache.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I'm going to say tap the brakes on the Bcache and the BcacheFS stuff.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Yeah, also that like if you're going for prod right now, BcacheFS is not probably the thing you want to do.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
If you want to play with it, you should definitely play with it.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
I'm going to say take it off the table for now.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Play with it on a test machine.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Play around with it with some virtual VHD files.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Don't mess around with it right now.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Wait until he tells you it's ready.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Now, you didn't tell us what kind of rig you got in terms of RAM and CPU

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
because that also plays a factor if you choose ZFS over ButterFS.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I think you're going to probably figure out by now that if it's on the lower end of the spectrum,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
you might just want to consider ButterFS.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I think you ought to test it like Wes is saying.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I think you may be a little too worried about sending your MVME to an early grave.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I have a lot of old SSDs and MVMEs that are even the crappy kind and they're still running.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:10.000
So I think the death of MVMEs due to cache writing has been slightly exaggerated.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Maybe I'm wrong on that.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
People out there have had a different experience.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Do let me know.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
But I would say go with Wes's recommendation.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Test ButterFS.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Play around with caching there.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Keep it really simple in that regard because you're going to have to come back to this in a year or two

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
when something dies and replace it.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
And the simpler it is, the easier it's going to be to get up and going again.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It does seem like the LVM route would definitely work.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Some folks seem to not like the LVM route because it's maybe less flexible or just more you got to learn.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
So that seems like if you're already comfortable with LVM, yeah, maybe just stick with that.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Totally could do.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Totally, totally could do.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
All right, moving right along.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
But thank you guys for boosting in.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
We got some really great ones this week, like some really great ones.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
So we appreciate everybody.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Batvin321 boosted in with a set of LeetSats.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Respect should be earned.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
He says, I'm also planning on going to Ohio Linux Fest.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I should bring my retro FireWire DigiDesign 002 rackmount audio interface.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Maybe as old as me.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
It's so big I need to record on the back of my car for a tailgate recording.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
This is in reference to last week.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
We had a listener who's going to do some recording for us.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I wanted to mention, we have the Columbus Club on Matrix.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And this is where people can organize for Ohio Linux Fest.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
And we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
GeneBean also boosted in with a set of LeetSats.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Respect should be earned.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:39.000
What I'm hearing from this review of the Thaleo is that this would be a great way for me to remove some thumb twiddling from my Gen 2 builds.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000
GeneBean also sent in a boost saying that they'd provide us with some geocaching resources, and they did.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Nice. Thanks, GeneBean.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So I think we've made the business decision to order a Thaleo.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:55.000
They're on sale right now, and they just, I believe, updated them with the 13th Gen Intel's.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So I think that's going to happen.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
It's a big step. I'm still sitting with it.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
But I think it's going to be our replacement OBS machine.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
That's so exciting.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.000
My logic being that one of these three machines, I predict, will die in the next two months.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I'm betting it's the OBS machine.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000
So I'd like to get replacement hardware in so I can start the transition before it dies.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
See what I did there? Before it dies.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Weird.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Yeah.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
That's odd.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Wait, wait, wait.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I'm saying before it's an emergency.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Okay. Wow. I'm not used to this.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Or, you know what, we'll order it, it'll sit around in the box for a few weeks, and then it'll die and we'll get it set up.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
It still might be an emergency.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Now, my understanding was that someone on the business insisted that you had to run NixOS on there, right?

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
That was the only condition.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Chris, I have a question whether you have an update on the Thaleo from last week.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Did you ever figure out what went wrong with that thing?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Yes, we had a problem where it powered off on us randomly.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
And then, Brent, I'm not kidding you, we were sitting here after the show working on post-show stuff,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
and I went upstairs and it powered up.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Come on.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
From off all the way to on.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
It's those solar storms we've been having.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Yeah, I don't know if the case was loose or what.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I was going to toy with it, and then I ended up getting sick.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I got a stomach bug, so I wanted to ship it back and get it back to them so they can take a look at it.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
We'll figure it out.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I still think you broke the button.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I did love that button.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I pushed a lot of buttons.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Tebulas boosted in with 250 cents.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Went to the Folsom Cash and struck out.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
We'll try again, but we'll bring gloves in a trash bag.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Nice place, but it needs a little bit of pickup.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Struck out.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
So does that mean they didn't find it, or does it mean somebody else already found it and hasn't said anything?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Well, that question, I believe, is probably hard to answer if you don't know where the cash is.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
So we might have to...

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Maybe listener Jeff can go out there and check it out.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Where's the way?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
It was Folsom.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Oh, Folsom.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Yeah, it was near Jeff.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
No, I bet it's...

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
No, Folsom was found.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It was Folsom was already found.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I don't think so.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I disagree completely.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I think we need a tracker.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
All right.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
All right.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Okay.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
All right.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Okay.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Acerbic also boosted in with 1007 cents.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Boost!

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Starting to get into geocaching with my kids and would love to be the Western Australia geocacher for JB.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Also willing to take over other caches with JB stickers.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Ah, all right.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I feel like this geocaching thing might just take off.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I mean, I'm having fun with it, but...

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I wonder if they'd be willing to join us in Matrix and then we could set up a little room for people who volunteer to do this.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
That's not a bad idea.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Are you saying we should have a geocache room in Matrix?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I mean, somebody may have suggested earlier and I'm coming around to it.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Cash club?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Yeah.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
The geocache group?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
The geocache jive?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Nope.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
No good.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Geocache cat?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Nope.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Got nothing.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
We should probably let the members of the group decide their group name.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Marcel boosted in with 2,222 sats.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And you know what that is, Chris.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Rho dux.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Of course you start talking about a Toronto meetup just as I move out of that area.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
When's the Munich meetup?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Sorry, Marcel.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
We'll have to let you know on that one.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Yeah, sorry.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Yeah.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:16.000
You see Rio A also boosted in saying I'll second a Vancouver or especially a Victoria meetup.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
You've started something, Brent.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I think my crew is starting to wake up.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
I like it.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Uh oh.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Oh, another boost from Marcel with a row of dux.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Nicole Lovay has a good video about the Fedora Kodak issue.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000
He explains that RedHot could not really wait until they got sued because knowingly violating

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
a patent is three times the fine of unknowingly violating a patent.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
So once they found out, they had to act quickly.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Sure, I'd like to have the Kodak, but I'm not paying anything for Fedora.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And like you said, most people will probably find workarounds.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
I find Linux users can be very entitled sometimes.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
You're right.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
They could license it.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
They're rich.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I think people get hung up on the should RedHat license it discussion.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000
I don't think that's the core thing to focus on at all on this.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I would like to know why anything really fundamentally changed.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
You're telling me they didn't know that Mesa had these capabilities.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
They weren't knowingly shipping Mesa before.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I mean, of course they were.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
RedHat legal didn't realize and get a whiff of something.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Are we all to just sit here and think that the Fedora developers don't understand how

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.000
this works, that they're so all ignorant that they don't realize that Mesa had these capabilities?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.000
And then the other thing that I think I wish could be done is some kind of middle ground.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
You know, like the way Canonical has done it in the past where there's a checkbox where

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
the user can choose to install them.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Fedora came up with a way for regular old users to install the NVIDIA proprietary graphics

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
driver from GNOME software.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And it feels like if we can overcome that hurdle and make it possible for users to get

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000
the proprietary NVIDIA binary driver, seems like silly old codecs that no end user is

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
going to get sued over realistically should be solvable and there should be tooling that

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
could be made.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
But I don't look like that's happening.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
And I think like the focus on, oh, RedHat should pay for it.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
That's just kind of a silly discussion to begin with.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
The question I had really around that was, is it even feasible?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Could something like that even be done for a price when you don't exactly have exact

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
numbers of the user base?

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
There's no way to really know.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
So how would you even license that?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And could you just buy a bulk license like that?

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I don't know.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And I don't know if we'd actually expect RedHat to ever do something like that.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I think the bigger questions come around, what are the other distributions doing and

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
why aren't they panicking?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I've seen some talk that openSUSE is going to make a change.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Why are the thousands of other distributions not going into some sort of panic?

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
And then what's really the difference?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Unless we're all just thinking maybe they didn't know Mesa had this support to begin

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
with.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
But yeah, it's a shitty situation, I'll tell you that much.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And I mean, it's amateur hour.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Sucks that it happened to a great distribution like Fedora.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I think it's changed things for me and the way I view Fedora.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I view it as vulnerable now.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I view it as vulnerable to commercial interests that override the best interest for Fedora.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Maybe that's the compromise we have to take to have an entity behind Fedora that has the

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
time and dedicated resources to develop things.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
But I'm still sitting with that.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:43.000
It makes me appreciate more distributions like Arch and Nix that don't suffer from the

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
political whims of their patron.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And I don't think I'll ever view Fedora quite the same way anymore.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
I still respect the project, still going to probably use it from time to time.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Something shifted for me at least.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000
This is really kind of an unforgivable thing just because it was user hostile and there

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
was no real effort put in to really solve the problem for users before they take it

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
away.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000
And there's still time, but I don't see anything happening.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
That's all.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And yeah, we could talk more about should Red Hat buy things, but I think that's the

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
silly part of the conversation.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Well, Grunerl.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Yep, Grunerl.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Boosts in with 1000 cents.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Pew!

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Greetings from Germany.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And don't forget your foreign listeners.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
What do you think about the future of Lure?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Thanks for making my daily commute a happy time and enjoying it for years.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I'm wondering if this is something you boys would be interested in trying out.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:48.000
So Lure, L-U-R-E, is intended to bring the Arch user repository to all distributions.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
So this is how I can get my Fedora codex.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Great.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Yeah, right.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
It's currently in a very alpha state.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
It's built in Go, has zero dependencies after it's been built.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
The only thing that Lure needs is a command for privilege avalation or escalation as such

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
as pseudo or something like that.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:10.000
And then of course, a supported package manager in this case, current support for apt, Pacman,

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000
APKs, DNF, yum, and zipper.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
It's funny because, you know, Nyx package manager is kind of the universal thing to

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000
go to now, but I don't know.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Brent, Wes, you guys interested in playing around with this?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
You want to try it?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
I think we better try.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
You're right.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Like Nyx has been meeting a lot of my portable package management dreams lately, but the

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
AOR is great.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And so something that carries on that spirit.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000
I've got to try.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Brent, you want to give it a go?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I'd be super tempted.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I mean, it sounds like they're doing a Herculean effort here that we've been asking for for

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
years.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
So why not?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Well, now I'm just curious.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Like, do we have things for production like Reaper, Sonobus?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Right?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Who knows?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Is it everything in the AUR?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
All right.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
We got to play with it.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Well, Neve boosted and with not quite a row of duck.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
It's 2022 sets.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I want to say this year has been exciting in the hardware space.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Far more than software.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
As such, I, with my own money, picked up an ARC GPU, which I found on my doorstep this

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
morning.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Ah, congrats.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Of course, I just overheard Chris talking about the OBS machine failing and would like

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
to donate this brand new GPU that's still in the box to JB.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
What?

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I'm willing to pay the shipping.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Just tell me where to send it.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
What?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Have we said recently that we have the best listeners?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
I don't know if we can accept that.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
What if we borrowed it for a bit?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Oh, yeah.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Okay.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
And then when we can find one, we'll order it and then we send it back to you, Neve,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
so you can have it back.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Because, I mean, I would really love to try one for the show.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I'd love to use one in an OBS build.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I have been getting very mixed reports on how well it's working for people.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
So it's definitely now like I cutely want to try it out.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
So I will email you back, Neve.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
How about I borrow it from you?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
And that is very generous.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Thank you.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Neve is watching live right now, too.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
So that is really great.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Because, yeah, I was looking at the arcs.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I'm like, I missed my window.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Dang it.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And would you throw it in the new Thaleo then, Chris?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Yeah, totally, dude.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Yeah, for sure.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Make OBS great again.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Mitch from Podverse boosted with 5,000 sats.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
B-O-O-S-T.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Just with a go podcasting.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I had a little opportunity to chat with Mitch this week because, as you both saw, Pocketcast

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
announced that they have gone open source.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Indeed.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
And so I was chatting with our buddy Mitch because Podverse is a podcasting 2.0 client

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
that's GPL.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
And it's available for Android, iOS, and the web.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
And it's the embedded player we're now using on the new Jupyter Broadcasting website.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And I just was curious Mitch's take on it.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And Mitch saw a huge spike in traffic for Podverse on the day Pocketcast announced they

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
went open source.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Interesting.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
That is fascinating.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
That's great, right?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And I think it's in part because Podcast has been talking about Podverse, but also I think

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000
it's people are opening up the idea of an open source podcast app is a great idea.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Why do I need a proprietary company to play an MP3 file again?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Yeah, right?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And also you think about it's an open independent media ecosystem, like the only one that exists.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Yeah, right?

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
It's like the only one that exists.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And why pair that with a commercial closed app?

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Gosh, like the idea of like, oh, no, no, you know, my podcast provider, they lost the licensing

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
with Jupyter Broadcasting, so I can't listen to love anymore.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
The whole back catalog.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Yeah.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
We're fighting over Coderadio.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
That's great.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
So it was great to catch up with Mitch.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I think we're going to have a lot to chat with him about on Office Hours and a future

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
episode coming up soon.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Michael B. boosted in with 3000 sats.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Hey, Chris and team.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I would love to hear your thoughts on the streaming sats while listening features in

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
the new apps.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Is it a sustainable source of value or do you see a higher amount with boost?

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Thanks for the great show, Michael.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:09.000
This is a really great question, and I really appreciate that Michael's even kind of asking

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
this question because what he's really trying to get at is what's the best way for me to

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
return value to the podcast while listening.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Right.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
My take on this is always whatever system works best for you.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000
If the set it and forget it with sat streaming is a better method for you.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I like that because it gives me a bit of signal when you're listening because, you know, I

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
see it on my dashboard that, you know, Michael B. just sent in X amount of sats, but there's

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
no message with it.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
So I also really like the boost because they have a message with it.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And I feel like the baller boosts and all the different boosts are a great way to invest

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
in a particular episode production.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
They're also just a really motivator for the team.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
It's exciting the sort of real time connection that per episode connection like, oh, they

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
were listening to that thing that we said.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
It makes a huge difference to that button is right there in the app.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Right.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And then we have our members and our members are like our our investors on our board that

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000
are always investing in the ongoing production of every episode for a sustained period of

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
time.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And it is so much stress to us.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
It's yeah, it unpluggedcore.com.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Either system, you know, might work better for different people depending on what they

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
got going on every day and in their life and whatnot, how they like to manage that kind

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
of stuff.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000
So today we don't see like a big source of revenue from the strat from the sat streaming.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
We get a higher overall one, I would suppose from the boost.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
But that's not really why we do this.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
So I don't generally have a preference in there.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
But I really appreciate that you're thinking about that because, you know, it is a small

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
independent boutique business.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
It's not something that is too big to fail.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000
If the ad market were to turn sour for a sustained period of time, things would get pretty lean

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
around here.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
But it's nice to know that we have some of these real baseline essentials taken care

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
of.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
So Mars X-Ray boosted in with 1024 sats.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
First time booster.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Just wanted to say keep up the great work on the podcast.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Long live Linux.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Or at least some representation of Linux.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Yours open source Lee Mars X-Ray.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Love seeing the first time boosters.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
That's so great.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And then our last boost of the day came from a great username from Thought Criminal with

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
one thousand nine hundred ninety nine sats.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Boost community supported independent media on open source.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
It was a cool idea a few months ago and now it's even easier than visiting a sponsor or

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
sending an email.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Thanks for tuning me in on the way forward.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I'm in.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
That is so great.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Thought Criminal.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Thank you.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Also, I just want to say a big thank you out there to everybody who boosted in.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Not all of them get on the show.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
We did a big batch this week because the content was just top notch.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
A lot of those got us talking.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
A lot of thought provoking discussion there.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
So that's the bar.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And so we really appreciate the support.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
We read all of them.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
If you didn't make it on the show, doesn't mean it wasn't a great boost.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
It just might mean we got tight on time or we were going for a particular theme like we

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
did with ButterFest this week.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
But we appreciate and read all of them.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Thank you, everybody.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
A couple of shout outs.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
A thousand stats from Opie on the live show topics.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I'll follow up on that.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Thank you for live shows and production.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Five thousand stats from Ninja Mort, who wanted to give a shout out to Easel App and also

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
tell us to keep up the great work.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
We got 1492 stats.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I feel like that's a particular number from Ruark.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Oh, they boosted in their earned stats while listening to us on Fountain.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Very particular indeed.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Interesting.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
A thousand stats from RastakastaVersa, who was the first to report a QA issue.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
We had in last week's episode.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Thanks, Rasta.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Appreciate that.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.000
And we got a hundred stats from NowScienceNews, who is hoping that power prices will eventually

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
come down so they can get into self-hosting.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
We hear you.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:59.000
But check out things like the Odroid H3 NowScienceNews because that thing's sipping like five watts

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000
and I would bet for 90 percent of home use cases, especially when you consider it has

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
quick sync for video decoding, I bet it would solve 90 percent of people's use cases.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Chris' low power colo.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000
There you go.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Set it up here.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Sell it to you in sacks.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, newpodcastapps.com.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
You can also just boost with Podverse.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I got a note from a listener.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I said, you know, I tried out Breeze.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
I don't know.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I want to stick with AntennaPod.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000
So what I do is I just load up the Podverse website and boost from there.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Oh, that's a nice way to do it.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Pull up the old show and boost from there.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Very convenient.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Yeah.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Totes cool.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
We will have lots of links and resources for the diffusion stuff that we talked about,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
for some of the AI voice stuff we talked about, all kinds of things in there.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
So do check out linuxunplug.com.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Slash 481.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
481.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Or go to the new website.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Give it a go.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
You know, go kick the tires and then catch office hours this week because we'll be talking

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
about that new website.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Won't we, Brent?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Yes, we will.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
We might even have a special guest.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Oh, there you go.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:12.000
We do this show on Sundays and we do office hours on Tuesdays, both of which are noon

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
at Pacific time and 3 p.m. on the East Coast time, which is where Brent is at now.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
It's true.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Weird.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
You got to try all the time zones.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
See which one you like best.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Brent Coast time?

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Yeah, it's the Brent Coast.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
See you next week.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Same bad time, same bad station.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And that does wrap us up this week.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
If you'd like to see how the sausage was made, you can head over to Jupiter.Tube or you can

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
become a member where we curate a custom made file just for you.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
We'd love to have you there.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
It's a lot of fun and you get to play around with some of our tools when we talk about

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
it.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
But if you can't make it, we understand.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
That's how it goes for most people.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
No hard feelings at all.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
You can always chat with us after the fact in our Matrix room.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
You can get details at Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Matrix.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And of course, there's a slash mumble for all of our mumble details.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:04.000
And I hope we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Still some pictures coming in.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Oh, wow.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000
These are so fun.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
There's the most recent one is of you.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Oh, yeah.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I love this one MiniMech did of a tux drinking a beer.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
That's great.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000
That is really good MiniMech.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Sonic the Hedgehog in there.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Penguin on the beach.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
This looks like a JFK going down the street, but it's a car full of tuxes.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
You guys got my drift with this one.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
All right.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Oh, boy.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Here's one of me.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
It's kind of close.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I like that it's sort of a reverse SMB7.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Like they almost got it.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Yeah, it's got a podcast mic.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
It's got a computer screen.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
What's on that whiteboard?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I want to know.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Yeah.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Yeah, I don't know.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
And it's got me in a shirt.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
That's a shirt style I would actually wear.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Where are the suspenders?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Right.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
It does need and these podcast setups are actually pretty good.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I like the, you know, this is funny how some of these actually really are.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
God, Wes, you make the best ones.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Jeez.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
It's worth going in the chat just to see these.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Wes Payne, you're an AI digital director artist guy over there.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I'm very impressed.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Trying for like Batcave here.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
That was inspired by Mars X-ray.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
You know, that's just a fun name.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:58.000
But it just took super complicated machine learning, AI models, and a little docker compose

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
to bring out Wes Payne's creative side.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Pencil and paper?

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Heck no.
