00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 26 for February 4th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,320
You're listening to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's green with

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,400
Hulk rage! My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey there Matt, I'm gonna tell you right now,

4
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,760
we might get into it if we have time later in this episode, but I'm considering banning

5
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,800
Fronix from all Jupiter broadcasting productions from here on out. Wow, yeah, I'd love to hear

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,360
more about that. Well, you know, it's not his fault. I mean, I actually respect Michael quite

7
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,200
a bit. We've had him on the Linux Action Show. I've got a link to it in the show notes. I respect

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,640
somebody who works hard and, you know, he has a trade that he puts a lot of energy into and,

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,320
of course, maybe he's spread a little bit thin and, you know, he's created a respectable property

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,680
there. But at the same time, at the same time, I get so mad when we make mistakes in the Linux

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,480
Action Show, especially in the news segment. The Linux Action Show has the privilege, because it's

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,120
coming on, what, its eighth year? It has the privilege of being one of the sources of record

13
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,600
for Linux. Now, it's not the only source, but it's definitely one of the most like time capsule

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,640
like sources for Linux history, because you can go back now eight years into Linux history and

15
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,000
hear about issues at the time that they were happening, you know, the drama, the things that

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
needed to happen and all of that. And it's sort of like reliving that experience. And it's a great

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,840
way to sort of get a Linux history lesson. That's why it really bugs me when we get the news wrong,

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,800
because that's a big part of that. Oh, I would think so. Yeah, well, so a mistake slipped into

19
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,480
this week's episode of the Linux Action Show, and it's been it's been bugging me since Sunday.

20
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,960
I know it's Tuesday afternoon here. And I want to talk about that in a little bit, what happened.

21
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,280
And and also I want to give a little bit of history on how important news accuracy is to

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,920
me on the Linux Action Show and about some of the actual fundamental changes we had made behind the

23
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,440
scenes of the show over the years to try to improve that because it's so important. And,

24
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,320
you know, this mistake happens still. And I want to try to kind of address why and kind of come

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,520
clean a little bit, because that's absolutely just as much my responsibility. It's not really

26
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,000
Veronica's fault. But we're not going to talk about that just yet. Not just yet. No, we have

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,120
some feedback to get to. And we also have a guest who's going to join us in a little bit. His name's

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,000
Martin and he works with the Mate project. He does also the Arch packaging of the Mate desktop

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,160
and is a project advocate. And we're going to chat with him a little bit because we also featured the

30
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,520
new Mate desktop live CD that's based on Arch on the Linux Action Show on Sunday. And he's the

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,500
creator of that live CD. So he'll be coming on the show in a little bit. But first, I want to

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,840
do some follow up. I wanted to do some corrections before we get to all of that, because there was a

33
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,280
point that I failed to mention on the Linux Action Show this last Sunday when I was talking about

34
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,960
the Qbox I4 Pro. And I mentioned that it has a gigabit ethernet adapter on it, which is

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,800
technically true. It does have a gigabit ethernet adapter. But in terms of actual bandwidth, and

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:21,200
thanks to omak777 in the subreddit for cluing me in on this, you can't actually achieve a full

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:29,080
gigabit. You're limited to 470 megabit actual transfer rate due to just bus limitations in that

38
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,920
system, right? And it's pretty much true for all ARM real gigabit. You know, you got to have a

39
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,120
super fast PCI Express bus, I guess. I mean, it seems to be a limitation in the speed of the ARM

40
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,560
system. And it seems to be affecting all ARM chips, which makes sense. I mean, gigabit is pretty

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,200
fast. And I didn't actually ever stress test it because I was using it as a desktop. But I thought,

42
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,000
you know, it has that ESATA multiplexer port. I thought to make a great file server. Yeah, 470

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,160
megabits isn't too bad, though. So if I'm understanding you correctly, you're basically

44
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,480
saying that the actual, you know, the ethernet port itself technically could in different

45
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,480
circumstances, different bus and whatnot actually support the gigabit. But because of bus

46
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,600
restrictions, that's no longer that's not actually possible. Yeah, it's one of those things where it

47
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:18,960
says gigabit on the box, not quite gigabit, you know, gotcha, gotcha. These some of these these

48
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,240
ARM systems do have some limitations. But I think it's important to know if you're considering using

49
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,680
it as a home file server, which you make pretty good and make a pretty good home file server. It's

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,560
only used like a watt when it's idle. That's I love that aspect of it. Oh, yeah. The port really

51
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,600
made it makes for a good cheap portable computer for someone that might want one and might not

52
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,040
otherwise be able to afford one. Yeah, we're you know, it's funny, too, because just my last thoughts

53
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,880
on it was when I was looking at this thing, it's one hundred and twenty five dollars. And I also

54
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,720
have the OUYA. Do you remember the OUYA? It was like this Android based console and it was kick

55
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,640
started and it got a ton of money and it shipped last year, mid year. It's bigger than this QBox is.

56
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,840
I think it's what is it, ninety nine dollars? So it's technically it's twenty five dollars cheaper.

57
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,920
It's so much slower and it's so much more limited. And it shows I mean, I really think you look at

58
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,880
that and you see how the OUYA is kind of doomed because it's already the OUYA looks old in

59
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,400
comparison to this QBox. And that's just, you know. So I guess in reality, I mean, with both of

60
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,360
these side by side, despite the fact that the OUYA is a reasonably new device, it's already dated

61
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,320
just based on things like I think these armchairs. Remember back in the day when it seemed like as

62
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,320
soon as you got a new Intel processor on the market, the next one was already out and they

63
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,840
just got from like, you know, 80 megahertz to 90 megahertz and then boom, all of a sudden we're

64
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,720
120 megahertz and 133 megahertz and boom, we're at 160. Now we're 220, you know, just 400 and

65
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,680
420 and 440. And it just seems like ARM is doing that right now, where it's just rapidly increasing

66
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,400
just at a crazy pace. Well, it almost creates a perpetual buyer's remorse to where you really

67
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,480
can't win. I mean, you try and buy these things and it's like, OK, I'm all set. Oh, wait a minute.

68
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,280
Now it's faster. Darn it. You know, and I went ahead and invested that money. So it does kind

69
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,080
of create a perpetual buyer's remorse, I think, over time. But I think maybe it'll start kind of

70
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,440
coming in its own and settle down a little bit. But it does seem like they're just going at such

71
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,480
a rapid pace. It's impossible to win. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's why, you know, you know what? You

72
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,880
know what? The speaking of mobile devices and rapid pace, this is why I have Ting's. This is

73
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,360
a great, this is probably a great time to mention Ting. Ting is a sponsor of this week's podcast.

74
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,760
And Ting is mobile that makes sense. They're my mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service

75
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,920
provider. And Ting has no contracts and no early termination fees. But they just turned two. Ting's

76
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,320
birthday was earlier this week. It was Monday and yesterday. And to celebrate, they're giving you a

77
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,560
gift. This applies to all existing Ting customers and all new Ting customers. And you can find more

78
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,320
details over at Ting.com slash blog. First go to Linux.Ting.com to get started. That way we get

79
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,600
credit for your visit. But when you go over to the Ting blog, you'll find out they just slashed

80
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,120
their data pricing in a massive way. They've done a huge reduction on prices. This is a great time

81
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,760
to go back over to Linux.Ting.com and try out their savings calculator. Because the data plans

82
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:11,480
just got a lot better. This is a perfect example of why it's so rewarding, even a year into it now,

83
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,600
to be a Ting customer for me. So I know a little bit, I won't share too much, but I actually know

84
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,600
a little bit of the behind the scenes details on how this worked out. Ting has had a very successful

85
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,000
two years. And as such, they were able to renegotiate with Sprint. Ting is an MVNO of the

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,840
Sprint network. So if you've got good Sprint coverage, you're going to get great Ting service.

87
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,200
And so they renegotiated with Sprint and said, okay, well we're making you a lot more money now,

88
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,200
so what can we do? And they got this drop on the data rates. And Ting looked at that and they said,

89
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:46,760
we could just not say a word and take all of this as profits and we would be making even more money

90
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,240
than we're making now. Or we could continue to make the revenue and profits that we're making

91
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,880
right now and just immediately pass that savings on to our customers. And that's what they've done.

92
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,680
They just moved that savings that they got when they renegotiated the contract and they're giving

93
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,080
to their customers. And what's so awesome about it, because Ting has no contracts,

94
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,520
you immediately get those new rates. You don't have to call up and sign up for another two year

95
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,200
plan. You don't have to get a new different type of plan and lose your unlimited whatever. No,

96
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,040
you just get it because it's just the next billing cycle. That's at the next rate now.

97
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,120
If you go sign up for Ting right now, that's what you get. Ting is paid for what you use.

98
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,760
It's $6 for a flat rate. That's it. $6 a month and you just pay on top of that. Every single

99
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,120
plan includes hotspot, tethering, voicemail, caller ID, video messaging. It's awesome.

100
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,520
And it really does make sense. When you start to think about it, it's definitely a different way

101
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,800
to do it than the rest of the cell companies, but it is the way that makes the most sense.

102
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,400
It really is mobile that makes sense. And on top of that, Ting has an incredible customer service.

103
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:53,160
You call them any time of day over at 1-855-846-4389. That's Ting FTW. 1-855-TINGFTW and a real

104
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,440
person will answer the phone and handle your problem right there. You're not going to get

105
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,200
transferred. You're not going to get moved around. You're not going to have to go to the next tier.

106
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,280
Everybody who answers the phone is the top tier. And then they get your problem resolved. They'll

107
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,800
call you back if they need to. They're really great. And I think you'll be impressed. And on

108
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,000
top of that, if you're a do-it-yourselfer, the Ting dashboard is incredible. Go over to

109
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,200
linux.ting.com and scroll down on that page and check out that dashboard. That is not a

110
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,680
fake picture. That's really what it looks like and it is completely functional. I've

111
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,760
been able to do everything I've needed to do over the entire year through that dashboard.

112
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,680
Go check it out. Now is a better time than ever to rerun through their calculator,

113
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,120
linux.ting.com to support this show and save yourself some money. I pay 30 bucks a month for

114
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,200
my Ting line. I'm using it in ways like a mofo. I use it all the time and it's like 30 bucks. And

115
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,000
I got hotspot. I got tethering. It's great. So go to linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,200
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged and their support of the Jupiter Broadcasting Network. Boy, I'll

117
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,200
tell you, between the panel and those new rates, it's just full of win. Really, it is so awesome.

118
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,040
And it really underscores how cool they are as a company. They're like, you know, we're just going

119
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,240
to pass that right along. And they still got the ETF relief program and all of that. It's really

120
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,040
cool. Good. Mad respect to them. I think that's so awesome. So I want to pull in a guest who's

121
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,520
joined us in our mumble room this week. His name is Martin. Of course, he's going by Wimpy in our,

122
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,600
I don't know what that means, but he's going by Wimpy in our mumble room and he works with

123
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:22,600
the Mate Project. And Wimpy, sorry, Martin, welcome to the show. Thank you. So can I, let's

124
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,280
start with where we were just, what we were just talking about on last on Sunday, and then we'll

125
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,920
just kind of go from there. So you've been working on this Mate Live CD and the reason that this

126
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,000
isn't the first Mate Live CD I've ever seen, but what caught my attention is I think it's the first

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:46,920
one based on Arch. So Wimpy, why Arch? Well, I'm an Arch trusted user. So I do the Mate, I'm going

128
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,280
to get in so much trouble. I do the packaging on Arch Linux for Mate desktop. So when the idea was

129
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,320
circulated among the team about making a live CD, it was natural for me to base it on Arch.

130
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,040
And how was that experience? Did you find there were shortcomings? Cause you know,

131
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,680
I think of things like Fedora spins and the openSUSE build service and even Ubuntu,

132
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,600
they all sort of have facilities built into them to make it easier to generate a live CD work. Arch,

133
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,360
what are you doing all that from scratch? How does that work? Well, surprisingly Arch also

134
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:26,880
has a facility built in. You can Pacman install Arch ISO, which is a suite of scripts. And from

135
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,920
there, there's a base template that if you just then run the build command once you've copied the

136
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,280
the configuration will make you the Arch live CD that you can download off the Arch Linux website

137
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,400
every month and use as the install media. So you can start with that. And from there you can

138
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,720
customize the packages that are built in and a whole raft of other things. I'd never done it

139
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,680
before and it was really straightforward. Oh, very cool. That's good to know. I'll have to

140
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,760
look into that. So you are a Mate, I'm going to have a hard time. I'm going to try it though.

141
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,280
You're a Mate advocate. Why, why the Mate desktop environment? I mean, it seems to me that it,

142
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,960
it's sort of, it's sort of seen an increase in popularity. I know we're seeing a lot more

143
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,960
distributions included. Is, is it sort of, is it getting a lot of momentum behind it and why did

144
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,240
you choose to become an advocate? Right? Well, yes, it is, it is gaining in popularity. I think

145
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,160
we've, there's been a lot of effort in the team to push all the packages into some of the larger

146
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,520
distributions, such as Arch Linux and more recently Debian, and that's now circulating

147
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,560
down to Ubuntu. And we're certainly seeing it trending up on the Debian package install

148
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,840
statistics. And the reason I got involved with it is I had been using Name Three for about 18

149
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,320
months or so, and I was reasonably happy with it. And I'd installed it on my wife's laptop some

150
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,040
years ago. She'd since got a smartphone and was pretty much using that for everything and time

151
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,440
goes by. And then one evening she decides she wants to organize some photos and she sits down

152
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,000
in front of this Name Three thing that she really didn't pay attention to when I was showing her how

153
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,200
to use it a year or so earlier and was hugely frustrated with it and almost hurled it at me.

154
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:19,600
So it was marriage, marriage protection. The spousal approval factor was low is what you're

155
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:27,560
saying. Okay. Yeah. So I very quickly yanked Name Three off that machine. I put the Mate desktop on

156
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,920
and that restored an environment that she was familiar with because she's been using Ubuntu

157
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,600
for many years previous and was familiar with the Name Two setup there. So that's where I got

158
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:46,000
started. And when I had installed Mate, I noticed that it was working okay, but there was some bits

159
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,440
missing and there were some bits that were broken. So I just decided to get stuck in and I started

160
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,640
submitting pull requests to the project to fix up some of the packaging. I wonder, it seems like

161
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:04,680
potentially as the XP era comes to a close, if maybe more conventional, these types of standard

162
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,840
paradigm desktops will see a big boost just because of people looking for something other

163
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,360
to move to. Have you seen some of that? When you're doing outreach, who are you outreaching to?

164
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,760
Well, that's a new thing for me. It's something I've decided to start doing for the project this

165
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:27,800
year. So this is the first time I've sort of done a proper promotion to talk about the project and

166
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:35,520
try and make people more aware of its existence. But certainly within my family and circle of

167
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:43,680
friends who I've helped move to Linux, they have been more comfortable with Mate because most of

168
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:51,960
them are moving from Windows XP machines. And a couple of clicks change the menu layout, move the

169
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,040
bar to the bottom of the screen and it's much like Windows XP with the start button and a familiar

170
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,080
looking programs menu. So it's been very familiar to them. And once they've got Thunderbird and

171
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:08,520
Firefox installed, they're away. I want to do, if you'd let me shift gears a little bit to Arch,

172
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:15,160
you mentioned you're an Arch trusted user and I realized that there's a lot of people who probably

173
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,440
have heard that term but have no idea what it means. So what is an Arch trusted user and how

174
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,520
did you become one? I became one through the work I'd done with the Mate desktop. So I'd done all

175
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,680
this packaging and I was maintaining an unofficial repository for the Mate desktop project. And then

176
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:40,240
I took over all of the Mate packages in the AUR because they were very old, had been put there by

177
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,360
the original Mate project creator some years previous and brought them all up to scratch.

178
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,560
And I was actually contacted by another Arch Linux trusted user who agreed to sponsor my

179
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,160
application to join the team because I wanted to get Mate into the Arch Linux official repositories.

180
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,320
So yeah, there's a process that you have to go through there. There's a peer review assessment

181
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,560
and voting to actually vote you in onto the team and you sort of have to prove your worth and how

182
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,520
you're going to improve the team. The main responsibilities of Arch Linux trusted users,

183
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,880
they are the moderators if you like of the AUR. So there's the mailing list where people can say,

184
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,880
can you merge these packages? Can you delete these old ones? Can you rename these? If anyone

185
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,680
needs any help with package creation or wants their packages checking over, that's something

186
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,120
that the trusted users do. The trusted users can then pull packages that they're interested in or

187
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,000
that they see in the AUR that have got good adoption. So plenty of votes and something

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,520
that can be redistributed. We'll then choose to adopt that package and pull it into the community

189
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:55,720
repository and then maintain it as part as an official package. And then some of the TUs have

190
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,760
other responsibilities within the team. So there'll be forum moderators, people that are working on

191
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,240
backend infrastructure and things like that. Well, Arch and Matei seem like actually a pretty

192
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,200
good combination because you could have a pretty tight lightweight system on there. So that's why

193
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,480
I was drawn to that live CD and obviously I just had a pretty strong interest in Arch these days.

194
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,920
But is there anything else, Martin, you want to touch on with the Matei desktop or Arch before

195
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,480
we jump to our next topic? If you don't mind, I mean, one of the things I worked on was I did

196
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,120
the initial porting to get Matei working on ARMv6 hard float and ARMv7 hard float.

197
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,920
Well, you know, I was just using that this last week. That's awesome. Tell me about that.

198
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:42,880
Well, curiously, that Qbox that you've got, I've got the previous generation, the Qbox Pro. So in

199
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,040
air quotes, I created a cluster at home of two Raspberry Pis and two Qbox Pros to actually do

200
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:57,120
the package building for the ARM ports. And the reason I did that is I had this aspiration to get

201
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,360
it into the official repositories. And I knew if it hit the official repositories, it would

202
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,120
automatically percolate into the build surface for the Arch Linux ARM project. And I wanted them

203
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,200
just to flow straight in without any problem. So I was building the packages in the unofficial

204
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:22,960
repositories for four architectures for x86-64 and the two arms. So yeah, I've got some of those

205
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,120
Qbox or the older generation of the Qboxes, but it's hilarious. It takes about 50 minutes to build

206
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,160
the whole Matei package tree for Matei 1.6 on a relatively modern PC. And it takes about 28 hours

207
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,040
to build it on two ARM boxes. Wow.

208
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:43,680
Well, I can't tell you how happy I was when I was sitting, I had LXDE was what I started with,

209
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,760
and I thought, okay, LXDE is fine, but I really would like to have, like, I was trying to think

210
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,400
if I was going to actually use this as a workstation to do like server work and stuff

211
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,080
like that, I would probably want more than LXDE, that's just me. And it went off, I was sitting

212
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,640
there and I couldn't really decide what to go with. And it was like a light bulb. I just knew

213
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,160
all of a sudden, you know what, I got to go with Mate or Matei because it's going to be lightweight

214
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,720
and I didn't know if it was going to be available for ARM. So I just, I went to the command line,

215
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,120
did a pacman-s and I said, mate, and I think that's all I did. And before I hit enter,

216
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,880
I went and did a Google search or to the over the arch Wiki and made sure I did like the right

217
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,080
package and hit enter and boom, everything was there. And I got a full desktop and I really made

218
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,040
that Qbox go from, you know, this is something that's really limited to, okay, now I could have

219
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:37,120
a full desktop experience. And I think it's perfect for that kind of device. It really is.

220
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,320
And something that I'm working on, the next little project I'm working on is an image for

221
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,600
the Raspberry Pi, which will be Arch Linux with the Mate desktop installed, but with a series of

222
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,320
tweaks so that it really flies. In fact, I think you had one of those laptop devices in a previous

223
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,040
show. I've got one of those sat in front of me here with two, I've got two of those and two

224
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:08,480
Raspberry Pis and I've started working on this. So soon enough there'll be a Mate image you can

225
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,200
download with it all set up, ready to go with Arch Linux. Wow. Well, so Q5 Sis, who owns that

226
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,720
laptop I was using, wants me to ask you if you know anything about Mate and their plans with

227
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,360
Wayland. Have you heard anything about that? Yeah, I have. So, Mate 1.8 currently on the

228
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:37,920
roadmap is to support Wayland and the precursor to that is to provide GTK 3 support. The work on GTK

229
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:45,600
3 support is largely complete, but there are some Mate 1.7 development table releases. I've got an

230
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,080
unofficial repository for Arch Linux users where you can go and install it and try it out. Although

231
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:58,080
my build is currently still GTK 2, but I've got a GTK 3 version that I run locally. So that GTK 3

232
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,840
work is there as the precursor and then the Wayland support will follow. Interesting. So I

233
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,960
got to ask the obligatory, any discussions around Mir? Is there anything changed there?

234
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,760
As far as I know, it's not planned to be supported. Well, I'm glad to hear that you guys,

235
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,360
I think the compatibility or is that the right term? You're not switching to GTK 3,

236
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,000
but you're supporting GTK 3. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. So we're retaining the GTK 2 support

237
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and adding GTK 3 support. So at build time, you can choose which toolkit you want to build against.

238
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,840
That's cool. And this is so, for example, the Raspberry Pi at the moment, there's not a decent

239
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,280
accelerated driver that's available. I think that's going to come in due course. So it would

240
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,840
make sense to continue to build the packages for the Raspberry Pi against GTK 2 and keep it that

241
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,640
little bit lighter. But then for the desktops, then maybe GTK 3 would make more sense. And what

242
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,920
I'm wrestling with at the moment is do I really want to support both toolkits? And I think the

243
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,600
answer is I'm going to have to, but that's going to effectively double the number of packages.

244
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:12,080
Yeah, yeah. But that seems like to me, that seems, I know what that is. That means more overhead,

245
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,720
but gosh, that's a great combination. If you can have GTK 2 and GTK 3 playing together,

246
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:27,120
everybody's happy, it seems like. And although the GTK 3 toolkit support is not in MATE 1.6,

247
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
GTK 3 applications will integrate seamlessly with MATE even though the desktop is GTK 2. So all of

248
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:41,200
the theming and everything is transparent. So for example, if you run network managers in the live

249
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,480
CD, for example, you won't notice that that's any different from any of the GTK 2 applications.

250
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,240
That's really great. That's really great. Gosh, sounds like people have a misconception about the

251
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
MATE project being old fashioned and out of date, but it sounds like you guys are right there on

252
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,320
the cutting edge and some exciting stuff coming. In some respects, I mean, yes, that is one of

253
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,440
the myths that I'd like to bust about MATE. It is seen as that everything got forked and

254
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,720
it was a great big dirty hack that sat on top of the forked project. But in recent years,

255
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,800
our lead developer, Stefano, he's really put a lot of effort into turning it into a proper project.

256
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,480
So there is a roadmap. I mean, a lot of the obsolete libraries from the GNOME 2 days have been

257
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,000
either replaced with the modern alternatives or just thrown out altogether. So that's one of the

258
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,640
reasons why MATE is lighter than GNOME 2 used to be. But Gconf has been replaced with Dconf and

259
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,840
Gsettings. And there's a whole raft of other changes like that. And then that will continue to

260
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,520
be the case going into the future. So we're trying to align more with the GNOME libraries

261
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,800
that provide the functionality that we need whilst preserving the MATE desktop and its

262
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,040
traditional desktop metaphors. Well, Wimpy, aka Martin, thank you very much for joining us today.

263
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,120
And I'd love to have you stick around for the rest of the show and jump in and comment with

264
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,400
the rest of us as we go forward. And please feel free to stop by any time. I love getting

265
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,320
perspective from people who work with the projects and also people who work with Arch Linux. I'm a

266
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,800
huge Arch fan. So thanks very much for joining us. You're welcome. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely.

267
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,040
Good stuff. Yeah. Hope we'll see you some more. All right, Matt. Well, before we go to the topic

268
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,840
of the little snafu that got me all in all grage this week. Oh, man, I got to tell you,

269
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,280
I'm actually glad we're doing this on a Tuesday because I was really flared up about this Monday

270
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,720
and I probably said some things I shouldn't have in Coda Radio this week. But I've had some time

271
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,960
to think about it and, you know, accept some of the responsibility. So I'm going to talk about

272
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,520
that. But first, I want to thank our second sponsor this week. And that is DigitalOcean.

273
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,760
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting, and they're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy

274
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,160
way to spin up a cloud server. Now, Matt, you know, I've been on here bragging about my 47 seconds,

275
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,960
right? Oh, yes, you have. Yeah. Well, so, of course, of course, you know, you leave it up to

276
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,600
our audience. Mark writes into the show. He says, I beat the champ. I spun up a DigitalOcean cloud

277
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:11,040
server in 40 seconds. Oh, 40 seconds. Yeah. And he actually this is you knew I wouldn't believe it

278
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,320
because I had 47 seconds as the and DigitalOcean says you can do it. Users can do it in 55 seconds.

279
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,360
Right. And I always got it down to 47. I was feeling pretty good. Mark clocks in here at 40

280
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,520
seconds. And he even included a tiny can't really see it. Sorry. Actually, I was trying to get a

281
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,640
shot of it for you guys. But he included a tiny screenshot. He got it in 40 seconds, his DigitalOcean

282
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,480
droplets. So let me tell you a little bit about DigitalOcean. You can create a cloud server in

283
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,680
55 seconds. If you're like myself, 47 is my record. See if you can beat Mark at 40 seconds. I don't

284
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,160
think it can be done. See if you can beat him. Mark can create cloud server in 40 seconds. Pricing

285
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,680
plans start at $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte

286
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,640
of transfer. Now, this SSD actually makes a difference. I've had a DigitalOcean droplet

287
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,720
running Arch Linux. Yes, I've got a server in Arch Linux. And yes, it's been fine. It's actually

288
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,480
been great because I've been keeping real close to the updates to BitTorrent Sync because this

289
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,120
is a BitTorrent Sync server. Now, Mark said what he's doing, he said, hey, I know you enjoy hearing

290
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,680
about what people do with their DigitalOcean VPS is this particular one is used to host

291
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,000
a Starbound server, which Starbound is just exploding on Steam right now. It's like the number

292
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,480
one Linux game on Steam and it's cray-cray. I should talk about it at some point, but I know

293
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,400
how much you guys hate it when I talk about games, but it's really good if you want to check it out.

294
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,240
So he's running a Starbound server on there. I've heard from people who are running YASI search

295
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,120
engines up there. BitTorrent Sync is great. Michael Dominic from Coda Radio uses it to

296
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,880
work with his clients. He'll either use it for temporary backend hosting or he'll actually set

297
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,120
them up a server over there because what's great about DigitalOcean is it's fixed pricing. So you

298
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,200
know exactly what you're going to spend and clients love that. It also makes it really easy

299
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,600
for budgeting of projects and things like that or just I know every month I can pay in five dollars.

300
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,560
You know, we have people in the audience now that have web mail up there and they just know it's

301
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,120
five dollars for my mail service. That's perfectly reasonable to have full access. And of course,

302
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,880
DigitalOcean has a super great control panel that lets you image it and set up backups and deploy.

303
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,640
You can configure a machine and save that and deploy it later. They also have data center

304
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,560
locations in New York, San Francisco, and Amsterdam. So go check them out. Go see that

305
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,600
intuitive control panel and you can also replicate it with the API if you want for your own tools.

306
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,080
And DigitalOcean also has a vast collection of tutorials in their community section on their site

307
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,320
and users can submit articles to the community and they get paid 50 dollars per published piece.

308
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,840
But here's the deal. Here's where we're going to get you a little something something because

309
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,680
you're a Linux Unplugged listener and we love you. We're doing this for you. So go take advantage

310
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,720
of this because why wouldn't you? It's cray cray. If you use the promo code Linux Unplugged February,

311
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,920
let them know that you appreciate they're still here. They've been here for a few months. Go use

312
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,160
this promo code Linux Unplugged February to say thank you for continuing to come back for another

313
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,760
month of Linux Unplugged. We appreciate you supporting Jupiter Broadcasting and Linux Unplugged

314
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,840
Show and plus that's going to get you a ten dollar credit. That'll let you try out that five dollar

315
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,320
machine for two months for free. You're going to get root access. You can run Ubuntu, Fedora,

316
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,200
CentOS, Arch Linux, Debian, whatever you want son. Go do it and see what I've been talking about.

317
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,160
This is a great thing to learn and experiment on or use in production and it's super fast with

318
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,800
those SSDs and their tier one bandwidth. So thank you to DigitalOcean for supporting Linux Unplugged

319
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,120
and Jupiter Broadcasting and thank you to everyone in our audience who uses that promo code Linux

320
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,560
Unplugged February to get a ten dollar credit. You can also click the link in our show notes

321
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,680
and a big thank you to DigitalOcean. Boy 40 seconds that's just wild isn't it?

322
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,480
I mean like I wonder if he had to like create a few of them because you can make them real quick

323
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,000
right? So right I wonder if he like ran through it a few times and then timed it and then just

324
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,640
sent me his best one. Do you think he had a Rocky montage happening while he was doing this?

325
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,680
Totally motivated and I like that. That's what I'll try. Maybe that's how I'll beat him.

326
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:55,440
Okay so on on Sunday I was filling out the news and we had this KDE story about designers coming

327
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,040
over to the KDE project to help spiffify up the next version of the plasma desktop and I thought

328
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,240
okay this is good but this isn't this it's really early days on this story so it's not

329
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,240
it's not a full story in itself I need a little something else to go with this story to kind of

330
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,840
let's spend a minute this qualifies it to be in the news segment right that kind of thing so when

331
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,880
I found this article and I was not thinking clearly and I fully admit that I was sort of

332
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,880
just looking for something to round out the overall story and so I kind of cheated and just

333
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,240
when I saw the headline I grabbed it and it's it was an article ran on Ferronix KDE Plasma next

334
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,200
gets a release date and in here it talks about the plan to do a feature freeze in March which

335
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,040
we talked about in the show beta in April and then the final version comes out in June will

336
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:48,480
be called 2014.6 should it actually ship now nowhere nowhere in here does it say this was

337
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,760
a proposal and I didn't report it as such because I didn't realize that and that was my bad because

338
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,480
I made it sound like that's an actual planned commitment on the KDE projects point and I have

339
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,000
a lot of respect for the KWIN developer Martin I'm not even gonna try to get Martin's last name

340
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,600
because I know I gotta get I just gotta convince him to come on the show so he can pronounce it

341
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,200
for me but you know there's some developers I follow in the open source community and Martin's

342
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,280
one of the ones that I hold the highest regard as far as his talents and his insights and so

343
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,920
I felt pretty bad when he went to G plus and he said reasons why sometimes hate the openness of

344
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,480
free software we are not able to discuss anything without the media reporting about it on the same

345
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,680
day sigh dear free software media you can leave the internal discussions as internal till there

346
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,880
is a public statement thank you and so what he's saying there is so that pharaonic's post was a

347
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,800
post from the mailing list on on you know whatever mailing list it was on uh and that was where the

348
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,480
discussion was having on the plasma devel mailing list that's where the discussion was having

349
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,000
taking place and it was being discussed as a hypothetical proposal it got ran as the as

350
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,280
kde's plasma next gets a release date and then I grabbed it to round out a story and so you can

351
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,800
see how we just sort of perpetuated this mistake that sort of all of a sudden commits the kde

352
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,640
project to a timeline that they never actually agreed to and we're just discussing in their

353
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,400
mailing list you know I can see yeah and I'm looking at this as a writer definitely I'm fine

354
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,640
with the title but I think it needed to be in big bold print within the article that this was a

355
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,000
proposal that's where I see the big that's why I think I think I would have the biggest issue with

356
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,280
it is that this needs to be very clear I get the attention grabbing title that's fine whatever but

357
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,000
be clear in the article and I didn't get that just when I was reading that um it definitely felt like

358
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,480
that that should have been made much more clear and you know I mixed feelings on the list though

359
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,280
honestly if it's on a public list you know as long as it's made clear and that part wasn't done in

360
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,840
this case but as long as it's made clear I don't see that as a big problem as long as it's really

361
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,880
really really really clear yeah I think it's I think it comes down to um my mistake was in not

362
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,920
going to the mailing list itself and reading it and the reason why is because I get so sick and

363
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,240
tired of reading mailing lists because from an outside perspective uh you know I'll give you an

364
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,600
example so we had another story this Sunday on the Linux action show about OpenSUSE uh getting some

365
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,520
changes at OpenSUSE where uh folks from SUSE proper would not be working on OpenSUSE for the release

366
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,560
they'd be working on the ancillary services around OpenSUSE I first found out about that by following

367
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:23,680
the mailing list but I was so confused on what I saw that I wasn't going to run the story because

368
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,760
it it seemed to be saying that people from SUSE wouldn't be working on OpenSUSE anymore and to me

369
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,720
that was like no way am I reading this right because first of all English isn't the primary

370
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,520
language in some of these mailing lists uh there's assumed cultural references and you know assumed

371
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,360
knowledge that people have to other people on the mailing list that is really hard to follow

372
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,840
sometimes these conversations are 30 emails deep sometimes they're not and so it's these it's one

373
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,200
of these things where I a lot of times I've sat on a story from a mailing list but one of my one

374
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,120
of my sort of self checks is if I see another publication like LWN or Ferronix run the story

375
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,520
then it kind of confirms what I found and I usually will then go with it and in this case

376
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:11,520
with the OpenSUSE thing not only did LWN confirm it but I even before LWN had a story up oh no it

377
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,760
was after LWN had a story up I reached out to an old friend of the show who now works at SUSE

378
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,640
proper I don't know if he's made that public yet and I had a 45 minute conversation with him to

379
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,240
try to really try to figure out am I really reading what I'm seeing now that resulted in

380
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,880
five minutes of coverage in the Linux action show but I probably spent two hours on that story to

381
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,240
verify it just because it seems so massive now I can't do that for every story and in this case

382
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,920
I was being lazy and I could have gone into the KD emailing list and saw that they were

383
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,680
saying proposal but I just went with the Ferronix headline that was my mistake but it seems like

384
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:50,640
I think potentially what bothers me about this Ferronix mistake here is I actually think he

385
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,560
probably wasn't even aware it was a proposal either got sent to him and he ran with it like

386
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,360
somebody posted in the forum and then he republished it or he grabbed it and he was working quick and

387
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,440
he didn't read it all the way and he made the mistake and that perpetuated the mistake now I

388
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,800
also perpetuated it so it's my fault too well I think also that another differentiator is essentially

389
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:16,160
at its essence it's essentially a blog versus a major publication like you know a mag and like

390
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,920
an online magazine or something like that so like the CNETs of the world while I gripe you know I

391
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,960
gripe at various publications online usually there's multi-tiered editing that happens and

392
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,760
fact-checking that happens in a written format and so when we read something on these sites

393
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,080
we trust that that information is in fact actual and Ferronix has been we you know would assume

394
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,040
had that same level of clarity but in this case we were kind of let down it feels like

395
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,280
I feel like okay so again I want to give you guys so this really bothers me when we make these

396
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,960
mistakes in the show because I so I don't remember what it was exactly but this whole problem of

397
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,280
somebody reading something on a mailing list and then it getting reported as news isn't unique to

398
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,400
the KDE project like I remember this happened to Arch I was reminded recently that the announcement

399
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,720
when they were just discussing Arch switching to systemd people grabbed that and ran with it as

400
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,360
Arch is officially switching before it was actually officially switching so it happens

401
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,960
all the time and so originally I was trying to think well how can we improve that process

402
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,200
and I think you know when the first so the last time the show had a kind of a I can't even remember

403
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,520
what the gaff was but there was a we covered something wrong in the show and that was the

404
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,200
inspiration for the creation of the Linux action show subreddit the idea was is I don't want I

405
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,320
don't want if we're gonna have the podcast of record for Linux I don't want to have I want

406
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,760
to minimize mistakes as much as possible because every time there's a mistake it really it really

407
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,800
eats at me and so at least in the news and so I thought okay I could drop the news because I'd

408
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,200
rather not do the news well and I don't think you need to drop it I and not to cut you off here but

409
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,920
I want to point out that if I had a dollar for every time I misquoted or got something wrong

410
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,560
that's what corrections are and that's what this show is it allows for a correction and that's

411
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,520
that's allowed so I thought okay dropping the news that's going too far but I just want to

412
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,960
show you I want I'm trying to illustrate my commitment to trying to get this right is I

413
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,200
would rather not do it at all than make the mistake so okay that was the inspiration for

414
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,680
the subreddit was here's what we'll do we'll assemble an army of informed Linux enthusiasts

415
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,080
and the crowd knowledge will sift through all of the news and I won't let a story and in fact I

416
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,240
even think I said this on air I won't let a story into the show until it's been vetted by the

417
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:28,960
community however that was a good theory but the problem is is I think first of all Linux news is

418
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,840
sort of going through a slow period right now so it requires a lot more digging so hence the going

419
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:40,000
to the mailing list right and so you can't you can't expect the burden of a loose group of

420
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,400
community enthusiasts to actually do all that digging and try to do original reporting and

421
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,760
submit it to a Linux action show subreddit so I take that burden on because it Linux action show

422
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,520
happens every single Sunday and the one thing I can count on is that I will get something in

423
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,520
place for it so I take that on and I do the digging so sometimes I fall short a little bit

424
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,000
and what happens is is if I do digging outside the subreddit which I always am doing because

425
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,680
I'm always trying to one up the subreddit too and try to find something they didn't find

426
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,760
it means it never makes it never gets vetted through the show because it doesn't go through

427
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,600
that process and so I'm either left with not covering stories that don't go through the

428
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,640
subreddit which doesn't seem very likely or trying to come up with another way to sort of improve the

429
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,840
quality of news and and I'm kind of I'm kind of wondering I kind of want to open this discussion

430
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,640
up to the mumble room and of course to you too and and see what people think of our ideas on ways

431
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,880
we could improve the news and one idea I had I'll tell you my idea up front was maybe we we drop the

432
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,000
amount of news we cover and focus on a couple of stories and maybe one of the one or two or three

433
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,920
of the stories maybe it's four stories I don't know what that mix is but one of them we try to

434
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,520
get an interview on with the person who's making the story now the problem with this is is this

435
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,040
would actually just require like somebody from the community become a producer for that and they

436
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,280
track down the story then track down the person and line up the timings that way we can chat with

437
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,400
them because I just that's not something I have time to do I it is it's more work than it sounds

438
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,480
it sounds like it's not a lot of work it's it's probably four four to six hours of work oh it's

439
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,320
tough I mean you're calling Google you're calling LinkedIn you're calling pretty much any place you

440
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,360
can think of to hopefully find an email address and then there's a few tricks that most people

441
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,360
don't know and then there's then there's the 30 email back and forth lining up and answering all

442
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,960
of the questions I mean it is this massive process that it takes a ton of time so but I feel like if

443
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,280
if the show's going on eight years and I feel like we could take it up a notch by sort of

444
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,640
having the newsmakers come on and make the news right there and say I I think if if we established

445
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,320
you know the linux action show news segment you're going to hear from some of the newsmakers every

446
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,800
episode I think that would be a huge uh upgrade for this news segment and I think also it would

447
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,160
sort of establish like people eventually would figure out hey we're about to have an announcement

448
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,240
let's schedule something with last uh so I don't know what do you guys think yeah go ahead I think

449
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,800
what you said is what I've managed to gather is most of your common mistakes seem to be coming

450
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,680
from generally one news source and that's for onyx oh yeah I mean there is that I mean that's like

451
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,280
you know I mean like but at the same time everybody was claiming he was wrong about steam

452
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,760
and then it turns out he was right about steam wait isn't this what um unplugged is for though

453
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,120
so like you can get feedback from them like news segments so like you can correct yourself

454
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:26,400
on unplugged if you need to yeah we do perfect yeah but there's a mistake later and it's fine

455
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,360
in my eyes you can't really expect everyone to listen to two podcasts though no baby but you

456
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,840
can't expect someone to go back to an old article either that I published or someone else publishes

457
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,680
and say oh wow I was completely wrong they've already read it they've moved on you know so

458
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,080
all you can do is put your retraction out there and let the chips fall maybe what you have to do

459
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,800
is have your new studio troll do the research for you well see here's the other thing too is

460
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,400
I think what I'm trying to address this is a problem and this is actually when I scratched

461
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,040
down my thoughts on this what I actually titled this as is fixing linux news because what what

462
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,240
we've talked about on this show uh it was episode 11 of linux unplugged we titled it bankrupt linux

463
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,840
news because it is there is just not a lot of good linux there's some there is some and I

464
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,720
want to give them credit but there's not enough and I thought maybe we can improve the quality

465
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,400
of news coverage in last and at the same time improve the overall state of linux news coverage

466
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,800
like like actually become a new source and in that sense that's why because we have this access to

467
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,480
communities we have these we have these personalities and these developers that we

468
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,920
can reach out to I think we have an opportunity to have instead of getting misquoted blogs

469
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,520
and and and reddit posts from see the problem is this is not a problem that's going to go away

470
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,880
because you got reddit you got twitter you got google plus people are going to be grabbing stuff

471
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,200
and misreporting stuff constantly ferronics made the mistake today but all it takes is some

472
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,320
reddit enthusiasts to post it and it could become it could quickly become the top vote on r slash

473
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,280
linux and be completely inaccurate right so there's it's not just ferronics it's a larger

474
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,040
problem that I think I'm trying to solve here I'd say just it would require some more research

475
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,240
before it even makes it into the show and ultimately if you do want to bring somebody

476
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,200
in for an interview make that for the main section of the show not necessarily the news section

477
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,880
I think I'm thinking the interview would be like two minutes long so you bring somebody on you say

478
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,320
okay so uh we saw there's a new version of uh this that shipped today can you tell us a little bit

479
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,440
about it boom boom super quick then we move on and we do a couple other news stories and I like a

480
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,600
pundit yeah they come in they well they just they just tell us what they're up to or the other thing

481
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,840
we could do is in lieu of getting the person that actually is behind the story maybe we could get

482
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,360
the person who broke the story and ask them some of the and clarify some of the questions right

483
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:42,480
there and get it on the record that's a really good idea but I think as long as you can catch

484
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,280
it ahead of time like if you find it and you can catch it as long as you just put it like a little

485
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,320
thing in his show notes and a little comment on a youtube channel I think you're fine I mean

486
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,720
everybody's human like people make mistakes as long as you actually like catch a mistake and

487
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:04,240
own up to it I think you're fine so uh q5 sis pointed out in the chat room that uh he he said

488
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,880
that maybe um since feronix is being filled is getting more and more ads maybe it was a clickbait

489
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,400
type title and regardless of whether or not that's true maybe something uh maybe the same

490
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,280
philosophy that you applied to unfilter with um you know that news should be without sponsors

491
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:30,320
maybe that needs to be applied to linux news as well um no the the easiest fix in my opinion is

492
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:36,160
to basically subdomain this out on news have it have it you know have the news story posted

493
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,360
always have two separate unrelated citations as to where it came from maybe it's a mailing list

494
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:46,240
and an actual statement or blog post from that developer or whatever it may be and then it can

495
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,480
actually and if you can't obtain two then it is then flagged as uh speculative not news you know

496
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,400
so that way you know if we're gonna have pundits we're gonna have to have this fox news or cnn

497
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,920
sound effects i don't think pundits is the right descriptor i would be more like

498
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,400
even more like the developers know what they're talking about

499
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,440
first we need a situation around colonic yeah you know and the thing is is the more i think

500
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,320
about it i mean it's really it it's it's almost infeasible production wise on a weekly schedule

501
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,080
like that but it would really have to i would be something i'd be willing to take on if we

502
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:24,720
had somebody in the community who who wanted to sort of step up and be that coordinator sort of

503
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,840
be that production person like he's definitely willing to do that he's actually mentioned he's

504
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,200
trying to get in wanted to comment on this but uh he did indicate in the chat room that he would

505
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,760
be interested in taking on that role if that was something you wanted to do oh well all right well

506
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,520
i'll talk to him more often because that yeah i'm definitely i'm definitely down for that if

507
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,840
you want to oh well you know make headway in that direction yeah okay yeah let's talk more because

508
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,640
uh i mean i'm not i don't want to convert every last new segment into an interview segment but

509
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,400
i feel like if if nothing else i want to i want to maybe yeah if the big stuff and we can get

510
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,240
stuff in there and if we can just i just want to try to get as accurate as possible because it

511
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,240
really bothers me when we get the stories wrong so you and i will chat more and maybe we can work

512
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,200
something out there i gotta i gotta ask are we gonna have a situation room because we really need

513
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,200
to have a situation right and i don't want a wall of that's what i've been saying this whole time

514
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,240
you get like three screens all over the place i mean all right all right here you go here you go

515
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:32,000
this is cnn's wolf blitzer and you're in the situation room uh matt i'm reporting live on

516
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,480
the scene from the mailing list right now i can tell you i've reviewed the thread i've actually

517
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:44,720
read every single email and i can confirm these dates are simply proposals situation situation

518
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,760
thanks chris now we're all gonna get flagged on youtube oh that was hysterical

519
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,360
or we could do like fox news and have those oversized monitors of death you know i got that

520
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,160
too chris i've got the uh wall of screens already taken care of yeah you do that's right you are in

521
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:05,760
the situation room you got like uh yeah you got uh shep and uh wolf beat well um so speaking of uh

522
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,640
last sunday um i was wondering about something back to the uh desktop app you picked the uh

523
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,600
live streamer um i actually found something really cool this weekend uh it's called youtube viewer

524
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:26,560
it's actually a command line tool to view youtube in your terminal so it's youtube uh viewer yes

525
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,360
it's youtube in a terminal and that sounds like it's gonna that's a pretty generic search but

526
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,600
actually i found it right here it's on github all right is the video then ascii i mean how's that

527
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:41,760
work no you like you load youtube viewer in a terminal and pops up you can log in like you can

528
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,360
see all your subscriptions and it'll give a video and it'll just have a number beside the video so

529
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:53,920
you press one and then a video and it'll play it through in player does it does it use like a vlc

530
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:02,000
as the as like the back end you can use the vlc as in player or employer i think so uh and you

531
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,400
just what you just just put the command in the command line and then uh you just put the youtube

532
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,120
url in there and then bob's your uncle no you don't need a url like you search for the video

533
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,840
and then youtube viewer you know like display them and you just hit the number next to the video and

534
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:22,000
it'll play it oh and you can actually select the uh video quality too i feel like that's that is for

535
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,400
720p like dash 10 for 1080 that's really cool i just put a i put a link in the show notes and

536
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,920
in the chat room so you guys yeah i just want to get that out real quick before we get out there

537
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,320
that is cool and there's also an app called youtube dl to uh right download from the

538
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,560
terminal that's a gooey one though or is that coming it's not gooey no it's a terminal

539
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:47,760
yeah there's another one it's a gooey but this one's a terminal one so um i want to talk a little

540
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,320
bit about my news process and uh because i do i i think maybe the there might be the wrong

541
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,800
assumption that way there's not a lot of research done in them now so right now uh first of all i

542
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,040
think one way we could address this problem is i'd like to call on a new focus in the linux action

543
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,720
show subreddit on news correlation i'm not saying off topic i'm not saying all the other discussions

544
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,120
aren't fine but please just want to remind everybody if you see a story uh let's post it

545
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,920
there because i've been noticing some stories that i'm tracking that are not showing up in

546
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,280
the subreddit which is normally it used to be the subreddit was like the best place to get the latest

547
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,160
breaking stuff so i just kind of want to maybe refocus on news there too and i also along with

548
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,800
that it's equally important that people vote up and down the stories they think should be in the

549
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,000
show and if you know something's wrong please say so in the comments or if you have an alternative

550
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,160
take or if you have some additional thoughts please engage in the comments all of the stuff

551
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,360
all the other community stuff that happens there right now is awesome i love that subreddit it's

552
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,040
funny because i was starting to say you know we created it because of a mistake and it was just

553
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,560
going to be a news vetting tool for the show and it has developed into this vibrant awesome community

554
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,200
that is really you know one of the driving forces behind the show and so i don't want to break what

555
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:59,040
it's doing but i also want to call for a focus on um using it really as a tool for content that

556
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,360
should be in the show and vetting out the stuff that's crap well here's an option like you said

557
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:08,640
earlier that you try to compete with the subreddit about breaking news and stuff and instead of doing

558
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,560
that you could post the articles on it and say this is a potential for a news yeah i've been

559
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,840
doing that now but you know what the problem is is like if you got i want to every now and then

560
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,440
have a few surprises in the news segments that way if somebody goes to that subreddit several

561
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,240
times a day they can turn on last and still maybe hear a story they didn't see in the subreddit i

562
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,600
don't always get there but hey chris i wasn't necessarily saying you weren't doing the research

563
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,720
it's just you are very busy with all these shows going on and you know maybe having somebody like

564
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,200
rick i help you out would be a huge benefit yeah i think i i am going to try to build out a little

565
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,560
team there because there's other you know then that could benefit the other shows too you know

566
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:50,800
it's not just last i um not to bash it or anything but i don't use like stuff like ours technica or

567
00:48:50,800 --> 00:49:00,480
or gizmodo or stuff like that i usually try to find the primary source because i feel like that

568
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:08,320
sometimes when you have things like ours technica or gizmodo or or kodoku or or whatever website that

569
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:16,800
is i i feel that it's sometimes opinionated right and and i'm very factual so i i like to get

570
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,200
just straight to the facts and i don't want to hear about oh well you know it could be used for

571
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:29,360
this feature i i can kind of discern that for myself but for the most part i use primary resources

572
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:33,360
if i could build on that i think some of the biggest offenders in the linux world would be

573
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:40,000
like ferronics or omg ubuntu yes definitely definitely the sites like that do kind of have

574
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,040
the advantage that a they give new users easy to digest information and they also aggregate uh

575
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,920
stories so that a new user who wants linux news wouldn't necessarily have to go find the mailing

576
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:59,360
list or something like that that's true i just feel that sometimes when we reach out into those

577
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:05,040
type of sources that it sometimes is a little bit too opinionated to one side than it is to the other

578
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:13,680
i just don't like the idea of sorry sorry i don't like the idea of putting ferronics in the same

579
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:19,680
area as like network world because i mean if you really want bad coverage anything from zdnet i mean

580
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,600
well this is the problem you guys is everywhere it's bad coverage it really is pretty bad there's

581
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:28,800
there's there's a handful of legitimate community-based or or even business-based

582
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,600
outlets that get it right but they're in the minority yeah and i'm just to pipe in on this

583
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,160
a little bit just to give you guys some perspective the bigger the company the worse it is honestly

584
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,200
i'm gonna i'm gonna be real blunt with you and then it just it's just the way it is now if it's

585
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,440
technical information only it's not so bad but if you're trying to actually your job is to grab

586
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,800
eyeballs that's what your job is um be factual if you can but by all means come heaven or hell get

587
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,000
good eyeballs that's really what that's why i love the linux action show because of not only

588
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:05,040
your commitment but the community's commitment to accuracy right yep yeah i realize this i realize

589
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:11,360
this probably isn't possible but i think it'd be great if we could get like a uh jupiter news.com

590
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:17,120
and have a like the community write pieces that's interesting just tell me you wanted to before i

591
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:24,000
go too far from ours technica you wanted to make a defense there right well yeah oh well yeah there

592
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,320
are technica it depends it depends if how long the article is when i really love their coverage of

593
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:40,160
like uh geohots and the whole sony hack and the whole doxxing of of um ah that one security

594
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,960
researcher by anonymous that was those were great articles yeah i think so i don't think it's a

595
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,800
black and white thing like i think pharaonix does some good work too with benchmarking and they do

596
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,240
some good work with the steam coverage that they have there so i don't think it's all black and

597
00:51:52,240 --> 00:52:00,000
white most of it's bad on pharaonix if it's like gossipy type stuff but like if it's benchmarked

598
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,480
and things like that that's where pharaonix has its place i think i think when it comes to site

599
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,440
select pharaonix a lot of what i see is the writers are typically people who use windows or os 10

600
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,520
they give linux a try and give it a review based on okay they're giving an ubuntu try for a week

601
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,400
or something a lot of times and also a lot of times when something usually when something

602
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,880
inaccurate happens a lot of times you're looking at a slow news week and so they're combing through

603
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,520
mailing lists looking for any hint of something that can maybe tweak into something that's not or

604
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,600
exaggerated a little bit i mean it's a problem that that really happens but when you have really

605
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,920
good coverage that's not a reflection of how awesome that site is that's a reflection of

606
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,640
really awesome news being there available that week all right wizard wizard jed there has uh

607
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,680
one last remark on pharaonix and i think we'll close the book on pharaon okay yeah i just wanted

608
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:54,160
to say uh for even pharaonix even for benchmarking you've really got to take a good look at it uh

609
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,880
he's gotten better with time but if you look at any of his old stuff i think he's been learning

610
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,960
with time that you know to get closer and closer and to use the same hardware with everything but

611
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,600
if you go back he'll go and you'll you'll use the same processor and say yeah this is the exact same

612
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,800
bench but he's using it on a board that has a lower lower bus speed than the other one so it's

613
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:19,440
never going to be the same uh never going to be the same uh benchmark at all but he puts his

614
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,440
hardware in an advantage one of the things he's testing already has an advantage versus the other

615
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,840
thing but he did that for a couple of things like even file system tests and stuff i uh i think i'll

616
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,480
shift gears i think you know i'll wrap up the news discussion with just sort of this comment is i

617
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,600
think i'm thinking more about this stuff too as we reach episode 300 uh so it's my commitment to

618
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:44,240
martin and the kd project and all of the listeners of the show and that you know i at post 300 i

619
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,840
really want to improve our quality of news and i i want it to be as reliable as any news outlet for

620
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:56,720
linux it's last isn't about breaking news it's about analyzing the news of the events and and

621
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:02,640
and commenting on that development for that week and it's sort of every week we're taking a slice

622
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,080
of what happened in the linux and open source world and analyzing it and trying to pull out

623
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,000
the most important things that happened that week so if you if you only listen to one thing i want

624
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,200
the linux action show to be the thing you can listen to and know that you're getting the best

625
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,560
stories of the week and my goal isn't to sort of try to change that model it's just to improve it

626
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,280
and say you know if we can go directly to a source in some cases and just get them on the show and

627
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,880
get it right out of them and quickly as we're doing some or other coverage i think that'd be

628
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,760
a good improvement to the show and i don't know if that's the end goal because that is it is a lot

629
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,200
of work but we'll see post 300 i'd like to see if we can't get there um and uh we'll at least try

630
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,840
to make improvements where we can yeah go ahead i'd like to just uh just say one more thing

631
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:47,440
regarding last um the great thing about linux action show is even if it's a slow news week

632
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,560
the other main section of the show can really provide something to give that show some um

633
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:57,520
compared to the news section sure yeah yeah oh yeah that's that's i mean that's what we always

634
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,800
try to make sure that we know last even if you don't like the main topic there's going to be news

635
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,480
and feedback and pics and if you like the main topic and it's a bet it's a win-win etc there's

636
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,040
always something there for everybody uh but why don't we i got an email from uh from somebody

637
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,760
named cash i love that name nice and uh this is an argument that i think i've heard kicked around

638
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,320
i've even considered myself he says hey guys i'm a big fan of linux action show and linux unplugged

639
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:23,600
it's a great video podcast i have a question though do we really want linux to be a mainstream

640
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:29,440
os for example imagine everybody in this world able to drive a ferrari or some kind of rare car

641
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,880
it doesn't feel special anymore once again do we really really want linux to be a mainstream us

642
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,360
thanks you guys and keep up the good work cash in malaysia that's an excellent point i mean i think

643
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:44,800
for myself personally i'm okay with i want everybody in my circle of influence to enjoy it

644
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,840
you know if that makes sense if you say they were a bunch of hipsters now

645
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,880
you know that's kind of where i so here i come down on two minds of this i'm with matt at the

646
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,920
same time i'm like hey as long as it makes me happy and makes anybody that i get to use it or

647
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,240
wants to use it happy that's all it really needs to do and it's up to everybody else to figure it

648
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:10,080
out on their own and then at the same time i don't know i think maybe it's it's it's maybe

649
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:15,520
a little bit of that richard stallman in me get it out of here but i i wonder if if if we don't

650
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,760
sort of owe it to try to make this free and open platform available to everyone who doesn't want

651
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,400
to be restricted by the computer systems that are really just designed to monetize them and lock

652
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,880
them down and keep them locked into ecosystems see linux sort of provides this general computing

653
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:35,520
platform that frees people from the corporatization of computing and in some ways it almost feels like

654
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,880
a duty to make that available to everybody else but the other way i'm like it doesn't mean we

655
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,400
need to sacrifice making an awesome desktop i don't know what do you guys think i i disagree

656
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,440
with the fact that it shouldn't be mainstream i personally would love to see more stuff like

657
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,240
netflix be easily available on linux just to be able to like click and watch without having to use

658
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:59,520
something like pipeline and have to worry about some bug and wine preventing me to be able to

659
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:05,840
watch it or some graphics drivers you know getting better see even if the linux does go mainstream

660
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:10,560
you can still be a hipster if you use awesome or x9 that's true well so i mean like i think wizard

661
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,560
jet here brings up a good point i mean he thinks we've gotten as far as we have because we haven't

662
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:20,800
been limited just to geeks go ahead wizard yeah uh we we we've always taken in input from everyone

663
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:26,400
else because linux only exists because the community has made it exist you know just the

664
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,680
kernel doesn't make all of linux just just the new user land doesn't make just all of linux

665
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,680
it's because we've all gotten together and made certain parts and because everyone's had input

666
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,840
we've made what we have today and it's only through going and you know having more people

667
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:45,760
in there we that i can only see benefits of having you know the clinics get better i know this is

668
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:51,360
going to make a lot of people form at the mouth but i think canonicals efforts in the past what

669
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:58,320
is it uh 13 i mean no i mean eight nine years that they have done to bring ubuntu to it used

670
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:05,120
to be linux for human beings but now it's i guess mainstream that has helped bring linux so far to

671
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:11,840
where it is now i think that's what linspire attempted to do and wasn't able to do successfully

672
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:16,080
but they learned from their mistakes and built up built upon it yeah yeah i i agree they've

673
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,520
helped a lot with uh getting a lot more people to try it and you just look at the adoption you've

674
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,320
seen in business too that that's that's not quite fair to all the other projects that you know

675
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,400
wouldn't be able to exist if it wasn't for them too so it's it there's a lot of there's a lot of

676
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,040
love to go around but i think i agree in the end bringing more and more people in all the time

677
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:39,040
improves the linux to look at look at it in a different way uh linux has seen such an we're

678
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:45,920
going to cover a story on sunday that i've already been researching uh that about uh where the code

679
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,040
growth is in linux over 2013 and uh the linux foundation put out their analysis you guys

680
00:58:51,040 --> 00:59:00,000
probably all saw the link now and uh it it to me is so it so underscores how bringing in arm and

681
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,200
going to mobile even though like we see a lot of companies like google and android and samsung sort

682
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,520
of using linux for all these different things it actually has brought so much to linux itself so

683
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,920
many new features so many new improvements have come from that work and continue to come from

684
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,960
that work efficiencies too and that's by bringing in a new class of people and a new class of

685
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,600
hardware partners because it's not just users it's not just desktop users it's developers it's

686
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,520
hardware manufacturers it's business interests and we've brought them in and because of that

687
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,000
we've gotten better we've gotten stronger and i would argue that you know we we used to bang on

688
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,560
tevo for the tevo ization of linux but i don't think it's harmed linux one little tiny teensy bit

689
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,960
here's my only fear and the you can call me richard stallman for all you care but

690
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:53,520
but um i just don't want to see that we have a whole bunch of developers developed to a point

691
00:59:53,520 --> 01:00:00,560
where a lot of the linux kernel or a lot of the linux stuff that's in there is closed off from

692
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:07,920
people so like only the development comes from the developer teams i i would prefer to see kind

693
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,520
of like a symbiotic relationship between the developers and the open community just a little

694
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:19,680
bit because say like you know like how we have adobe killing us on flash so we have to figure

695
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:26,560
out ways of working around with flash a little bit more it it would probably be more beneficial

696
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:32,480
if yes i do think that we need more people but we also want to have people that would be willing to

697
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,960
contribute to the community not just not just in a software fashion but also in a communication

698
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,680
fashion i don't even necessarily think they have to directly contribute but i mean if somebody

699
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,920
you know is helping support them or if it's a support team that may run into these issues

700
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,000
the more people using it the more issues that get highlighted and fixed i think wimpy fills

701
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
this role really well right now with the mate project where he's uh you know he's here he's

702
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,680
advocating made he's very informed about he's communicating with the developers he's working

703
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:05,280
with a large distribution uh it's it's it's exactly what a lot of these projects need and

704
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,960
so i think he's a great example i'm another reason i'm glad he could join us this week

705
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:14,240
uh well there you go cash there's the uh there's the community's uh the virtual lugs thoughts on

706
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,280
linux staying mainstream it sounds like for the good of linux we have to continue to grow we must

707
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,480
assimilate all as the borg would say uh all right matt well i think we'll wrap it up right there at

708
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,280
that point um i'm not gonna say what we're gonna talk about on sunday i'm just not gonna do that

709
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,280
anymore because every time i commit something comes up and we have something else but i will

710
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:39,760
say there is a possibility according to the forecast that we'll have snow so if matt ends

711
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,000

715
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:00,480

716
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:06,240
