1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
Just three hours ago, no, two hours ago as we started recording, Google has made their

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,960
big announcement about Stadia, the streaming service that all runs on top of Linux and

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,960
Vulkan.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,960
Have you had a chance to see this, Wes?

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,960
I know we've been really busy today.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,120
Only just a little bit.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,720
I saw some headlines and I said, I'm going to have to dig into this later.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,120
So this is the evolution of that streaming beta, I guess, you could trial run, maybe.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,840
Yeah, which I have been using.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,440
So I'm curious to see just how much better it is.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,120
That already works on Linux.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,160
But the thing that was crazy is in this keynote and there's a big slide up on the screen that

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,720
says Linux and Vulkan.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,160
If you want your games to work on this platform, write your game for Linux.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
Wow.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,240
That is, that's different.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
I'm very excited.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,960
I mean, I'm also skeptical about streaming games.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,840
I've had some experience, some have been great, some have been flawed.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,000
So there is definitely room for mistakes to be made, for this not to be that great.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,120
However, Google's kind of making the case, look, we can throw essentially unlimited GPUs

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,120
at your problem.

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
I was a game developer.

25
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,480
I'm like, hmm.

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,640
The other thing they demoed, this is really where I could see this working, is play now

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,760
buttons like right next to a YouTube video about a game and within and they showed up

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,800
on screen within five seconds, the game is streaming to your PC or your whatever it is

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,280
and you're just playing the game immediately.

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,520
And in many ways, many games are already operated as like an online service anyway.

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,400
So now you're just not running their proprietary client.

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,320
You're just getting shipped some frames.

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,840
The browser is the platform.

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,800
But what I'm going to watch with a lot of interest, I mean, it's the gaming service.

35
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
That's kind of neat.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
I'll watch that too.

37
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,600
But what I'm really going to watch with interest is does this lead to more Linux games using

38
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,640
Vulkan?

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,360
That's going to be a massive win for Linux users.

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
Right.

41
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,160
Not just like the first order of games that run on Linux, but just that being a standard

42
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,400
people are trained to do.

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,800
That makes it more, you know, there'll be more documentation, more developer know how

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,240
it will benefit the community at large.

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,440
Here's what I'm thinking.

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,000
Even if like desktop Linux isn't enough of a reason for developers to be incentivized

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,920
to target Linux, somebody like Google coming along and saying, here's Stadia and or Stadia,

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,400
however you say it, and it has five million users thanks to us tying it in with YouTube.

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,240
So write your games for that, because that's going to get eyes like that.

50
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,760
That seems like there's potential there, doesn't it?

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:40,840
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 293 for March 19th, 2019.

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:52,520
Well, hello there and welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's hitting

53
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,840
the road and barely surviving.

54
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,600
My name is Chris.

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
My name is Wes.

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,840
And oh my gosh, I am so happy you're alive.

57
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,600
Well, I'll tell you just in a brief moment about how I was almost taken hostage yesterday.

58
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,680
But but first, I'll tell you what's coming up on this week's episode.

59
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,000
If you're a Debian user, we've got some great news for you.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,680
If you're a SUSE user, we've got good news for you.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,640
And a brand new Linux desktop just got a great new release.

62
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,000
And we'll talk about the troubles that our favorite open source project for Plasma and

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,640
Android users, KDE Connect, will tell you about the problems that they're running into

64
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,560
with the old Google Play Store this week.

65
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,640
But later on in the show, once we really get in our groove, we're going to talk about

66
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,960
eBPF in practice.

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,760
There is some amazing performance monitoring, hacking, testing tools that have come to Linux.

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,760
And one of the best things that happened to us at scale is Wes and I got to attend Brandon

69
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,380
Gregg's talk on performance hacking.

70
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,200
And we watched in real time as he diagnosed all kinds of performance issues with Minecraft.

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,040
Well, we took away a few of those essentials, a couple of practical examples, and we're

72
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,720
going to cover them, what it means for us Linux users, and why the kernel devs are so,

73
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,760
so excited about this new feature.

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,120
It's big stuff.

75
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
And if we have a little bit of time left, we've got some feedback too.

76
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,920
But before we get any further, you guys know what time it is.

77
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,640
It's time to bring in that mumble room.

78
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,440
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

79
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Hello.

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Hey.

81
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Good afternoon.

82
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
Hello.

83
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,800
Nice to have you all here.

84
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,640
So most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux.

85
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,280
You know, I have to say most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux.

86
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,900
I just I just came up with that.

87
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,280
Now, what do you say, guys, before we get into the news, can we have a little storytime

88
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
with Chris?

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,920
I had to tell Wes about this.

90
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,960
Wes and Wes Allen, she's already know about this because I this was crazy.

91
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,760
I've never had anything like this happen to be in my life.

92
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:56,840
But yesterday, my wife, my dog and possibly my home were all at risk of being taken hostage

93
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,400
or worse.

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,160
It was an insane situation that thankfully I can now sit here and laugh about.

95
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,560
However, about this time, 24 hours ago, I could not.

96
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,320
So I'll start with you have this thing called BLM land, and it's it's a beautiful gift from

97
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
the federal government.

98
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,200
It's the Bureau of Land Management has all of these areas where you can go take your

99
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,680
RV and you can park for free for 14 days.

100
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Isn't that great?

101
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
14 days.

102
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
You can go somewhere.

103
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,960
It's just fantastic.

104
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,480
And as we were driving along, going back up to Seattle from Texas, we found this great

105
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,280
spot in Arizona where we could pull off of the I-10 highway for a little while and get

106
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,700
fantastic cell signal.

107
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,040
That way we could still get some work done.

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,880
And we've got these new lithium ion batteries that we had installed.

109
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,520
So I knew we had like a couple of days of working time.

110
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,100
We go there, we park.

111
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,120
Beautiful cell signal.

112
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,000
Nobody is around.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,660
Gorgeous view of the mountains.

114
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,760
So we pull in late at night and we get set up and sleep great because it's under the

115
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
stars.

116
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
It's silent.

117
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,840
It's it's just a gorgeous location.

118
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,800
And about midday, after working for most of the day and attending meetings and listening

119
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,360
to a great episode of Kota Radio, somebody comes knocking on my door and open up the

120
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,560
door and it's it's a rough looking fella.

121
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:24,760
Somebody who's who's seen who's seen the inside of a jail cell a few times and just rough

122
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,760
looking guy.

123
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,200
And he's got a weapon on his side.

124
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Oh no.

125
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Mm hmm.

126
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,760
And it didn't take me more than I mean, I mean, I immediately kind of assess what was

127
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,200
going on.

128
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,320
And I was a little drunk at the time.

129
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,320
So really not on your A game, tired from a long day of driving, I'm sure preparing to

130
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
relax.

131
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
It was the end of the day.

132
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,680
It was about three thirty and we had been driving forever, had been working since four

133
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
a.m.

134
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,160
So it had been a very long day at this point.

135
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,320
And Hadid was about to start make dinner.

136
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,760
So I poured myself a glass of whiskey, turned the old TV on, and that's when the door got

137
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
a knock on.

138
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,000
Boom, boom, boom.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Open it up.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,900
Hey, man, can I have some gas?

141
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,900
We're all out.

142
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,480
And I'm looking around and says he's got this.

143
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,920
He's got an RV that he says he got for free.

144
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,680
I don't know if he stole it or what, but it's really bad shape.

145
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,800
Like there's parts on the side that are missing.

146
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,560
It's got it's the suspension has collapsed on the rear, right?

147
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
It's in bad shape.

148
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,680
He says, we're all out of gas and I could use a little gas.

149
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,200
And I'm looking around, I'm thinking to myself, well, what are you doing?

150
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,640
What are you doing this far off the highway up in the mountains?

151
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Why?

152
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,840
Like, that's not where you go when you run out of gas, right?

153
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,280
You pull off on the side of the road.

154
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,040
You don't go down a long, windy road where there's absolutely nobody, right?

155
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,720
No gas stations, no gas stations.

156
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,720
And so, you know, half drunk me, I'm like, well, all right, man, let's do this.

157
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,360
Like I'm just thinking we could just throw a hose down my, you know, my where we put

158
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,640
gas in the gas cap and I'll just siphon off a couple of gallons and they'll be on their

159
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
way.

160
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,940
So the guy goes back to his RV for a couple of minutes and he walks up and he's got these

161
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,560
small little like two foot hoses and a couple of like connectors.

162
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,520
And I look at it and I can see, I can see it's something that they've used a lot.

163
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,960
Like they're going around to different rigs and they're disconnecting the gas line and

164
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,640
they're hooking up to that and they're filling their rig up with gas and that's how they're

165
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
getting down the road.

166
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,980
And this all starts clicking because I can realize, oh, he wants to disconnect my gas

167
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,080
line and take my gas, but they don't have any way of fixing it.

168
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
So then I would be stranded.

169
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,320
And then a couple of other guys step out of the RV.

170
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,080
They also have weapons.

171
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:38,040
And then three mastiff dogs, you know, the big dogs, mastiffs and one husky dog get out

172
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,160
of this tiny RV and they all start walking towards us.

173
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
This is insane.

174
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,360
It's getting a little tense, right?

175
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,560
And so I'm trying to just be nice, trying to empathize with their situation a little

176
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,120
bit, figuring like if I resist, then, you know, they're desperate.

177
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,280
They're going to take what they need.

178
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,960
But if I can, if I can cooperate a little bit, maybe they'll just, you know, they'll

179
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
be cool.

180
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,320
And so I'm looking at different ways like we can disconnect the gas line because, you

181
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,200
know, like I don't have a lot of options here and I'm like, there's just no way I'm comfortable

182
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
with this.

183
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,480
So I'm talking to them some more and trying to get an idea of what they're looking for.

184
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,960
And I walk them back over to their RV to kind of look at what their different options are.

185
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,040
And so I suggest to them, I say, hey, well, why don't we do this?

186
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,440
Why don't one of you guys just come with me and I'll just drive you to the gas station.

187
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
We'll fill up some gas.

188
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
I'll even pay for it.

189
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Okay.

190
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
Yeah, that'd be great.

191
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:32,640
So if one guy grabs a gun, grabs a knife and comes and gets in the RV, he's ready to go.

192
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,920
The other two guys and the dog stay behind.

193
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,980
So Hadia, Levi and I take this guy down the road to go fill up a couple of gas cans.

194
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,600
And then when we bring him back, oh, and I should say, you know, I'm trying to be nice

195
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
to the guy.

196
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
So like we're at the gas station.

197
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,040
I offer him a couple of beers, you know, just trying to loosen him up a little bit and get

198
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,320
him, you know, get a couple of gas cans filled up.

199
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,360
And when I say gas cans, I mean like milk jugs.

200
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,280
They had milk jugs and water jugs that we just filled with gasoline and then put caps

201
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
on it.

202
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,760
But that's all we had.

203
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Good lord.

204
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
Yeah.

205
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,200
And then we got back and it was like this process of trying to get rid of them and not

206
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,360
not like show our hand that much.

207
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,000
It was one of those moments in life where you had a sense this can go two ways.

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,640
I can either play ball and just kind of try to help these guys out a little bit or I can

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,360
resist like, you know, when he walked up to my door, I could have told him to eff off

210
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,840
and that could have just started a whole thing, right?

211
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,560
Because they were they were stuck and they needed to get going again.

212
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,460
I have a sense they had somewhere to be and they had to get there fast or somewhere not

213
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,460
to be.

214
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,460
Yeah.

215
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,460
Or somewhere not to be.

216
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,520
And so it took another couple of hours to get them to go.

217
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,680
Hadia made them dinner even.

218
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,560
And after they ate and filled their rig up with a little bit of gas that they got, we

219
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,920
gave them like 10 bucks and quarters and they left.

220
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,100
And man, it was a weird experience because like you start replaying like the 50 different

221
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,360
decisions that you made along the way that probably made this go the right way and how

222
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,720
each in each one of those situations, it could have gone really south.

223
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,680
Like they could have been dismantling my RV.

224
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,560
Like best case, they would have dismantled my RV.

225
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,300
Worst case, they would have stolen it.

226
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,960
Maybe with my dog and my lady inside it.

227
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,780
Like who knows what would have happened?

228
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,640
It was weird and I've never had an experience like that on the road before.

229
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,560
And it was a damn shame, Wes, because it's a beautiful work spot with just full cellular

230
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
signal.

231
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,560
No one around.

232
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,080
And you were chased off by these hooligans.

233
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
Wow.

234
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Well, we thought about it.

235
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,640
We're like, should we stay or should we go now?

236
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,400
Because they left and we thought about it.

237
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,500
And you know, I had to sober up a little bit because I'd had some drinks.

238
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,820
And so while I was sobering up, I was trying to decide what I wanted to do.

239
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,720
And while they were here, I was drinking with them, too, you know, trying to keep everybody

240
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,160
social, keep everybody happy.

241
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,800
So I'm sitting here, I'm drinking whiskey and ciders.

242
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
That is impressive.

243
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,680
You really just picked up right up on that and befriended them in ways like you're saying

244
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,840
most people probably would not have.

245
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Yeah.

246
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,320
I mean, it was like so I had but then like so but like, I'm also like there's a clock

247
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,560
in the back of my head going like you're you're diminishing your ability to escape.

248
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,280
Like I kept trying to arrange it so that way Hedia and Levi and the awning would all be

249
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,440
in like we'd have the awning in the dog would be in the RV, Hedia would be in the RV.

250
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,960
So if at any moment something went really south, I was going to try to run into my RV,

251
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,240
start it up and just take off.

252
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,680
But that's not a super fast process because we have like these leveling jacks and shit.

253
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Oh, no.

254
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,360
It wouldn't have been smooth as they're firing up.

255
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,100
And I just kept trying to like I kept trying to arrange it so that way like we had we could

256
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,200
escape if we had to.

257
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,880
But a lot of times that just wasn't an option.

258
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,120
And I just had to like I just had to hang out with these guys and like drink with them

259
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,720
and talk about their time in jail and talk about how one of them is trying to go get

260
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,160
his kid and another guy was talking about how his wife died.

261
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,600
Now he's now he's called now he's calling himself a preacher.

262
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,160
Who apparently makes money by selling tricks at gas stations from what I could pick up.

263
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,000
And it was really like none of their stories checked out.

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,520
Like each guy had a different story that didn't really sync up with the other guy's story.

265
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,120
Like they hadn't coordinated that at all.

266
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,360
I got to ask, they didn't happen to find out the name of this show, did they?

267
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,240
No loose stickers laying around, right?

268
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Yeah.

269
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Yeah.

270
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,640
That's why we got to change all the logos now because they know the show logo.

271
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,620
So we got new logos.

272
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,200
It was weird.

273
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,460
And Hedia was really shaken up.

274
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,040
And you know, it's so I had to roll with it so fast that there was moments where she didn't

275
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,440
know if I was just being blissfully unaware of how much danger we were in.

276
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Right.

277
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
You couldn't communicate.

278
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
Right.

279
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,200
Because she thought maybe Chris just thinks he's making buddies with some RV guys.

280
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,240
But there was a couple of times, like three times we were able to exchange a couple of

281
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,680
looks that were like, yeah, I know what's going on, you know, and and then afterwards

282
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
we finally got a chance to talk about it.

283
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,520
Like, you know, just like, can you believe that just happened?

284
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,800
Like, it was huge.

285
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,680
So we sat there decompressing for like a couple of hours sobering up and then I thought, I

286
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
got to go.

287
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
I can't stay here.

288
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,040
I got to keep going because, you know, those guys are going down the road.

289
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,200
But if something goes wrong or they run out of gas, well, they know where to come back

290
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,360
now.

291
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,100
They know where to find me.

292
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,160
So I got to keep going.

293
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,600
But it it totally sucked because that's where I was going to record today's show.

294
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
It's I mean, it does.

295
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,760
It did sound like a beautiful spot.

296
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,760
Yeah.

297
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
What a shame.

298
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,640
I ended up getting down the road another three hours and now we're just outside of L.A.

299
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,160
I wonder I wonder if after after they left, if for a moment there like I don't know my

300
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,220
mental image is just this group of like vigilantes or whatever this these vandals and they're

301
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,120
like, you know, that Chris guy, he was a really nice guy.

302
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,160
You just like killed him with kindness.

303
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
I did.

304
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,400
I tried to I try to just be accommodating and be a good host and kill him with kindness

305
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,640
and empathize with their situation and try not to be judgmental about about the fact

306
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,840
that they're probably all outlaws on the run.

307
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,060
You know, I just I just tried to roll with it and and just try to because everybody everybody

308
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,720
goes through a hard time.

309
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,560
I was trying to look at it from that perspective.

310
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,680
And the guy ended up like talking to me about his kid and how he's going to go try to get

311
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,480
his kid from Georgia and problems he's having with his ex-wife like in a way we made like

312
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,120
a genuine human connection.

313
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,000
It's just that no moment was I under any false pretenses that these are my new best friends.

314
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It was weird.

315
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,860
It was it was really something.

316
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,720
And so then after it happened, I had to get in our group chat and I had to tell you guys

317
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,760
all about it last night because it was just one of the craziest things that ever happened

318
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
to me.

319
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,800
And I can only really tell you half the story, right, because otherwise it take up the whole

320
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
show.

321
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,800
But, man, am I glad to be here today doing the show right now.

322
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,240
And finally, I'm glad I found another quiet spot to record.

323
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,160
Chris, I'm really looking forward to your memoir.

324
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
I hope that comes out soon.

325
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
No doubt.

326
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Right.

327
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,440
One hundred percent agree with that, Bruce.

328
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,040
This would have made a hell of a vlog episode.

329
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,760
I'm just saying.

330
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
But I don't know.

331
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,560
I just who I am.

332
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,960
I did post a picture on my Instagram, which I don't use very often, but insta Chris last

333
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,600
where I put I posted a picture of the workspace.

334
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,800
You can see the you can see the intro where Apollo in the picture, too.

335
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,240
And that was it was just so nice.

336
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,040
And you could walk and, you know, didn't have to put Levi on leash.

337
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,240
He could run around and it was so cool, but, you know, got to move on.

338
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Got to be safe.

339
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,680
That looks like a great spot.

340
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,320
But when you're so far out from society, you kind of forget that there are different or

341
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
fewer laws.

342
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Yeah.

343
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,440
And it was funny how they several times mentioned, you know, out here in the desert.

344
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Mm hmm.

345
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Yeah.

346
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
OK.

347
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,440
I get it.

348
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
I get it.

349
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
I got it.

350
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
OK.

351
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Is that what they sounded like?

352
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
A little bit, actually.

353
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
They all had a little.

354
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,060
Yeah, they all had a little drawl, but they were also they seemed like they were on something

355
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,400
that I don't know what it would be, but they didn't like that glossy eyes and stuff.

356
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,880
And they had a little bit of coordination issues sometimes.

357
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,400
And so I don't know what was going on.

358
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
Maybe they were drunk.

359
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,840
Maybe maybe it was something else.

360
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,440
But who tell you what?

361
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,960
That's my that's my probably my craziest road adventure yet.

362
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,120
I thought getting hit by a semi truck, but no, that's that's this tops it.

363
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,020
Were there a bunch more RVs out that like whenever you were heading out onto the land,

364
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,700
did you like pass by a bunch more rigs and stuff or were you out there just kind of all

365
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,600
desolate and these guys just roll up on you?

366
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Yep.

367
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Hundred percent.

368
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
It was just us.

369
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
That's why it's really weird.

370
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,840
Like you're running out of gas.

371
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,920
You don't you don't come down this road to find gas unless you unless you think there's

372
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,240
a good chance there could be some RVers down there where you could go steal some gas because

373
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,020
it is a like there's a few websites that list the spot that we were at.

374
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,120
That's how we found it.

375
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,040
So it's a known camping spot and it's a legal spot for you to go camp on federal land for

376
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
up to 14 days.

377
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,320
Do you think they were out there just because they wanted good cell phone signals as well?

378
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Yeah.

379
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
Yeah.

380
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,440
They got to make sure that, you know, their podcast has good signal.

381
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Everybody's hustling.

382
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,320
I mean, if it's working out the gas station, you know, who knows, right?

383
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
All right.

384
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Well, let's talk a little Linux.

385
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,900
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

386
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:16,320
Last week on the show, we discussed the leadership challenges facing the Debian project.

387
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,960
Since then, clearly because we covered on the show, there is now at least five candidates

388
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,360
and likely more that have emerged.

389
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,500
And it's an interesting group of people.

390
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:34,600
They all seem to have all five on this first list here all seem to have fairly long connections

391
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,760
with the Debian project.

392
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,240
I think one of the shortest one is from 2007.

393
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,120
I guess that's a good crop of candidates.

394
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,760
Why do you think it took so long for people to put their name forward?

395
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
I don't know.

396
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,280
I hate to speculate that it's because of some of the issues the project may be facing, but

397
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,840
it's hard to say.

398
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,840
The leadership position is also not necessarily one that is purely technical, and it could

399
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,880
be that people that are interested in the Debian project perhaps have more of a technical

400
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,880
inclination.

401
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,640
You know, they want to scratch that itch and not so much of a political itch, which the

402
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,240
leadership position is a little more of politics than it is development.

403
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,240
Yes, right.

404
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,440
I mean, it is in many ways, you're performing a service for the project.

405
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,200
It takes time and commitment, and it may not be the little thing that is the most interesting

406
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,000
in maintaining and being a part of the project.

407
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,400
Each candidate in the list here is really fascinating.

408
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,920
A couple that jumped out at me, Jonathan Carter has been a Debian developer since 2017.

409
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,500
And I believe he also maintains a fair few packages, including most of the gnome shell

410
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,720
stuff in Debian.

411
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Another candidate, Sam Hartman is interesting because he's been a Debian developer since

412
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,840
2000.

413
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:46,240
He's best known for the maintenance of the Debian Kerberos packages, and he's blind.

414
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,840
I think that that's great.

415
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,880
I think inclusion is a great thing.

416
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,920
And even people with disabilities should have, you know, a prominent role in some of these

417
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
projects.

418
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Absolutely.

419
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,920
That only brings awareness to those people with disabilities and making that distro even

420
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,560
more suitable for those people.

421
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Yeah.

422
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,800
And I wonder how that, I wonder what that dynamic would, how that would change the dynamic

423
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,920
at events when, you know, it's one of the primary roles of the leadership position.

424
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,400
I wonder how that would change.

425
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,680
Several other interesting folks on the list as well.

426
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,120
And I think we're going to see more show up.

427
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,320
So Debian won't have a leaderless problem.

428
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,520
Now they have an issue of trying to pick just the best one.

429
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,760
I think it's a pretty good, a pretty good spot for them to be in overall.

430
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,080
It's in the campaign time now, right?

431
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,240
And then after, is it another week from now and then there'll be actual voting?

432
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,440
That's my understanding, at least I could have it wrong, but that does track my understanding.

433
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,840
And we'll let you know what happens.

434
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,240
If anything interesting develops, why don't we, just that we only have a few community

435
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
news stories.

436
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Let's keep going.

437
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,000
One of the other ones that I just wanted to let everybody know about is that awesome Linux

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,800
laptop battery optimization tool, TLP has a new release.

439
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,760
And I'll admit, I kind of thought this project was dormant.

440
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,040
If you're not familiar with TLP, it's a command line advanced Linux power management tool

441
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,880
that helps save battery power for your laptop.

442
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,400
You essentially install it and forget it, at least that's the hope.

443
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,120
TLP is highly configurable though.

444
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,960
So you could go in and modify the Etsy default TLP file to your liking in general.

445
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,800
And there are third party GUIs like TLP UI, which you can install from your local repo

446
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,080
and then manage some of those settings with a GUI.

447
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,440
It really is just sort of install and forget it.

448
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,000
It runs in the background, so it'll detect when you're on AC or battery and you can do

449
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,520
all the normal things like apply different profiles, more optimizations depending on

450
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,920
what power profile that you want.

451
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,120
And it just works.

452
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,440
You can go use other tools like PowerTop.

453
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,400
Don't use its auto tune setting, but you can go use it to go check out and see exactly

454
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,920
what's being tuned and you'll find it all runs very nicely.

455
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,160
And in TLP 1.2, there's even better support for stuff like NVME drives.

456
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,280
I really liked that.

457
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,600
I've already upgraded because we've got those in those ThinkPads.

458
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
There's also some neat stuff around Intel GPU frequency limits.

459
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,240
And you could already do this, but they've just integrated it in a nice little way to

460
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,320
do it right in the tool so you can tune whatever minimum or maximum boost frequency setting

461
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,760
depending on if you're on AC or battery.

462
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
That's cool.

463
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,760
I like that.

464
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,240
Speaking of ThinkPad, there's a couple other things in there for ThinkPad users too.

465
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,720
Oh yeah, a new native kernel API for battery features that are just specific to ThinkPad.

466
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,160
So you don't need to be running a ThinkPad for this, but if you are, you get a few extras.

467
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,340
I do really appreciate seeing the support for NVME drives.

468
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:34,240
That is all kinds of fantastic, and it's pretty neat that you can tweak the Intel GPU frequency

469
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
stuff.

470
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,520
I didn't really realize that was a thing, and I don't know, it kind of makes me even

471
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,080
happier that I have an Intel card in my ThinkPad.

472
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,680
So TLP is available in just about every Linux distribution under the sun, including Debian

473
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,120
or Ubuntu or Arch or Fedora or probably even openSUSE.

474
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,480
And the new version 1.2 is not available for most of those repositories yet.

475
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,820
It is available though for Arch, surprise, surprise.

476
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:05,320
And there is a PPA out there for Ubuntu users that is maintained by the TLP developer.

477
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,600
So it's a legit PPA that you can go install if you're on a Ubuntu-based distro.

478
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,040
We'll have a link in the show notes.

479
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,520
Link in the show notes for sure, but you combine something like TLP with PowerTop and you can

480
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,680
really get to a pretty good place in Linux battery performance.

481
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,260
If you have been on a system in the past that you weren't quite sure what was hogging so

482
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,360
much battery life, why was your battery draining so fast, install PowerTop.

483
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,680
And PowerTop will show you what is hitting that CPU, what is waking up your IO, what

484
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,120
is taking all of that power.

485
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,560
That's what PowerTop will tell you.

486
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,960
And then you combine that with something like TLP, which helps tamp some of those things

487
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,160
down when you're in battery mode, and it's intelligent about being on AC power versus

488
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:55,040
battery power and it's a nice combo that some distributions ship out of the box by default,

489
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
but not most.

490
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,640
And it's definitely worth an install.

491
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,680
Not calling it an app pic, Wes, but it's kind of an app pic.

492
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
You know what I mean?

493
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
It's like a mini app pic.

494
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,240
It's a mini app pic and it deserves it too.

495
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,100
One thing that really impressed me when I was looking at this new release is just the

496
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,220
quality of the documentation the project maintains.

497
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,540
They've got all kinds of nice stuff, a really well filled out FAQ and some practical examples

498
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,540
to get you started.

499
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,600
Man, I don't want to sit here and say, man, this is going to fix all of your battery problems

500
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,440
on Linux, but if you're having battery problems on Linux and you're not using PowerTop and

501
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,440
TLP, do that because it will definitely improve the situation.

502
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,160
And in the case of my ThinkPad, when I have these two different components and if I don't

503
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,400
use Chrome, I stick with Firefox, I can get eight and a half hours of battery life out

504
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,040
of my T480 with the, I think it's like a six cell battery on there.

505
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,920
I'm not quite sure what the battery size is, but eight and a half hours is, that's an all

506
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,240
day battery life for me.

507
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,320
And really it's just a combination of tuning it with PowerTop, using Firefox instead of

508
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,080
Chrome whenever possible, and then TLP underneath it to manage all that stuff.

509
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
It's pretty nice.

510
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,320
And Brandon, I know you're a mobile user, have you tried out any of these things?

511
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,760
I learned about TLP maybe two or three years ago and it's been awesome.

512
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,920
And I love, like Wes said, it's a kind of a set it and forget it sort of thing.

513
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,880
So I have it on my main sort of install script and I just don't even think about it, but

514
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,160
the ThinkPad stuff has been really nice.

515
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,480
But one question I have around that is, how is a regular user, you know, someone who's

516
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,760
new to Linux and it's just a desktop user supposed to know about these things that they're

517
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
available?

518
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,720
It seems like it took me years to find it really, and it was almost by mistake.

519
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,720
And so how do we spread this stuff around, right?

520
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Yeah, I agree.

521
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,360
Elle, I think you ran into something similar.

522
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,240
Like earlier you were having battery drain issues and I mentioned to go try out PowerTop.

523
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,960
Again it's sort of like, how do you even know about PowerTop?

524
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,600
Well, and one of the things that I ran into that I was joking around the IRC room that

525
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,200
I'm raising my hand is a lot of my battery drain issues were happening when my system

526
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,360
was supposed to be idle.

527
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,000
I'd shut it down or I'd put it in suspend mode and I'd come back and a lot of these

528
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,200
tools I couldn't find the logs to go find out what was happening when I didn't actively

529
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
have them running.

530
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,520
Yeah, you know, the battery drain on idle is so frustrating.

531
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,320
That is like, it's like, what are you doing computer?

532
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
You're just sitting here.

533
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,880
What is wrong with you?

534
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,520
And if you don't have the logs or you don't have the tools to expose that information,

535
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,640
it's just a black box.

536
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
You're trying to fix it.

537
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,120
But I do want to, I want to hit the pause button here because MiniMech is flagging me

538
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,320
and he's saying it's not always all roses.

539
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,080
You've had some problems with TLP, Mini?

540
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,800
Well, I had the same problem.

541
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:29,140
I was trying to get down my power consumption when in idling state.

542
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,680
So I was tuning like hell and all of a sudden my computer freezed and it didn't wake up

543
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,560
again and I was not knowing why until in the end I found out that I had a firmware bug

544
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,840
in my SSD and once the SSD went to sleep, it didn't wake up again.

545
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,640
So and it was really difficult to do an upgrade for the firmware because you need Windows

546
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,280
to do the firmware upgrade of the SSD and you know what, so you can go too far when

547
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,080
it comes to the configuration with TLP.

548
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,960
Yeah, sounds like if you hit a weird firmware bug, like there's not much you can do about

549
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,760
that and how would you even know until you try something like this?

550
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,480
Well, it took me days, it took me days to find out.

551
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,160
All right, that is a good disclaimer.

552
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,160
That's good to know.

553
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,600
Do you, do you happen to recall what the brand of that SSD was or maybe even the model just

554
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,280
so the audience has a heads up?

555
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,280
I still use it, it's Transcend MST 400.

556
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,440
It's used in a lot of Chromebooks.

557
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,560
You can still buy it and I guess with the new versions, the firmware has been upgraded

558
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:42,440
so there's no problem now, but when I bought the computer, there was still the old firmware.

559
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,400
Yeah and if you got that old firmware, it only updates through Windows, that's a bit

560
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
of a chore.

561
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,000
Back to you Brent, you were wondering why Firefox versus Chrome for me?

562
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,480
Yeah, you mentioned it a few times and I wondered what that's about.

563
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,960
I've noticed that the overall battery drain on Firefox seems to be significantly less

564
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
than Chrome.

565
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,640
I don't know what that fully is.

566
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,680
The generous side of me would like to say, well, the Mozilla developers have really optimized

567
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,620
Firefox, but then like the skeptic in me is like, well, that's because Chrome is just

568
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,680
like using like RAM and CPU like a madman to render pages as fast as possible.

569
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,120
I don't know which one's better really.

570
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,800
I don't know, I don't technically know the reason, but I've definitely experienced this.

571
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,620
Now Cheese, I know you wanted to jump in earlier.

572
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,160
Have you had a chance to play with TLP at all?

573
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,880
I haven't had a chance to play with it, but I did want to comment just reading through

574
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,960
the article and some of the documentation.

575
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,680
What's kind of interesting is that you can set up these configurations, but you can set

576
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:48,000
these up like all the way down to maybe even enabling or disabling integrated radios.

577
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,120
So maybe it could be a software type switch for your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi or whatever,

578
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,920
whenever you're at a conference or someplace you don't feel comfortable.

579
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,660
You could act as that software kind of switch that you see on some of these hardware devices

580
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,760
that are available and or coming down the pipeline.

581
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,320
You know, now you say that, man, I could see like having like conference mode TLP config

582
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,160
where it just shuts off all the radios, just go dark and save battery power while you're

583
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
at it.

584
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
I like that.

585
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,400
If you're out there and you've got a good config or you've got a war story like Mini

586
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,720
Mac did Linux, unplug dot com slash contact, send it in and let us know.

587
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:31,220
Now this next story, this is a hard one because it depends on your bias.

588
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,000
When you read this story, you're either going to read it two different ways.

589
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,120
I mean, it's it's all about money, really.

590
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:45,600
What we have now is a company that is quasi independent, calling themselves fully independent.

591
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,860
And I'm talking about your good friends over at SUSE.

592
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:55,800
They have announced that they are once again an independent company that is owned by an

593
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
investment firm.

594
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,080
I'm not quite sure on that.

595
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,600
I kind of depends on your on your definition of independent and of being owned by a private

596
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,760
equity investor counts as independent.

597
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Yeah.

598
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,440
And I mean, as long as we're just going to play the technicality game to us like they're

599
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,400
they're big promotions all over their blog.

600
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
It's in every press release.

601
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,000
They are now the largest independent open source company.

602
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,760
The only problem with that, I mean, again, we're just playing technicalities here, is

603
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:24,240
the Red Hat IBM acquisition isn't done yet.

604
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,880
So technically, Red Hat's still the largest independent open source company.

605
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,240
Well, that's what you get for reading blog posts and PR articles, Chris.

606
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
That's so true.

607
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
That is so true.

608
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,280
And they've gone through a few hands over the years.

609
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Oh, yeah.

610
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,480
I mean, I can't think of that many other companies that have kind of been passed around so much.

611
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,640
Way back when they were first acquired by Novell, oh, yes, Novell in 2004.

612
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,760
And then, okay, that stuck around for a little while in 2010, AttachMate bought up Novell,

613
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:58,000
which then a little less time now Micro Focus in 2014 bought AttachMate.

614
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,160
At that point, things got a little bit better for Zeus, because they were turned into an

615
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,820
independent division.

616
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,400
But then, well, just last year in 2018, they were sold to EQT.

617
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Right.

618
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:15,240
And I believe they are still the primary owner, EQT is what's called a, quote, growth investor.

619
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,480
So it could be that Sousa is an independent corporation that is getting growth investment

620
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
from EQT.

621
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,800
So they're not actually owned so much by EQT.

622
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,760
But independent is still debatable.

623
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,680
Oh, Zeus, we'll see what this means and if it actually like, there has been some replacements

624
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,520
of various leadership positions.

625
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,400
So perhaps that will have long term outcomes for the company.

626
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,800
But only time will tell.

627
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Yeah.

628
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,320
So everybody bear in mind, this doesn't really change anything for open Sousa, which is the

629
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,160
distribution we often talk a lot more about Sousa here is this is the enterprise product.

630
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,720
This is the product they're trying to position as a solid competitor to Red Hat Enterprise

631
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
Linux.

632
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,200
Hence, this now renewed focus on being an independent open source company.

633
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,560
It's kind of it's a reverse jab saying we're not owned by IBM, but you got to ask yourself

634
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:06,200
like you look at the market and you look at IBM's acquisition of Red Hat.

635
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,640
It does kind of and this is my opinion, but to me, it seems like it's only a matter of

636
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,360
time until somebody else comes along and buys Zeus.

637
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,480
Just like I would imagine that if Canonical went public or if Canonical wasn't in its

638
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,480
current financial raising stage, it would likely get bought up too.

639
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,960
It's just the the reality of the marketplace right now.

640
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,560
Yeah, it does say something about the value proposition of some of these companies.

641
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,640
Well, we'll see how long we can hold out on if anything actually happens.

642
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,560
And I am surprised to see it is popular in some embedded spaces.

643
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,560
I've seen it of the Linux I see at like various point of sale machines.

644
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,040
I think Zeus is still the most common.

645
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
Yeah.

646
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,440
And they had they do have a pretty legitimate and large vendor ecosystem around them.

647
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,680
Like that's when you when you've been around for like twenty five years like they have

648
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,960
you build out like deep industry relationships and those are things they can still leverage

649
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,160
and maybe even more so now.

650
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,920
So I think at the end of the day, the takeaway from the story is Zeus is in a better spot

651
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,780
than they have been in a long time.

652
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,900
They're independent again and they've got the deep pockets of EQT should they need it.

653
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,440
That's actually a pretty competitive spot for them to be in.

654
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,440
I wonder how how Zeus being passed around like that has affected their community and

655
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
their community involvement.

656
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,720
I mean, if you look at, say, the community around Ubuntu or something like that, or even

657
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,560
the Red Hat Centaur community, it just seems more vibrant, maybe.

658
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,560
I do agree.

659
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
It seems larger.

660
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:43,080
However, I feel like open Sousa being its own separate thing has insulated a lot of

661
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:50,200
the enthusiast community from these changes at Sousa, like as an open Sousa user.

662
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,520
It's almost always been sort of the footnote of all of these stories.

663
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,600
Oh, by the way, if you use open Sousa, this doesn't affect you like that's been the footnote

664
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,400
for all of these purchases so far.

665
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,600
And in a way, that's sort of been like a buffer between all of the corporate shenanigans

666
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,920
and the end enthusiast users who are using the distribution.

667
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,760
I think it's I mean, you're right.

668
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,380
It is hard to say if there's been a cost and their community doesn't seem to be as large

669
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:20,680
as some of the other distributions, but it's still a pretty large, healthy community overall

670
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:27,440
and taken in totality, and it's survived a lot of change of hands, which is kind of impressive.

671
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,120
Oh, yeah, absolutely impressive that they're able to forge along, you know, with I wouldn't

672
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:40,640
I wouldn't say that it's turmoil, but I remember way back in 2004, whenever the first acquisition

673
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,680
happened and thinking that was going to be a real growing point for them.

674
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,960
Their marketing is wonderful.

675
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,160
They do their but sometimes I'm curious if that marketing is directed where it should

676
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
be.

677
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,600
You mean YouTube videos instead of something more directly beneficial and contributing

678
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
to the community?

679
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,720
Yeah, I mean, given given a little something more back to the community, if you're going

680
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,120
to spend that kind of money, I think it could better be better spent on other things, other

681
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:15,280
projects and just opening up and accepting it with open arms, the community and what

682
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,800
what they want to see.

683
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
People do love them, though.

684
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,360
They love those videos.

685
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,720
I want to just I didn't do it earlier.

686
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,000
I want to mention we've got Brent in the virtual lug today, Bruce Cheese, who you're just hearing

687
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,840
from Els in their mini mech and Thor Thor Hop.

688
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Hello, Mr. Thor.

689
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,440
Nice to have you join us.

690
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
That's that's new.

691
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,360
I think we've had Thor in there before.

692
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:43,400
And Cheese is hard at work right now on refreshing the look of our logos for the shows.

693
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,720
And man, I am so excited by this process, Wes.

694
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
It's awesome.

695
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720
Yeah.

696
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Yeah.

697
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
And I don't know, man.

698
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
I just cheese.

699
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,840
I just we're not going to we're not going to say much yet because it's still early days.

700
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,320
It's yeah, we don't want to spoil nothing.

701
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,440
But we've got we got a new fresh look that cheese is hard at work on right now.

702
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,760
And we've had some great, great input from the Linux Academy design team, too.

703
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,640
And I'm just really happy with the way things are going.

704
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,760
And if this is a big if but if everything kind of syncs up and lines up, our current

705
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,440
plans and intentions are to reveal the new look, the new logos, new swag at Linux Fest

706
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,960
Northwest this year.

707
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,840
Yeah, that deserves a bell.

708
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,780
It's a big undertaking.

709
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,660
There's a lot of work that's already been done.

710
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,920
There's a lot of work that's still going into it.

711
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,280
And just the scope and scale of this is a I think is pretty dramatic.

712
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,560
Yeah, it's every show.

713
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,140
Plus all the different iterations you have for social media and for the websites and

714
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,260
for the MP3 badges and all these.

715
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,480
There's hundreds of different ways we use the logo that people don't even really realize

716
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,240
because, you know, just all part of what we do.

717
00:36:53,240 --> 00:37:00,720
And I so many, so many times have I wished we've had the resources to clean these up

718
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,200
and update them over the years.

719
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,820
So just super excited to have a here cheese working on that.

720
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,480
So I know we can't say much because it's early days.

721
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Yeah, I will say that I think people will enjoy a kind of unified look.

722
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
Mm hmm.

723
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,680
Yeah, there'll be some familiarity, but it'll be a nice, clean, unified look across everything.

724
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,240
Just like our new friends over at the Mate desktop, version 1.2.0 is out this week.

725
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,840
There's the new mate panel with a crazy ton of rework, especially for Wayland support.

726
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:37,200
And the number one, absolutely no doubt about it, most important feature, Wanda the fish

727
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,120
has now been updated to work properly on high DPI displays.

728
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
It's about time.

729
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
I know.

730
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
And never fear, Wes.

731
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,800
It's still pixelated on purpose because Wanda the fish is supposed to be pixelated.

732
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,640
I actually don't know who Wanda is.

733
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
I haven't met Wanda yet.

734
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
Could someone?

735
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,840
You got to go Google Wanda the fish.

736
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
You got to do it.

737
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,200
Yeah, it's a it's maybe one of the the best panel plugins, extensions, whatever you want

738
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,000
to call it ever.

739
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,280
So you know, Nome extensions really have a legacy going back to Nome too, where you could

740
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,800
put these little applets up in the up in the toolbar, little eyes to follow your mouse

741
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
around, whatever.

742
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Yep.

743
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,920
X eyes was another one.

744
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,480
And so Wanda the fish, you could go and you go search for one of the fish, Nome or Mate,

745
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,840
and you'll see what I'm talking about.

746
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,360
I don't know why anybody wants to spend CPU cycles on something like that.

747
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,400
And yet at the same time, I love that it's let's see, it's not the first feature, but

748
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,000
it is one to it's the fourth feature they list.

749
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
This is what I noticed.

750
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,480
All the most important stuff is buried at the bottom.

751
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,760
Things like improving stability by closing memory leaks and fixing build warnings, removing

752
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,480
deprecated code, a whole bunch of updated documentation.

753
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,440
And they put in a bunch of work to get their CI better, having clean builds on major distros.

754
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
That's huge.

755
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
And it's at the bottom.

756
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,240
I know, like that's going to improve every future release from here on out.

757
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,560
Like that's how big that feature is.

758
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
But it's on the bottom.

759
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,680
But one to the fish at the top, man.

760
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,200
And it's below the calculator now supports 15 characters of accuracy, which is great.

761
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,000
And I like that a lot personally.

762
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But reorder that.

763
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah.

764
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah.

765
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,480
It is nice to see that GTK cleanup and that Wayland support coming along.

766
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:25,000
There's something that just tickles me about this classic old style interface paradigm

767
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,600
that is modern, high DPI, GTK three, ready to go, running on Wayland.

768
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,200
Like it just tickles me.

769
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,280
It just really does.

770
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,880
I want to mention a story that's a little frustrating right now.

771
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,680
And this is our one of our last ones for the week.

772
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,160
And it's KD Connect.

773
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,280
Just such a great tool.

774
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,640
I've met Albert.

775
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,480
He is a fantastic, talented developer.

776
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,880
And he tweeted today that Google has yanked KD Connect, the Android side that you need

777
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,040
to connect to your plasma desktop.

778
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,640
They've yanked it from the Play Store on grounds of violation of a new policy for apps that

779
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,120
access your SMS.

780
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:14,320
Now this policy does have an explicit exception for companion apps like many others.

781
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,880
But KD Connect, for whatever reason, was not granted that explicit permission.

782
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,040
Now those scammer apps that are stealing your SMS contacts and uploading those to Chinese

783
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,560
servers, still good to go.

784
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,600
It has been resubmitted to the Play Store, right?

785
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,960
Yeah, I believe so.

786
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,400
It's just so frustrating though, because this is one of my favorite applications.

787
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,200
And I am one of the things I am the first thing to install whenever I reinstall my Android

788
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
phone.

789
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Yeah, and it had to get resubmitted without the SMS reading support.

790
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Yeah, that's it.

791
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,140
They don't have that capability anymore, which I have other means around that, but is kind

792
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,780
of one of the price features of the application, at least for users still stuck on SMS.

793
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:57,020
It's an obvious, obvious sort of failure on the Play Store side, because this app has

794
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,920
legitimate use for this data, and it's been using something that has been allowed up until

795
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,920
this point.

796
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,080
And then where it really falls down, though, is there's really no humans he can talk to.

797
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,520
Yeah, and I think as Brent points out, and he can chime in more, but there are competitive

798
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
marketplaces.

799
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,160
So if the Play Store wants to be seen as a place to get safe, legitimate software, they're

800
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
doing exactly all the wrong things.

801
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,440
So maybe we should be using F-Droid.

802
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Yeah.

803
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
That's probably it, right, Brent?

804
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,760
I mean, this is the opportunity for people to try something different.

805
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
Yeah, so true.

806
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,000
I've been using F-Droid for a few years, just as it started out as a bit of an experiment,

807
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,200
just to see, oh, what's in there?

808
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,720
But it's really come into its own in the last year.

809
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,280
So I use it exclusively, actually.

810
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,040
I just checked my phone since the intro where you mentioned KD Connect, and almost all of

811
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,520
the apps I use daily are from F-Droid.

812
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,040
And so if anybody doesn't know about F-Droid, it's just basically a repository for open

813
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,600
source focused apps that you can get on Android.

814
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,920
So you don't need any crazy logins or permissions to install it.

815
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,360
You can go get it at f-droid.org.

816
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,040
But for KD Connect, it's on there.

817
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,920
They're updating it all the time.

818
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,440
And I was really sad to hear what the news was here on KD Connect, but to hear from me

819
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,920
at least that it was pulled from the Play Store doesn't really affect me any.

820
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,280
So I'd encourage anybody who is interested in Linux Unplugged, they'd probably love F-Droid

821
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
if you're not in it already.

822
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,440
Yeah, you could always use both too.

823
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,600
They're not mutually exclusive either.

824
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,840
So if there's some things in the Play Store, you could still do that.

825
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,760
Or you might be able to get rid of the Play Store depending on what you really need and

826
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
just stick with F-Droid.

827
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,280
Is that what you do or are you mixing it up, Brent?

828
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,920
Well, I've been mixing it up now because I have thought that I needed to.

829
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,080
And one of the last apps that I thought I needed to do that with was Signal Messenger,

830
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,080
which I use quite a bit, which I wonder if that got pulled too because it definitely

831
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,360
has access to your SMS.

832
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,880
But you mentioned there were some exclusions.

833
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,660
But I noticed that that was the last app and you can just get it from their own website.

834
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:03,840
So I just checked and none of the Play Store apps I'm actually using on a daily basis.

835
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,760
It's mostly the Cruft that comes with the phone.

836
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,240
So I would say I'd be totally fine with running F-Droid 100% of the time now.

837
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,480
There's been a huge increase in the amount of usable apps in there and the quality of

838
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,480
them.

839
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,480
So it's been great.

840
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,480
That's nice.

841
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,320
That's really good to hear because it's probably been a year since I've checked it out.

842
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:26,160
So I think I will load it up on my Pixel and I will give it another go because I'm a big,

843
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
big fan of KDE Connect.

844
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,320
And I think this is the killer app right there to really make me give it another try.

845
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,700
You might have some problems, but I'm not sure with the Nome experience.

846
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,400
But on KDE, the KDE Connect just gets better and better and better and better every single

847
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
month.

848
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
So the features are amazing.

849
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,400
There you go.

850
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,600
There's your unplugged app pick again.

851
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,800
Not quite an app pick, but it is a bit of an app pick, F-Droid.

852
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,640
We're knocking out of the park, team.

853
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,000
I am really happy to see that.

854
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,440
And I hope that Google works with the KDE Connect folks.

855
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,120
The real issue is, and their main complaint has been, we just haven't been able to talk

856
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,120
to anybody.

857
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,680
We just want to explain what our version of the story is and see if you'll work with us.

858
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,600
But we don't even have that opportunity.

859
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,200
And that's the classic complaint about Google, right?

860
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,200
When their machines do it correctly, they're kind of great and streamlined.

861
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,080
But when there's any kind of kink in the system that you need a human to resolve, there are

862
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,080
no humans around.

863
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,760
I'm sure the game stream service, though, that's going to be great.

864
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,240
All right.

865
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,080
Well, I want to talk about eBPF.

866
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,940
This don't call it eBPF.

867
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,940
Just call it BPF.

868
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,380
No, it's not your Berkeley Pack of filter anymore.

869
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:37,040
It's something much, much cooler built into the Linux kernel that kernel developers and

870
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,760
performance engineers like Brandon Gregg at Netflix are absolutely excited about.

871
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,640
So just a brief moment of housekeeping.

872
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,640
There's really only one thing I want to tell you about this week, and that is Linux Fest

873
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,600
Northwest 2019 coming very soon.

874
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,400
And we've set up a telegram group.

875
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,360
Go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Linux Fest, and you can get in on our Linux Fest

876
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,360
Northwest community telegram group.

877
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:10,460
And in fact, I want to extend this invitation to even those of you who can't make it to

878
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,460
Linux Fest.

879
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:18,520
We'll likely be using this URL for Texas Linux Fest and other fests that go on around the

880
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,080
country or the world.

881
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:26,120
So I encourage you to join if you want to contribute positively to the conversation.

882
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:31,080
And the other reason is, as you heard, we're going to be updating the show logos and the

883
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,320
network logo.

884
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:37,060
So I thought one thing that might be kind of cool to do is do a big old series of giveaways

885
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:41,960
in that telegram group of the old retro sticker logos while we still got them.

886
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,560
Did you say retro swag?

887
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,560
Yeah, man.

888
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,680
Well, I mean, it's current swag now, but it's soon to be retro.

889
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,680
Yeah.

890
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,520
So we'll start doing that as Linux Fest Northwest gets closer for folks in that room.

891
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,800
And I don't know, we're kind of kicking around.

892
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,920
Like if you show up at our booth at Linux Fest and you show that you're in our telegram

893
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,920
group, maybe we might have a little something extra for you.

894
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,680
And it's not a bad place to go anyways, because that's where we coordinate things like the

895
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:13,600
parking lot barbecue, which I got to say, Wes, Emma is getting me so hyped.

896
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,760
Emma from System76 and I are chatting now like on a daily basis about like, hey, what

897
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,760
about this?

898
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,760
Hey, do you think we could do this?

899
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,200
Like today we were discussing the table situation, you know.

900
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,340
She is a great organizer and really knows how to throw a fantastic party.

901
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,760
So I'm sure it's going to be even bigger and better than last year, which was already amazing.

902
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,520
I feel like we should get her on here sometime and have her maybe a week or two before and

903
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:37,220
have her throw her hype game out there for it.

904
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,320
That is a great idea.

905
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,960
I will suggest that to her.

906
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,640
And really, I should mention, make sure on air that System76 is providing a ton of the

907
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,220
food and drink to everybody is bringing something, but they're bringing, I would say, the bulk

908
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,640
of the meat.

909
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,720
And that's not cheap.

910
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:58,200
And I just I just it's so cool because it's not necessarily like going to change a thousand

911
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:02,320
lives, but it might make, you know, maybe like, you know, 50 to 100 people really happy

912
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,900
and they're still invested in doing that.

913
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,620
And I'm that's one of the reasons I'm in L.A. right now.

914
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,840
I'm bringing the RV back up from Texas to get it up to Bellingham for Linux Fest Northwest.

915
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:18,540
So like quite literally, the wheels are in motion to make this a huge event.

916
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,880
We have all of the details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

917
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,420
That's where the barbecue meetup information is at.

918
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,300
And that telegram group, which we'll probably use for future Linux Fest, too.

919
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:33,440
But right now it's for Linux Fest Northwest, that's at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash

920
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,440
Linux Fest.

921
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,860
And that is where I'll be giving away the soon to be retro stickers.

922
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:41,340
So if you want to get in on that or maybe a little extra swag at the booth, you go get

923
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:47,040
in that telegram group, you hang out, contribute positively to the conversation and we'll all

924
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,040
have a great time.

925
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,040
All right.

926
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,040
That's it.

927
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,420
Just a real quick little short housekeeping this week, because really, I want to hear

928
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,420
about EBPF.

929
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:02,900
I'm I'm not often like starstruck when I see people, but Brandon Gregg, he's got this he's

930
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,060
got this amazing look about him.

931
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:09,260
It's he's got a coiff of hair that looks like it's always being blown in the wind.

932
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,260
But there is no wind.

933
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,700
You're like, well, how does this work?

934
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,700
Right.

935
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,700
And and what did you say, Wes?

936
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,620
Like it makes it look like he's always having a good time the way I mean, giving a talk

937
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:23,000
in at scale or, you know, fighting performance problems in production, Netflix or surfing

938
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
on a beach.

939
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,580
I imagine he looks exactly the same.

940
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,580
That's exactly it.

941
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,540
That is the perfect way to describe his look.

942
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:36,940
He's got you know, he had this great ensemble, a pink shirt, a super bright red belt and

943
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,260
some red pants and just really, really caught the eye.

944
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,700
And we talked about this a little bit last week.

945
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:50,360
He did some incredible takedowns of Minecraft performance using EBPF, which I think I'm

946
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,360
doing it a disservice.

947
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,220
So I'm about to hand it over to you, but I think maybe the closest parallel is it has

948
00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:00,020
a lot of same benefits a tool like D-Trace might have, which has a lot of hype around

949
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,020
it.

950
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,020
Yeah, exactly.

951
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,220
And it can be a little confusing because BPF is fundamentally a virtual machine.

952
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,460
It's a bytecode that runs on a virtual machine inside the kernel.

953
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,980
And so it has a huge number of use cases.

954
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:16,100
BPF is obviously Berkeley packet filter and came from the use case of filtering packets.

955
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,980
That's not what we're talking about today and not really what what Brendan's doing.

956
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,120
He's talking about tracing and one of the new tools on the block that is very similar

957
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:28,620
to D-Trace in some aspects is BPF trace, which is kind of a command line playing around handy

958
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:33,580
one line scripting utility whose command language is modeled after D-Trace.

959
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,580
It kind of looks like awk.

960
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:38,260
So you might be wondering, OK, what does BPF trace do?

961
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:42,700
Well, it allows you to write small programs that execute whenever an event occurs.

962
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,700
All right.

963
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,220
That's not that's not really a useful explanation.

964
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,220
I know.

965
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,220
What's an event?

966
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,260
Is it a system call, a function call or even something that happens inside a function call

967
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:55,780
like 50 milliseconds has elapsed since the last time something happened or a page fault

968
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,660
occurred?

969
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,460
Once you get an event, this tooling lets you do something right like log something, compile

970
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:05,500
statistics about what's happening and you have access to interesting information here

971
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:10,380
like the PID, stack trace, time, all the arguments on the call stack, the return value, all these

972
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,860
many little details that you might want to understand how your program is really running.

973
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:20,700
Now do I get those details because the BPF virtual machine is living in the kernel so

974
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:26,420
it it can learn what the kernel knows or I guess all of that sounds good.

975
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,380
But why being a virtual machine in the kernel, why is that the important part?

976
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,380
We're going to get into that.

977
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,020
And basically it's it's for performance reasons because you don't have to incur a context

978
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:38,580
switch or try to go dump a bunch of data from kernel memory into user space.

979
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,340
Instead, you can compile statistics inside the kernel.

980
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:45,900
Once you've computed those, just do one copy at the end of the final computed value instead

981
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,540
of having to share all the intermediate data, which as Brendan will talk about, sometimes

982
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,320
that can be like gigabytes a second.

983
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,780
We should also note here that we're talking about cool tools that you can use now and

984
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,460
that is one of the big takeaways is that this stuff is has been around for a little while,

985
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,460
but it's matured.

986
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:05,100
And finally, most distros are going to have kernels and and possibly even packages for

987
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,180
you to use.

988
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,860
So these tools exist.

989
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,980
But to really understand some of the motivation and background, I thought we should talk about

990
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,900
the history and we can't not talk about detrace.

991
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,540
I mean, you already brought it up, Chris.

992
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:22,860
And detrace is a full system dynamic tracing framework originally developed by Sun.

993
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,820
And dynamic tracing is all those things we've just talked about.

994
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:28,780
And then the dynamic part is usually you don't have to recompile, right?

995
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:33,340
You don't have to have worked with the developers to go pick points that you want to specifically

996
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,340
trace.

997
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,860
On the fly, you can add new trace points so that you can understand what's actually happening

998
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,500
on your production systems.

999
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,980
And this is a huge capability and Linux hasn't had it.

1000
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,980
Yeah.

1001
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,420
And this is critical for very high performance workloads where you need to understand what

1002
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,500
components are getting slowed down at what times and what is the root cause.

1003
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:58,940
And imagine a Netflix scenario, for example, where you're serving up streaming video to

1004
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:07,980
millions of people, a few seconds, even a second of delay times a million is unacceptable.

1005
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:13,860
And so the requirements and the pressure for extremely high performance applications sort

1006
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,700
of necessitate this tracing ability where it is exactly what the word implies.

1007
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:23,460
You can trace the steps that the application went through, what resources it accessed and

1008
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:28,940
use that to sort of walk back a story of what it was doing and where it slowed down.

1009
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,460
Now you may wonder, okay, detrace was actually put under, relicensed under the GPL just last

1010
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,620
year in 2018.

1011
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,620
Shouldn't we just be using that?

1012
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,880
Why is Linux reinventing the wheel here?

1013
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,420
But as you'll see, eBBF is nice, both because it has a, you know, this general virtual machine

1014
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,060
that is already used for other features in the kernel, and so is a simplification and

1015
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,000
a unification of code paths in that way.

1016
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,500
But also, in some ways, it's more powerful.

1017
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,280
Before we get into that, though, let's try to sympathize because for a long time, Brendan

1018
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,660
was the expert on detrace, right?

1019
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:02,300
He made all kinds of great tooling around it, spent a lot of time working at Sun on

1020
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,040
these systems.

1021
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,660
And then he went to work at Netflix on Linux, where he didn't have any of these tooling.

1022
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:14,840
In fact, I think he was a bit of I don't think a Linux new, but it wasn't his daily driver.

1023
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,040
And he, like you said, is a big fan of detrace.

1024
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,120
And the reason why I want to underscore that is detrace has become one of those projects

1025
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,760
that has its fans.

1026
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,000
And it becomes a holy war when you start talking about different methods of tracing.

1027
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,240
And if it's not detrace, it's garbage to some people.

1028
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,720
And I'm not saying Brandon was one of those types of characters, but he was familiar with

1029
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,720
that camp.

1030
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,840
And he was kind of a detrace fan.

1031
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,280
And to see him make this move and appreciate what BPF can do and how you can use it.

1032
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:50,380
Not only is that fascinating, but the journey of joining Netflix that got him here is also

1033
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,380
an incredible story.

1034
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,380
Yeah.

1035
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,380
Let's let him tell a little bit more of it.

1036
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,380
OK.

1037
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,380
Thanks for choosing this talk.

1038
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,380
My name is Brendan Gregg.

1039
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,000
I am a senior performance architect at Netflix.

1040
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,360
And as of tomorrow, I'll have been at Netflix for five years.

1041
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,360
Time flies.

1042
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:09,080
That means I'll have worked on Linux full time for five years.

1043
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:16,100
When I came to Netflix, I was a detrace expert and performance analyst.

1044
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:21,800
And coming to work on Linux full time, I knew that I would have a challenge of lacking all

1045
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,360
of the tools that I created.

1046
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:29,560
But I knew this challenge would also motivate me to find out new ways to accomplish things.

1047
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,560
And I discovered early on that Linux had ftrace.

1048
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,000
And so early on at Netflix, I created a suite of tools called perf tools that were based

1049
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,280
on ftrace.

1050
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,360
And they let me solve a lot of problems.

1051
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:48,440
I also met Alexei Storyatov, who was working on a new virtual machine for the kernel called

1052
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,440
eBPF.

1053
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,200
And I saw how that could be used to do more programmatic things.

1054
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,160
And so I've also created a lot of tools using eBPF.

1055
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,320
And that's the thing is he's just trying to pick up whatever framework comes along that

1056
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:05,120
can actually help him solve his real world problems on whatever operating system he happens

1057
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,200
to be using.

1058
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,200
Very pragmatic.

1059
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,960
The nice part here, too, is that it's kind of been around long enough that it's easy

1060
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,000
to access.

1061
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,440
And he was working on that problem right at scale.

1062
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:22,200
And so now five years on at Netflix, I can finally do what I want to get done in production

1063
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,760
using all of these new tools.

1064
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,040
It's really amazing and exciting.

1065
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:31,920
And also we're at the point with these technologies where early on we made sure they got into

1066
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,040
the kernel because that takes a long time to propagate.

1067
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,200
And now we're getting them packaged.

1068
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,560
And so I was swapping emails with Canonical yesterday to make sure the bpftrace package

1069
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:47,520
appears for the Ubuntu distributions, which would be really awesome.

1070
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,680
They've already created a snap for it.

1071
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,560
And we have BCC, which is the other front end, has been packaged.

1072
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:59,280
So we're at the point where these superpowers, you can use them for analysis just by doing

1073
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,960
a package add to a system.

1074
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,320
I like that point because he's trying to underscore that they are here or they're coming, really

1075
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,320
they're here.

1076
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,320
You have these tools.

1077
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,320
You can download scripts.

1078
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,480
You can install packages.

1079
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:16,880
I do note there that he's using package add, which is the FreeBSD command.

1080
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,240
But really the point is this is stuff you should learn.

1081
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,240
You don't have to be a programmer.

1082
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,040
You don't have to be able to write really complicated scripts because a lot of this

1083
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,480
stuff is prepackaged for you.

1084
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,520
So let's learn more about what it can do.

1085
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,640
Enhanced BPF, also known as just BPF, can do lots of things.

1086
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,760
It's kind of crazy to explain.

1087
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:41,240
It began life by a company called Plumgrid that were doing it for software-defined networking.

1088
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,220
And Alexei Sotoyov came up with it.

1089
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:49,400
And that was so that it could handle packets and then you could define some sort of proxy

1090
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,800
or router or whatever you want in software and it would handle it.

1091
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,800
This is really good.

1092
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,960
This is really good for us because packets can be very frequent.

1093
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,280
Packets themselves can be millions of times a second.

1094
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:05,520
So since this was designed from the beginning to handle very high packet or very high event

1095
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,120
rates, it means it's been optimized.

1096
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,340
And so we can use it for things like off-CPU analysis and schedule analysis.

1097
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,200
It's been used for lots of other things as well.

1098
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,000
Denial of service mitigation, intrusion detection, container security, observability, what I

1099
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,160
do, BP filter, even device drivers.

1100
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,520
There was an infrared device driver written in BPF.

1101
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,000
I mean, yeah, you can just use it for basically everything.

1102
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,440
And that means people have been speculating it might be taking over the kernel.

1103
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,480
There's been a number of discussions about BPF taking over everything to the point where

1104
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:43,080
it seems that the ability to write a user-defined program and have the kernel run it and that

1105
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:48,360
user-defined program to have more and more capabilities sounds a lot like a microkernel.

1106
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:53,000
So microkernels is where you write stuff in user space and you have a minimal kernel that

1107
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,160
runs it.

1108
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,240
And so it's a little bit scary to think about microkernels and Linux.

1109
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,160
But anyway, I think it was Jonathan Corbett who first came up with that realization that

1110
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,440
we're heading towards a microkernel.

1111
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,000
I want to underscore here too, there is a step where there's an analyzer that takes

1112
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,200
the BPF program and the BPF bytecode itself has some nice properties like there are no

1113
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,200
loops.

1114
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,560
So in some ways you can guarantee that it will halt.

1115
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,160
So there are some safety checks.

1116
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,240
And because there are disparate systems in the kernel using this stuff, I know that the

1117
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,160
a lot of eyes thing is often a fallacy, but it's true, this is just being tested a lot

1118
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,960
and it means we're not having disparate code paths that are all doing slightly different

1119
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,960
things.

1120
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,500
They can all be tested in one unified architecture.

1121
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,780
The other thing I think that we should make clear and I didn't really realize is what's

1122
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:37,780
with the name?

1123
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,140
Because we're not, maybe we're doing a couple of stuff.

1124
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,600
There are networking applications, but that's not really what we're talking about.

1125
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,660
So why are we still calling it Berkeley packet filter?

1126
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:52,120
So the question was last year we wanted to change the name of BPF because BPF is kind

1127
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,120
of a terrible name.

1128
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,360
BPF, maybe I should have said it, it stands for Berkeley Packet Filter, but nowadays what

1129
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,200
we're doing has nothing to do with Berkeley, little to do with packets, and little to do

1130
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,600
with filtering.

1131
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:11,880
And so a better name would be something like Virtual Kernel Instruction Set, VKIS, a virtual

1132
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:17,000
machine, anyway, Alexi and I are engineers and we're terrible at naming and we couldn't

1133
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,120
come up with a better name, and Alexi has settled on BPF because he sees it as, and

1134
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:29,920
like he wants it to be BPF and not EBPF because he sees it as equivalent to x86 and ARM.

1135
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,500
Because it is, BPF is an instruction set, and so this is a virtual machine instruction

1136
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,500
set.

1137
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:38,720
So he wants it to be three letters like everything else, x86, ARM, BPF.

1138
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,000
So that's why we're stuck with BPF.

1139
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,200
All right, don't call it EBPF, it's BPF.

1140
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:49,040
I understand, you know, it is, that three letters does make all the difference.

1141
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:54,720
Okay, so that's like a little bit of practical foundation, it is this machine language.

1142
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,680
You probably don't want to write that, and it can be a little bit complicated to understand

1143
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,720
what your next steps are because there are multiple front ends.

1144
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,960
There's lots of front ends for BPF.

1145
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,760
Raw BPF is where you write instructions like this, BPF instruction level programming.

1146
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:11,080
There's some samples inside the kernel source code.

1147
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,560
I think very few people are ever going to need to do this.

1148
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,640
It's really hard.

1149
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,880
There's also, if you look in the kernel source code, there's C examples as well, which is

1150
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,240
a little bit higher level.

1151
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,020
But we've spent years trying to make it even easier.

1152
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:32,800
So we've come up with a BCC front end, which has a Python interface, a C++ interface, and

1153
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,640
a Lua interface so far.

1154
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:40,000
And I imagine people are going to add other interfaces to BCC as well, other languages.

1155
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,960
And so that lets you define your kernel program in C, and then the front end that manages

1156
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,040
it in Python or whatever that is.

1157
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,040
And that's really pretty handy.

1158
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:52,160
He'll talk about this a little bit more, but it means you can have one part of your program

1159
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,080
actually do all the complicated little BPF stuff, and then rely on nice high level Python

1160
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:01,300
libraries to do, if you're writing in a REST API on top of this monitoring tool, whatever

1161
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,960
you might be working on.

1162
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,320
That is what we should contrast with BPF trace, which is what we started talking about.

1163
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,260
And that is not really for standalone tools.

1164
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,000
It's for one-off scripting and exploration.

1165
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,400
And there's another front end called BPF trace, which I was working on a lot last year.

1166
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,440
BPF trace is good for powerful one-liners and custom scripts.

1167
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:29,480
And so with BPF trace, I can say, BPF trace, T is for trace point, syscall, sysenter open,

1168
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:37,640
print out the file name, or do a histogram of the read size distribution by process.

1169
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:40,480
And that sounds actually pretty darn handy.

1170
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,880
You do need to know how to do that.

1171
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,400
Thankfully, there's extensive documentation.

1172
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,420
And maybe this is a good point to underscore.

1173
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:50,840
This kind of tracing is kind of opening up new bounds, stuff that we haven't really seen

1174
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,280
before, not just in Linux, but anywhere.

1175
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:59,040
If you're solving new things, off-CPU analysis was this cool thing we really wanted to do,

1176
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,760
but it was so prohibitive to trace scheduler events.

1177
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,520
Now BPF is letting us do it.

1178
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:09,640
Another thing it's letting us do is I can save stack traces when a thread blocks.

1179
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:15,600
I can save stack traces when a wake-up event happens, and I can associate wake-up stack

1180
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,920
traces with block stack traces.

1181
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,200
So I can take that off-CPU time example further with Minecraft, because sometimes when you're

1182
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,520
looking at a lock and you're saying, I'm blocked on this lock, your next question is, well,

1183
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:27,520
why?

1184
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,880
Why was I blocked for 10 milliseconds on this lock?

1185
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,400
Who was holding the lock for 10 milliseconds?

1186
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,680
I need to know them.

1187
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:39,640
Well, you can know them if you trace the wake-up events.

1188
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,680
So the kernel has to manage this.

1189
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,680
The kernel has to...

1190
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,680
So a thread releases a lock.

1191
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,160
The kernel then does a wake-up from that thread to the blocked thread.

1192
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,400
So you grab the stack trace there and you associate it here.

1193
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,360
Doing that association was something we've never done before in kernel context.

1194
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,000
Dtrace could not do it, but it's something that BPF can do.

1195
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,640
So you can kind of see why he's excited.

1196
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,480
This is genuinely neat stuff.

1197
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:06,120
I like that example because some of the, like, technicalities of the various kprobes and

1198
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,880
kernel fixtures that you're attaching to may be beyond a lot of people, but trying to understand

1199
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,120
what other part of the system is in contention with you or hogging resources, I think we've

1200
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,480
all been trying to diagnose those problems.

1201
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:21,160
But okay, maybe you don't want to write BPF trace scripts or anything.

1202
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,360
Is this still applicable and useful?

1203
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,880
And I got to say, yes, a lot of these, you can just run on the command line and they

1204
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,540
will tell you stuff about your system that you might want to know.

1205
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,720
And you're already installing debugging tools, right?

1206
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,040
People are installing stuff to monitor what network connections are happening, stuff to

1207
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,680
monitor what disk space is using or watching IO latency.

1208
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,940
These are some of the best tools, especially for end users.

1209
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:47,000
If you're an end user, the BCC repository has lots of canned tools so you can just use

1210
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
them straight away.

1211
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,840
I only demoed two so far, profile and off CPU time.

1212
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,200
But there's lots.

1213
01:03:54,200 --> 01:04:00,300
The tools have man pages, example files, documentation, and usually you can get BCC on a system nowadays

1214
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:02,640
just by doing apt-get install or yum install.

1215
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,480
Which, I mean, is super easy.

1216
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,600
And clearly he's used, you know, Linux a little bit there.

1217
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,360
Yeah, there was no doubt.

1218
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,740
Actually watching him work, it was pretty clear he knew exactly what he was doing.

1219
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:17,000
And even if, you know, so in this case, in this example, right, he was showing Minecraft,

1220
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,780
but you know, in his day job, of course, it's this massive, massive scale stuff.

1221
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:25,880
And so it's fascinating that they've created something that a very, very small portion

1222
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:31,000
of people could write direct bytecode for all the way up to abstracted layers with tools

1223
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,880
that anybody can just pass some flags to.

1224
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,620
And it does all of the hard BPF interfacing for you.

1225
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:38,620
It's a whole range.

1226
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:39,620
Yeah.

1227
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:40,620
And the tools aren't hard to use.

1228
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,560
One of them is bio latency.

1229
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:47,400
As an example, just to have one in the slides, this is a BCC tool called bio latency.

1230
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,480
It's showing the disk IL latency as a histogram.

1231
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,520
It's efficient.

1232
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:57,140
So the count column is what's maintained in kernel context.

1233
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:01,920
And it just copies the count column to user space and user space prints this out.

1234
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,920
Prior implementations, I had to dump out every disk event and post process and user space

1235
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:06,920
and that's too expensive.

1236
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,700
So you can actually just get a really nice histogram right in your terminal, install

1237
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:15,600
it from your package repo, and you can see a histogram of block latency.

1238
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:20,180
Or another cool example is using and monitoring whatever people are typing into the read line

1239
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:21,400
library.

1240
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,520
Let's hear about OpenSnoop, which is also really cool.

1241
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:27,160
If you want to go see whatever TCP connections are happening on your system, well, there's

1242
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:28,160
OpenSnoop.

1243
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,720
OpenSnoop shows all the files that are open.

1244
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:38,860
In fact, it's great for locating config files and log files and things that can help you

1245
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,520
troubleshoot or debug software.

1246
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,520
Yeah.

1247
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,640
So maybe you're running some new software you've never run before and you're trying

1248
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,000
to wonder, where are the configuration files?

1249
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,480
What files are touching or modifying on my system?

1250
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,540
OpenSnoop tells you in real time.

1251
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:53,280
That's another sneaky app pick right there for the episode.

1252
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,760
OpenSnoop is another great tool that people should go grab.

1253
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,760
Yeah.

1254
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,560
Another one right there with it is ExecSnoop, which is the same thing, but you can watch

1255
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:03,400
as users on your system are running applications.

1256
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,640
You can just watch whatever they're executing.

1257
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,880
ExecSnoop tells me what's happening when Minecraft starts up.

1258
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,600
I can say, okay, so that ran, and then it ran this thing, and then it ran these other

1259
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,600
things.

1260
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,800
Oh, he just has the best presentation style, right?

1261
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,760
I love listening to Brendan Craig.

1262
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,520
There were so many cool tools, Wes, that he covered during this talk.

1263
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,800
Like a couple of times I leaned over to you and I'm like, man, we got to tell people about

1264
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,800
this.

1265
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,800
Oh my gosh.

1266
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,800
Yes.

1267
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,800
Right?

1268
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:30,800
There's just so many that you might want to use.

1269
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,720
EXT4 slower comes to mind, which is where you can just go watch slow EXT4 stuff.

1270
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:37,720
You can actually debug the file system separate from how it's interacting with the block device.

1271
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:42,120
You can actually isolate where the part of the problem on your system is.

1272
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:46,920
You can also instrument things like TCP open or close calls so you can understand them.

1273
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,760
Now unfortunately there are some gaps.

1274
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:54,440
You may notice that there's no UDP commands here, but this is all a project run under

1275
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,160
the IO visor name.

1276
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:59,360
That's a bit weird, but it's actually under, you never would have guessed it, Chris, the

1277
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,760
Linux Foundation.

1278
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,600
And that's where BCC lives.

1279
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,000
That's where all these cool tools are.

1280
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,920
You can just install them, start playing with them.

1281
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:10,880
We'll have linked in the show notes this great graphic that just sort of instruments the

1282
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,200
stack and tells you here's how you do application level debugging.

1283
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,760
There's one to go look for slow MySQL queries.

1284
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,760
Just build right in.

1285
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,920
You don't have to do anything to specially tune it.

1286
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,260
Just run that command.

1287
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:23,720
So it's super easy to find and play with.

1288
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:27,580
And really the reason I wanted to talk about this today is because this is new technology.

1289
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:31,720
And I think Brendan says it best, but we should all be sharing the cool stuff you can do with

1290
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,720
it.

1291
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,720
So takeaways.

1292
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:37,160
You can really explore systems in powerful, new and custom ways.

1293
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:42,560
You can also contribute and also please, if you can share war stories and blog posts and

1294
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,840
give talks about these tools, it's a lot of new stuff.

1295
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:52,640
And if you come up with a cool usage, it's going to help the BPF community to share it.

1296
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,760
We are finally living in the world that we've all really wanted, where we have a functional

1297
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,960
D trace for Linux or something even better.

1298
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,120
And the future is probably going to be GUIs and other tools, but it's not going to get

1299
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,080
there unless we build it.

1300
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:10,900
Yeah, I think that's the important thing for people listening to keep in mind is if you're

1301
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:15,200
an expert at this kind of stuff, it's totally ready for you to jump in right now.

1302
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:20,520
But in a year or two, Brandon thinks that we'll probably see graphical applications

1303
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:25,140
where you check a few boxes, click a few buttons and run it against the application.

1304
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:31,080
And it does a lot of this deep analysis for you in a very consumable way in a graphical

1305
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,080
session.

1306
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,280
And we're not there yet, but those tools are likely coming.

1307
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:40,040
And it's kind of exciting because this is a major new feature that's been retrofitted

1308
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,840
into our lovable Linux operating system.

1309
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:43,840
Yeah, really.

1310
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,640
I mean, eBPF is here to stay.

1311
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,640
Start playing with it.

1312
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,400
You can use it for all kinds of better ways to understand your system.

1313
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,180
And in the future, hey, it might just replace your firewall.

1314
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:55,360
But that is for another show.

1315
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,120
And a big thank you to Brandon for giving that talk.

1316
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,240
And he kind of inspired us, you know, at the end there and he was like, spread the word

1317
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,240
about this stuff.

1318
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,080
This is really cool things that we can do now.

1319
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:08,400
And it's a challenging topic sometimes to talk about because it's not necessarily applicable

1320
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,640
to everybody's day to day life.

1321
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,600
And it's a slightly technical thing.

1322
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,680
But at the same time, it's a massive kick ass feature that our favorite operating system

1323
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,680
now has.

1324
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,360
And it is worth spreading the word on that stuff.

1325
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:22,360
So thank you for grabbing those clips, Wes.

1326
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,360
All right.

1327
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,920
Well, we do have to kind of wrap it up there.

1328
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,100
We could keep going all day.

1329
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:31,040
But at some point, I do have to hit the road and keep on moving on because I got to get

1330
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,040
back up to that studio.

1331
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,600
There's nothing like hanging out in the studio with Wes.

1332
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,600
I think we've learned it's not safe for you to stay in one place for too long.

1333
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,800
You know what's funny too, man?

1334
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:47,120
You think about it is I drive around with a live tracker in my RV posted at jupyterbroadcasting.com

1335
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,460
slash rover.

1336
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:52,460
And I have never had a problem from an audience member.

1337
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,860
It's never been an issue.

1338
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:57,760
The people that I had issues with probably had they would have no idea that I had a tracker

1339
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,760
in there.

1340
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,520
Although if they had stolen the RV, oh, that would have been pretty handy.

1341
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:06,440
We would have known where they take the thing is, too, is I've got two different trackers

1342
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,440
in this RV.

1343
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,760
So even if you saw the visible one, there's a hidden tracker as well.

1344
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,920
So we totally would be able to find it.

1345
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,400
And that would have been a hell of a story.

1346
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,400
I just not one I want to share.

1347
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,680
I'm glad it didn't go that way.

1348
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,120
Hey, go check out Wes on TechSnap.

1349
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:26,680
They just did a killer episode on machine learning and the ethics of AI.

1350
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:30,320
I learned so much from that episode TechSnap.Systems.

1351
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,320
Go check it out.

1352
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,560
He's at Wes Payne.

1353
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,420
I'm at Chris LAS.

1354
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:40,260
And if you're craving more Linux news, go check out LinuxActionNews.com a weekly Linux

1355
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:48,720
snoop news podcast between Joe and I about 30 minutes every week, but the most important

1356
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:54,240
thing you could do is join us live on a Tuesday over at jblive.tv.

1357
01:10:54,240 --> 01:11:11,680
See you next Tuesday.

1358
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,600
??

1359
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,600
??

1360
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,600
?

1361
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,600
??

1362
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,600
??

1363
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,600
?

1364
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,600
?

1365
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:37,680
You know, I didn't, uh, I didn't think about doing this in the main show.

1366
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,120
Well, I kind of thought about it, but, Wes, I've decided.

1367
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,700
I've decided to out you in the post show.

1368
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,740
Ladies and gentlemen, it has come to my attention.

1369
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:47,740
The Mr.

1370
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:51,060
Wes Payne has gotten hooked on the disco dingo Sauce.

1371
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,920
Well, let's do it.

1372
01:11:52,920 --> 01:12:09,680
So what do you think so far, Wes, of the old 1904 beta?

1373
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,280
Or I guess I'm not even sure if it's beta yet, you maniac.

1374
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:16,360
I mean, I did grab it from the dailies, so I don't think so.

1375
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,360
That's what you gotta do.

1376
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,360
You gotta do that.

1377
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,360
It is what you gotta do.

1378
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,360
Honestly, it's been a lot of fun.

1379
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:25,400
I kept talking about it on that there Linux Action News program that I enjoy so much.

1380
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:30,080
And I was like, okay, well, I know Chris, and I know what he's been through with Gnome.

1381
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:35,420
So if he's talking about this, and then you mentioned some other stuff about disco.

1382
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:37,560
So I was like, that's gonna be what I'm gonna run.

1383
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,720
I was really happy.

1384
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:43,440
Honestly, Neon's been working just fine for me, almost no issues, super rock solid, wasn't

1385
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,440
in a hurry.

1386
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,560
I mean, I've got other partitions for trying stuff out.

1387
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,160
I wasn't in a hurry to repave there.

1388
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,040
Gnome about disco, though, it's getting me in that fever.

1389
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:55,880
I don't think I'll wipe it just yet, but I have been spending almost all my time on the

1390
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,880
live install.

1391
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,880
Yeah.

1392
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:58,880
Huh.

1393
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,560
You know, I'll tell you, the reason what's really drawn me in, and I don't know how long

1394
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,560
this is gonna last.

1395
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:07,920
So this is kind of an interesting experiment, in a sense, is it's not often, it's not very

1396
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:13,720
often that you install something, and it is perceptibly much faster.

1397
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:14,720
That's what struck me.

1398
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,720
I just was like, this is super pleasant, and I could stay here.

1399
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,720
Yeah.

1400
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,720
That's fun.

1401
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:24,640
And, you know, often you'll get that with just a fresh install, but I have installed

1402
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:29,960
Gnome a few times, and I'm familiar with what a fresh Gnome Shell install is like.

1403
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:30,960
And this is different.

1404
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,400
This is a totally different beast.

1405
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,880
Rawhide's version's great, too.

1406
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,480
It really is, but Disco Dingo just seems like perhaps they're a little bit further along

1407
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,760
in their implementation and a little more thoughtful.

1408
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,760
And you know what?

1409
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,040
I gotta say, like, credit where credit is due.

1410
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:48,280
The Fedora camp and the Red Hat team has plugged away on Gnome Shell for a very long time.

1411
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:53,000
They've fixed some important things, but it is without a shadow of a doubt in my mind

1412
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,160
that Gnome is getting in a much, much better state now that Canonical is involved in the

1413
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,160
project.

1414
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,720
They're putting their efforts into the project, too.

1415
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:06,240
And we are seeing the collective results of more people, more talented people working

1416
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,680
on Gnome Shell, and it's just simply making it a better product.

1417
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:15,440
And man, if that's not great, and if that isn't just one of the best damn things about

1418
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:21,040
open source, because these two companies are competitors, yet they're making it a better

1419
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,040
product.

1420
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,040
Right.

1421
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,240
We can find some collaborative shared resources and infrastructure that we can all invest

1422
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,000
in and we all get to benefit.

1423
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
It's so great.

1424
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It's just so great.

1425
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,880
And, you know, and that's not to take anything away from Plasma or Mate or any other great

1426
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:35,880
desktop environment.

1427
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:39,520
No, actually, I was wanting to go play with that new Mate release, but I was like, well,

1428
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,120
I'm already kind of playing with a different desktop environment release, so maybe I'll

1429
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:45,120
wait a little bit.

1430
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,000
I've always loved Mate, too.
