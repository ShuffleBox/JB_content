1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Wes, you probably catch XKCD from time to time, but I thought this was hilarious.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,760
They have posted the perfect phone, the XKCD Phone 4.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,960
And there's a couple of things that I think are just, I don't know why they're just obvious.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,840
First of all, it has a built-in dog whistle.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,840
Yeah.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,720
It has exposed duck work on the sign that is software defined.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,080
It has a new bright glow display that incorporates genetically spliced together jellyfish protein.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,320
It integrates Siri, Cortana, Google Now, and Alexa all at once.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,320
They all respond simultaneously.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,320
Yes.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
Oh, that's great.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,520
And of course, it also has a parallel port on the bottom and 12, count them, 12 headphone

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
jacks.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,160
Now, that's your phone.

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,440
How often have you been with your 11 best friends and you want to listen to exactly

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
the same thing?

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,440
Exactly.

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
Or maybe Linux Unplugged.

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
Right?

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
Right?

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Yep.

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Boom.

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
There's your upgrade, Wes.

24
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
Just bring it to your local Lug.

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:01:06,240
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 162 for September 13th, 2016.

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,720
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's going back to school.

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
My name is Chris.

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
My name is Wes.

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Hello, Wes.

30
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
How's the install going over there?

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
Oh, it's wonderful.

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,520
I'm up and doing the show.

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
Nice.

34
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,840
Well, we got a big show for you today.

35
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,840
So buckle up, Wes.

36
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
Buckle up.

37
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,440
Coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged show, we're going to go through some breaking

38
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,320
news just as a sort of a community heads up.

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,600
We're going to talk about a drone that also doubles as an Ubuntu desktop PC.

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,640
Apparently also, speaking of Ubuntu, they're getting attacked for being copyright pirates

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
or something like that.

42
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,640
I'll tell you about it coming up in the show next.

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,960
Nextcloud's got a surprise in store.

44
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,280
We've got some really interesting open source projects we want to highlight, some updates

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,400
to cover, some digging around on getting rid of that Intel spyware, a.k.a. the management

46
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
firmware.

47
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Oh, strong words from Chris over here.

48
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
I know.

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
I know.

50
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,520
Plus, I had to fix a key ring bork this week.

51
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
I'll tell you about my key ring bork.

52
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,480
We also have jets flying overhead right now as we record the show.

53
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,520
To do great honor to Linux Unplugged.

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,120
Sending your USB devices over the network, a follow up on making Linux look a little

55
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
better.

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
We're going to talk about it in the context of the Loki review.

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
You hear that?

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
You hear that thing?

59
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Wow.

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
That's for the show.

61
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,560
So we'll talk about the state of Linux desktop customization and then we have a very important

62
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
email to get to.

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,880
We have a couple of good feedback items.

64
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,280
We're going to do something we haven't done for a while.

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
We're going to reach into my mail sack and we're going to read some really great emails.

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Yes.

67
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Some stuff that people have probably been wondering.

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,280
So we've got all of that coming up in today's show.

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
But you know what else we've got, Wes?

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,320
We've got a totally locked and loaded Mumble Room.

71
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,960
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

72
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:51,320
Hello guys, boy, it's great to hear all of you in there and welcome back to Popey's.

73
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,720
Been a long time since I've heard Popey's charming voice.

74
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
It's good to have you here.

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
You smell good, Chris.

76
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
Thank you.

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,120
It's handsome even over Mumble.

78
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,280
I know you do, Popey.

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
I don't even have to smell you to know.

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
I know.

81
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
You know what?

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
He truly is.

83
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,920
So guys, let's just sort of just as a sort of a public service announcement because there's

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,900
a lot of things we could we could start today's episode off with, but we should probably start

85
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,280
with some legitimately breaking news.

86
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,640
So there is a zero day vulnerability right now that could lead to total system compromise

87
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,920
for MySQL.

88
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,340
It came out yesterday, so it's still pretty new.

89
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,640
And I just wanted to put the word out there for any of you out there.

90
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,960
It affects, this is directly from the CVE, the vulnerability affects all MySQL servers

91
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,240
in the default configuration in all version branches being 5.7, 5.6, and 5.5, including

92
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,720
the latest versions, and could be exploited both by local and remote attackers.

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,000
That was an advisory that was published yesterday afternoon.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,600
Both the unauthenticated and authenticated access to MySQL databases are an issue.

95
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,840
So a sequel, and it's a sequel injection apparently, but I don't know the details.

96
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:03,240
It's CVE, if you want to look it up, it's CVE 2016 6662.

97
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Well said.

98
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,680
If that's not a sign, I don't know what is.

99
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,240
Anyways, so just a heads up to those of you out there that may have MySQL installed, but

100
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,940
I actually thought this would be a really fun story to start with.

101
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,400
I love this so much.

102
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,200
This makes it feel like we're in Marty McFly's future right now.

103
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,280
I might not be able to have the video wall that he had that was super cool, or the dehydrated

104
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,080
pizza refresher thing, which was amazing.

105
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,880
We could be eating pizza right now.

106
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,880
But I bet Marty didn't have a drone that also doubles as an Ubuntu PC.

107
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
I bet Marty didn't have that.

108
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
No he did not.

109
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Because we've got that.

110
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
We have that.

111
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Or we could.

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Well, that's true.

113
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,240
It's a development kit from Parrot, I think.

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Or is that how you say it?

115
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
I think so.

116
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Okay.

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
I just want to make sure I'm not making fun of him.

118
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,520
It's designed to create drones that can avoid obstacles, like the new DJI Phantom 4 that's

119
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,640
super fancy, which is, I got to tell you, somebody who's tried doing, well, we've crashed

120
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
our drone before.

121
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
Let's just put it that way.

122
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
It was awful.

123
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,160
The development kit itself doesn't have wings, and it needs to be attached to a drone and

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
a flight controller.

125
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,640
Otherwise, the kit can be used to create robots.

126
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,840
It's called Slam Dunk, and it's a fisheye camera that can capture 1500 by 1500 pixel

127
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,800
resolution images at 60 frames per second.

128
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,840
The camera allows the drone to process the images, which it will then be able to identify

129
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,240
obstacles, which is very nice, because then it can use that identification to avoid those

130
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
obstacles.

131
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,500
It also has an ultrasound sensor, a magnetrometer, and, just for Wes, a barometer.

132
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,840
They say it doesn't need GPS to operate.

133
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,360
The development kit has an HDMI port, as well as ports for keyboard and mice, which means

134
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,800
you can build a PC out of it.

135
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
There's no price yet.

136
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,400
We're going to probably get something in the fourth quarter, but just, you know, what do

137
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,200
we always hear about what makes Ubuntu work so great on the cloud?

138
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,680
What makes Ubuntu work so great on the cloud, Wes?

139
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,240
I think it's the built-in drone support.

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,640
No, I don't.

141
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
Maybe not yet.

142
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,840
I think what you often hear is, I can build in my local environment and have it run just

143
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,840
like it builds.

144
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Dev matches production.

145
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Yes.

146
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,140
So, this is the ultimate version of that, because you can make this little kit.

147
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,920
You could hook it up, a keyboard and a monitor and a mouse, and develop directly on it, and

148
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:24,960
strap it onto a drone or a robot, and this is the true 100% dev matches production kind

149
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
of scenario here.

150
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,320
Or when your friends come over and you need an extra computer, you just sit them down

151
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
by your drone.

152
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,800
It has to charge anyway, right?

153
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,880
When you have a full Ubuntu machine up in the sky, what are the possibilities?

154
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,000
With a camera on it that has a 1500x1500 resolution at 60 frames per second, it runs Ubuntu 14.04,

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,480
so it's going to feel a little old.

156
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
A little old.

157
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
I'm just teasing.

158
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
It's a drone.

159
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,440
I want to see, like the diagram in the blog post shows a keyboard and mouse and a screen.

160
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,440
I want to see someone running after the drone with a keyboard and mouse and a screen trying

161
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
to use it.

162
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Oh my God, yes.

163
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,000
Or like a really long USB cable.

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,200
I think it's a super neat example too of how Ubuntu can be used on a range of devices that

165
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,680
are actually approachable by consumers, so somebody who really had an inspiration could

166
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,480
go out and get this stuff, eventually at least, in the fourth quarter it looks like.

167
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
That is neat.

168
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,280
And it's the first time where the in the clouds is legitimate.

169
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,440
Oh no, that's good too.

170
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,840
I hadn't thought of that.

171
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,440
You guys are on top of it today.

172
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,880
Okay, so while we're talking about Ubuntu, let's talk about this.

173
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,640
The Ubuntu torrent was removed from Google using the infringing DMCA takedown.

174
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,080
It's a horrible process where big companies outsource to these third party contracting

175
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,560
firms who go out and do these massive sweeps of the net and then they submit these huge

176
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,280
DMCA takedown requests.

177
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,680
Or perhaps Hollywood is, hold on a second, full stop.

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,300
Perhaps Hollywood is telling us something.

179
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,600
Maybe the robots are on Ubuntu.

180
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,280
So Ubuntu 12.04 LTS torrent was taken down because apparently, according to Hollywood,

181
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,320
it infringed on Transformers Age of Extinction.

182
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,440
That was the Ubuntu release that came with Transformers Age of Extinction, right?

183
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
Just pre-installed.

184
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Yes.

185
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Starts right on startup.

186
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Yeah.

187
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
That's an example.

188
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Content.

189
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Yeah, exactly.

190
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,840
Yeah, and I just, this, boy, if this isn't just such a great example, taking down open

191
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,560
source software like this, what a broken system is this.

192
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,960
This could be worse.

193
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,340
There's an even better example of why this is broken.

194
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:51,000
Last week, Warner Brothers ordered Google to remove several sites from its own websites

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,960
because they infringed their own copyright.

196
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,240
They had the Batman Dark Knight and Matrix stuff yanked out of Google search results

197
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,480
for their own sites.

198
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,360
Boy, I don't mean to take this down a notch.

199
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,960
Take down your own stuff.

200
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,680
What happens when this, what happens when they start taking down other legitimate stuff

201
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
accidentally?

202
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Right.

203
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Where does this stop at?

204
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,320
Well, Google aren't going to put any real effort into checking this because they get

205
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,720
millions of these things a day, so how, you know, nobody can be-

206
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,500
It'd be nice if they could charge a fee.

207
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,700
If you want to take something down, you have to pay X amount so they can't just generate

208
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,400
a bunch of bogus requests.

209
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,240
Moe's and Rath, you have an idea of where it stops.

210
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,320
Yeah, when you sit there and you think about it, what happens when they take down someone

211
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,200
else's stuff, then lawyers show up.

212
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,000
Remember how you were discussing lawyers?

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,460
I don't know which show that it was, but it was in the past couple of weeks.

214
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,680
The lawyers will have a field day if Warner Brothers accidentally manages to take down

215
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,040
something by say, Fox or something by just some other company, any other company.

216
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,720
Let's just say it was something that involved say Microsoft, for example.

217
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,760
Microsoft would say, oh, you decided to impinge upon our ability to make money through legitimate

218
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
means.

219
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,240
Well, we have a few people that would like to talk to you.

220
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,640
Snap, snap, the shark lawyers show up.

221
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Sure.

222
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,520
Yeah, so basically once they start picking on somebody their own size.

223
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Yeah, well, mm-hmm.

224
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,680
Well, it's not a matter of picking on because remember, as you're saying, this is pretty

225
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,000
much a blanket sweep, right?

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,040
So it's not a matter of picking on.

227
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,680
It's more like, because I have size 13 feet, so I got to be careful where I step sometimes

228
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,080
because if there's little kids around, I could end up stepping on their foot, their feet.

229
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:41,120
Now what happens to someone with size 13 feet, someone else's feet who also has size 13 feet,

230
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,000
but they're hostile?

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's an interesting analogy.

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,840
And you just came up with that on the fly.

233
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Yeah.

234
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
That was damn good, sir.

235
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,400
What size are your feet?

236
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, maybe he's probably got big feet.

237
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,800
He's thinking about that.

238
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,520
Yeah, that is a good way to put it.

239
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,120
That is a really good way to put it.

240
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,640
And it's just as shameful right now.

241
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:09,080
And I think I'm extra sensitive to it because I almost on a daily basis, I fight this problem

242
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,440
on the YouTube side of things, which is also a Google platform.

243
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,280
And I am assumed guilty.

244
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Exactly that.

245
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,440
It puts the onus on the content creator who's just trying to do their thing or the people

246
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,320
who are just trying to distribute legitimate ISOs.

247
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,840
And now it's gotten even worse from a monetization.

248
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,440
The only nice thing about YouTube from a content creator standpoint is it's got a great user

249
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,960
base and sometimes you can make some ad revenue.

250
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,980
Now for the kind of stuff that kind of views we get on YouTube, nobody goes to YouTube

251
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:45,560
to watch long form content, except for the awesome people that watch our long form content.

252
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,400
Because there is definitely an audience for it, but it's not as huge as everybody that's

253
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,720
on YouTube to watch 15 minute, five minute, and 10 minute videos.

254
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,980
They see that it's like, oh, an hour and 20 minutes.

255
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,280
So it's never been like a huge platform for us.

256
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,840
We don't make very much money on there at all.

257
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,240
And it's almost, it barely even makes enough for them to actually even pay us.

258
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,360
But they've started demonetizing videos simply for covering current events.

259
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,340
And this happens to one of our shows on the JBL network on a routine basis all the time.

260
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:22,220
But it's also even been retroactively happening to shows called Stoked, I used to do a Star

261
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,400
Trek online podcast years ago.

262
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,840
It's recently beginning to demonetize for covering current events.

263
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:35,840
So they are, in some senses, they can do everything from revoke JB videos from certain audiences

264
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,640
in the world, completely revoke it, or just not allow it to be funded.

265
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,200
There's so much control.

266
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,800
And never do they start with, well, let's get the creator's perspective.

267
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,900
Let's get the content creator's perspective.

268
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
Just like this Google takedown.

269
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,480
I mean, when you get removed from Google, you're essentially gone.

270
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,200
Just disappeared from the internet.

271
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,960
But so far, it's just made for a few good examples.

272
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,680
So now let's talk about something that's outside of Ubuntu.

273
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,040
I'm going to use the word Unity, but I don't want you to get confused.

274
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,320
It's not the Unity desktop.

275
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,040
It's the Unity gaming engine.

276
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,440
And it looks like the Unity gaming engine is getting some proper Vulkan work done right

277
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
now.

278
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Nice.

279
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,720
So this was posted by a software developer over at Unity Technologies.

280
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:33,720
And she shows here an example of a demo, a Unity demo, running under Vulkan on Ubuntu.

281
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,320
Pretty cool.

282
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Pretty nice.

283
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,080
And not that I'm some huge fan of Unity games, but what this will mean is more games for

284
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Linux.

285
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,240
This is going to get a lot more games for Linux.

286
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,920
And that is a big deal.

287
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,520
So it's not really news anywhere yet.

288
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,600
I just happened to catch this on Twitter today.

289
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
I was just trolling.

290
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,040
It's a cool looking screencap there, too.

291
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,760
Yeah, that's one of the demos that, yeah, that's, yeah.

292
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,640
I also like that hashtag Linux.

293
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,960
It kind of looks like a corridor of a modern retrofit Millennium Falcon.

294
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,680
Like if the Millennium Falcon got a facelift and they went in and cleaned it up a bit,

295
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,520
it would look like that with big balls rolling around.

296
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,960
I don't know what that's about.

297
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,720
But I thought that was pretty cool.

298
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,200
Actually, speaking of trolling around on Twitter, I found this on there, too, from NyxCraft.

299
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,280
ButterFS status in Linux kernel 4.7.

300
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,040
And this is kind of an interesting breakdown.

301
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,880
And by the way, NyxCraft adds the world is already moving on to ZFS.

302
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,680
So a couple of things that are still not working properly in ButterFS as of kernel 4.7.

303
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,660
I thought I would just mention them here.

304
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,160
Not to ding it, but just so you know.

305
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,060
They list defrag as mostly working okay, but extents currently get unshared.

306
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,960
Compression is mostly okay.

307
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,320
Auto repair and compression itself may crash from time to time.

308
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,120
Scrub and RAID 5.6 are considered unstable.

309
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,520
RAID 5.6 write holes still exist also, and parity is not being checksummed.

310
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,800
And the free space treat is considered unstable.

311
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,320
So if you're on a little Indian machine, you're okay.

312
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,880
But if you're on anything but an x86 machine, apparently ButterFS can't calculate free space

313
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
for shit.

314
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,300
I think that's the version 2 free space tree that you have to enable by an option.

315
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,280
So these are things that are considered totally unstable.

316
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,960
Then they have things like device replace, balance, quotas and queue groups, out of band

317
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,480
dedupe, and file range cloning that are all TBD.

318
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,360
William, what do you think of that stuff?

319
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Anything else that jumped out at you about the current state of ButterFS?

320
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,840
I mean, RAID 5.6 is broken.

321
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
What a surprise.

322
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
Yeah.

323
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,600
It's like, we've kind of known that for a long time, that it wasn't in a great state

324
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,440
and it never really has been fixed stability-wise.

325
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,360
And I think that right there, your sentiment, is my point.

326
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,100
I feel like as a community, enough of us have come to a, like, ah, this is never gonna,

327
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,480
this is just not gonna work.

328
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,440
Like I, I feel a little bit like-

329
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,980
Yeah, so Sheep has been dumping countless hours into it, like they've definitely been

330
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,400
submitting patches, but it's not really getting anywhere.

331
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:09,120
I do feel like the window of acceptance, or I guess I should say the court of public opinion,

332
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,920
may have come to its verdict.

333
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,800
And that could change, but it doesn't have the same kind of, like, momentum or excitement

334
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,760
or general, like, trust or anything that we'd like to see.

335
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,440
I also don't see RAID 5.6 being as relevant today as they were 10 years ago, either.

336
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
No, I mean, and I still use it, right?

337
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
Most people are running RAID 1 and RAID 10 now.

338
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
Well, I still use it myself.

339
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
I still use it myself.

340
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,200
It's still relevant for me.

341
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,720
So how, why do you say that?

342
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
Hold on, I don't hear you.

343
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,440
Well, William, what else do you think people are using instead?

344
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, he must be-

345
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,760
Sorry, my mixer is flaky with the mute button sometimes.

346
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
It's all right.

347
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

348
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,680
So what I was thinking is disks take so long to recover now, your large, like, four to

349
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,800
eight terabyte disks, because the read speeds haven't, and write speeds haven't gone up

350
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,320
enough to counteract how much space you're adding, how much capacity you're adding.

351
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,480
So overall, you're re-silvering or you're rebuilding times are taking much, much longer

352
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
than they used to.

353
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
True.

354
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,120
And so it's not as useful to use RAID 5 and 6 when you could rebuild much faster in a

355
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
mirrored configuration.

356
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Yep, yep.

357
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,440
And with less potential for data loss.

358
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
Yeah.

359
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
That's interesting.

360
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
I do use mirrors a lot.

361
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
And also storage is kind of cheap.

362
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
So-

363
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
Yeah, and then stripes and mirrors.

364
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
It's not that big a deal to go 2X.

365
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
You know, 2X is not a big deal.

366
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,040
Yeah, you're losing some, but it's worth it for the speed of everything.

367
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,200
All right.

368
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,640
I think you probably, I think, you know, I think you're dead on on that.

369
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,500
And I think, I think I will admit part of the reason I would, I would, the configurations

370
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:37,000
in which I would still use RAID 5 or 6, I guess, would be not a lot of disks.

371
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,440
And I specifically want something that's kind of a straightforward setup.

372
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,240
And I, and I, and I, I'm thinking of like a, like a, maybe an editing, I mean, I don't

373
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,920
even know anymore, but maybe an editing system with a few terabyte drives into that are super

374
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
fast.

375
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,400
But even there, I tend to do actually just a, just like a RAID 0 type setup.

376
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Yeah.

377
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Yeah.

378
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,840
So instead of like, how much do you care about what are your priorities?

379
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,640
So I have a feeling there may be a surprise in the air.

380
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,640
There may be something we could be talking about next week or whenever.

381
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
I actually don't know.

382
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,600
I don't know when, but it's, if I was going to make a red book prediction, I'm going to

383
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,080
say the next cloud project has something of their sleeve, which is going to take the project

384
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
to the next level.

385
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
What?

386
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,040
Now they're kicking off a next cloud conference and they've just put up a blog post about

387
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
it.

388
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,400
There are a couple of headline speakers there.

389
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,600
One of them is the CEO of Canonical, Jane, is it Silber?

390
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Is that how you say it?

391
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Yep.

392
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
It's Silber.

393
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Yep.

394
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,240
And then also Karen Sandler, the executive director of the Software Freedom Conservancy

395
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,560
will be giving some keynotes and they're going to have lightning talks and they're going

396
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:49,320
to have hacking sessions where they encourage people to bring hardware and there's going

397
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
to be a bit of a surprise.

398
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
That's exciting.

399
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,680
A bit of a surprise, a bit of a surprise that I can't tell you right now, but I will be

400
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
able to tell you soon.

401
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Come on, Chris.

402
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Tell us, tell us.

403
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,240
So if anybody gets a chance to go, let us know.

404
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,560
Look at them having a conference.

405
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,400
Yeah, I think that's cool.

406
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,160
It kind of like gives them, you know, it defines them a little bit more as their own thing.

407
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,440
I definitely want to give room to continue to listen to the own cloud version of events

408
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:21,520
and just sort of break all this stuff down, but in terms of just tactical execution here,

409
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,080
the next cloud project is lapping own cloud.

410
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,480
Like the own cloud project or whatever, the own cloud company has stumbled to properly

411
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,920
and fully respond to the entire series of events.

412
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,920
When they finally did, it was through sort of indirect means and blog posts through quote

413
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,240
unquote bloggers.

414
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:48,040
And just all of this, and then all of this sort of has been rather, they've been rather

415
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
quiet.

416
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
They haven't really been executing.

417
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,360
They haven't been executing on promotions as well and now this, there's a conference

418
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,720
happening for next cloud, like there seems to be a lot of momentum there.

419
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,720
It feels like it's, it feels more like a community.

420
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,840
It feels more like there's like, there is life there.

421
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,960
There's people excited about it.

422
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,000
Like if it's just some quiet company that, if no one's talking about it, then why would

423
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,560
we talk about it?

424
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:19,120
And whereas with own cloud, I feel that there is sort of, it has the life support feeling

425
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
right now.

426
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,680
And the only thing that, and then part of me is just like, well, I know I need to, I

427
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,600
know I need, I need to keep in mind there's two versions of events.

428
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,320
There's always two sides to a story and we haven't fully heard their side.

429
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,560
We've begun to hear, but we haven't fully heard.

430
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,560
I keep keeping that in mind and the same time these guys are generating buzz right now.

431
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
Exactly.

432
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
But we don't want to rule it out.

433
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,880
They might continue to be very good and they might do some exciting things that we want,

434
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,120
that we're excited about, but you just don't know.

435
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,920
Maybe Oracle should buy them and then kill them.

436
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Oh yeah.

437
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Why?

438
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
And then we would know what to do.

439
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Why?

440
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
We've established this whole path for software to die.

441
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
No.

442
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Oracle buys you.

443
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Then the path would be clear, right?

444
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
They can buy them.

445
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
We can have the second open office and LibreOffice and go forward to LibreOffice.

446
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,920
Eventually they shut to Apache and then it withers.

447
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Their next cloud in this case.

448
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Yeah, exactly.

449
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
Oh man.

450
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,880
I think that was the worst idea in the show yet.

451
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,880
Donated.

452
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Hmm.

453
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,240
I think they donated it straight to Apache and then you know it's dead.

454
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Hmm.

455
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,560
Well, I've been using own cloud for a long, long time.

456
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,320
In fact, I still have a droplet with it running on there.

457
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,040
I don't actively use it, but I can still connect to it and check it out and all that stuff.

458
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,020
So I'm keeping one toe in the water.

459
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:27,440
So that's, I think, but I'm also feeling the next cloud pull.

460
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,920
Anybody in the mob room running the next cloud installation at the moment with some regular

461
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
use?

462
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Yep.

463
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,400
I have it as a snap on a Raspberry Pi.

464
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,760
And what are your thoughts so far?

465
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
I like it.

466
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
It just kind of sits there and runs.

467
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,280
I don't really do an awful lot with it.

468
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,880
It's not like active because I don't have a huge amount of storage attached to my Pi.

469
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Yeah.

470
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
But I've just been playing with it.

471
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Yeah.

472
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Huh.

473
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
I should do something like that.

474
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,320
A Pi actually would be a good machine just to kind of, and I could, you know, I'd like

475
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
to use it for calendaring.

476
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,120
I did have a period of time.

477
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:06,360
My own cloud peak, my peak own cloud was, I got all really anti-Google for a while.

478
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
Exactly.

479
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,800
And I seriously was getting creeped out by the tracking.

480
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,120
And I went and got an iOS device.

481
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,600
And I prototyped this, I remember I started this, I got like an iPhone 5 or something

482
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,080
for free from Ting.

483
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,520
And they just sent it to me so I could try this.

484
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:31,480
And I set up everything to use, my calendar, my contacts, everything was pointed to my

485
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
own cloud server.

486
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Right.

487
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,800
And I had a, and I didn't use Google search, I had a 100% Google free iOS devices a little

488
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
while ago now.

489
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Yeah.

490
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:48,600
And own cloud, it reached that point where it was, I was totally unaware I was even using

491
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
own cloud.

492
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
I didn't, there was.

493
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
It was just a backend.

494
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Yeah.

495
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,100
I just had, and I had it syncing with my desktop, my gnome desktop, so I had calendar events

496
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
on my phone.

497
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
That is nice.

498
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Yeah.

499
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,440
And once was I ever having to manage the own cloud server, I just got everything set up

500
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
once and it worked.

501
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,720
And it was a pretty cool experience because I didn't use Apple services and I didn't use

502
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Google services.

503
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Yep.

504
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,880
So if I ever get around to getting that Ubuntu phone going, I might set something up just

505
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,880
like that up.

506
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Oh yeah, that's a great idea.

507
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Yeah.

508
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,520
But it would be nice, it does seem to work really well for that kind of stuff.

509
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,920
It's just when you're using it for that and then the urge to use it also for your syncing.

510
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Maybe if it had better support for like, you know, just being strapped on top kind of as

511
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
a layer.

512
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Yeah.

513
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
I would use it more.

514
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
Yeah.

515
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,160
Wimby, are you still playing around with a Libre Vault?

516
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
I am.

517
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,160
And?

518
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
And how is it going so far?

519
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,880
Well, I haven't done anything significantly different from when we last spoke, but it's

520
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,360
still working.

521
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
That's good.

522
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:55,000
Although Mark from Ubuntu podcast contacted me over the weekend because he was doing some

523
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,680
testing and he ran into some issues actually getting the thing to run and there was a couple

524
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,040
of bugs introduced in a recent update.

525
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,880
So but you know, file issues on GitHub and the developers very responsive.

526
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,940
So that was about to ask.

527
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,480
That's kind of a good test right there.

528
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
Yeah.

529
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Yeah.

530
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,000
So I'm going to pick up with that.

531
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,040
I've had a pause on that because I've been busy with other stuff.

532
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm going to pick up on that next week and put it through its paces a bit more and hopefully

533
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,740
look to move something important over to it.

534
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:35,080
My challenge is I've got about four terabytes of data in total that I'll be syncing using

535
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,800
whatever I end up using.

536
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Wow.

537
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,120
And one of the things I definitely noticed with it was a major issue with BitTorrent

538
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,840
Sync is because that data set is so large, it was essentially constantly just working

539
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,680
to recalculate the hash on the files, re-index, and by the time it got...

540
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
Maintaining state.

541
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
Yeah.

542
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
Just churning.

543
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
So I had to have a...

544
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,960
I had a dedicated machine.

545
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Still do actually.

546
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
I still do actually.

547
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
I have a dedicated machine.

548
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,280
It's a VM, but it's a dedicated machine with allocated resources just dedicated to that

549
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,020
task.

550
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,400
And so I don't know how LibreVault's going to handle that, but that'll be one of the

551
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
things.

552
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,120
And that's the unfiltered show notes are just huge.

553
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,400
It's just a huge, huge set of data.

554
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
And I don't...

555
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
I haven't even released all of it.

556
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,080
You should be like the testing bed for syncing solutions.

557
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
I will be.

558
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,760
It's unfortunate you can't use sync thing because they have an inotify solution which

559
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,400
would reduce the polling of the files.

560
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,000
Well, I don't know how LibreVault does it.

561
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,960
So then maybe they're using Ionotify too.

562
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
I think they do.

563
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Yeah, they could use inotify.

564
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,640
I would hope if they're Linux focused.

565
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Yeah.

566
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Yeah.

567
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
There's the wrapper.

568
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
What's the lib something?

569
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
Oh, really?

570
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,040
Well, that does KQ and other stuff too.

571
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Yeah.

572
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Yeah.

573
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,040
It is...

574
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,440
If I have a dedicated machine, it's manageable and I just have it off on a set of disks, but

575
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,760
that may be changing in the future.

576
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,640
So I will be revisiting that.

577
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,000
Either way, you know what?

578
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,360
I will have it all running through a DigitalOcean droplet.

579
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,900
That's how I do my cloud component to this.

580
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,320
This is when I ran own cloud and if I try out next cloud, this is what I'll be doing.

581
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,480
And when I do a LibreVault deployment...

582
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,580
I've had a syncing on DigitalOcean for like, I don't know, two years now.

583
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,580
It's just always there.

584
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,580
It just sits there.

585
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,580
It's always on.

586
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,580
It's great.

587
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,580
You know where the light went off for me?

588
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,200
So DigitalOcean, you can get a droplet for $5 a month to do this.

589
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
This is a $5 droplet.

590
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,760
Especially if you're not transferring tons of stuff all the time.

591
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,760
You just need it to kind of sit there and when you need it, it's there.

592
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,240
And if you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you get a $10 credit.

593
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,080
So the light went off for me when I decided it was time to do a couple of regional servers

594
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,780
to help people that are downloading our own filter files just get it a little bit faster.

595
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,880
So I sort of kick it off by seeding in their location and then other folks, other audience

596
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
member in those areas pick it up.

597
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,520
And of course, using BitTorrent Sync now, currently, it sort of becomes its own CDN.

598
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,320
And so my transfer isn't that crazy because everybody that's part of the swarm is also

599
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:55,120
transferring the files, but yet I'm able to serve them up at local speeds at $5 a month.

600
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
That is awesome.

601
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
It is great.

602
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
It is so great.

603
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,480
And you know, as I switch over to LibreVault, which I suspect I will, I'll just essentially

604
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
implement the same exact setup.

605
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,840
And you know, they have templates which makes us super nice.

606
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,360
They also have snapshots, which is great before you make a big transition like I'll be making.

607
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,920
And they have an API that allows me to automate like the rebooting and the managing of these

608
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,600
systems really easily.

609
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,920
And I can just use apps that have already been created by the open source community.

610
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,880
So check them out at digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUG.

611
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,040
They're all SSD-based storage.

612
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,080
They have block storage you can attach as you need it.

613
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,420
So as the unfilter storage grows now, I can add that, which makes being able to seed it

614
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,840
with all of the content, the entire back catalog now much more possible, which is going to

615
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,280
be super nice.

616
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:47,640
And something else that they are sort of drawing everyone's attention to is high memory droplet

617
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
pricing.

618
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,640
It's easy for me to say.

619
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,280
It's high memory droplet plans that offer large amounts of RAM, which is super, super

620
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
cool.

621
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
That's really handy.

622
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,800
I mean, I'm talking like when I say large amounts of RAM, I'm talking like 128 gigabytes

623
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:08,840
of RAM or, holy crap, 224 gigabytes of RAM.

624
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,120
Damn.

625
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,680
That is nuts.

626
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,160
DigitalOcean, and then combine that with the SSD-backed block storage.

627
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,040
And you know, they're using Linux for all of these systems.

628
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,200
KVM for the virtualizer, I couldn't say more.

629
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,120
DigitalOcean.com, just use our promo code DOUNPLUG.

630
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,760
You apply that to your account, you get a $10 credit, and you just supported the unplugged

631
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
program.

632
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Keep us going.

633
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:37,680
Ok, bomb DOUNPLUG, and I wouldn't mind trying out one of those 256 gig droplets.

634
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,960
I know, yeah.

635
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,640
Just for a little while, you know, just an hour or two play with it.

636
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
Geez, Louise.

637
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,460
You know, I wonder, so what were you talking to me about before the pre-show, what you

638
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,440
were talking about with the persistent RAM state, would that work on a virtual machine?

639
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,500
It's a good question, it might.

640
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Yeah.

641
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
Do you want to recap what it was?

642
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:02,980
I was just talking about the kernel's persistent memory support for having like a block device in persistent memory

643
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,300
So apparently I had no idea

644
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:10,740
This is a module that's been available for a while that allows you to convert part of a space of memory of RAM

645
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,080
Yeah

646
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,460
So it's in storage and so it's meant for like for dealing with persisting like is this sort of the back-end technology that RAM dis

647
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,900
Used to create a RAM disk or is this beyond that is it similar, but this is developed developed

648
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,980
In theory to support like non-volatile RAM. Oh, so if you have like that bank

649
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:31,740
I don't have that but for development purposes as well as other purposes. You can mark any segment of RAM

650
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,840
Basically, you say like leave this unassigned and then the kernel can make a block device out of it. Okay

651
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,020
And that actually the store that caught wood, but the content you store there

652
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,020
Persists after a reboot not not like a full reboot

653
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,020
Not if you like actually turn the system off

654
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,780
But if you keep the system running and for instance K exec

655
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,500
Yes

656
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,120
Because if as long as you don't as long as you don't wipe that memory and then you boot the new kernel

657
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,840
Also treating those memory regions as a block device then BAM. That's cool

658
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,680
Yeah, so you can just have a whole system running and RAM reboot right back into it. Good. Oh

659
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,780
That'd be fun. So what were you using that for?

660
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,400
Not really anything specific. We're just playing with it

661
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,520
But in theory, you know

662
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,540
You can there's a lot of just like speed up use cases or maybe you just want to have a system who you know

663
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:20,680
All your date you use your disk just for data and then you bootstrap into that kind of environment off like a pixie boot server or something

664
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,280
for your root file system

665
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,640
This is this is officially our geeky segment

666
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,120
So I'm gonna play off that and I was just talking about KVM

667
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,000
Which I think is the world's best virtualizer and is that even the right term? Should I hypervisor?

668
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,560
Is that what I should be saying? Yeah, it is but this is called kimchi

669
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,980
It's an HTML management interface for the SOB. So you course probably are familiar with boxes

670
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Mm-hmm. Very nice gooey to manage

671
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,720
KVM or whatever but kimchi is an HTML based management tool for KVM

672
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,280
It's designed to make it easy and possible to get started and look at these look at these screenshots

673
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,600
Here's the login here and here's where they've got several virtual machines running. Oh, I like those icons

674
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,960
Yeah, they match they recognize distros automatically and the virtual machines get the distro icon next to it, which is

675
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,040
Very nice. Honestly, this is so nice. I probably should have kept it

676
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,480
It's a secret and then done it as like a like a big segment on Linux action show

677
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,840
They should it has a web interface

678
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,680
It'll show you a list of running guests including live screenshots of the guest session you can use action buttons to shut down the guests

679
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,440
Or you know, you can connect to the display of the guest in the browser. I was about to ask

680
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,040
Mm-hmm. I think this is probably the way I'm gonna oh

681
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:36,000
Boy, oh boy, I just got an idea. Oh boy. Oh boy. I see I was thinking I was oh boy

682
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,680
I was thinking I was gonna use Proxmox in lady jupes. So one, you know, Wes

683
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,440
I'm working on setting up a Linux based network in the RV. Yes, and I

684
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:53,920
Was thinking I only want one computer. So you're gonna have like a virtualized all-in-one. I was thinking Proxmox

685
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,300
It's worked super solid here

686
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,520
It has been a total work champ and we've got machines have been running

687
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,960
Literally since day one that we put when we moved in as one of the first things we stood up were these machines

688
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,760
That's and they're still running today. It's been bulletproof. So I was thinking well, I should just set up Proxmox

689
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,200
But honestly with kimchi, I I probably a lot, you know

690
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,000
It's a lot easier to just bolt on I would I think I would rather do this with like a

691
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,520
Base server install and then load kimchi to manage it because the thing is gonna the other thing about it

692
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,680
It's gonna be under a cow. It's gonna be under a bench sealed up

693
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,260
I there won't be a monitor I can get to or anything like that

694
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,440
So this is this could be this this could be the virtualization solution. This might be my Proxmox replacement

695
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,480
I was recommending Proxmox to a friend, but he was kind of running into things that he was already kind of

696
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,000
You know the server he was had in mind. He's gonna already set it up

697
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,840
He was already using Ubuntu on it and he didn't really feel like, you know

698
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,600
He didn't want to wipe and reinstall and that guy so like he might just be able to bolt right on and bam

699
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,720
All right. There you go. Okay

700
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,600
And it could be perfect for me this because I would much rather just have like a base

701
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,000
1604 server install or something like that and then install this on top of it

702
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,440
Proxmox is fantastic

703
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,960
But it still is a little too free-nazzy for me in the sense that it's too much of us

704
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,360
Pre-built setup that I'm especially if you're only going for one device, right?

705
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,840
So if it's your office and you just stick it in the corner, that's fine

706
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,280
Yes, when you have the device that like in six months, you might need it to do a whole new function

707
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah, Proxmox doesn't support. Yeah here

708
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,640
We have a dedicated Proxmox machine and it runs in the garage 24-7

709
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,880
And that is the only thing it does and I just cannot do that in an RV

710
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,720
so this is gonna be the I I can I cannot wait to play with it. It's called kimchi and

711
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,380
We will have a link in the show notes to the github page. So while we're in the geeky category

712
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:43,200
I wanted to talk about the management firmware that comes with the pretty much most Intel machines for years now, right?

713
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,920
I mean, I think it's been in there since the core series perhaps

714
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,600
I don't know when it was added, but it's certainly been here

715
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,280
Yeah for the but like all things that are in bundled with the Intel stuff. They iterated on every single release

716
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,800
constantly adding features and it is it is some people call it like the

717
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,400
Sort of the spyware Intel spyware that is its proprietary. There's no we have no idea what it does

718
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,100
It's called the management management firmware. Is that what it's called an engine management engine? Thank you

719
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:16,480
Thank you, and it does all kinds of crazy things like apparently it uses your network connection to go out and synchronize with NTP servers

720
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,880
Yeah, if you run Windows, it supports functions like syncing your Wi-Fi network passwords to the firmware chip itself

721
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,380
And of course no source code is available for this although and the core boot project

722
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:36,380
Has been has been keen on replacing this or getting rid of it and there's been some experiments by I'm gonna say Tramel trammell

723
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,320
Tramel, yeah, maybe Tramel. I apologize. I'm sorry. I'm so horrible with names

724
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,880
Yeah, come join us and then correct us. That would be cheese. That would be great

725
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,960
But we could just have a name person on here

726
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,880
I'd be all about that, but you are familiar with his work if you're not familiar with his name

727
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:58,920
He is the one that created the magic lantern firmware. He reverse engineered the firmware on the Canon 5d mark 2 Wow

728
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,680
Yeah, that is really cool. Yeah, he's also he's also the guy behind thunder strike

729
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,720
which is a proof-of-concept EFI firmware root root kit for Apple's MacBooks that uses a

730
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,960
Thunderbolt and

731
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
We've covered it extensively on tech snap

732
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,440
I he is so he you were probably you're probably familiar with some of his work

733
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,520
even if you're not familiar with the name like I wasn't and

734
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,240
He's been poking around at trying to get

735
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,360
the trying to get around or disable this management engine and

736
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:34,580
He says I'm experimenting with what happens if I remove the management engine firmware from the lower

737
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,200
SPI flash chip on a ThinkPad x2 30

738
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:44,940
I just erased the first four kilobytes of its region take that and then core boot boots up fine and reports that this has a

739
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,420
Bad firmware the management is a bad firmware, but it continues on and Linux actually

740
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,080
initializes without any complaints

741
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,760
And then he went to try to remove the entire region of memory and of course it immediately wouldn't boot at all

742
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,340
But he's so he's beginning to experiment with where what he can poke at and what he can damage in the management engine

743
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:09,360
I like that to make it unusable, but still to make Linux bootable right which is kind of a great idea

744
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,120
Yeah, right what an interesting approach is we're cracking the

745
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,960
Destroy the damn thing x2 30. What's that? Which version of the ThinkPad? Did he say?

746
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,120
Yeah, it's the x2 30 ThinkPad x2 30

747
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:26,200
So I wonder if he can still do that with later models because I've heard they are locking down the management engine more and more

748
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,680
And relying on it. Yeah, there's some discussion about that in the thread

749
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,560
I believe so I'm kind of curious if the x2 30 isn't the best representative model for this no interesting

750
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,280
I didn't know that and you know I mean in some ways that might be true for actual production solutions

751
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,680
But in other ways that it allows him to poke at this and actually be able to see

752
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,520
What kind of results and proceed so in some ways?

753
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,280
Maybe it's good, but in other ways it means it's not applicable to

754
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,920
Some people they're getting newer ThinkPads. Yeah, that's a good

755
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:59,600
That's good to know in the in the good-to-know column. Have you have you ever have you ever had to enter in like your keyring?

756
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:05,240
Password on the gnome desktop sure yeah, yeah, maybe I think this probably apply to unity as well or Ubuntu matei

757
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,200
I'm not sure I mean yeah, I don't know actually maybe I could add wimpy

758
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,260
So the gnome key ring is that that's a that is a?

759
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,900
That on the matei desktop. Yep, okay, so I had a I had a I had a very privileged thing happened to me

760
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:25,820
It is one of the best things it's ever happened in my life is I had other people build a computer for me

761
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:33,200
What I had to pay for the components for my own Bitcoin, but I had your own treasure. I had other people assemble them for me

762
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,500
Mainly the beard and and Noah and he created we created a we covered the machines

763
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,380
We said this is way. This is months and months and months and months ago, and

764
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:47,420
He he even installed Anna gross for me. He set up Noah. He set up Anna gross for me

765
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,420
He set up real nice installed a few apps for me

766
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,540
And set the password to something generic and said all right have at it. See you later

767
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,220
And I said thanks sat down started using it and I opened up Chrome

768
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:05,860
And I got a key ring prompt for the password I typed in my password that you'd said and nothing happened wrong password I

769
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,920
Typed in other variations of generic passwords. I know Noah's used from various studio

770
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,580
Nothing happened

771
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,620
It was at that point. I realized I

772
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:22,060
I don't know my key ring password. Ah screw it. I don't care won't be a problem right well turns out

773
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,660
I tried I saw I began setting up in Elias and one okay

774
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:32,980
Yeah, I'm I said in LA is nihilus nihilus and one the mail client trying to set up my own server get all that stood and

775
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,980
standing interesting and and

776
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,740
one specifically relies on the gnome key ring to store your credentials are very like for Google and

777
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,080
So because I could not unlock my unlock my key ring. I couldn't you couldn't you set up and one

778
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,280
And so then I so then I had to set off on a mission

779
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,520
I was on a mission now yep to be able to solve this problem

780
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,520
I didn't know what I could do because I didn't know what the password was and the only way to change the password obviously is

781
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,400
To provide the previous password can't do that

782
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,440
And I don't want to reload because the machines freaking perfect except for this one thing yes

783
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,360
So I eat the key ring, so here's what I did

784
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,380
And there's probably there's probably a few ways to crack this nut so please leave a comment and let me know

785
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,960
but what I did is I installed seahorse and

786
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:19,560
Then I went into seahorse, and I selected the key ring that was there and I deleted it

787
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,560
Which means it deleted anything that had in there?

788
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,900
And they were prompts you for a few times, and then I went to the file menu new created a new key ring

789
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,080
Set in a password that I knew and then this is the key part you have to do

790
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,720
After you create the new key ring you have to right-click on the new key ring and say set as default

791
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,780
And and then go reconfigure the applications that we're trying to store their key ring credentials

792
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:48,160
So I then went and reset and reset up and one and then it prompted and actually because I already had my key ring unlocked everything

793
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,400
Just worked just worked right so I have links in the show notes

794
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,560
But seahorse was the key ring manager that I decided to use and I have I have a brief description in the show notes if you

795
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,280
Ever run into this about seahorse. Yeah, it worked well. Yeah, and you know you know why I was trying out and one is

796
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,460
Oh, this is not really related to seahorse, but and one has totally kick-ass key base

797
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,980
Io and it really does yeah, oh have you played with it, too?

798
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,640
Yeah, yeah, you should follow me

799
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,640
And I should follow you on key base and all that s because I'm Chris LAS on key based on IO beautiful and that I

800
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,040
Have been getting some emails this week that people been using my and I needed a I needed a solid way

801
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,400
Oh, they support it very nice. I was actually quite impressed with that

802
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,520
Yeah, so the so did you go for the pro? Did you stand on server? Yeah? No I ended up

803
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,280
I decided I'm trying both. I'm okay building my own server, but I also be so I saw so this week

804
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,280
I've been getting a lot of emails for on filter that are encrypted. I'm like I need a way to

805
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,660
Yeah, I got a so I wouldn't bought pro in the meantime

806
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:48,360
But I actually already have a droplet set up where I've already started to but I just didn't have time to all moving very fast

807
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,060
It's been a busy week

808
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:56,260
But damn that if that ain't if that ain't a sweet integration and it totally beats a big male or whatever you call it in Thunderbird

809
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:01,260
Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Anyways key based on IO slash Chris LAS and what are you on there?

810
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:07,380
I think I'm West pain. Let's jeez. Well, I'm noble pain. I'm noble pain on there. Okay. There you go

811
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,960
Yeah, so I've been enjoying the layers in that sense and I apparently it also is

812
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,580
super

813
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,500
Vigilant about tracking when people read your emails. Have you noticed this? Yes, so they have this I think that's a pro only feature

814
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,220
They have you know

815
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:25,140
They have like the built-in support for like read tracking and that kind of stuff so that when they open it

816
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:31,380
They're you know downloading something. Yeah, they're servers that yes track of that. They've seen it. Yeah, which maybe that's important to you. Well

817
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:38,220
I'll tell you it's been interesting because I've been corresponding with an individual from the Linux Foundation recently and

818
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:45,340
It is interesting to get that bit of information from time to time it is helpful

819
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,180
I will say to get that bit of information a little metadata. Uh-huh

820
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:55,860
Uh-huh. And so that was an unsurprising perk of using of using n1 that I I thought read receipts were like this

821
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,380
It's not even it's like it's more than read receipts though, isn't it? Yeah, something else. What's the

822
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:05,220
Pricing on the pro right now. Do you know I don't let me go look cuz it's not cheap

823
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:12,120
But I was pretty happy with their client though, and the you know, it played pretty nicely with my work

824
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,740
I think they make it really Oh pricing. No, here they go right here sits. Oh, it's okay

825
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,860
It's not nearly as much as I remembered. It's seven dollars a month

826
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,580
but for me, here's here's here's why I like this a lot is I

827
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,860
Have a lot of I have right now I have over 13,000 unread email messages

828
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,220
And I usually get that down to about five thousand

829
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,680
And it's about as low as I ever get sure and so having an email client that anything that can help me search faster

830
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:45,420
We're gonna actually today in this show. We're gonna we're gonna read email

831
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,340
We're gonna cover email and later on in the show

832
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:53,580
It's it's one of the it's one of the first times in probably a year that we've read a email on this show simply because

833
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:59,160
I now have a slightly better workflow to collect you can actually look at the email. Yeah, so it's been worth it

834
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,660
It actually has been worth it for me because it's been good for

835
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:09,040
Some encrypted communications or you know GPG encrypted communications for and filter

836
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,460
It's been great for corresponding with the Linux Foundation and it's been great now for this particular function

837
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:20,020
So I do like it quite a bit. I think it's rather nice. It's it's bulky it is

838
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,300
Not cheap you can stand up your own server

839
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,700
I'm going to work on that but right now

840
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,540
I decided to try this because I wanted to use this right away

841
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:32,980
Yeah, but it also is like you know you're using some other you're using some other background anyway

842
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,940
That's probably free so you know maybe there's an angle where you're like well

843
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:43,300
Is it enough of a thing on top that I would I would not I would not recommend it for most people

844
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:47,340
Just if you're concerned all about a third-party being involved in your email

845
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,300
Unless you're using Google services, then go screw yourself. You're a hypocrite all right

846
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:58,900
I want to talk about something else is totally unsecure USB IP. This is brilliant. This is such a brilliant project

847
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:03,900
I this is this is something that actually could be really great for Linux terminal service project

848
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:10,580
USB IP is a project aimed at developing a general USB device sharing system over an IP network USB IP

849
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:18,740
Encapsulates USB I O messages into TCP IP payloads and transmits them between computers original device

850
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:25,820
Divide drivers and applications can be also used on the remote computers, so they have with no modification

851
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,460
They have no idea so USB storage discs work

852
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:36,620
Just fine even even tools like fdisk and make FS and mount all work fine USB keyboards and mice webcams and speakers

853
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:41,260
USB printers even this and and

854
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:47,700
USB devices it currently is implemented as a Linux device driver and available under the GPL

855
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,620
It's IO performance is enough for practical it for it says this is I think the English is a little broken

856
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,740
Performance is enough practical and local area network for all types of devices

857
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:03,120
Including IO synchronous devices without any modification of Linux original USB device drivers

858
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,180
interesting

859
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:12,500
This could be big for us because this could essentially turn any webcam into an IP camera for us

860
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,460
Yeah, and we could bring we could bring these into our OBS machine. We could have

861
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,780
this of this

862
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:24,580
This could work so amazing because we could have little machines that could be raspberry pies all over

863
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:31,020
Conferences with USB web cameras that we could pull into our OBS machine amazing. Yeah, wow

864
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,020
I'm super excited about this project

865
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:39,980
I'm very it's it's self it I'm selfish, but I'm very excited because it if if the host network was good enough to support it

866
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,180
And it doesn't have to be crazy. We could really we could really

867
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,940
Essentially have a Linux powered IP

868
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,700
camera solution here

869
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:56,780
Boy yeah, if that would work I'm gonna try we should we have to try yeah, I think so well

870
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,960
Maybe I can get no Enrique to try yeah

871
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,520
I think guys yeah, hey guys. Hey guys. Let's take all the things to put them over IP. What do you think mosenrath?

872
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,040
I'm not so sure I would actually trust that you know like if you're gonna do that over say like a private network a

873
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:20,280
Monitored network sure go right ahead, but if you're not think about it for a second people are already hacking

874
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,520
Like you know webcams and all that kind of stuff already using whatever means

875
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:30,480
I'm not smart enough to remember how that's all done, but now if you're putting them all really on the net

876
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,240
Via the wonderful wonderful world of IP what happens if someone says oh, I know what that is

877
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,120
I know what that is

878
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,760
I know what that is and starts just pretty much using all those IPs to

879
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,360
Literally just record all the stuff that you're doing that way instead of recording

880
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:52,080
You know what's going on on your computer using your computer to record you so this is totally got a lot of huge massive

881
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,680
unbelievable

882
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,920
Security ramifications that we probably can't even begin to touch on I mean

883
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,360
This is this is the project even says you know use this for devices you trust

884
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,960
But on a local area network here like in the studio where we're the only thing we're doing is production, right?

885
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:13,840
Or or where we could go set up a network where you could trust that network a dedicated switch that kind of thing which is

886
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,840
What we would do oh man

887
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,600
That if you do in a controlled environment. I think it's there's a lot of potential to this

888
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,720
Yeah, William you have thoughts on it. We're just gonna say lock it down. Yeah lock it down

889
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,120
It's a little environment stick it over. You know I'd be sacred and then to be great

890
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:33,240
It'd be amazing could also this could also be a great way to do network installs you could have

891
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,720
Remote IP USB flash drives, or I don't know I mean just there's a lot of I think there's a lot of

892
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:46,920
Reminds me of like and DB or the network block device dr. DB. Is that what you're similar to that? Oh?

893
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:53,760
Network no, what are you talking about Wes how you can mount it you mount a block device over the network. Yeah, yeah

894
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,520
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, dear DB's for like block device replication. Yeah exactly okay, I follow you

895
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,240
Yeah, same thing, but yep now this can be just any USB device mm-hmm

896
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,080
Cool, it's very cool. I'm pretty excited about it anyways

897
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,920
Well wonder if you could do like a synergy type thing not not like as synergistic obviously because it'd be you know

898
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,240
Taken over by one machine, but like here's my keyboard over here. Yeah really mounted on that machine

899
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,960
I think you probably could I think you I think I think that would probably I don't know why that wouldn't work

900
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,920
I could be or and you hmm because to the Linux host it just it just looks like a USB local device

901
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,040
They had this the the software level is just exactly the kind of thing about Linux where it's like you know

902
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,400
Maybe you have like practical applications right in your mind

903
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,240
But there's just so much fun and playing with it

904
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,400
And there's like so many things that you'll discover like maybe it actually is useful to you

905
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,340
Just because you can do it

906
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:47,480
I legitimately on this computer over here already have a telegram thread going with Noah talking about how we could use this in production

907
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:48,720
So we will probably test this yes

908
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,000
And get back to you guys on it because it I think it's I think it has some serious potential

909
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,720
I am I am constantly trying to scheme different. I actually kind of blame

910
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,800
I kind of blame wimpy in some ways

911
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,340
But I'm constantly trying to scheme ways we can

912
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:11,040
We can come up with cool solutions for using Linux to podcast and then and then contribute back to those projects in user air

913
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,880
For that'll come out. God knows when because I'm gonna going on a road trip cat Dev random

914
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,680
that's when but in user air for we talked about some of the

915
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,380
Technology changes we've been doing on the back end and one of the new open source projects that Rekha has been contributing to

916
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,700
sending patches back to to produce user air and

917
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,800
It is it's pretty awesome because so far at least and I know this will probably not always be the case

918
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,000
But so far every upstream project. We've begun working with

919
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,400
For the tools we're using in-house has been damn receptive. That's awesome and in the case of the tool

920
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,960
We're gonna talk about user for is implementing the patches right away

921
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:54,120
So some of the stuff that we needed to get fixed to improve playback on Android devices and stuff

922
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,520
He's already he's already fixed it upstream Wow yeah

923
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,080
It's so we started we started in-house like well

924
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,680
We'll patch that we'll patch it ourselves and then Rekha Rekha contacted the developer

925
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,200
We've had a couple of successes like that now so anyways

926
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,500
We'll talk about that in the state user air for but it is really cool to be able to take this stuff and say

927
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,400
This gives Linux an advantage in production right of course

928
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,760
That's the lens of what I look at this

929
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,080
but that is is where we're gonna build a pretty good list here of reasons that make Linux awesome to do media production pretty soon and

930
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,360
It's gonna make the Mac look like a joke

931
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:30,960
You know what else looks like a joke the rest of the mobile industry compared to ting I mean it is

932
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:37,480
I got nothing these the duopolies they try to be creative, but really they just want to soak you for every single thing

933
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,240
See that's not how ting does it ting is just pay for what you use wireless

934
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,300
It's six dollars for the line, and then you just pay for what you use ting keeps rates simple

935
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
We don't make you pick a plan instead

936
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,240
You just use your phone as you normally would how much you use determines how much you pay each month

937
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,120
You can have as many devices as you want on one account

938
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:01,280
That's good because when you use more you pay less per minute message or megabyte of data

939
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,480
Your usage plus six dollars per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill

940
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,440
Simple that's what we mean when we say

941
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,300
Mobile that makes sense and then they back it up with

942
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,640
Fantastic passionate customer service you get to talk to a real human being they stay on the line

943
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,100
I remember when I was on my road trip out to Noah's house

944
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:28,920
And I had a mi-fi issue that wasn't ting's fault, and I legitimately I legitimately thought at least three times

945
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:35,440
It is totally understandable for this person to bail on me right now. It's just a human that could be like listen sir

946
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,080
It should work. I don't know I have I have I have been in that support role before

947
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,440
so I'm like totally understandable and

948
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,800
legitimately they stuck with me the entire time and

949
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,800
It was I was so damn impressed with that experience, but honestly

950
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,680
I don't often talk to the team customer support because they just have a great dashboard

951
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,440
They the control panel really let's you manage anything and an app for your phone, too

952
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,640
It's really nice and the nice thing about it. I'll just say you can go in there and set limits on certain people's accounts

953
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,440
Ha I gotta lock the beard down

954
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,440
He's a mess yeah

955
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,120
They've also got a whole line of devices. They're unlocked you own them outright. They're yours

956
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,680
It's such like an upfront and honest way to do mobile service

957
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,680
There's no like secret backdoor deals. We have to call up and ask when you can get your next

958
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,440
agreements or contracts or

959
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,160
Commitments, it's early termination fees none of that. It's gone

960
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,680
You just got to go to linux.ting.com that'll take

961
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,680
$25 off your first device or if you bring a device and they get CDMA and GSM

962
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:44,120
It'll take $25 off your first month which will probably pay for the whole damn thing depending on how much you use

963
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:50,280
So just start by going to linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

964
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:59,400
All right, so Wes you and I were sort of caveats in recently is that commencing is that about the state of desktop customization

965
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,120
I gave Loki a pretty good review in 434

966
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,960
I think it's a I think it's got a couple of rough spots, but overall it's a pretty polished desktop a unique product. Yes

967
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:14,840
But it from a customizability standpoint. That's not its strongest standpoint. It's not where it's really

968
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,920
That's not where you go if you want to have a really custom experience

969
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,480
There's a lot of other options with the plasma desktop

970
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,360
There is some great themes for the gnome desktop

971
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,880
And it's interesting because different distributions make it easier or harder to accomplish this

972
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:36,880
And if you look at if you look at distributions like arch, yep, there is easy access

973
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,500
But there's no direct tools that allow you to necessarily

974
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:47,200
Implement those themes right you look at distributions like Ubuntu Mate that come with the tweak tool that allow you to choose a general layout

975
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,640
Which is an overall interface paradigm, but not actually a theme tool itself

976
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:58,400
There's several they're separate theme tools right, but they're sort of predefined preset. You have a box in which you can play and

977
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
and and and so

978
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,040
There's a lot that can be done, but depending on the desktop you choose and the distro you choose

979
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,680
or the combination in which

980
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,680
The variability is very high. Yeah, really it really is and so you've been recently doing

981
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,440
I think you just reloaded from fedora right yeah

982
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,400
Well, I was just getting ready to my laptop has been polluted by all the various things

983
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,040
We've tried here on the show no doubt so I thought like well

984
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,880
Let's reinstall and I can kind of want to redo some of the partitioning to better

985
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,480
You know have better space when I do you want to reinstall like six operating systems at a time to give them a shot

986
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,400
and

987
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,400
I was just thinking about it, and it's not like my main workstation

988
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,920
It's kind of like my on-the-go laptop when I you know when I'm out and about and don't need serious power or anything else

989
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,040
So so it's not crucial. It's not like you know the one I spend all my time on

990
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,600
And I was just thinking about it. It's like I'm very comfortable installing arch

991
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,600
I like installing arch

992
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:53,680
But there's kind of that last layer of like picking themes choosing them remembering like which directories

993
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,200
I need to stick them in so that they'll be picked up by the right programs

994
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,920
you know even things down to like customizing my vim setup and that sort of stuff where it's

995
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:05,240
It sometimes it takes me a little bit to get going and there are just some things about

996
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,720
Antrigos in particular in this case. I just thinking well

997
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:12,080
It's I can get like a really nice desktop where I can still customize everything

998
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,360
I need to write like there's not crazy things installed by default

999
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,680
But I'm up and running in a thing that looks beautiful and like I'm not ashamed to have next to my wife's MacBook

1000
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,280
That's an interesting

1001
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,960
Criteria, and I don't I don't usually do that. I'm not saying that's like yeah what I will do

1002
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:34,720
And I feel like when you say it was easier was it because that it just came pre-installed with new mix or is it or

1003
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,240
Is it something else?

1004
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,080
I think so I think it's more just

1005
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:43,360
What what we lack is that like that sense of design in a lot of ways like elementary has it right?

1006
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,800
And that's kind of one of the things that sets them apart other distributions have it, too

1007
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,840
But especially in like the Wild West of arch or some other places

1008
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:54,760
I feel like it's you know you see like the Unix porn subreddit and that kind of thing and there's a lot of good examples

1009
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,640
There, but it it really is something you you have to figure out if you want something

1010
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,240
That's non-standard, but you want it to look nice

1011
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,080
You really have to figure it out for yourself, and there's like such a there's such a huge array of different possibilities

1012
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,760
There's a lot of directions. I think we could go

1013
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,080
And I I guess I have one I obviously have one take on this

1014
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,200
But I kind of want to bounce it around the mumble room a bit

1015
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,720
And I haven't heard from poppy for a while, so I'll start with him. I'd like to hear poppy thoughts on

1016
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,360
desktop Linux customization

1017
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,840
if you have just general thoughts, but also on

1018
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,680
If it's if it's really something that we need to be concerned with at all

1019
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,440
I'm I'm the worst person to ask because I'm the kind of guy who

1020
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:42,140
Installed a desktop and then leaves it basically so I think that makes you the perfect person because it's a totally different perspective

1021
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,600
Which is I'm kind of like I want to live your world for a second

1022
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:49,880
And so I just don't care. I just want it to get out of the way and get on with doing my applications

1023
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,680
I'll generally accept whatever the wallpaper is I might change it

1024
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,800
but I've gone for months with whatever the default wallpaper is on my distro and

1025
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,360
Probably the only thing I would fiddle is the size of the launcher on the side. You just make it a little bit smaller

1026
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,520
I'll install loads of apps of course

1027
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,320
And I might change the default so instead of having Firefox to my default. I may have Google Chrome, but

1028
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,040
That's about as far as it goes. Um, maybe in a terminal

1029
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,960
I might change the font and the font size, but really that's it

1030
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,560
I I don't change you consider yourself a very distractible person

1031
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,600
Yeah

1032
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:33,120
Okay, so I guess I mean, I mean yes. Yes, totally if by that you mean, you know

1033
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,480
I mean I have

1034
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,920
loads of windows open with all my social networks in and all that kind of stuff and I also

1035
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,360
You know have a phone nearby pinging me at every and yeah

1036
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,880
Okay. Okay. I that's I

1037
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,560
I just think that for me

1038
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:56,480
I I the reason why I customize is because I can't stop until it's just right and I and I feel like it steals brain

1039
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,480
Cycles to use a CPU term. I feel like it steals cycles from my brain right until I've got it just right

1040
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:09,600
So here's a different question. Has it has it gotten easier or less important because it's easier like I feel like ten years ago

1041
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,520
If you were using Linux like especially like when comp is was the rage and all that

1042
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,960
Like you wanted to customize right you wanted to like show off me like look I can make this look cool

1043
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,800
Yeah

1044
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,960
Is it just that these days like we've done a good enough job that most distributions you install like they they look respectable like you

1045
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:27,440
Don't have to try to compete to make them look like Windows or Mac because they're their own thing

1046
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,560
I think there's a part of that but I mean when I was working on Windows or my

1047
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,840
When my work laptop would have been a Windows machine

1048
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,920
I would have probably done the same as Chris and I would have tuned it and moved the launcher and fiddled this

1049
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,540
So what are those gaming things for Windows even called? Oh my god. Yes

1050
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,840
Yes, the dark I would have done

1051
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:50,740
I would have I would have done all of that to get it absolutely perfect because I'd be sat at that computer all the time

1052
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:56,700
Nowadays, I actually just accept most of the defaults and I find that's fine. I have a Windows 10

1053
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,700
Machine that I do

1054
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:02,900
That mostly gaming but I do a bit of surfing when it happens to be booted into Windows

1055
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:03,140
Sure

1056
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:07,860
And I don't change that at all other than move the launcher to the left-hand side because that makes sense what?

1057
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:13,700
Barbarian as the launcher at the bottom of the screen consuming vertical real estate that just sounds insane

1058
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:21,420
So I move the launcher to the left and that's it job done job done. That's that's that I like it poppy

1059
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,780
That's a good perspective now. Mr

1060
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:28,680
Sipes is in the in the mumble room and you had a chance to look at elementary OS. What do you think about a

1061
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:35,140
Distribution that really focuses on we're gonna just make it look right out of the box and call it good

1062
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:43,260
You stole the words out of my mouth Chris. I used it this past week and it is freaking awesome

1063
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:50,900
I'm the guy I'm kind of like you I try to tweak everything to make it just perfect and until then it's it's not right and

1064
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,580
I

1065
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,580
popped into elementary and

1066
00:59:54,980 --> 01:00:00,620
Once I got my head around the keyboard shortcuts that they write that are slightly different than unity. Yep

1067
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,420
I was pretty much there

1068
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:08,980
There are a couple of things which I got back to the team about that. I think are just little bugs maybe that could be

1069
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,740
Squashed and make the experience even better

1070
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:19,380
But man, like their defaults are like dead-on and it kind of made me upset and I hate to do this

1071
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,700
while poppies in here, but the it kind of made me upset because

1072
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:29,380
Elementary has the polish and has the the out-of-the-box experience that at this point

1073
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,860
I really wish that I got that same feeling when I popped up unity

1074
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,420
To your opinion right

1075
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:44,340
All right, fair enough now I want to give I write I yeah, I I

1076
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:49,060
I think if I could have if I could sum up my last review about elementary OS

1077
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,060
It would be it is the default

1078
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,860
Configuration in which my AGD mine can relax and I can just get work done

1079
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:00,980
Yep, and I think I could if I could have just said that if I could have probably summarized the entire review

1080
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:06,180
North ever to that last episode, but North Ranger is on the opposite side of this spectrum

1081
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:09,300
He says screw just let it just sit there and don't tweak it

1082
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:14,860
The tweaking is the the beauty of the Linux desktop. Is that right North Ranger? Yeah, you know

1083
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:20,500
And my experience has kind of grown I think with the way the Linux desktop has grown because you know way back in the day

1084
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:21,860
I vaguely remember

1085
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:26,620
Messing with you know for boom and an open box on Dora. Okay, I'd had at the time

1086
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:33,460
Was you know, you know actually kind of settled into I just want it to work during the Ubuntu GNOME 2 days

1087
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,180
But when they booted or the when the unity split happened

1088
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:41,940
I kind of checked out on desktop Linux for a while and it was about I want to say about GNOME 3

1089
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:47,860
312 or 314. Yeah when I really jumped back in but even though I liked the way that

1090
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:54,140
The GNOME folks were handling things. I still wanted things to work a certain way

1091
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:58,900
So I went down the extension rabbit hole man. I probably have about 30 GNOME extensions

1092
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:06,220
I don't know what that's like and I tell you the beauty I think of the system that is available particularly on the GNOME side

1093
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,860
Nowadays is how programmable it is

1094
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:16,620
I had a great example of the screencast extension that allows you to record your desktop. Yeah, and I didn't like the

1095
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,580
Gstreamer

1096
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:22,260
Settings that it was using and hey, it's just a JavaScript file

1097
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,640
I could go in and mess with it and I thought that was awesome that it's not only the look and feel

1098
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,540
It's actually how the desktop works awesome and terrifying. I agree. I agree

1099
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:36,900
Well said I actually thought you're gonna come and come at me with the plasma desktop mini mech

1100
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,600
I want to give you a chance to jump in go go for it, sir

1101
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,420
Yeah, especially on small screens

1102
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:47,900
I would love that all the desktop environments will have an auto hide or in tele height top bar

1103
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:54,100
Because that top bar takes space and there yeah, it's space lost for me

1104
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:59,660
Yeah, that that precious vertical space because all our screens are now 16 by 9 or widescreen aspect ratio

1105
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:04,960
So we did it vertical spaces at a premium now. There is one voice has been absent so far and that would be mr

1106
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:11,300
wimpy and like it or not wimpy may be sort of the face of traditional desktop on

1107
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:16,820
Linux now traditional desktop that has moved forward in ways that make a lot of sense

1108
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:21,060
But wimpy we've talked a lot or we've talked around this a lot, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this

1109
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,820
Okay

1110
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:23,980
Okay

1111
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:30,540
Yeah, I make a distro and I added a tweak tool so I could pre bundle the defaults suit me

1112
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:36,020
Which is the Cupertino layout? Mm-hmm. So when I installed a bunzu Marte, so you do customize it

1113
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,020
You just build a tool to just automatically

1114
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,940
The rest of us get to benefit yeah

1115
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:45,660
That's one way to do it. I guess. Yeah, so

1116
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:53,380
There are tools and but then there is the practical matter of getting the themes and I think this is and I'm not this

1117
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:56,160
Is not a this is not a arch master race thing

1118
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:01,640
I just think honestly, this is where arch probably pulls ahead is the AUR has all the best themes

1119
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:09,700
It really does and and and the the simple fact of the matter is you can do pack AUR dash capital s GTK dash theme dash

1120
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:16,100
Arc enter and you now have the best theme available for the gnome desktop. You didn't have to Google for a PPA

1121
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:20,540
You didn't have to make sure it was the right PPA. You didn't have to add it to your software repository

1122
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:23,260
You didn't have to add the key if you needed to you didn't have to refresh your

1123
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:26,780
Source list and then you didn't have to issue the install command separately

1124
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,540
It's already done and you've already configured your gnome desktop to have that theme

1125
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:37,540
it is legitimately one of the best distribution when it comes to choosing a theme because it's just in the AUR and I I

1126
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:44,740
Think that's I think that's one area where I've really enjoyed cinnamon and the plasma desktop is in their theme selector

1127
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,180
They just download the themes for you

1128
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:49,220
I feel like because that's one of the things about themes I guess that I would

1129
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:53,380
From before is that it feels very much like there's not a central index

1130
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:58,300
There's not a lot of like can you and if someone knows like is there a good like 2015 2016?

1131
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:03,940
really good guide about how to theme Linux and all the different options and where you go and what are popular themes and where to

1132
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:06,580
Look for those things. I feel like it's kind of like something you gradually learn

1133
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:11,340
You have to know Linux people who know what good themes are to listen to Chris Lass is, you know

1134
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,420
Very good opinions about them. Thank you

1135
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:17,500
So it's nice if they if you know the AUR is kind of one of those places like you have like a blessed themes

1136
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:23,500
Well, you have a you are at least you can type in gnome theme search and then search by votes or or

1137
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:28,420
Popularity and get a good idea of which themes people are installing. Yes, it provides like something from like that

1138
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:33,920
That's a nice for some people like tweak their desktop. That is a that's an inherent advantage, but mr

1139
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:41,420
Cipe says he has the ultimate solution. Yeah, so here's what I say. I say that

1140
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:47,140
The canonical higher wimpy and higher the elementary team and

1141
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:53,980
They work really hard on making things customer customizable, but also really nice and polished out of the box

1142
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,980
What do you think of it? What do you think of that Chris? You think we should?

1143
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:02,740
Pressure them into into doing that. I actually think what we should do

1144
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,740
We'll all buy a bunch of phones if they do

1145
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:07,660
Ryan if we're gonna play that game what I say we should well

1146
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:14,180
I would say what we should do is start a campaign with in system 76 to ship one of their laptops with elementary OS

1147
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:16,180
That's what I say. We should

1148
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,300
Know I think honestly, I

1149
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:25,860
Think really there is a certain design choice that should be made for the traditional desktop

1150
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,860
Obviously that's something that canonical has

1151
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:34,340
Gotten some flack for in the past and the and the switch over to unity 8 is probably gonna reignite that debate to some degree

1152
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:37,980
After it happens, but I actually and I'm not gonna put words in wimpy's mouth

1153
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:40,580
but in my opinion the way it seems to be working is

1154
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,500
canonical

1155
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,860
Acknowledges the existence of the Ubuntu Mate project. It is it is an official flavor

1156
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:52,980
They have extended invitation invites to wimpy to go to things like the snap sprint invite. It kind of seems like

1157
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:59,740
the ideal arrangement for end-users at this point because wimpy is able to manage his project as a

1158
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:08,300
Independent project and make decisions the best benefit it and its user base while basing it on a technology stack that is

1159
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:15,800
Not only aware of the project's existence, but working amicably with that project. I mean it seems right now to be

1160
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,540
sort of an ideal

1161
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:25,460
Arrangement and I mean I wish the best of wimpy could if canonical offered him a great salary go for wimpy

1162
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,460
But I think wimpy

1163
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:30,320
You have something kind of unique in your hands. I was just saying to

1164
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,820
West before we started the show and

1165
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:38,300
Then you you you kind of mockingly reshared this or or jokingly reshared this on Google Plus

1166
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:43,780
But the the the sentence that stuck in my head was the Linux distribution of the year. I

1167
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:49,660
I mean the year is not over yet, but there are there are only so many distributions

1168
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:55,140
I would put maybe in the top three and Ubuntu Mate is there and I I think you have a good arrangement now

1169
01:07:55,140 --> 01:08:02,020
And I think it's that's just my opinion, but I think it's I think it's one of the best distributions of the year so far

1170
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:04,580
Yeah, sadly not the best. It sounds like so

1171
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:12,460
Right yeah, yeah, well, you know Ike he's been working hard. He's been working hard, and he didn't spend some time here on the West

1172
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:14,460
Yeah, no he doesn't sleep

1173
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:17,620
He's actually been able to so in five years

1174
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:23,260
He'll explode and then you guys will be somehow somehow he's even been able to ship the Mate desktop for solace

1175
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:25,920
So yeah, now who knows what could happen good to see

1176
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:33,340
All right, so I want to move forward we have some follow-up and feedback to get to but I would like to hear your thoughts

1177
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,220
out there about

1178
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:38,140
The oh well actually Ryan. Did you have thoughts on polish before we move off?

1179
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:42,340
yeah, the the thing that gets me is I

1180
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:50,220
whenever I was using elementary this past week, and I've used Mate before and the thing that I come back to is I

1181
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:56,700
I've gotten so used to popping into a distribution and having like

1182
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:01,140
These little things that bug the crap out of me and having to go through

1183
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,060
you know a series of steps in order to fix them and

1184
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:08,620
It was so weird to to pop in and feel like

1185
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:13,460
There had been a lot of focus on that polish, and I didn't really know what you were talking about

1186
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,220
In your in your review till I popped up

1187
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,820
You know elementary on my own box and started playing with it, and I realized

1188
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,500
Just the just the little things that have gotten neglected

1189
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:32,700
neglected for what I think our visions outside of you know that that experience of I

1190
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:38,780
Have a desktop. You know I have this desktop distribution. I'm gonna make it as great as possible and

1191
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:47,820
Anyway, that was super frustrating and and I've and I'm glad that that we have like Mate and I've talked to Aiki quite a bit

1192
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:49,820
You know solace talking about his

1193
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,300
his full focus being on

1194
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,980
his desktop distribution and

1195
01:09:55,700 --> 01:10:01,180
Elementary it sounds like they're doing the same thing and I just really wished that there was that same focus

1196
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:07,340
From from other projects as well and making the desktop experience. Just work and be

1197
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,100
consistent and nice

1198
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:18,900
So anyway, that's that's I'll get off my high horse, but that's that's that's where my head's been today, and I was just so impressed

1199
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:23,300
the past few days playing with elementary that I so wanted to

1200
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:29,700
To talk about the great job that you know some projects are doing around that polish and that great experience

1201
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,020
I feel like

1202
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:33,500
elementary solace and Ubuntu bate

1203
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,180
Might be my top three for the year right now at this point and

1204
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:43,020
For different reasons for each one of them. I feel like they're they're they're all

1205
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:50,380
Or at least to some extent distributions you can recommend and the the caveats that you would have with that would go along with that

1206
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:55,180
Are pretty minimal, you know, well, there's a lot of other distributions that like are amazing in some ways

1207
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:55,980
But you have to be like well

1208
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,020
but except for this and you're gonna have to do that and

1209
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:03,340
But all those would be like I could set those up for a lot of people and just they would be that's they would do

1210
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:13,660
That's dead-on. That's exactly that's better than I could have ever put it. It's a that thing where you start apologizing

1211
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:20,980
This is good, you know, but you're gonna run into this and I just turn it off to Wi-Fi off put it back on

1212
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,780
It's fine. Don't suspend don't suspend

1213
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:28,060
Yeah, that's exactly it. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, it is

1214
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,380
it's

1215
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:36,340
2016 I think some of the surprises have been so far now that we're more than halfway into it has have been these distributions

1216
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:41,740
but also and not just because Ryan's here because I also say same same goes to Entraware is

1217
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:51,480
Some and and and purism is working on it to some aggressive improvements some some really aggressive improvements to

1218
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:56,640
the desktops and laptops that run this stuff and I think there's still people out there that have

1219
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,840
a perfectly legitimate reasons to choose a ThinkPad or a or even a MacBook Pro

1220
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,920
I mean the or a Dell Sputnik

1221
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:07,240
there's a lot of different hardware out there at this moment that Linux will run on but the the the

1222
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,720
locally sourced

1223
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,720
artisan homegrown

1224
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,840
100% organic

1225
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:19,940
Laptops that run Linux have been better penguin tattoo right on them better than ever and now we have these distributions

1226
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,680
that are better forever and it's kind of a funny because

1227
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,120
I

1228
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,840
Don't I don't think we really talked a lot about this at the beginning of the year. No, we didn't

1229
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,880
Interesting. All right. Well, let's move on let's I think we've probably spent enough time on this

1230
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,360
But thank you mumble room this yeah

1231
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:41,680
And if you have if you have thoughts on Linux desktop customization, feel free to let us know in the comments

1232
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:48,400
I want to mention Linux Academy before we move into our feedback Linux Academy comm slash unplugged go get the advanced

1233
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,320
Skills you need around Linux the basics

1234
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:58,040
But also really all of the cool things around Linux that are more more sophisticated they have advanced training tools that increase your skills and encourage

1235
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:04,920
Critical thinking and give you hands-on experience at Linux Academy. You start by going to Linux Academy comm slash

1236
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:12,080
Unplugged they have labs and exercises that give you real world servers where you get to actually work on this stuff

1237
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,520
Really feel confident with it and walk away like you've actually done it before in that interview can be like, yep

1238
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,960
I I totally hosed that easy to instance. I just destroyed it

1239
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,720
And now I know what not to do and you know

1240
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,600
What's nice about like specifically with the ec2 stuff all included as part of Linux Academy subscription

1241
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,760
It's not like you got to go set up a separate thing and all of that

1242
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,200
You can SSH right into the servers

1243
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:36,520
They have practice exams and quizzes learning plans that give you a time frame and you can just work within that

1244
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:41,280
In fact, if you're busy, they have availability planners that'll sort of work with you on your days

1245
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,680
You have available and set up reminders. It's a super cool system full of Jupiter broadcasting community members

1246
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,160
and

1247
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:51,240
Created by Linux enthusiasts. I think the big thing for me is like

1248
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:57,760
Even just outside of the JB community the amount that I've seen people jump on the Linux Academy bandwagon is amazing

1249
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,120
Like yeah, you know like big old-school admins just a whole gamut of people who use Linux

1250
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:07,000
I've seen just like they're getting really big the people who use Linux they they know about Linux Academy because it's made by people

1251
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,680
Who use and yeah, it's high-quality stuff and they're getting bigger and bigger all the time. Exactly

1252
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,500
It is pretty neat to see them grow Linux Academy comm slash

1253
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,500
unplugged

1254
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:19,340
Alright, so this is an email that came into the show from storm 77

1255
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:23,840
He says warning they may use a pro 5 Ubuntu manual that we linked to last week

1256
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:31,100
Suggest formatting the external SD card. Hi. Hello by the hello there. Hi there. Hello in an episode real pain in the flash

1257
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:36,280
Love 161 you added this manual to the show notes any links to the PDF by the way

1258
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:41,120
He says in the TWRP section on wiping the device. It also selects the micro SD card

1259
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,140
This is the external SD card. Not the internal one. I saw it in time. It just let you know

1260
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:48,220
I almost formatted my 120 gigabyte card

1261
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:51,020
Just wanted to prevent anybody else from running into this

1262
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,060
The backup is also incomplete

1263
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:56,740
So I wrote a small tool to back up the entire flash onto an internal SD card

1264
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:02,140
He links us to that too and he says give wimpy his regards. Well, that's just great. Thank you for the warning

1265
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:08,340
Yes, likewise the tool improvement. That's amazing. And it's great that that you're doing that

1266
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:13,420
I think you you should let us know more about your experiences. It's going forward. Oh wimpy. Can we get an update from you?

1267
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,500
Fine going well, thank you

1268
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:22,900
Good legally awaiting OTA 13 in the hope that

1269
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,620
Bluetooth is

1270
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:30,940
Bluetooth specifically Bluetooth audio is resolved for for my my device

1271
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:33,940
I thought I thought literally you were gonna do with all is going well. Thank you

1272
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:37,860
Yeah, I don't ask you about your phone do I

1273
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:45,840
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I was in fact, I'm gonna cover OTA 13 a little bit in the next week's episode of the Linux action show

1274
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:49,500
Yeah, no, it's all good it's good

1275
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:54,140
I think it's it looks like a pretty great update. So I just talked about that a little bit in the next episode of last

1276
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:56,260
which

1277
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:03,620
I'll be honest was pre-recorded. I know I'm going on a little road trip and so we pre-recorded that but so we I do happen

1278
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:07,820
To know the future and that we talked about that new update. So Bluetooth is what wimpy is looking forward to it

1279
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,820
Sounds like yes. Yeah

1280
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:13,820
All right, I'm a whole bunch of stuff. I'm looking forward to but that in particular

1281
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,980
I'm gonna keep asking you wimpy all the time because you I'm living by

1282
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:21,580
Prepared in the future. This is revenge for you asking about when the Libra was kind of

1283
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:28,660
I was doing that for about six months

1284
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:34,140
Chris you need to buy something so we can bring that back. You should take mental notes wimpy

1285
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:37,760
You could take it. No, I'll just ask you next week. Actually, I just really want to know

1286
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,900
Yeah, that's me too. Yeah, exactly Paul writes in

1287
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:46,380
About a bunch of touch way into the nexus 70 says that with all the talk recently about a bunch of touching KDE

1288
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:52,420
Have you seen plasma dash mobile org you talked about Wayland how good that will be to have

1289
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:58,040
But on arch with gnome 320, it's already available. If you just check out your gdm custom.com file

1290
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,900
Finally, it's rumored that there will be a nexus pixel 7 this year

1291
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:08,500
If that happens, do you think a boon to touch would be released for it? Keep up the great shows Paul

1292
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:14,100
So mr. Popey, can I pick your brain on what is the process when a brand new piece of hardware ships?

1293
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:18,860
What is sort of what is what the impetus to get a boon to touch on that devices?

1294
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:22,620
I got to imagine it's a it's a starts with somebody picking up a piece of hardware

1295
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:28,100
Yeah, for the most part their community ports

1296
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:35,700
So it's you've got to have a someone skilled in doing the porting and be they've got to actually have the device

1297
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:40,020
Yeah, and then third third the real the real killer is time

1298
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:46,580
They've got to have time to actually sit down and do the port and when you have a never-ending supply of Android

1299
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:52,380
Devices coming and people, you know saying hey, I want this one next this one next

1300
01:17:52,660 --> 01:18:00,020
It's it's actually a never-ending supply and we need more people to to to get involved in that because it's just

1301
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:04,940
You know, there are more devices out there than there are possible people who can pour them, you know

1302
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:10,060
I would imagine so it's it's a small team. But yeah, generally you pick up advices and

1303
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:15,180
you know get the source code for the kernel and all that kind of stuff and then start the porting effort and

1304
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:19,340
Follow the documentation basically so far and this could change over time

1305
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:24,220
But it seems like the way it works is when a device reads it reaches a certain critical mass

1306
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,060
Which it can sometimes be a year or two after its original release

1307
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,900
you start to see

1308
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,140
enough community members coming together to work on that device like

1309
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:36,140
The Nexus 5 for example

1310
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:42,900
Or other devices where there's just it's kind of nice in a sense because it gives a device of yours a second life

1311
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,660
but at the same time as

1312
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:51,720
The community grows I would expect that might scale a bit more right and and there's a lot of resources typical like

1313
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,380
Developers scratching their own itch, you know

1314
01:18:55,180 --> 01:19:00,080
Has a Nexus 5 in front of them and once you know once the port to happen

1315
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:04,540
Then they'll either try and do it themselves or they'll throw some money at somebody else to do it

1316
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,460
It's you know

1317
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:09,300
If you if you don't have it if if there's a device and you don't actually have one

1318
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:14,340
You're probably not motivated to want to pull to it. Then you need that because there are a lot of people

1319
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,860
yeah, there is like a there is a

1320
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:24,460
Shoot, I'm blanking on the name poppy, but there's kind of like a bounty source equivalent for device port. Isn't there you be ports?

1321
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:30,220
Yes, you before you have any ports. It's it's got a patreon as well. Okay, there you go

1322
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:34,540
so that that is an eye that's a fascinating idea to in fact, I think I've I think I've actually

1323
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,100
Well, cuz you kind of need that like you need the people developing it

1324
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:42,220
They need to have the phones and then you need the people who are willing who have the phones and are willing to like run

1325
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:47,180
It and then submit bugs and you know patches and core dumps and all that stuff. Yeah

1326
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:53,020
It's fascinating though because it can all happen just takes a community to do it. It takes a village West

1327
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:57,820
It takes a village to raise a phone. So Java King writes in and wants to know my Bitcoin Linux details

1328
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:00,740
He wants me to expose all my secrets. He says hi Chris. You mentioned using Bitcoin

1329
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:05,520
I'm a new bitcoiner and I wonder if you might elaborate on your setup. Maybe share you with your audience

1330
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:11,100
Here are some questions. I have do you use Bitcoin core or a lightweight client with multi bit or electrum?

1331
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:15,860
Have you securely backed up your wallet dot dad? Do you perform all transactions from a single desktop? And

1332
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:22,260
What currency exchange do you use and what app do you use to monitor the Bitcoin value? Thanks Java King. Boom

1333
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:29,120
Give us the deets Chris. So Java King. He said you're a new bitcoiner and you wanted to know how how I

1334
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:34,780
Secure my setup. No, I'd say my first step is don't tell people how you use Bitcoin. That's my first hint

1335
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:40,860
Because that is the worst thing you could do. But since I am here, it's helped. I am here at your service

1336
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,500
I am here for you. I will I will expose myself

1337
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:48,260
so I use electrum as my wallet of choice it has I've

1338
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:54,540
Mainly since I started plan B. I've used this because I I've had an on-and-off

1339
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:59,820
Conversation thread over the years with the developer and so I just happened to know the person behind it and I like it

1340
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:03,740
But also I like the fact that it fires up right away. That's one of the things I really enjoy about it

1341
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:09,620
Have you tried electrum? Yeah, I have. Yeah. I also like the instant on yes, really. That's a big sell

1342
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:15,560
Yeah, so electrum is the the wallet of choice. So then he said do I back up my wallet dot dat file?

1343
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:18,600
How do I securely back up my wallet dot dat file?

1344
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:26,520
Well, one of the cool things about Bitcoin Java King is you could actually store it offline and there are methods to actually even print

1345
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,520
It out and store it if you want. So look into that

1346
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,960
Do you perform all transactions from a single desktop? Yes

1347
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:38,300
And I back that directory up. What currency exchange do you use? I'm lazy. I use coinbase

1348
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:40,600
Yeah, what do you know? I also am lazy and use coinbase

1349
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:44,460
And I've also talked to the people behind coinbase before and I know them and I like them

1350
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:48,380
So what desktop after you used to monitor the current Bitcoin value? Well, I

1351
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:51,300
am

1352
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:56,780
Apparently a masochist. I use a gnome extension. And so I have a gnome extension that works all the time

1353
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:59,740
So right now at the Bitcoin price as we record this episode

1354
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:04,580
$609 and 64 cents a US greenback this morning. It was at

1355
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:09,100
$611 and so I made a small Bitcoin transaction on behalf of the Jupiter broadcasting

1356
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:14,900
Well my Bitcoin, but I purchased something for the Jupiter broadcasting network because I made the guesstimate that that's the high for the day

1357
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,380
And I need this thing

1358
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:20,180
And so that's I kind of watch that and if I know there's something that the network needs

1359
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:26,420
I watch that on my desktop and I try to I try to make my purchase in the point where it's at the highest value

1360
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:27,340
of the day

1361
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:32,040
and there's there's I have I have so many Bitcoin bookmarks that I also check but

1362
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:39,280
I believe coin average. That's the one I was gonna say Bitcoin average is just a little pin tab. Yeah, check out Bitcoin average

1363
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:44,440
We also have the we also have some Bitcoin functionality built into J bot. Oh, yeah, that's right

1364
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:48,000
Yeah, and if you want to follow news of the Bitcoin subreddit, it's usually pretty good

1365
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,960
you can go there and check that out Bitcoin still hanging around it's hanging around and

1366
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:58,000
Noah is actually still mining Bitcoin to this day. Oh, is he? Yeah. Wow, he does

1367
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,880
He has some dedicated rigs to wimpy. Do you mind any Bitcoin anymore? No, it's a false game. Yeah, I agree

1368
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:04,640
Yeah, I agree

1369
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:09,080
I think Noah gets the power for free for some reason and a like it's like from like this

1370
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:14,360
All right, this building overall payment that he made not even sure it's worth it for the heat that it generates

1371
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:18,920
Anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I did look into getting some of those

1372
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,160
faster USB

1373
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:29,400
A6 yeah to plug into a pie. Yeah, but the difficulty now is astronomical

1374
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:34,800
Even if you sort of used a dozen of those, you know, you yeah. Yeah, it's not worth it

1375
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:40,160
You're just you're just participating in network playing your role in keeping the network healthy

1376
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:47,480
But you're not actually gonna make anything you need some serious horsepower these days. I have I have I have been experiencing

1377
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:53,760
some interesting like holy what you're using Bitcoin and like

1378
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,280
Yeah Bitcoin, yeah, they what Bitcoin and I'm like

1379
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,160
I'm totally shocked

1380
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,800
I mean I look at them like you know what Bitcoin is they look at me like I've heard this word before but I have

1381
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,440
No idea what you're talking about

1382
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:10,760
There are more and more small independent shops in Washington

1383
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:16,960
That are using Bitcoin as a back-end payment as a back-end sort of

1384
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,080
What is the right word to use it's like it's like this it's the payment processing

1385
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:26,800
They're using Bitcoin to fund the transactions and the payment processing and then they're immediately converting it into cash

1386
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,360
Right, and so at the point-of-sales device, I give them a visa or a MasterCard

1387
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:39,480
but when they swipe it the payment processor is using Bitcoin to float the transaction or something and then

1388
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,040
the

1389
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,040
Merchant receives the payment in cash

1390
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:51,000
Interesting and this is there's a lot of little businesses doing this now and they have it hooked up to the tablets and Wow

1391
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:59,200
Yeah, so you just use your your visa regular Visa card, but Bitcoin is used on the back end as some sort of facility interesting facilitator

1392
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,360
Yeah, huh? I've been meaning to look into it more. We should definitely look into them

1393
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:07,840
Yeah, yeah. So anyways, it's it's Bitcoin still out there. Yeah, Electrum is my wall

1394
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:13,080
There's multi bits and other multi bits another good one. Yeah, check out but I like Electrum

1395
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:18,160
So when be do you do you have a wallet that you like to mention or do you want to talk about your setup at all?

1396
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:26,100
Well these days I use coin corner as my exchange and my wallet. Mmm coin corner. Yeah, nice

1397
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:32,000
so they're based in the Isle of Man which is in the shores of the

1398
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,720
British Isles, but

1399
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,080
independently governed I

1400
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,860
Like I like that. That was that was your requirement

1401
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:48,080
Well, it wasn't a requirement back when I was looking because I went through the whole you know getting out of Mount Gox

1402
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,980
That all yeah, I mean and and even when that was

1403
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,740
like the only reputable exchange around it was

1404
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,240
It was always a heart-in-mouth moment whenever you did any kind of

1405
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:07,400
Yes, gosh, it was man. It was just awful. So I was looking for an exchange and

1406
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,160
A few couple of years ago. Yeah about two years ago

1407
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:17,440
I found coin corner and they were a startup then but they'd got all the right bits in that they could do

1408
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,520
Sterling euros dollars

1409
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:27,600
they'd got all the necessary financial approvals they'd got a sensible bunch of people behind them and

1410
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,240
I

1411
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:34,120
Switched all that over to them and I've not looked back since they've been a really good service

1412
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:39,880
So they're much like coinbase, but that they are in this part of the world, which was kind of important

1413
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:45,880
Absolutely. Sure. That makes sense. And of course our our Bitcoin expert poppy any Bitcoin update from you?

1414
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:52,200
Hmm. No, it seems like he wandered off to bed. Nope. He doesn't have a Bitcoin update. I think he just

1415
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:57,800
Doesn't have one. He's counting all these bitcoins. Yes. Yeah filthy rich bastard

1416
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,520
All right

1417
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:03,720
That brings us to the end of this week's unplugged if you would like to send us an email go to Jupiter broadcasting comm

1418
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:10,100
Contact you're also encouraged to leave feedback wherever you watched this or visit the subreddit

1419
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,440
It Linux actually showed our reddit comm and man

1420
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:19,200
Would we love if you showed up live Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar and also shout out to the Linux gamer

1421
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,480
Who may be joining us next week on the program. That's right. Don't forget

1422
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:28,240
Tune in live at JB live TV and if you'd like to join our virtual lug go get mumble and then bang mumble in our

1423
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:49,760
Chat room to find out more. We'll see you back here next Tuesday

1424
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,240
Oh

1425
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:25,520
JB titles comm let's go pick our title you guys. Let's go figure out what we're gonna call this sucker. Hey guys

1426
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,920
Thanks for being here. It was a good show. I really appreciate a great mumble turnout. Yeah, absolutely

1427
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:33,500
Hmm that mumble the room virtual log

1428
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,080
While we do that

1429
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:45,080
Let's see if I can type now with the live updating too. So have you been doing desktop customization?

1430
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:49,640
What do you been you got what do you got going on over here? No, I I this has not been customized at all yet

1431
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:54,920
Oh, I installed I installed it as we started the show damn damn snickety

1432
01:28:54,920 --> 01:29:00,040
Thankfully causal is really easy to install so that's true. That's true. That's why I'm running Firefox. Well, I have Chrome now

1433
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:03,940
I just haven't switched Linux flying high Linux is for tweakers yikes

1434
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,160
Yeah, that's right week

1435
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,920
All right, well, let's see while

1436
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:18,040
While we go vote at JB titles comm a brief distraction. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

1437
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:22,240
You said commercial software. I don't know what to make of this Indiegogo project

1438
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:26,840
It's it's title it gets me excited big brother needs to be stopped

1439
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:34,440
Independence Day for your private data a new way of using cloud services and messaging apps and they've got 20 days left to raise some funds

1440
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,840
I'll play a little bit of their publicity video and maybe we can

1441
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:42,240
Can I get a larger version of here? They see it's trapped in the yeah. Here we go. Let's watch this thing

1442
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:47,960
Hi, we are saying we'd like to show you a new way using cloud services

1443
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:55,720
Messaging apps a way that's simpler and more secure than ever before. Are you one of the 1.6 billion people on our planet?

1444
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:02,240
Using messaging apps and cloud storage. It's kind of a cool track. You can share anything you want with the whole wide world

1445
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,200
But what if you don't want to share?

1446
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,560
Set even up to you

1447
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:14,880
Think about it. What actually happens to messages when you hit sent and what happens to your data when you upload it to your cloud service?

1448
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,680
Some cloud services are easy to use including for data snoops

1449
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:25,040
Some are transparent about what's under the hood and if you even manage to keep the door shut on big brother

1450
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:32,520
But there's not a single solution out there that delivers all three of these requirements, but with Zengi you're always protected

1451
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:36,680
Not only do we encrypt your data with the best available code

1452
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,000
We split every single file into countless fragments

1453
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:47,160
Which we then distribute across all cloud storage services you use. So this is like a layer that says on top of your cloud services

1454
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:48,920
I see interesting

1455
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:57,320
So for the cloud provider and anyone else your data is just a random collection of unreadable data chunks

1456
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:02,680
Because with Zengi only you have the key to the fully assembled files

1457
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:09,080
Nobody should see your messages, but the people who sent them to whatsapp and other providers claim they encrypt your message

1458
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:12,720
But you are also just claiming that you encrypt my message

1459
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:15,160
You got to give me a little more here and don't snoop on them

1460
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:23,160
But do you really believe them Zengi is open source so you can see yourself that our code secure and free of any backdoors

1461
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:26,040
I like that. Or get a nerd you can trust to check for you

1462
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:31,080
Zengi the world's first encryption solution for the people by the people

1463
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,080
Not some big multinational

1464
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:37,480
Even when there are secure solutions out there, they never just hand it to you on a platter

1465
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:43,000
The thing is your security shouldn't be some puzzle you have to solve

1466
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:43,960
He's got a Rubik's Cube

1467
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:47,000
It's a serious game and you should be free to play it by your own rules

1468
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:47,800
Did he saw that there?

1469
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,800
Rules that you configure

1470
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:53,000
You know what would be great is if it was part of you know

1471
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,440
You know, it's a stretch goal for a project like this that I would be totally behind is

1472
01:31:56,440 --> 01:32:01,640
You know you do your main funding for for actually accomplishing this

1473
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:06,040
But then in one of the stretch goals a full third party audit

1474
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:09,640
Oh, that would be great. Yeah, that would be a great stretch goal that I could get behind

1475
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,640
Using the simplicity of Zengi

1476
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:19,080
Rules that protect you and the people who you really trust

1477
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:21,400
If somebody is hyper security conscious

1478
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,280
Are they less likely to use a Fitbit because he's got a Fitbit on

1479
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:25,400
I don't know

1480
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,360
Who those people are

1481
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:28,760
What they're thinking

1482
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:29,480
Where they're from

1483
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,560
How they look like

1484
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,600
What they're working on

1485
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:33,240
How they look like

1486
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,440
And who they are

1487
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:38,680
Basically everything they want to keep private is protected by Zengi

1488
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:42,040
Zengi works and for one very simple reason

1489
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:50,840
Security transparency and usability to give you back total control

1490
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,360
Stu!

1491
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:55,240
I feel like this is also them wanting to show off their entire team

1492
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:55,880
Yeah, probably

1493
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:58,200
That guy did just solve that Rubik's cube in the background

1494
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,000
That was kind of cool

1495
01:32:59,000 --> 01:32:59,880
All right, that is cool

1496
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:02,680
Other solutions lets you choose a key

1497
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:06,360
With Zengi you have ownership of the key and the lock

1498
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:10,680
Zengi will create a complete ecosystem where security

1499
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:15,160
Transparency and usability are yours anytime anywhere

1500
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:19,000
So your digital identity is always protected

1501
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,320
And sometimes that can be pretty important

1502
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:25,960
And Zengi puts you back in control of your personal data

1503
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:30,280
Zengi will give you the power to protect your digital identity

1504
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,360
These guys do look a bit like a stereotype though

1505
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,080
Good for them though

1506
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:37,320
Okay

1507
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,720
Their music sounds like a radio spy novel

1508
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,320
Yeah, that's a good way to put it

1509
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,680
I like that, that's a nice way to put it

1510
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:46,440
So let's look at the

1511
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:49,640
Let's see if they tell us much about the underlying technology

1512
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:52,680
They have good dress like a boss, that's cool

1513
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:54,680
They have cool the all in

1514
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:57,160
They have good price levels

1515
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,240
Let's see though

1516
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,160
We got to get some details on this

1517
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:06,120
They say they created a foundation for a new standard of security and transparency and usability

1518
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,480
Well, those are all things that we like

1519
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,440
That sounds good

1520
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,800
That's not the details I want

1521
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:13,640
They say that your data is encrypted with AES 256

1522
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:17,480
It is split into tiny chunks and distributed to all cloud services you use

1523
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:21,320
So for the cloud provider, it sounds like it really is a layer that sits on top of your

1524
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:24,120
Dropbox in your Google Drive and just gives them bits and pieces

1525
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:29,080
So what happens if you split it between all these places and one of them goes down

1526
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:29,960
Is all your data gone?

1527
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,840
I think they're saying that it sounds like they're

1528
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:36,680
They're not splitting it across the separate things, but they're splitting it

1529
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:40,280
They have to know how to put pieces back together and they're all

1530
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:44,360
They have all the bits, but they're put there because they're separated

1531
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:47,160
You'd have to have the key to put them all back together

1532
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:50,760
It looks like Linux isn't supported until $70,000 is raised

1533
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,480
But it says it's a messaging app, right?

1534
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,480
It's not clear

1535
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,360
It says it does those things

1536
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:57,960
How does it actually sync with other users?

1537
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:00,040
Does your phone do the federation?

1538
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:02,360
Here's the question

1539
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,120
Can I use my existing cloud accounts?

1540
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:05,240
Absolutely

1541
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,280
You can link all your existing cloud accounts or simply add new ones

1542
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:11,560
However, the data in your existing accounts must be re-uploaded to guarantee full security

1543
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:12,520
Wow, that's interesting

1544
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,040
Geez

1545
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:17,880
These guys become the gatekeeper for all of your online services

1546
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:19,480
That's what I was thinking

1547
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:24,120
You're now trusting a company you've never heard of with all of your online storage

1548
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,640
They would argue that's their advantage

1549
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:30,200
Is that they are a non-multinational small group of folks

1550
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,200
That are creating something by the people for the people

1551
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:32,920
That's what they say

1552
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:33,720
That's their argument

1553
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,640
I mean, you trust inseminators for something

1554
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:38,920
Even your grandma can use it

1555
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:40,680
Is that thing plugged in?

1556
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:41,800
Does that say it's plugged in there, Wes?

1557
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:42,600
Is that what it says there?

1558
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,360
Can you tell, I don't know what those icons mean

1559
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:45,640
Windows

1560
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:46,120
Yeah, I don't

1561
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:47,160
It does look like it, yes

1562
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:47,640
Okay

1563
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:49,000
Fully charged, 100%

1564
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:49,800
Okay

1565
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:50,280
Does have a little

1566
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,520
Their goal is only $35,000?

1567
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,920
Yeah, and they don't have Linux support until 70

1568
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,360
What?

1569
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:59,080
But like, what are they going to do with $35,000?

1570
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:02,440
Are they planning to bang this out in like a month with four people?

1571
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,760
They would have to have already had a bunch of funding, I would think

1572
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:10,040
So I think, unfortunately, even though it's something we'd all like

1573
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:11,320
I think we're all saying nope

1574
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:13,240
I think it's kind of a nope

1575
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,920
The goal just doesn't make sense

1576
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,720
Yeah, they would be such a critical point of failure

1577
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,960
How do you sustain yourself on $35,000?

1578
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:23,560
And how do you, and then, so they show it right here in their diagram

1579
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:27,560
If you are the front end proxy to all of these different services

1580
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:33,080
And the ones they have, they have Box, Pax, OwnCloud, and Drive on here

1581
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:35,880
They actually don't have Dropbox's icon, but they have all the other ones on here

1582
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,600
So two things, like was just mentioned

1583
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,080
If they go offline, you can't get access to your data potentially

1584
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:47,720
But aren't you just giving the government the best gift in the entire world?

1585
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:50,360
They just have, instead of having to go to four different providers

1586
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,120
They just go to one provider?

1587
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:54,520
And even if they just got the metadata

1588
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:57,720
If they just got the time and date and where you upload it to, that'd be something

1589
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:01,000
I mean, this seems like this is one place to serve a national security letter to

1590
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,200
Instead of four different places

1591
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:07,320
Even if it's not getting the data

1592
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,640
Even if you're just getting the time and date the user logged in

1593
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,400
The IP they logged in from

1594
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,520
And the amount of data they uploaded to and the services they went to

1595
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,520
That's valuable information

1596
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:19,320
Well, is Sangy actually storing anything on their end?

1597
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:22,360
Or is it just a software solution that combines all your cloud accounts?

1598
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:23,800
Well, I'm not saying they're storing the data

1599
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:27,080
But they probably have logs of when you connected and logged in and transferred

1600
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:27,640
I've been asking them

1601
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,200
They should tell us these things, perhaps

1602
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,960
There's a lot of implementation questions

1603
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:36,280
What are you doing this?

1604
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,320
I like how they're growing that

1605
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:40,200
We created a foundation for a new standard of security and transparency

1606
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,080
They keep going after this

1607
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:44,360
But then they're not very transparent about how this works at all

1608
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,080
They say that they're going to put their code up on GitHub

1609
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,760
But that doesn't make it transparent

1610
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:49,320
No, not really

1611
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:52,680
That's like the first thing that you do on the transparency

1612
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,520
Doesn't tell us what you're doing on the server side, though

1613
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,720
Doesn't tell us how you're logging it

1614
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,320
Oh, where the phones go

1615
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:58,360
This is good

1616
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,960
They're making it secure for Linux

1617
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,160
Because you're not able to use it

1618
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:02,360
Right

1619
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:03,880
Oh, excellent point

1620
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:05,160
You have a thing that says where the phone

1621
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:05,640
Oh, where?

1622
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:07,720
Yeah, scroll down on their Indiegogo page

1623
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,720
And there's like bars and these graphs

1624
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:12,920
And it's like 50% of the stuff goes to development and admin

1625
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,040
And then there's like marketing

1626
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,000
Oh, that's what that is

1627
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,680
That's known as a chart, Chris

1628
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,560
Oh, there it is

1629
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,040
There it is

1630
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:23,320
That's at $100,000

1631
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:26,520
$17,000 goes to development for your base goal?

1632
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:30,600
For what it's supposed to be like a world premiere secure product?

1633
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:34,120
Yeah, it has to integrate with like eight different services out of the box

1634
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:40,200
Yeah, who's like, are they like going to take on the burden of maintaining all of those API wrappers all the time?

1635
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,040
Yeah, boy, that just right there could be a job

1636
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:43,160
Yikes

1637
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:50,040
Not to mention, I'm sure that Dropbox and Google is not super keen to having a third party between them and their customers

1638
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:53,240
Because from Google's standpoint, Google wants to do their utmost

1639
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:55,560
Supposedly to protect your privacy and data

1640
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,160
So they're not going to like this

1641
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:59,400
This reminds me of like when you used to be able to use a

1642
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:06,760
If there was a fuse layer so that you could store files in your gmail storage by like split it up and do a lot of different emails

1643
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:09,480
I think somebody, I think a company should take LibreVault

1644
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:13,560
Or something like SyncThing and productize it and just say use

1645
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:19,400
Use and sell it as combining all of your computer's hard drives into one online secure storage

1646
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:19,960
Right

1647
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:24,520
No online cloud account, no service, no account required

1648
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:29,800
Just uses all of your devices storage and pools them together in a super secure encrypted way

1649
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:33,240
Why is that not a product that people are selling on Indiegogo or Kickstarter?

1650
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,120
That seems pretty obvious

1651
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:35,080
Because grandma couldn't use it

1652
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:35,960
It's all about grandma

1653
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:39,960
And also they wouldn't be able to do a subscription service

1654
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:53,720
Oh you got it, yeah that's true
