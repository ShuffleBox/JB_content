WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.580
Wes can I interest you in snakeware? It's a free Linux distribution with a full Python user space

00:08.220 --> 00:14.980
Inspired by the Commodore 64. Oh boy, you had me at Python and well the creepy name snakeware

00:15.220 --> 00:20.900
This looks pretty cool though. You're booted directly into a Python interpreter and you can do whatever you want

00:20.900 --> 00:29.900
Now you should also note that snakeware. Yeah, it doesn't use x11. Definitely not Wayland. It just writes directly to the frame buffer

00:40.480 --> 00:46.320
Hello friends and welcome into 356 of your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes

00:46.320 --> 00:54.100
Hello, Wes. I've been looking forward to hearing your take on the XPS 13 for a couple of weeks now and in my hot little hands

00:54.100 --> 00:58.860
I have the Pinebook Pro. We'll tell you more about our hardware extravaganza

00:58.940 --> 01:01.860
But of course, we have some community news in 356

01:01.860 --> 01:06.700
I got a little clarification on what's going down with the GNOME patent suit as

01:07.020 --> 01:11.940
Well as some great features landing in the latest Linux kernel. We have some feedback

01:12.220 --> 01:15.780
We may even have some pics who knows but before I can get to any of that

01:15.780 --> 01:20.860
I got to say hi to the guys over there in the red chairs. Hello cheese Andrew. Hello

01:21.780 --> 01:27.620
Hello, thanks for bringing your own chairs guys. Mm-hmm. Yeah, of course. Yeah, I mean after what happened last week

01:27.620 --> 01:29.620
I don't blame you, right? Right

01:30.460 --> 01:34.180
What was so sticky there? I never figured that out. It's the honey Wes

01:34.180 --> 01:46.020
I told you we shouldn't use the honey and also of course our virtual lug is here time appropriate. Greetings mumble room. Stay a while

01:47.060 --> 01:52.780
Hello mumble room good to have you along had a fun virtual lug over the weekend

01:52.780 --> 01:59.100
We'll tell you more about that and a little bit but let's start with GNOME getting a big open source

01:59.100 --> 02:08.260
patent win now you might remember back in 2019 the dome foundation was sued by Rothschild patent imaging for violating its wireless image distribution system and

02:08.820 --> 02:10.580
method patent, of course

02:10.580 --> 02:13.300
Rothschild a non-practicing entity, which is

02:14.140 --> 02:17.140
business speak for a patent troll has filed

02:18.540 --> 02:21.300
714 lawsuits over the past six years

02:21.300 --> 02:29.420
But now in a surprising move GNOME has won not only a release and covenant not to be sued for any Rothschild

02:30.100 --> 02:37.420
Specific patent but a release and covenant to any software that is released under an existing open source initiative

02:38.020 --> 02:45.020
Approved license, right? So they're essentially not going after anyone who is covered by an OSI approved license

02:45.020 --> 02:47.500
So it's not completely a green light

02:47.500 --> 02:54.460
But it's a green light for tons and tons of projects dozens many projects the Shotwell open source image organizer

02:54.980 --> 02:59.700
infringed on a 2008 patent because it used an image capturing device to import and

03:00.180 --> 03:06.460
Filter photographic images from cameras and then it would allow users to organize those photos and share them on social media

03:06.740 --> 03:10.980
Yeah, nothing does that right right that patent would apply to just about every kind of software

03:11.620 --> 03:16.280
Fortunately for no they had friends including the open invention network

03:16.280 --> 03:21.220
Which we've mentioned before and is a pro Linux patent non-aggression consortium

03:21.980 --> 03:28.540
Faced with opposition like that and the possibility of losing their patents in the lawsuit. Well Rothschild backed off

03:29.240 --> 03:34.060
Making the best of it. Well, I Rothschild managing member of Rothschild Trust Holdings said

03:34.340 --> 03:36.340
I'm pleased that we've managed to settle this issue

03:36.780 --> 03:43.740
Amicably, I've always supported the innovation of open source software maintenance developers and encourage its innovation and adoption

03:43.740 --> 03:49.500
Yeah, uh-huh. It sounds genuine. So Wes I had a bunch of questions about this because

03:50.180 --> 03:53.300
We talked about this aspect on the show the genome

03:53.940 --> 03:58.980
Foundation took some funding to fight this but then at the end of it

03:58.980 --> 04:01.340
It looked like they didn't have any settlement to pay out

04:01.340 --> 04:07.620
They didn't have any legal fees to necessarily pay seemed because some of that was also going to be covered

04:07.620 --> 04:09.700
So I wasn't really clear on where the money it went

04:09.700 --> 04:16.420
So I emailed Neil McGovern the executive director of the Gnome Foundation and I asked him, you know

04:16.420 --> 04:23.220
What's happening with the money what happened with the money that was contributed and as you would expect he writes as with any court case

04:23.660 --> 04:28.420
Things get expensive really fast. Although our lawyers were working on pro bono

04:28.580 --> 04:31.160
There's a large number of other expenses

04:31.160 --> 04:36.400
We have from court filing fees and prior art searches to even flights and hotels

04:36.400 --> 04:40.520
Which I think is the aspect of these court cases

04:40.520 --> 04:46.480
We don't talk a lot about and it was pretty awesome that they had lawyers working pro bono for them. I mean, that's incredible

04:46.480 --> 04:51.720
No kidding. It really doesn't it show you unity there? Yeah, definitely right that you've got this, you know

04:51.720 --> 04:55.840
You're all you're all working together and that we can defend the cause of open source software

04:56.120 --> 05:01.240
The important thing he says he continues is I want people to know that we didn't pay RPI

05:01.240 --> 05:04.900
That's the Rothschild patent imaging folks for the settlement agreement

05:04.900 --> 05:08.640
They didn't receive any money from us

05:09.640 --> 05:13.440
Now there is more to this settlement that wasn't

05:14.140 --> 05:20.760
publicly available and Neil kind of hinted to that that there was more details and if you had a project that is

05:21.080 --> 05:26.920
Covered by an OSI compliant license you can email him to get these details

05:27.440 --> 05:32.280
But they're not otherwise publicly available. So I said, what can you tell me? What what about these things?

05:32.280 --> 05:39.480
Can you share with me and he writes? I'm a little restrained here. Usually a settlement agreement is confidential in this particular case

05:39.480 --> 05:47.060
I wanted to ensure that those affected by the Covenant not to sue was able to inspect the protections we had gained for them

05:47.940 --> 05:49.940
Also, it shows that we didn't pay them any money

05:50.000 --> 05:57.320
He goes on to say this means that I can pass on the full and unedited agreement to those who are arguably covered by the CNS

05:57.320 --> 06:02.600
This means that anyone who has authored a non-trivial bit of free software can request a copy

06:03.000 --> 06:05.360
But I can't just put it on a website

06:05.960 --> 06:11.800
However, if you have any extra particular questions about the agreement, I can probably answer those Neil isn't that great?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.920
So they didn't pay any money to RPI

06:14.200 --> 06:21.860
They had the lawyers that were there pro bono and the community funding covered all of those extras like prior art searches flights

06:21.860 --> 06:27.460
hotels all of the admin stuff for this case and the walkaway win here is an

06:27.740 --> 06:30.680
Agreement that if you have an OSI compliant license, which is a lot of them

06:30.780 --> 06:36.420
You're not gonna get sued by this patent troll. It didn't invalidate the patent which would have been the ultimate win

06:36.820 --> 06:41.620
But it's pretty darn close West. Yeah, it is now the weird amount of secrecy

06:41.620 --> 06:46.940
All the lawyer lawyer Lee goings on still a little disappointing and I'm not quite clear

06:46.940 --> 06:53.140
What non-trivial piece of free software really means but it's definitely a win. Yeah, and

06:53.820 --> 06:58.460
It's nice to see this happen for Shotwell who I I'm not positive

06:58.460 --> 07:02.380
But I don't even believe Shotwell is part of like the default gnome core. I

07:03.220 --> 07:09.140
Mean, I don't know if it necessarily was the gnome foundations obligation here to help, but I think they did anyway

07:09.140 --> 07:12.240
I I'm not positive on that. I say this to the patent trolls

07:12.240 --> 07:16.680
Leave our free software alone. Yeah, I'm flushing them down the studio toilet

07:17.640 --> 07:22.080
That's where a lot of things go around here. So thank you Neal for answering those questions because you know

07:22.080 --> 07:27.040
I asked him was like so what did the money go for where did the money go Neal and I gave me a very straight

07:27.040 --> 07:33.120
Answer and I really appreciate that. Maybe let us know if you've got further questions and you know, we can drill down a little bit deeper

07:33.120 --> 07:36.880
Yeah, absolutely. He left that line of communication open so I'd be willing to do that

07:36.880 --> 07:39.360
but I'm very pleased to see it and

07:39.360 --> 07:43.800
This is a way that larger software projects and foundations can contribute beyond

07:44.600 --> 07:49.520
organizational and financial stability and it's great to see it a new kernel landed West

07:50.080 --> 07:53.440
version five dot seven since we all gathered together and

07:54.120 --> 07:59.000
There's many many many things in this kernel release including the new official

07:59.560 --> 08:03.840
ExFAT file system driver that is the code from Samsung the good one a good one

08:03.840 --> 08:05.840
Yes, but I wanted to talk about

08:05.840 --> 08:12.840
The thermal pressure in the task scheduler support now because this opened my eye to a problem that I didn't fully appreciate on Linux

08:12.840 --> 08:15.840
That kind of seems obvious on its face

08:16.400 --> 08:22.320
When a CPU is overheating probably a common scenario for my Raspberry Pi's or for your laptop the thermal governor

08:22.560 --> 08:26.680
Will usually cap the maximum CPU frequency. We're all familiar with that

08:27.400 --> 08:28.520
however

08:28.520 --> 08:33.320
This decreases the maximum available compute capacity of the CPU

08:33.320 --> 08:40.240
Obviously, if a task scheduler is not immediately aware of those frequency changes

08:40.240 --> 08:42.240
IE Linux is task scheduler

08:42.240 --> 08:49.000
It will take the wrong scheduling decisions assuming that the CPU has greater computing capacity

08:49.640 --> 08:51.640
Than it actually has

08:52.280 --> 08:56.800
Never really thought about this, but the scheduler is looking at it going. This is a CPU at this speed

08:56.800 --> 08:59.800
It's not aware that the governor's kicker is at this speed

08:59.800 --> 09:06.200
A CPU at this speed it's not aware that the governor's kicked in and it keeps scheduling stuff as if that

09:06.320 --> 09:08.320
CPU is at full capacity

09:08.400 --> 09:14.200
So this release in 5.7 introduces the notion of thermal pressure

09:14.520 --> 09:23.040
Which makes the task scheduler more aware of frequency capping and leads to better task placement among available CPUs in the event of overheating

09:23.440 --> 09:29.360
Which then in turn leads to better CPU performance numbers. This is just so cool

09:29.360 --> 09:33.240
I mean, we've already worked some on memory pressure getting added to the kernel

09:33.240 --> 09:37.800
You know just to better understand what that's like and now that we have thermal pressure added

09:37.800 --> 09:40.760
I think this is gonna be huge when at least eventually

09:40.760 --> 09:45.040
I mean, you know, no one's running 5.7 at least not very many just yet

09:45.040 --> 09:48.600
But once it makes its way to the distros, this is gotta be good for laptop users

09:48.680 --> 09:49.760
Yeah, I think so

09:49.760 --> 09:55.160
I think although it could be wrong because I'm not super familiar with the bowels of Mac OS

09:55.160 --> 10:01.520
But I think this is similar to how the kernel task scheduler process works in Mac OS

10:01.800 --> 10:08.400
Where it is monitoring the temperature sensors even including the ports where you plug in your power adapters

10:08.400 --> 10:14.560
They have temperature sensors there and it's monitoring the overall chassis temperature of your laptops

10:14.560 --> 10:16.880
And then this kernel task process

10:17.760 --> 10:23.520
Will start eating more CPU to make the CPU is look busier to the scheduler

10:23.520 --> 10:27.320
But doesn't actually reduce the frequency and keeps the thermal load lower

10:27.800 --> 10:30.680
They don't expose the thermal pressure information though

10:30.680 --> 10:36.920
Like this Linux API will like this is going to be a kernel level thing that also exposes that metric as information

10:36.960 --> 10:42.960
So you can monitor that thermal pressure and that is an example of where Linux once once it gets a feature like this

10:43.280 --> 10:48.800
It's always so much cooler. Yeah, you know, there is definitely a little bit of a barrier to get things into the kernel

10:48.800 --> 10:54.160
But once they're there you've got this amazing community of folks who can all work to make it better

10:54.160 --> 10:59.680
Right before we move on from new kernel features. There's a patch that is being discussed right now

10:59.680 --> 11:02.640
So that's the phase this one's in just in the discussion phase

11:03.400 --> 11:06.580
That is necessary to land in the Linux kernel

11:07.200 --> 11:08.760
for newer

11:08.760 --> 11:14.960
Windows games on wine to work properly. Wait, this is kernel stuff about Windows games

11:14.960 --> 11:20.040
Yes for wine stuff, which you can maybe get a feel for why the conversations a bit awkward

11:21.400 --> 11:27.880
But newer Windows games and even applications are making use of system call instructions from the application code without

11:28.320 --> 11:29.920
resorting to the win API

11:29.920 --> 11:34.640
Which is wines mega tricks and it's breaking that wine emulation support

11:34.640 --> 11:41.000
Which is not an emulator a Linux kernel patch that it's being worked on would address this issue in the form of a system call

11:41.160 --> 11:42.000
isolation

11:42.000 --> 11:48.760
based on memory areas while having a smaller performance hit than say some alternatives where you do it all in user space and

11:48.960 --> 11:51.440
That's pretty important when you're talking about games

11:51.840 --> 11:59.120
So with newer Windows software, they're basically just executing system call instructions directly without going through the Windows API

11:59.560 --> 12:06.840
So that means wine isn't able to intercept those with their implementation of the Windows API and then emulate those system calls

12:06.840 --> 12:10.420
And that means those games just don't work under wine

12:10.420 --> 12:16.980
Wine can't really rework its handling of every single system call. That was just trash performance

12:17.820 --> 12:22.220
So that's why you basically need a Linux kernel based solution for this

12:22.900 --> 12:24.900
Gabrielle Chrisman Burtazi of

12:25.300 --> 12:29.340
Collabora the consulting firm that has helped valve in all kinds of these, you know

12:29.340 --> 12:36.420
Linux gaming efforts posted an initial patch to the kernels sec comp mailing list implementing a system call isolation mechanism

12:37.100 --> 12:39.100
based on memory areas

12:39.100 --> 12:44.900
Sec comp which is short for a secure computing is traditionally used for Linux security matters

12:44.900 --> 12:47.660
And this really isn't for security in this implementation

12:48.220 --> 12:53.620
But sec comp already has all these mechanisms in the kernel for filtering system calls

12:54.060 --> 12:55.980
So basically with this patch

12:55.980 --> 13:00.940
Set comp gains an ability to sort of filter things in this new virtual memory attribute

13:00.940 --> 13:05.020
That's used for tracking where in memory these calls are coming from

13:05.020 --> 13:11.940
So since wine can set this up and basically say like yes, I know that I've set the program up with this virtual memory area

13:12.180 --> 13:18.500
It can then use if accepted this patch and sec comp to filter all those calls and then do the patching

13:18.780 --> 13:23.940
Filtering and adjustments that wine needs to do to make sure that those system calls get translated correctly

13:25.180 --> 13:29.300
Wow, now they did look into using the existing sec comp filtering

13:29.300 --> 13:35.940
But that's like a 10% performance penalty and if you just do it with isolation based on memory areas like their proposed plan

13:36.220 --> 13:41.240
That's 1.5 percent and that's a lot better. Isn't it interesting to see

13:41.860 --> 13:48.940
Windows and Linux making changes to bring each other slightly closer together in some ways and that is fascinating

13:48.940 --> 13:51.100
I mean, it's no longer a you know

13:51.100 --> 13:54.860
Not quite the Cold War of old anymore and you know

13:54.860 --> 14:01.580
So many people especially with proton are using wine for playing games on Linux. So hopefully that you know with that sort of momentum

14:02.340 --> 14:08.540
The kernel developers won't object too much. I guess we'll see but you know, this change is under a hundred lines of code

14:08.540 --> 14:15.140
So it's not like it's muddy enough the kernel too much. Yeah, we're not talking like a huge change to Linux kernel here

14:15.140 --> 14:21.680
I like to think about this from like 2002 Chris where I was really in the prime of my everything must be Linux

14:21.680 --> 14:25.400
This would be heresy to even suggest such a thing

14:25.520 --> 14:28.720
But if you look at this, it's it's not a major change

14:28.720 --> 14:35.560
It opens the door to bringing even more application could bit of compatibility to Linux. It's not something we'll see immediately

14:35.560 --> 14:38.760
It's not gonna land in 5-8. That's kind of too late

14:38.760 --> 14:45.160
It may may end up in 5-9 if they go ahead with it later this year, but we'll see only a time

14:45.160 --> 14:49.400
We'll tell but yeah, you're right at some point things just get tricky, especially when you're emulating

14:49.400 --> 14:53.840
I mean not really emulating but you know, you're trying to pretend that you're a Windows system

14:53.840 --> 14:57.500
And there's just so much going on there. And of course, that's a target that doesn't stand still

14:58.000 --> 15:05.680
Wes I am excited to say that I have received my Pinebook Pro. Oh, no way awesome

15:06.440 --> 15:09.720
Yep, it's a nice nice rig. I

15:10.600 --> 15:13.720
Love it already. I open it up. I took it out of the box

15:13.720 --> 15:17.320
I didn't have a strong immediate reaction to it because it's it just looks nice

15:17.320 --> 15:22.560
It's not striking any particular way, but it's also not like ugly in any particular way. So I took out. Okay, that's great

15:22.560 --> 15:23.940
Take it out of the box

15:23.940 --> 15:28.200
Booted it up as I started to use it over the next few minutes. I started to realize

15:28.200 --> 15:34.320
Oh, this is gonna be one of those devices one of those that's in my bag all the time that I carry with me

15:34.320 --> 15:36.320
I was hoping in the back of my mind

15:37.280 --> 15:43.020
That this would be a solid alternative something like an iPad Pro with a keyboard. That's a big ask right there

15:43.320 --> 15:47.000
Well, if you look at what I use an iPad for not really because I use it for a web browser

15:47.000 --> 15:49.300
I use it for a terminal a lot and

15:50.720 --> 15:54.680
Telegram and chat apps. I haven't tried all the different chat apps yet, but

15:55.320 --> 15:57.880
Man, is it really great? It's light

15:58.360 --> 16:05.480
The keyboard is solid. It has way more travel to the keys than I expected for a keyboard in 2020. It's

16:06.160 --> 16:08.120
so far

16:08.120 --> 16:11.560
Performing very well battery wise. It's probably been off battery for

16:11.560 --> 16:17.340
Um, uh, does it tell me no it doesn't tell me but it tells me I have eight hours of runtime left

16:17.800 --> 16:22.720
So that's pretty good night. I would guesstimate that it's been off for about an hour

16:23.280 --> 16:27.400
Maybe even slightly more than that. Maybe an hour and a half boy. Am I impressed now?

16:27.400 --> 16:33.720
I know cheese you traveled with yours to system 76. So this is sort of a unit that you have

16:34.280 --> 16:39.580
Extended hands-on with at this point. Are you still using it on a semi daily basis? Yeah

16:39.580 --> 16:47.460
I mean I use it mainly for all of my 3d printing needs so slicing and you know checking out models

16:48.200 --> 16:52.640
adjusting models and stuff like that and then of course, you know telegram and

16:53.320 --> 16:56.480
Browsing and just general kind of couchsurfing

16:57.000 --> 17:00.640
Computing, you know, so that's it seems to fit that and that niche really well

17:00.640 --> 17:04.520
And yeah, you know whenever I ran it at the system 76 event for a week

17:04.520 --> 17:09.960
Yeah, I was using it primarily as as a device just for that writing up some reviews

17:09.960 --> 17:14.480
And you should have held it up and said guys you could just build one of these you could just well

17:14.480 --> 17:16.480
You know, I did put it in Carl's hands

17:16.640 --> 17:22.960
Good. I've showed him, you know the machine and he was actually really really surprised by the machine and

17:23.840 --> 17:30.640
You know big up to Dan and and all the guys over at Manjaro that have put a bunch of work into this machine as well

17:30.640 --> 17:37.080
Yeah, Manjaro really really sings on this thing and it makes it feel like a powerful workstation

17:37.080 --> 17:41.680
It doesn't just seem like a toy. I think it seems like I've got

17:42.400 --> 17:45.220
Nearly the entire Linux universe of software available to me

17:46.000 --> 17:48.860
Dan is joining us today Dan. Welcome to the unplug program

17:48.960 --> 17:53.480
Thank you, and then explain your role with the project before we go too far because sometimes I'm horrible at that

17:53.480 --> 17:58.280
Well, I'm the you can call it lead developer of the Manjaro arm branch

17:58.280 --> 18:01.960
So you are the perfect gentleman to have on the show as we are talking about this

18:02.360 --> 18:04.560
I'd love to know a little bit of the background of the work

18:04.560 --> 18:06.960
It went into if you anything you do know about the work

18:06.960 --> 18:10.000
It went into getting this thing singing like it does on the Pine Book Pro

18:10.040 --> 18:13.560
The main thing is probably the main line of the kernel

18:13.560 --> 18:17.820
Oh, I bet that went into five dot seven now, but we've been running our own

18:18.640 --> 18:24.800
Kernel repo branch for a while since five dot four five dot five on the Pine Book Pro

18:24.800 --> 18:29.920
And so what aspects of Pine Book Pro hardware have been mainlined almost everything?

18:30.760 --> 18:34.520
except the battery that's going into five dot eight and the

18:35.520 --> 18:40.200
Display port alternate mode. It's also missing and suspend is missing. This is why I think

18:41.320 --> 18:48.880
Manjaro is such a great candidate for these ARM platform devices because it's not all there yet

18:48.880 --> 18:54.080
And you need something that's going to be really fresh because the stuff is inbound right now

18:54.080 --> 18:58.240
We are living in the era where these fixes and the support is landing

18:58.240 --> 19:02.640
But if you use a distribution that doesn't update very often its hardware support

19:02.920 --> 19:10.240
You basically end up with a machine that isn't fully functional. Yeah. Well the previous OS was Debian and that was using a

19:11.240 --> 19:16.400
Very specific kernel built on 4.4, which was specific for the Pine Book Pro

19:16.400 --> 19:20.000
So that had most of the things working. So do you have a bunch of ARM?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.720
SBCs around your place to I do I have a lot

19:25.400 --> 19:29.800
How many do you roughly would you guesstimate I guess about 15 Wow, oh

19:30.120 --> 19:33.620
Okay, are they mostly all one type or all different kinds?

19:33.620 --> 19:39.600
Like I'm curious what you're finding to be your favorite all that like for me mine are obviously

19:39.600 --> 19:45.000
I love the pi 4 and I love the rock pro 64. Yeah, those are my favorites as well

19:45.000 --> 19:46.960
I have a lot of the

19:46.960 --> 19:52.760
Love the pies. I have all the way back to the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 then 4 and

19:53.320 --> 20:00.720
I have lots of the pine 64 devices because of our partnership. They shipped them out to me, which is nice. Yeah, no kidding

20:00.720 --> 20:05.040
I see you invited Dan on just to normalize your Raspberry Pi collection Chris, right?

20:05.440 --> 20:09.320
Absolutely. I just got to clip this out and send it to Alex now because he's giving me a hard time

20:09.320 --> 20:18.920
Yeah, the rock pro 64 for me was sort of a the next level of these SBCs because of that PCI Express slot and then I

20:18.920 --> 20:24.120
When I threw the MV me drive in there and I'm sitting there getting performance that seems

20:24.680 --> 20:27.340
Well, it seems absolutely comparable to an x86 system

20:27.420 --> 20:33.340
Yeah, it's really great device and the Pine Book Pro is really close if I understand to the rock pro 64

20:33.340 --> 20:38.400
Is there any any major deviations that you're aware of other than different ports the different ports?

20:38.400 --> 20:41.840
And of course the displays and stuff, but otherwise, it's basically the same

20:43.360 --> 20:46.660
Stock and board that's in it. So it also has the PCI

20:47.240 --> 20:52.480
slot inside it kind of feels like the plasma desktop is

20:53.600 --> 20:58.120
Sort of at the edge of what the device is comfortable performing it works for sure

20:58.120 --> 21:02.680
But like I get the I get the I get kind of the chunkiness when I'm resizing windows

21:02.680 --> 21:09.880
So why plasma as the version to ship? I love it. I'm gonna keep it, but I'm just curious what the what the thinking was

21:09.960 --> 21:16.520
well, I'm a plasma guy myself, so I I was pretty hooked on getting that to work pretty good and the

21:17.920 --> 21:24.720
GPU drivers also pretty far ahead now so they can actually run plasma. So the plasma you're running on the device

21:24.720 --> 21:26.200
It's actually hardware accelerated

21:26.200 --> 21:30.920
it's awesome and the login screen and lock screen looks super sharp and clean and

21:30.920 --> 21:37.240
The when I'm logging into the desktop the progress bar. It sort of fades up from the bottom very nice and smooth

21:37.240 --> 21:44.320
It's it's a pretty tight experience and I wouldn't have thought it'd be possible a couple of years ago. So it's it's great

21:44.320 --> 21:46.320
I'm glad it it feels like that that

21:46.840 --> 21:51.880
addition of plasma and of course the repositories available to mangero and

21:52.520 --> 21:55.600
The the work that you've put into it to make it all really sing

21:56.360 --> 21:59.920
It made it feel like full-fledged product not a hobby toy

21:59.920 --> 22:02.600
That came with a cool arch install on it

22:02.880 --> 22:10.640
But it made it feel like a full-fledged product that is actually competitive for what I would use a thousand dollar tablet for

22:10.640 --> 22:15.000
Yeah, we were even for giving it a pretty much a desktop feel

22:15.000 --> 22:19.320
It's it's remarkable for the price and and and for the and for the board

22:19.320 --> 22:22.920
So as we get into the XPS 13 here in just a few moments

22:22.920 --> 22:27.720
It's got I think a higher bar it has to hit now because this for what you get for around

22:27.720 --> 22:32.840
$300 the Pine Book Pro gives you a great terminal experience gives you a great browser experience

22:32.840 --> 22:37.240
I watched some live stream videos and Firefox on it worked just fine

22:37.240 --> 22:41.240
I brought the whole thing up to date installed a ton of packages on it

22:41.240 --> 22:47.520
Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna say it felt like it was some super performing I 732 gigs of RAM system

22:47.520 --> 22:52.040
But when I look at the relative price points and the fact that you could save a thousand dollars

22:52.040 --> 22:59.640
And you're still getting in your terminal web browser email chat work done still feels like a real laptop with a good keyboard

22:59.640 --> 23:03.200
To Wes that was the other thing that surprised me. I don't love the trackpad

23:03.200 --> 23:05.560
That's my main criticism of the overall hardware

23:05.560 --> 23:09.600
How have you felt she's using that trackpad for an extended period of time is that you get used to it?

23:09.600 --> 23:13.480
Mmm. I'm not a huge fan of it. I would imagine that the version that you have

23:14.560 --> 23:17.800
Has been flashed to have the new firmware for the trackpad

23:18.800 --> 23:20.800
the early first

23:20.800 --> 23:25.400
Shipment of those devices. It was pretty horrible. The palm rejection was really bad. I

23:26.040 --> 23:31.340
Usually just hook up a little USB mouse to it and I'm fine rock and roll that way, you know

23:31.340 --> 23:34.600
And it should be said too. I think Dan and you can correct me if I'm wrong here

23:34.600 --> 23:36.680
You guys have already got the latest

23:37.760 --> 23:42.720
Pi 8 gig working with man jar as well, right? Yeah, we have awesome

23:42.720 --> 23:48.120
My 8 gig supposed to arrive tomorrow my my gig pie. So I'm looking forward to that

23:48.120 --> 23:52.440
Yeah, there's that caveat cheese that if you got the Pine Book Pro in 2019

23:52.680 --> 23:54.320
You need to reflash your trackpad

23:54.320 --> 24:00.600
But they have instructions on their wiki and then the other caveat is that if you got one of the more recent batches of pine

24:00.600 --> 24:05.360
Books like mine it came with the Wi-Fi and microphone turned off

24:05.800 --> 24:11.200
This is actually one of the cool features of the Pine Book is you can turn these off and then there is a LED

24:11.200 --> 24:16.440
Indicator to let you know if they're off or on and they ship with all of those things off in that they tested them in

24:16.440 --> 24:21.400
The factory and they left them in the off configuration. So your Wi-Fi won't work out of the box

24:21.760 --> 24:25.000
it's just you hold down the pine key and I think it's f11 and

24:25.440 --> 24:30.080
Then if you get the two flashes of the LED your Wi-Fi is on if you get three flashes

24:30.840 --> 24:36.680
Your Wi-Fi is off. Did I get that right Dan? Yeah, you just need to reboot in between them. Yes, and that too

24:36.680 --> 24:40.160
Yes, thank you. You also have to reboot because I hit it and I'm like, well, where are they? I

24:41.280 --> 24:44.520
Thought it'd be like airplane mode. No, no, it's hardware physically

24:44.520 --> 24:46.780
Reconnecting to your OS, you know

24:46.780 --> 24:53.100
I actually mentioned to Lucas as well that maybe that's something they should ship turned off and include

24:53.100 --> 24:59.300
You know kind of an instructional pamphlet so that people actually know that those features are baked in

24:59.300 --> 25:04.980
I mean the majority of us do right but secure by default. Yeah, exactly and then opt to turn them on

25:04.980 --> 25:08.620
I actually I didn't turn on the others just turned the Wi-Fi back on. Oh

25:09.580 --> 25:13.220
Yeah, left there left leave the camera off. I don't need the camera right now

25:13.220 --> 25:17.700
I thought I should probably try it. So I'll keep using it. I'm gonna take it on the trip with me

25:17.700 --> 25:19.700
it'll be kind of like my go-to

25:19.780 --> 25:22.580
you know just checking up checking in on stuff machine and

25:23.140 --> 25:26.360
I'll give you my thoughts after an extended review today

25:26.360 --> 25:31.180
Really? We're gonna talk more about the XPS 13, which is the most recent 10th gen Intel a

25:31.940 --> 25:34.900
developer workstation from Dell and it's

25:36.060 --> 25:41.320
Gorgeous. I have been watching Wes use it as we've recorded the shows with a lot of envy

25:41.320 --> 25:43.620
usually I get to review the machines, but we thought

25:44.360 --> 25:47.160
Let's change it up. It's fair that West get not only get a shake at it

25:47.160 --> 25:51.640
But he's got a new gig where he's setting up new machines and he had to give back his ThinkPad

25:51.640 --> 25:54.900
So he's kind of in a sense. He's in the market. So before we get there

25:57.480 --> 25:59.480
How about a little housekeeping

26:00.120 --> 26:05.840
We'd love to have you join us live just as a disclaimer though. We will not be live next Tuesday

26:06.040 --> 26:10.240
We have a special episode already recorded and waiting to release

26:10.240 --> 26:14.000
We will each get assigned a lightweight distribution

26:14.000 --> 26:17.320
We're going to review it and then we'll have to meet a certain set of requirements

26:17.320 --> 26:22.880
We'll score it based on those requirements and then we're going to try to convince each other all of the co-hosts

26:23.520 --> 26:25.520
That our distribution is the best

26:26.040 --> 26:29.360
It's a really fun episode. Yeah, that's for the June 9th

26:29.360 --> 26:30.880
So we won't be here June 9th

26:30.880 --> 26:35.880
But pay attention to your feed because they'll still be a new show. Exactly Linux Unplugged.com

26:35.880 --> 26:41.400
Linux Unplugged.com slash subscribe also check it out. Go pay it forward cloud

26:41.400 --> 26:45.840
Learners can now empower others to gain the knowledge needed for a career in the cloud

26:46.320 --> 26:53.720
Just by getting your own certs for every cloud certification a cloud guru and Linux Academy users earn between May and June 2020

26:53.720 --> 26:59.340
They're awarding an annual subscription to a person applying to receive a free a cloud guru subscription

26:59.360 --> 27:03.420
So you get a cert somebody else gets a subscription. That's a nice thing to do right now

27:03.420 --> 27:09.360
So I wanted to pass that along the luck plug goes on every single Sunday, even when I'm on the road

27:09.360 --> 27:11.640
I'm by the way guys, I am gonna try to connect from the phone

27:11.640 --> 27:14.680
I suppose the only variable will be if I have signal or not

27:14.680 --> 27:21.040
Or if I have children climbing all over me, but the luck plug happens every Sunday noon Pacific

27:21.040 --> 27:25.200
So that's when we do this show on Tuesdays the same bat time

27:25.960 --> 27:29.400
Different bat day in the same mumble room. We just do it up in the lobby

27:29.400 --> 27:33.920
to help figure out when all this is going we will soon be adding it to the calendar and

27:34.520 --> 27:35.480
also

27:35.480 --> 27:39.720
you can join the chat room on IRC that get shed net where the

27:40.160 --> 27:43.560
Hashtag Jupiter broadcasting chat room is there's now a new room

27:44.120 --> 27:48.920
Hashtag lup lug you join that you can chat in there. That's also the room everyone uses

27:49.600 --> 27:53.060
During the lug so lup lug happens every single Sunday

27:53.060 --> 27:59.620
Sometimes we may even commandeer it into a surprise show recording which may or may not have happened recently

27:59.620 --> 28:03.340
But I can't say because that's in the future and that is also all of the housekeeping

28:05.740 --> 28:08.420
The XPS 13 Dell's

28:09.100 --> 28:13.380
2020 developer edition with 10th generation Intel CPUs

28:14.460 --> 28:19.580
Super edge-to-edge screening keyboard this nice new fingerprint reader

28:19.580 --> 28:24.020
I mean, it's definitely one of the fanciest machines we've ever had in studio

28:24.140 --> 28:29.220
We're drooling all over it and those drill marks are easy to clean off though. So don't worry. I

28:30.300 --> 28:35.940
Just kind of want to mention this because we often will just pass right over it. But the aesthetics of this thing

28:36.700 --> 28:40.340
Are I think worth noting because to me it's striking

28:40.340 --> 28:45.300
I mean you're sitting there with this thing and I look at it with these chamfered edges and I look at it with this gorgeous

28:45.300 --> 28:49.580
keyboard and I think to myself that is a very high-end machine I

28:50.340 --> 28:55.940
Legitimately one time glanced at it and I thought Wes is using a Mac. Oh, no. No, it's in several ways

28:55.940 --> 29:01.500
They've exceeded what the Mac books do with the edge-to-edge screen and keyboard and the chamfered edges

29:01.500 --> 29:03.460
I mean aesthetically it's it's very nice

29:03.460 --> 29:07.240
I don't know if you had did you have a chance to show it to anybody else and get any reaction? Yeah, you know

29:07.940 --> 29:12.180
Everyone I sent pictures to and the few folks that saw it in person from afar

29:12.180 --> 29:19.380
But they were all impressed like it's in the Linux community, especially we're we're used to sort of settling a little bit

29:19.380 --> 29:24.040
You know trying to find the right hardware that we know will work well with our you know

29:24.580 --> 29:26.700
Out there operating system at times

29:27.380 --> 29:33.080
There's no settling with this new XPS 13. Like it's just it feels great in the hand

29:33.260 --> 29:37.940
It's it's definitely a lot more dense than some laptops like especially the leave me with a pro

29:37.940 --> 29:43.660
But it feels so solid, you know, you can just really tell that it was they've been refining

29:43.940 --> 29:49.100
Building these things over the years now that they've been working on them. Yeah, I agree with that assessment and

29:49.980 --> 29:55.060
It kind of shows in a lot of ways. Yeah, boy. So it's a 10th generation

29:55.740 --> 29:58.180
10 nanometer chipset here ice-like

29:58.540 --> 30:04.420
It can be hard to get your hands on ice like get the 10 nanometer process from Intel because a lot of their stuff these days

30:04.420 --> 30:06.420
It's still Comet Lake and 14 nanometer

30:06.420 --> 30:11.940
It's a nice CPU. I was especially pleased with the Iris graphics installed

30:11.940 --> 30:14.020
One of the first things I did was just get steam going

30:14.020 --> 30:18.420
So no that wasn't job work, but it was a lot of fun

30:18.420 --> 30:22.080
And I was pretty impressed with the wide range of games. I was able to play now

30:22.580 --> 30:25.540
Not all of them are on the settings that I was used to from using a desktop

30:26.220 --> 30:30.460
But they worked like there there weren't problems and they were definitely playable

30:30.460 --> 30:34.400
which is nice because I think I think one thing that this XPS excels at is

30:34.400 --> 30:36.400
Sort of being a jack-of-all-trades

30:36.840 --> 30:39.360
It's small enough to fit in your bag very comfortably

30:39.360 --> 30:43.160
You hardly notice it's there even though it's not the lightest of all laptops

30:43.400 --> 30:47.560
But at the same time if you've got the right dock set up, which we'll get more into

30:48.160 --> 30:54.920
It can be almost a desktop replacement. All right, let's talk about that because I know this sounds kind of silly

30:54.920 --> 30:56.960
But if I'm gonna spend I don't know maybe it's not silly

30:56.960 --> 30:57.560
Maybe not

30:57.560 --> 31:03.000
But if I'm gonna spend a good chunk of change nearly two grand or something on a laptop or maybe even 2200 after it's all

31:03.000 --> 31:04.800
configured and shipped I

31:04.800 --> 31:08.560
Want to be able to play a little bit of games and I want to be able to do a little bit of work

31:08.560 --> 31:14.240
I've heard good things about the 10th generation graphics if my expectations are

31:14.960 --> 31:19.200
Moderately low, but not too low. I'm gonna you think I'll be happy with the results

31:19.200 --> 31:21.440
So this is the Intel Iris plus

31:22.320 --> 31:28.080
G7 with three gigs of a dedicated memory there now one caveat here is by default

31:28.080 --> 31:32.320
You know, it's it's a 4k screen on this laptop and it is beautiful

31:32.320 --> 31:39.000
But the higher resolution has some cost so that will depend a lot on how far you push things in terms of the in-game

31:39.360 --> 31:41.000
resolution and honestly

31:41.000 --> 31:42.760
that was one of the factors I think that

31:42.760 --> 31:50.080
Showed up a lot in several of the benchmarks from performance to battery life is just it's a big beautiful display that

31:50.640 --> 31:54.160
Takes a lot of power just that's just how it works

31:54.160 --> 32:00.000
you know and it's it's worth it if it's it's not gonna be the laptop that has the longest battery life on the field or

32:00.000 --> 32:06.280
is the fastest but it's it's in a very special middle ground between those where it's fast enough and

32:06.640 --> 32:12.560
It lasts long enough. So we have the benchmark data for the limo room. We have the benchmark data for the previous XPS

32:13.680 --> 32:18.160
Generation the one just before this did it stack up decently in those results?

32:18.400 --> 32:25.060
You know, we'll have to dive more into the graphs to really tell but it's a it's a four core eight thread laptop

32:25.060 --> 32:30.300
now you do have to do a little bit of tweaking to make sure that it's in in the performance mode in terms of the

32:30.300 --> 32:34.460
CPU performance and you as well as you might want to do some battery tweaking to get it there

32:34.460 --> 32:38.460
But I've been pretty impressed with the general overall performance in terms of you know

32:38.460 --> 32:40.780
Running a workload spinning up a bunch of virtual machines

32:40.780 --> 32:46.100
I also did just some some various benchmarks out of the Phronics test suite to you know

32:46.100 --> 32:53.300
See how the system would perform under load. I did notice a couple times the desktop freezing

32:53.300 --> 32:59.340
That was a little concerning, but it didn't take the whole computer down. I was able to just pop over to you know another term

33:00.540 --> 33:04.540
Restart GDM and get back into my desktop and it wasn't that big of a deal but

33:05.060 --> 33:10.540
I've heard from some other folks who've been testing out these that they've had similar experiences and that was a little concerning

33:10.580 --> 33:16.700
Would it do that only in a load scenario or would it do that even under like idle conditions?

33:16.740 --> 33:19.700
No, you know during normal use I didn't run into that at all

33:19.700 --> 33:27.220
Yeah, that's a tricky one because even on my on my fairly powerful workstation upstairs. I would I would get desktop freezing

33:27.980 --> 33:31.020
Until I switched to profile sync demon for my browser

33:31.540 --> 33:34.940
Overall impressions on the way the work applications all that kind of stuff pretty good

33:34.940 --> 33:39.580
It sounds like the battery life not quite what you'd want but acceptable charging all USB C

33:39.580 --> 33:42.780
I assume all of that kind of standard stuff. In fact, it's only USB C, isn't it?

33:42.780 --> 33:47.820
It is only USB C and that is something we should definitely talking to is just what ports do you got?

33:47.820 --> 33:55.820
And you've got a micro SD to USB C that are you know Thunderbolt as well full full featured both able to charge from

33:55.820 --> 34:01.420
So that's really nice. That's nice to see so you got you've got Thunderbolt 3 on those ports and micro SD which feels like

34:02.340 --> 34:04.340
Is just an obvious

34:04.780 --> 34:11.940
Easy addition for any laptop at this point and it's got one of those legacy 3.5 millimeter headphone ports on there

34:12.220 --> 34:14.900
Wow legacy ports indeed. I know right

34:14.900 --> 34:20.780
So if you if you pick up one of these, you're just gonna need some docks and some dongles basically

34:20.780 --> 34:22.480
There's just there's no getting around it

34:22.480 --> 34:28.420
I think for folks that have a newer laptop, you know before this already or maybe some setups from from various work

34:28.940 --> 34:30.940
Configurations not that big of a deal

34:31.060 --> 34:38.680
But if you've been lucky enough to hang around and just using manual, you know USB a style ports or you like physical Ethernet

34:39.220 --> 34:41.820
Maybe not the configuration for you. Mm-hmm

34:41.820 --> 34:47.820
Yeah, one big thing though in this line is you can get it with up to 32 gigs of RAM

34:47.820 --> 34:50.420
And that is a huge change for the XPS line

34:50.420 --> 34:55.380
It's great to see that especially for those of us that have a few VMs kicking around

34:55.820 --> 35:03.000
Let's talk about what it feels like to actually use it seems like it has a pretty sizable trackpad that keyboard layout

35:03.000 --> 35:08.060
I'm wondering about like I noticed that the arrow keys look like the bad version of the MacBook keyboard

35:08.060 --> 35:14.900
How's the how's the overall like experience using that? Are you triggering the mouse more than you mean to with a trackpad that big?

35:14.900 --> 35:19.460
Is that an issue, you know? No, honestly, I've been decently impressed with you know

35:19.460 --> 35:25.420
Some of the rejection from the trackpad no no complaints and I like it a lot better than I liked the ThinkPad trackpad

35:25.420 --> 35:29.820
That's for sure. Oh, really? Okay. Oh, yeah, definitely and it's not quite MacBook level

35:29.820 --> 35:35.540
But in terms of like the actual material the build quality of the trackpad a lot of laptops use the trackpad

35:35.540 --> 35:38.820
Especially if you're using it a lot. It just starts to wear out really quick

35:38.820 --> 35:43.580
You know that it loses whatever surface that they put on there to make it smooth and nice for your fingers. I

35:44.660 --> 35:49.340
Took the XPS on a little tour around Seattle. We'll have a photo gallery in the show notes

35:49.500 --> 35:50.860
So I you know, I set it up

35:50.860 --> 35:52.140
I couldn't go to coffee shops

35:52.140 --> 35:52.660
Unfortunately

35:52.660 --> 35:58.060
But I went to several different parks and locations around and set it up to just use it try to get some work done tethered

35:58.060 --> 36:00.380
To my phone using the trackpad the whole time

36:01.020 --> 36:04.540
Really one of the better trackpads I've used on Linux. It wasn't again

36:04.540 --> 36:07.740
It's not like Mac level with tons of fancy gestures and all that

36:07.740 --> 36:12.020
But really just solid basic trackpad and I've got to say the same for the keyboard

36:12.020 --> 36:15.500
It's not quite ThinkPad level in that written in that term

36:15.500 --> 36:21.940
But for just regular day-to-day use a little light programming catching up on emails sending slack messages

36:22.300 --> 36:24.980
It was good enough that I just didn't think about it

36:24.980 --> 36:29.020
Do you think that keyboard would bother you a year out from now? No, I don't think so

36:29.020 --> 36:34.980
There are times it feels like maybe a little bit flimsy and the travels not super deep

36:35.380 --> 36:39.740
But it's good enough that when you're using it, you just you just forget about it. It's totally fine

36:39.740 --> 36:45.300
And once you've got it docked for a real workstation setup, I'm just gonna use a regular keyboard anyway

36:45.300 --> 36:51.020
But that's true for basically all laptops that I use so you went the dock route. I assume, you know limited ports

36:51.020 --> 36:57.060
It's kind of easier if you just shunt it all off into a dock. Yeah, I think you have to in the USB C lifestyle

36:57.060 --> 37:01.860
Right you guys just you just you're gonna need a nice dock setup so that you can actually have all the peripherals you want

37:01.860 --> 37:03.140
especially if you've got like a

37:03.140 --> 37:09.820
Desktop microphone and maybe you've still got a non bluetooth mouse in play like I do at my current work from home setup

37:10.020 --> 37:12.020
So it just seemed like the easiest route

37:12.300 --> 37:14.300
Go plug everything in that way

37:14.420 --> 37:17.880
So there were some times especially when I was I was trying to do some testing

37:18.500 --> 37:19.740
As maybe you know

37:19.740 --> 37:27.460
Like a recording workstation the lack of parts was kind of annoying because I've run Ethernet up into my recording location or I am now

37:27.460 --> 37:33.740
I've got it all set up. And of course my audio interface is a USB a so if you're not prepared for the USB C lifestyle

37:33.780 --> 37:38.900
There are times that you sort of forget that your computer can't cannot connect to things and can't talk to

37:39.420 --> 37:44.660
Most of your gadgets, but if you're used to it, it's just not that big of a deal. I love your pictures

37:44.660 --> 37:46.620
I'm looking at some of these pictures. I was showing them on the live stream

37:46.620 --> 37:52.060
They're really cool. And it really does show you what a nice looking machine is. You get a good idea of that keyboard

37:52.740 --> 37:57.320
But the thing that I'm not I'm not blown away by the results in the Ferronix benchmarks

37:57.320 --> 38:00.980
They're good, but I'm not I'm not blown away by them. They didn't super surprise me

38:00.980 --> 38:04.200
It doesn't seem like it's a a substantial performance increase

38:04.200 --> 38:09.580
But it other than the RAM area where if you need more memory, it's an obvious an obvious choice

38:09.860 --> 38:12.160
yeah, and this isn't some you know, it's not like the

38:12.160 --> 38:18.160
The the real desktop replacement lines the precision series. It's it's not to that level, right?

38:18.160 --> 38:22.880
Yeah, but you know, I was testing it out with a ton of containers running and some virtual machines

38:23.760 --> 38:28.440
tons of electron apps and chrome tabs and let me tell you plenty of tabs open and

38:29.760 --> 38:33.880
Compared to any of the other sort of day-to-day laptops I've used for the past couple of years

38:34.960 --> 38:38.360
Wasn't breaking a sweat. What about fan noise? I was gonna get to that

38:38.360 --> 38:45.800
When you're playing a game or spinning up a whole bunch of stuff, you will hear the fans, but it's not a bad fan

38:45.800 --> 38:52.120
It's not shrill. It's not too, you know, whooshie. It will be there in the background, especially if you are playing a game

38:52.120 --> 38:54.120
It's basically there all the time

38:54.480 --> 38:59.640
But if you're listening to any of the game audio or you're you know chatting with friends on discord

39:00.040 --> 39:03.920
They didn't hear it and I couldn't hear it once I put headphones in. Yeah, okay

39:03.920 --> 39:05.520
I mean, that's that's how it works on a laptop

39:05.520 --> 39:11.040
I did notice it right away, but I wasn't really put off by it and it wasn't wasn't anything like those laptops that you know

39:11.040 --> 39:14.200
Have the world's tiniest fans spin up and are just screaming in your ear

39:14.200 --> 39:18.760
I want to take a moment to talk about Thunderbolt 3 here because

39:19.440 --> 39:23.760
This is something that really has gotten a bad rap. You know, everybody

39:24.640 --> 39:27.080
Probably is aware that recently there was yet another

39:27.840 --> 39:34.280
Security story that mentions that oh by the way, it's it's dangerous to have external access to the PCI bus Wow shocker

39:34.280 --> 39:36.120
shocker

39:36.120 --> 39:42.080
but yeah, it also is external access to the PCI bus and that makes it amazing and I have

39:43.080 --> 39:44.160
some

39:44.160 --> 39:49.400
Docs in the studio and in my RV that I can move between

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Linux I can move between

39:52.040 --> 39:58.080
MacBooks I can move between anything that supports Thunderbolt and it's it's so great because they're not

39:58.080 --> 40:04.400
Gimped devices that require a bunch of CPU usage to sort out messages on the USB bus

40:04.400 --> 40:12.080
It is really PCI wired in and that means multiple monitors and GPUs and and sound cards

40:12.080 --> 40:18.120
And it really gives you a lot of power that you can hook up into a laptop with one

40:18.440 --> 40:23.880
Single cord and if you're willing to invest in that it I think tremendously expands

40:23.880 --> 40:28.440
what these laptops are capable of like I just really think it's

40:29.200 --> 40:31.760
It's gotten a bad rap and I know as part of a review

40:31.760 --> 40:35.160
It's hard to go out and buy a whole bunch of Thunderbolt accessories because they're not cheap

40:35.520 --> 40:39.320
Unfortunately, they're not but I think did you get a sense of like it's nice

40:39.320 --> 40:40.200
You can hook up the monitor

40:40.200 --> 40:45.460
You can hook up your mouse and keyboard to one thing the power if you have power pass through and then it's just that

40:45.480 --> 40:49.400
Single cord that goes into the laptop. Yeah, you know that actually that was really nice

40:49.400 --> 40:54.720
and I got myself a little Bluetooth mouse to play with too and that combination

40:55.360 --> 41:00.320
Really made for a seamless sort of docking and undocking experience where I could throw it in my bag

41:00.480 --> 41:03.520
Go run around and do stuff show back up at the house

41:03.880 --> 41:06.400
You know when I was using the ThinkPad for better or worse

41:06.560 --> 41:09.200
There were like three or four things because I actually had ports

41:09.200 --> 41:14.320
so I was using the ports that I had to unplug and replug in even with USB C on there and

41:14.320 --> 41:21.600
And with the XPS 13, yeah, it's just one cable and you're done and then you're instantly back at your legitimate setup

41:21.600 --> 41:24.440
And you don't have to feel like it's some really flaky setup

41:24.440 --> 41:29.320
Like I know I've had in the past some docks that especially with like display port pass-through for multiple monitors

41:29.320 --> 41:33.600
And like they just would never wake up correctly after you know after sleeping none of those problems

41:33.800 --> 41:38.160
Yeah, and you could even if it is say you're going all-in you could eventually decide

41:38.160 --> 41:43.760
I really actually want to game on this thing fairly seriously and then you could go spend the ridiculous amount of money

41:43.760 --> 41:48.460
It is on an eGPU and have a real powerful GPU you hook up

41:48.720 --> 41:53.480
Maybe it's not 16x PCI, but it's still plenty fast to play your video game

41:53.480 --> 41:59.600
I do it all the time and it means that you can have this tiny machine that has almost no

42:00.040 --> 42:02.080
Bag debt and you know what I mean?

42:02.080 --> 42:06.960
Like it just doesn't really affect your bag in terms of size it takes or weight and because it's USB C

42:07.000 --> 42:12.720
You're charging it with the same charger. You're charging all of your other devices on your trip and it matters a lot

42:12.720 --> 42:16.920
So if that's a situation that a rock that comes up for you from time to time or you want to have a grab-and-go

42:17.600 --> 42:19.960
Situation where you just take the bag and get out and work somewhere

42:19.960 --> 42:24.800
I think it really makes a big difference and I think we're now in a world where

42:25.760 --> 42:30.160
The Linux version is a superior product to the Windows version

42:30.520 --> 42:35.360
Friend of the show Jim Salter had a review of the XPS 13 and on the Windows side

42:35.640 --> 42:41.200
There's software it comes with to manage the killer wireless card and all of this that has some trade-offs

42:41.200 --> 42:46.680
that make it maybe an experience that I don't think the developer market would be interested in and

42:47.080 --> 42:54.640
It shows you how when you buy the developer edition of this laptop. Not only do you get a great operating system, but you also

42:55.320 --> 43:00.160
don't have these silly like gimmicky killer wireless management features that take a bunch of

43:00.600 --> 43:06.840
CPU overhead and whatnot and I think that's also worth considering now is like these products are in some ways better on the Linux side

43:06.840 --> 43:12.800
They are I mean you also get that 4k screen, which you know, I could go back and forth on it. It is so beautiful

43:13.160 --> 43:18.360
It's a little bit much in a 13 inch laptop. I think and it definitely has some as we talked about

43:19.360 --> 43:21.980
complications for the battery life and some other issues, but

43:22.840 --> 43:28.480
It's just it's so nice to see the Sputnik program have gotten this far that we have this developer focused machine

43:28.480 --> 43:33.920
that really does feel like it with 32 gigs of RAM and a first-class experience all around and

43:33.920 --> 43:39.000
Up on to shipping on it right out of the box. Was it 1804 that it shipped with do you recall?

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
I know we kind of we nuked and paved fairly quick. We very quickly got rid of that

43:44.000 --> 43:46.720
It did ship with 1804 and that worked fine

43:46.720 --> 43:53.020
But I wanted to own to try 2004 on it because that's that's the new hotness and it works great now

43:53.340 --> 43:59.600
One thing people been asking about with this machine is the fingerprint reader. Yeah, that doesn't work quite yet

43:59.600 --> 44:05.400
I haven't found any official updates about when that will be available. If you look at the Dell website and Barton

44:05.400 --> 44:10.920
George's original post on his blog. They mentioned that that will come out sometime mid 2020

44:10.920 --> 44:15.000
So I think we're in that range anytime. It should be an over-the-air update

44:15.360 --> 44:20.400
Just some firmware that gets added support and a new driver available for Linux. Not there yet, though

44:20.400 --> 44:23.360
maybe a combination of an FW up D and

44:23.920 --> 44:25.920
a point release of

44:25.920 --> 44:30.120
2004 yeah, I think so because you can see it there, you know if you do LS USB

44:30.120 --> 44:33.960
It shows right up and you get all the driver information and they have promised that you know

44:33.960 --> 44:39.520
They've been working with the hardware vendor. This should be coming down the pipe, but so far not there yet

44:39.520 --> 44:42.200
Which is a little disappointing because I was excited because in 24

44:42.200 --> 44:47.440
They've got the the genome changes in that you can you can add fingerprint support just right there in the genome settings

44:47.560 --> 44:52.760
Which is pretty cool. It's a nice fingerprint reader. It's a it's like a big padded button

44:52.760 --> 44:56.880
It's not your old swipey fingerprint reader. No, it is not and it actually doubles

44:56.880 --> 44:59.440
It's the power button which feels a little modern

44:59.440 --> 45:05.360
Maybe too modern takes a little bit to get used to but is pretty cool. Don't change West Pains power button

45:05.360 --> 45:07.360
It spooks them now this thing doesn't it?

45:07.760 --> 45:14.040
Technically have support for the Windows. Hello style face ID style login. Yes, it does

45:14.040 --> 45:15.800
So it has the infrared

45:15.800 --> 45:19.640
Sensors needed to do that right next to the webcam and we should note

45:19.640 --> 45:23.200
Unlike the old days of staring up your nose on a webcam call

45:23.600 --> 45:28.480
This XPS has the camera in the usual spot on the top of the display

45:28.720 --> 45:33.360
It is only 720p, but honestly, it's fine. You know, I did so I did some work calls

45:33.480 --> 45:40.040
Did some gaming with friends some zoom calls. No one complained. No one said anything. The webcam is good enough

45:40.040 --> 45:44.800
I can't believe they managed to fit a webcam up there. Oh, I know it's it's shockingly small

45:44.800 --> 45:45.720
You hardly believe it

45:45.720 --> 45:46.940
It was I tried to take a picture of it

45:46.940 --> 45:50.240
But that was hard to because it's just it's just a tiny little bezel

45:50.240 --> 45:51.860
You could kind of see it in your picture

45:51.860 --> 45:56.080
So I do you got to check this out go check out the photo gallery because it's it's remarkable

45:56.080 --> 45:58.280
They fit it in there along with the IR sensor

45:58.640 --> 46:04.280
Also, it's it's it gives you a better concept of what we're saying when it's edge to edge screen and edge to edge keyboard it

46:04.280 --> 46:09.140
It really feels like every scrap of space in that machine is used

46:09.320 --> 46:15.560
Nothing has gone to waste on the design and space of that machine. So you were mentioning the Windows style. Hello

46:15.560 --> 46:19.600
So this gave me a good opportunity to try some open source software called howdy

46:19.600 --> 46:22.760
Oh, really and howdy provides Windows Hello style

46:23.240 --> 46:26.600
Authentication for Linux and it's actually pretty cool because it ties into PAM

46:26.940 --> 46:30.780
So if you want to do pseudo you can use your face to do it now

46:30.780 --> 46:33.900
I'm not saying you should do this is probably not a good security posture

46:34.000 --> 46:40.020
But it was really neat to see this actually work on Linux. There's a PPA out there if you want to go install it

46:40.020 --> 46:45.620
They've got packages available for Ubuntu add that install it and then it's got a handy little guy that will guide you through

46:46.120 --> 46:52.800
Registering your face getting that enrolled and then it downloads all the necessary machine learning models sets things up for you

46:53.800 --> 46:59.280
You're done. Say you were going to buy this thing you get there's two base models. They start with a

47:00.640 --> 47:07.760
$1,000 model and a $1,400 model they both come with the 10th gen processors ones and I five and I seven

47:07.760 --> 47:10.920
I want to price this out and see if you'd actually buy it now that you've used it

47:10.960 --> 47:14.760
Would you get the i5 model for Westpain or would you get the i7 model?

47:14.760 --> 47:18.320
You know, that's a tough one. I might be tempted to just stick with the i5

47:18.320 --> 47:23.440
I could see it's reasonable and in a laptop. You're probably not gonna see a huge difference. That's just it

47:23.440 --> 47:26.680
I mean if you're using this thing, you're gonna throw it in the closet never be around it

47:26.680 --> 47:30.800
It's gonna have its fan going and it'll be cooled and you're busy on the CPU all the time

47:30.800 --> 47:36.440
Then okay, maybe you want the i7 but I don't think you'll notice just what the i5 for whatever reason

47:36.440 --> 47:41.420
I think when you get the i5 you cannot do 32 gigs of RAM with a Dell configurator at this time

47:41.720 --> 47:44.340
So are you okay with 16 gigs or would you stick with eight?

47:44.360 --> 47:49.940
What's your choice be I don't think I could buy a new laptop that only had eight gigs in 2020

47:49.940 --> 47:53.920
It's $100 to go up to 16. So the display has two options

47:53.920 --> 47:59.160
Now the one we got in-house to review is the UHD plus 4k infinity edge touch

48:00.040 --> 48:02.760
Anti-reflective 500 nit display. I mean it's like

48:02.760 --> 48:08.120
Gorgeous on a laptop. However, you can get that same chassis

48:08.760 --> 48:11.320
with the infinity edge display at

48:12.640 --> 48:15.520
1920 by 1200 and it's actually

48:16.200 --> 48:20.880
$400 cheaper that I would be tempted for I mean the 4k is beautiful

48:20.880 --> 48:25.000
But honestly just for like simple Linux desktop stuff and since I'm not, you know

48:25.000 --> 48:29.840
I wasn't using it for doing any sort of like content creation in terms of photo or video work

48:29.840 --> 48:33.680
The smaller resolution would be fine for just when I'm in the terminal

48:34.240 --> 48:39.480
1920 by 1200 is a great resolution. It's a great resolution and it'll save you some battery life

48:39.480 --> 48:42.880
I'd love to see a 2k option, but they have an anti-reflective

48:43.540 --> 48:48.080
Version of that 1920 by 1200 for an additional $100. I don't know

48:48.080 --> 48:55.680
That's a tough call but at the storage level by base. It's 256. I'd kind of advise you bump it to a terabyte for 250 bucks

48:55.680 --> 49:01.480
I don't know what your thoughts are though. Maybe 512 or 256 is enough for Wes 256

49:02.360 --> 49:05.880
Not not anymore. I think that that fits in the 8 512

49:05.880 --> 49:08.760
I can live with especially if it's you know, you build your workflow around it

49:08.760 --> 49:13.360
You just know that you're gonna need a scratch disk attack to your dock somewhere or you're doing everything in the cloud

49:13.360 --> 49:18.760
Anyway, those are all workable. You've got Thunderbolt. You've got you've got cloud storage. You can always build the NAS

49:18.760 --> 49:23.640
So ok 512 m.2 for 100 bucks more. All right, Wes

49:23.640 --> 49:31.020
Are you ready for your final price this by the way is with the base warranty one-year pro support

49:31.920 --> 49:38.560
And no additional damage and at any kind of like office software. No office software. No antivirus, please

49:39.840 --> 49:42.520
your grand total comes to

49:44.800 --> 49:50.400
1249 dollars and 99 cents. So let's just say maybe 13

49:50.400 --> 49:54.040
14 hundred dollars after sales tax or whatnots shipping is free

49:54.520 --> 49:59.480
Let's round up just to make it a little easier. Would you pay 14 hundred dollars all-in?

50:00.360 --> 50:07.480
For the laptop you have right now. Yeah, you know, I really think that I would it's just it has fallen into my lifestyle

50:07.480 --> 50:10.880
So well, you know, it doesn't do really any one thing

50:11.400 --> 50:15.960
Better than anything else necessarily, but it is remarkably well rounded

50:15.960 --> 50:21.640
I feels comfortable just throwing it on the couch and using it while you're watching TV and it feels comfortable

50:21.640 --> 50:26.440
It's like a primary development workstation. That's a hard thing to get right and

50:27.600 --> 50:33.080
Make it a laptop that I'm proud to show off as I'm walking around and I gotta say you and I both having been

50:33.240 --> 50:38.700
XPS owners, I think we both have some very old XPS is that still boot up and run

50:39.880 --> 50:42.800
And they have no right to be doing so at this point. Yes

50:42.800 --> 50:47.720
Now unfortunately, you do kind of have to make the the Mac style calculus of how much more am I gonna spend to try?

50:47.720 --> 50:49.560
To future-proof this thing, but you're right

50:49.560 --> 50:55.000
I have no doubt that this will still be especially given the build quality of the thing a

50:55.760 --> 51:01.300
Great laptop in four years time. So before tax this thing came out to essentially

51:01.800 --> 51:08.520
Thousand two hundred fifty dollars and for that it was a 10th gen i5 up to three point six gigahertz boost

51:08.760 --> 51:11.280
It came with Ubuntu pre-installed

51:11.280 --> 51:15.520
16 gigabytes of DDR4 low-power RAM a

51:16.280 --> 51:17.840
1920 by 1200

51:17.840 --> 51:19.840
FHD plus edge-to-edge

51:19.920 --> 51:21.920
500 nit display a

51:21.920 --> 51:28.700
512 gigabyte PCI MVME solid-state disk the killer Wi-Fi ATX 1650 which is legitimately

51:29.320 --> 51:30.880
Supposedly a very good Wi-Fi chip

51:30.880 --> 51:37.280
I poked fun earlier and also those Intel UHD graphics that come with that 10th gen Intel i5 and

51:37.280 --> 51:43.360
on the mid-range area a 4-cell 52 watt-hour battery in the

51:44.040 --> 51:48.080
fully nice shiny platinum silver with black carbon fiber

51:48.760 --> 51:50.000
design

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
You get all that for

51:52.600 --> 51:57.560
1250 plus tax that does seem like a pretty strong value

51:57.560 --> 52:01.720
I don't know if it's the end-all machine for everybody because they have made some very

52:01.720 --> 52:07.680
Serious decisions and how you can use the machine and and that I think is where the compromise lies

52:07.920 --> 52:10.640
But outside of that, I think it's very compelling now

52:10.640 --> 52:15.720
It'd be another $400 to go with the 4k display, but I like your build a little bit better Wes

52:15.900 --> 52:17.900
yeah, I do too, honestly, that's very

52:18.760 --> 52:20.480
tempting because it's just

52:20.480 --> 52:26.920
It fits it does what you need and I love that Dell is making these with Linux just pre-installed

52:26.920 --> 52:31.160
I think that it's it's great to be able to support that if you can and send that signal like

52:31.160 --> 52:38.080
Yes, keep doing that. Yeah, the team's got to be super proud of this machine looking backwards come, you know, it's funny to you

52:38.320 --> 52:40.320
you mentioned the Wi-Fi there and

52:41.000 --> 52:44.880
All of Jim's problems with the Wi-Fi was on Windows and it turns out

52:44.880 --> 52:50.280
It's a totally fine Wi-Fi chip with Wi-Fi 6 support and when you just use the in kernel driver for it

52:50.280 --> 52:53.520
I mean kernel 5.1 or later you won't notice the thing

52:53.520 --> 52:59.800
I think that's another way in which it is a superior product using Linux for people that just want to get their work done

52:59.800 --> 53:04.360
Well, that means we have to box it back up and send it back to Dell now

53:04.360 --> 53:08.360
But it was it was neat to see it. And this is really prompt

53:08.360 --> 53:09.840
I mean we say it every time but

53:09.840 --> 53:12.280
They really just keep iterating on this product

53:12.280 --> 53:15.680
and so if you buy in at a certain generation there is a

53:16.220 --> 53:23.000
Really good indication that when you're ready to rebuy in how many years has it been for us seven years since you bought your XPS?

53:23.000 --> 53:24.760
Whoo. Yes

53:24.760 --> 53:28.160
you know though that you can now go back to that same product line and

53:28.160 --> 53:34.320
There's continuity there and that there's very likely at this point that if say you bought another laptop and four to seven years

53:34.600 --> 53:39.680
There could be another one in that product line and there's something to that. That's just it as I think they've shown

53:40.440 --> 53:44.400
Excellent stewardship of the line, you know, it hasn't really betrayed us yet

53:44.400 --> 53:46.800
It hasn't just really sacrificed quality

53:46.800 --> 53:53.580
If anything they've continued to invest in the quality of this of the hardware of the setup of thinking thoughtfully about how to configure these

53:53.580 --> 53:59.660
Machines with things like adding 32 gig support with finally working on drivers for fingerprint readers for Linux

54:00.280 --> 54:03.920
Those are all good things and I expect we'll see them to continue

54:04.120 --> 54:06.920
Yeah, and you really can't argue with that price

54:07.720 --> 54:12.880
$1,300 or if you want to round up $1,400 all-in for decent hardware

54:12.880 --> 54:20.400
But what is not in that price but is included is the design of the chassis that edge-to-edge screen that huge trackpad

54:20.400 --> 54:27.800
I think it's I think I agree with Wes. I think it's likely the best trackpad shipping on a Linux pre-installed laptop right now

54:27.880 --> 54:31.960
We've talked about the beauty and niceness of sort of the machining and the build of the chassis

54:31.960 --> 54:38.960
But it also just feels very sturdy and reliable as I was walking around with it using it around like I wasn't worried about damaging

54:38.960 --> 54:42.240
It had a great feel in the hand and the hinges were really solid

54:42.240 --> 54:44.800
Which is one thing that I really bugs me on a lot of laptops

54:44.920 --> 54:46.680
Even if it's a good laptop supports Linux

54:46.680 --> 54:51.160
Well, you can just tell that those hinges are really gonna wear out and after a year or two

54:51.160 --> 54:55.440
You're just gonna have a floppy screen that you have to prop up. Yep. Absolutely. Well, thank you Wes now

54:56.040 --> 55:00.440
before we run out of time I wanted to do a little follow-up on my data loss crisis and

55:01.240 --> 55:07.160
Answer I'm a question that I'm sure was common in a lot of listeners minds Jameson wrote in and he said

55:07.760 --> 55:13.280
Why not build all of what you just tried to do with butter FS on LVM and XFS?

55:13.280 --> 55:16.800
I know it requires a bit of stacking of technology and different tools to manage

55:16.840 --> 55:21.320
But there isn't much you can do on LVM that you can do on butter FS and ZFS these days

55:22.200 --> 55:28.840
And I think that was probably everyone's probably wondering why I didn't go with XFS. I was I was specifically trying to

55:29.240 --> 55:33.160
Use butter FS. That was a choice. I made there was a couple of things that played into it

55:33.960 --> 55:38.720
Number one is I do like to do it as low-level to the system as possible

55:38.720 --> 55:42.620
So that's bias number one is I don't like a lot of tools stacked on top of it

55:42.620 --> 55:47.760
I love the concept of an all-inclusive file system that's built into my operating system kernel

55:47.920 --> 55:52.240
That has the tools to do these things for me all about that monolith

55:52.400 --> 55:57.540
Yeah, man, and these things being I want drobo like capacity to just add

55:58.320 --> 56:03.040
Dis so I have production discs that we may retire out of production

56:03.760 --> 56:05.860
This is not an actual scenario that exists right now

56:05.860 --> 56:07.120
but in the future we will have

56:07.120 --> 56:12.320
discs that will want to retire out of production and I could take some of those and just add them to an existing

56:12.320 --> 56:19.240
Group storage pool with butter FS very simply for just scratch projects. I have I have no concern if the data loss occurs

56:19.400 --> 56:24.800
there's a very simple butter FS add volume command that just grows a mount point and

56:25.360 --> 56:27.040
That's a very appealing technology

56:27.040 --> 56:33.920
so I wanted to learn and experiment with that as well if I was building something that I wanted absolute stability and

56:34.880 --> 56:37.160
predictability and that I never touched again, I

56:37.880 --> 56:40.600
Probably would have gone with LVM and XFS

56:40.600 --> 56:44.880
That's that's generally my go-to strategy for like a server setup

56:44.880 --> 56:50.960
or if it was a more powerful x86 system probably would have gone with a

56:51.440 --> 56:56.060
Isolated OS and then ZFS pool approach like we do here in the studio, you know

56:56.060 --> 57:02.120
But it is a good point by Jameson here writing in which thank you LVM, especially with thin provisioning and the snapshot capabilities

57:02.920 --> 57:07.200
As a lot of these features and XFS 2 is growing copy-on-write abilities as well

57:07.200 --> 57:13.040
So they have not stood still and I think we've seen too with things like project Stratus that there are a lot of those

57:13.200 --> 57:13.760
capabilities

57:13.760 --> 57:18.560
But you're right to my mind a lot of the big wins with things like butter fast and CFS

57:18.560 --> 57:20.360
You you just have the one interface for it

57:20.360 --> 57:24.680
You don't have to manage multiple different projects and how they interact and really understand it

57:25.000 --> 57:31.700
You just got to rely on using the one tool correctly, even if sometimes with butter FS. That's tricky. Yeah, that's it and

57:32.600 --> 57:36.840
On a Raspberry Pi there is less overhead available

57:36.840 --> 57:42.360
so I really want to do something as low level as possible the other thing that I find appealing about butter FS is

57:43.600 --> 57:50.600
Besides its SSD trim support and things like that is I can individually turn off copy-on-write for a directory of things

57:51.120 --> 57:55.200
There's some compelling reasons perhaps on a docker container to turn off copy-on-write

57:55.760 --> 57:57.480
Although there's advantages to for snaps

57:57.480 --> 57:59.740
There's advantages of having butter first for snapshotting there too

58:00.000 --> 58:04.720
but anyways actually where I where I don't really intend to use copy-on-write is these

58:04.720 --> 58:06.080
five

58:06.080 --> 58:11.520
Plus gigabyte media files that can be you know up to 20 25 gigabyte MKV files

58:11.520 --> 58:17.360
I don't really want copy-on-write on USB media for those and I can turn that off just with a

58:17.720 --> 58:20.440
Directory attribute with butter FS. Yeah, that's pretty nice

58:20.440 --> 58:24.060
But you can you know, you can still get some of the other nice features of butter FS at the same time

58:24.120 --> 58:29.480
Yeah, exactly and I can do this drobo style mismatch disk sizes

58:29.480 --> 58:37.200
over time which is probably a recipe for horrible disaster unless I bring some kind of raid into the mix which

58:37.480 --> 58:40.000
I'm not super inclined to do with butter FS

58:40.320 --> 58:45.800
But I'm also doing it with files that assuming my backups are working correctly are all

58:46.000 --> 58:50.320
Restorable the applications are all in containers. The data is all backed up here at the studio

58:50.760 --> 58:56.720
So it's all recoverable and I am happy to say it is all back up and running and like what happens anytime one of these

58:56.720 --> 59:02.560
Catastrophes happen and you rebuild you rebuild with lessons learned and so now I like the new setup

59:02.680 --> 59:04.680
Even more than I liked the old setup

59:05.240 --> 59:10.360
So I'm feeling pretty good at this point all about it all I am using the crazy butter FS setup

59:10.360 --> 59:14.120
I after I rebuilt everything I went back to butter FS from the start this time

59:14.120 --> 59:20.200
No file system conversion shenanigans and I did the volume add so I have now combined two

59:21.040 --> 59:22.160
1TB

59:22.160 --> 59:24.240
MVME SSDs as a

59:24.240 --> 59:25.920
a

59:25.920 --> 59:32.760
2TB storage pool that is available for my media and I love solid-state media in the RV because I'm going down the road

59:32.760 --> 59:34.760
you know, it's it's a they say it's like a

59:35.240 --> 59:39.280
4 on the Richter scale for an earthquake for everything in the RV as you're going down the road

59:39.280 --> 59:44.520
So obviously spinning rust is out mind those platters. Yeah, and so my kids are watching TV

59:44.520 --> 59:49.640
Well, I'm going down the road and I'm serving up media and doing the encoding I'm streaming it and I don't want to be running

59:49.640 --> 59:55.840
off of platters so that's where this kind of technology where I'm adding fairly reliable disks and

59:56.240 --> 01:00:01.080
The use case scenario is our media server goes out or I can't get to my notes

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:08.200
Makes the stakes low enough that I'm comfortable experimenting with raspberry pies and with butter FS

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:16.080
Because it's a great learning opportunity and nothing truly teaches you like actually using something in a scenario where you kind of depend on it

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.160
That's why I was glad to see you picked butter FS. Honestly, is it it's just nice to use some of these times because we've

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.560
Deployed it a little bit at the studio

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:27.020
I've still got a storage pool at my house that's using it and I haven't sent seem to need to replace and

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.360
It's good to remember that it's in the kernel. It's being updated and maintained. It hasn't stood still

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.780
So it's good for us to keep a rest of the changes and for me

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:41.240
It's like okay if I was gonna rebuild say the file server here in the studio again something god forbid happened

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:46.500
I'd go ZFS again. I wouldn't be experimenting with butter FS there, but at the same time

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:50.440
I don't want to be ignorant to what it's capable of and because I have been critical of it in the past

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:54.880
I think it's important that I check in on it from time to time and update my

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:58.280
understanding of what it's capable of because otherwise I just become one of those

01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.980
jackasses on the internet that

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:06.340
Criticizes things for 15 years and never updates their opinions and never tries things out and that's just annoying. We wouldn't want that

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:11.620
All right, mr. Payne. Well, I think that wraps us up this week Linux unplug calm slash three five six

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:14.900
You can go to Linux unplug calm slash contact to send us your feedback

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:22.780
Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar if you want to find out when we'll be here alive could mention the Twitter handle at Linux unplug

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:28.780
The network is at Jupiter signal. I'm at Chris glass. He's at West Payne and thank you for being here

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:36.900
That's what really matters and we'll see you back here next Tuesday

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:00.780
You

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:12.460
Know I was looking at the specs for that XPS. It was pretty surprised

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:19.700
2.6 pounds. Yeah, it's definitely dense because it's you know, so just small in a 13 inch platform

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.700
But it feel it just feels very sturdy. And yeah, I threw it up through my bag

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:27.680
Didn't feel different than having an empty bag. It kind of feels like it's all one solid device

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.400
It does feel like that

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.720
Could you open it with just one finger or did you have to hold the base down as well?

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:39.360
So that I found depends a little bit on what surface they've got some pretty good little grippies on the bottom there

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.940
So on most normal surfaces, yes

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.640
Holding it in my hand also

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:44.880
Yes

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:51.480
but the the hardest part is just like the angle on the screen and it's like at the ends of the screen is thicker than

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:57.800
Like the taper on the bottom part of the laptop. So the hardest part is just getting that first crack going

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.760
They don't have the little cutout like the older MacBooks did got you but once it's open a little bit then it works really nice

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.920
Yeah, that's the tricky thing. I tried that probably too much

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:21.680
I was just playing with it because the hinge is so smooth. It was fun to mess with
