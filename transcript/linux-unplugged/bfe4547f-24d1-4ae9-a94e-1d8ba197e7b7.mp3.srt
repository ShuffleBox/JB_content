00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I was walking into the studio yesterday, and I look over at Wes Payne's screen, and I don't know, maybe I saw 600 icons on that man's desktop, and I just look and I said, Wes, what kind of mess is this?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, okay, don't judge me. I don't normally have desktop icons, so it was actually showing my home directory. It does occasionally get a little bit untidy, let's say.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You mean all of those files are in the root flat of your home directory?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, I was doing some tests, and I had shared them in a container already, so it was just simpler that way, all right?

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Normally, towards the end of the week, I clean things up, and mostly it doesn't really affect because all my serious work is already sorted in subdirectories in a hierarchy, right?

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now, unfortunately, I must have tweaked something, or, you know, I am on Neon here, so maybe something tweaked upstream.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Ultimately, desktop icons, and I'll admit, I'm still learning my way around plasma. I mean, I've come a long way here, but no expert.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, you could throw me under the bus, too. We both looked at it, and we're like, how do we turn these icons off?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Because I thought it was like a plasmoid that was showing desktop icons. That was the assumption I made, and so we were trying to figure out, well, how do we turn that plasmoid off?

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
How do we kill it? Like, where is this setting at? It took both of us standing there looking at this thing, and I'm going, I don't know, Wes.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, so actually, you do go to configure your desktop, which is kind of where I thought, but it's called the view.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So you can do folder view or desktop view, and desktop view is pretty much just a wallpaper.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, okay, that's good to know. But you know what's funny about that, though, is you and I have been using Plasma Desktop now for a while.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Seven months, eight months, nonstop, and it took us that long. Well, it really took you that long to find that. I love Plasma.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 290 for February 26, 2019.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hello there, and welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's building a pie stack. My name is Chris.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
My name is Wes.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hello, Wes. We have a great episode, as we always try to do. We're going to start things off with some great news for you GNOME users.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
OBS Studio has a new funding model, and then we'll head into the Raspberry Pi corner and pick the very best open source home automation system.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Plus, speaking of Raspberry Pi, we'll cover some Ubuntu updates coming that way.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We got a few pics, a few quick pics, a nostalgic chat with our study buddy, Kenny. But before we go any further, we have to bring in that mumble room.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hello.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hello.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hello.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hello.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, look at that. Brent, you slipped in under the wire during the intro. Good job.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That must have been some fast driving. I assume following all posted speed laws, though, of course.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Brent was on the road right before the show started. So good to see you, Brent.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hello, Bruce, CubicleNake, Demchuk, Foursquare, Mr. Badger back again, MiniMech, Sevia Machinia.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I wonder what that is. Terth is in there as well. And the one, the only, Mr. Martin Wimperis.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hello, Wimpy. Good to have you here tonight, too.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Good evening.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, now, let's talk about those Dome Shell performance improvements that I'm very excited about.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
While Plasma Desktop has been working great, my eye has been over on the Dome Desktop since the start of the year.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, you don't say.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh, yes, I know that was your prediction. I think I still have like 20 days to like pull the eject lever and rob you of your prediction.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think. So we'll see.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Well, that makes me more happy to see the news today.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, I know, right? Because they're pulling me in. Yeah, that's right.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There's more improvements coming to Gnome, specifically around Mudder, too, and latency reductions.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Over the course of Gnome 3.2 that's nearly complete, as well as Gnome 3.0, really,

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
there's been a lot of measurable performance fixes and enhancements to improve the fluidity of the Gnome Desktop,

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
as well as addressing latency issues that we've complained about here and there on the show before.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And of course, some areas make a huge difference. Other areas are minor improvements.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And it seems like one of the developers leading the charge is a canonical bloke, Wes.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, that's right. Canonical is Daniel Van Vitt. I don't know how to say that, but that's my attempt.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And while he's already made some great strides in fixing some issues himself, reviewing, collaborating on patches, the job isn't done.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There's really some big ticket work pending, as he called it.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
In particular, well, there's a bit of NVIDIA proprietary driver issue that he's been working on to resolve as it, well,

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it causes Xorg to use 100% CPU and significantly lag during simple work like GLX gears. And yeah, that is simple.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah. Now, did you get the number right there? Because that 100% CPU usage, is that what you said?

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Ideally, I would like, I mean, a few spare percentages, if you can, NVIDIA.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They thought it might be fixed by the recent 4.18.3.0 driver release, but turns out that this issue is still affecting some users.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We speculated when Canonical made the announcement of switching from Unity 7 to Gnome Shell for their desktop.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We speculated then that perhaps Gnome would see a pretty nice improvement because they'd have the development resources of Canonical now.

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And I think that very much has bared out, specifically on the Ubuntu front too.

60
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Daniel has released a fix for Disco Dingo as well. So you'll get it in the new 19.04 release.

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But it looks like, although I think it's still in testing, they're also looking at backporting some of the fixes to 18.04 as well.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So 18.04 users may get some of these fixes, I think specifically around like screen refresh rates and whatnot.

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Definitely some of those patches are going to make their way back to 18.04.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, Wes, between this and the overall polish that the Gnome desktop has been seeing, the work that's going into 19.04 and the new Fedora,

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
it's going to be really hard for me not to run Gnome for the rest of 2019, I think. We'll see.

66
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, I'm happy for you because, you know, just because you get to enjoy a first-class free desktop and no other reason.

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Either way, right? Either way.

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm like, that's actually a pretty good position to be in, where in the past I was leaping from Gnome to Plasma to sort of have a stable island of desktop Linux.

69
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And now, at least so far on Intel graphics, with the later versions of Gnome, I have not been able to reproduce some of the same issues.

70
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Very, very happy.

71
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm remaining cautious because I am aware that sometimes after something's been installed for a while or some weirdo extension gets added,

72
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
that things can start to go south. So it's with some caution, but I think so far it's going pretty well.

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Speaking of going well, I mean, it was like two, three years ago now.

74
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The studio of Jupiter Broadcasting Studio switched over to OBS Studio for broadcasting our live stream and recording videos.

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And it's been great. It's been great.

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We switched from the proprietary Wirecast application, which is also very nice.

77
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's gotten better over the years, but OBS just keeps getting great.

78
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And now fans like us have even more to celebrate with version 23.0 releasing yesterday,

79
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
as we record this with Linux Mac OS and Windows releases and some nice acceleration stuff in there, Wes.

80
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, I mean, do we really care about those other operating systems here on Linux Unplugged?

81
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No, the Linux version of OBS, well, now has support for the VA API interface to allow for GPU based video acceleration.

82
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And while you might not always love the quality you get out of those sorts of things,

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
it seems like a nice application for live streaming where you might just want to go fast and make sure you have no delays,

84
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
even on a lower end system that might not have the fastest CPU.

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You'll also find a bunch of new audio filters, remixing support and multitrack audio.

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, that is really nice. I'm starting to get a little worried.

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm reading through how OBS is doing fundraising now, and there's positives and negatives to it.

88
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So the first approach they're doing, aside from just straight up direct donations via PayPal or Bitcoin,

89
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
is this open collective platform where they write a group of people can raise money for a shared purpose

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
in an open and transparent way, even if the group may not have a formal organization body.

91
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The open collective uses a practice called fiscal sponsorship,

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
where a host organization provides facilities and services that allow the group to accept payments.

93
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They have launched a sponsorship program through the open collective to sponsor the OBS project.

94
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And there's a contributor page where you can contribute money and then you get your logo on there and

95
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Games Done Quick has done that recently so they can get their name on that page.

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So that's one approach, but it's convoluted. It's even kind of hard to explain.

97
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The other approach, which is a little more traditional, but I think is suffering from Patreon fatigue,

98
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
is they've launched a Patreon campaign to help fund OBS development.

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Now, OBS is one of the big desktop open source applications now. It's big. It's really, really big.

100
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Basically, Twitch is powered by OBS. Now, most of those are probably on Windows, but it's huge.

101
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's just even a great way if you just want to do screen caps, you know, like it's a really, really solid application.

102
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, if you're not streaming at all, it's still perfectly useful.

103
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's great for streaming or not. So right now, they have 93 patrons total.

104
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There's probably, as we record the show, thousands of people, and we're one of them,

105
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
streaming to the internet with OBS at this very moment. They have 93 patrons.

106
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Now, I got to say, that's up from yesterday. Yesterday was 88 patrons, so it is slowly going up.

107
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
They're making $1,000. Now, you got to remember that number that Patreon posts right there, it's bullshit.

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So they're probably making $800, $700 a month after credit cards fail to go through and you take out

109
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
about 10% of processing fees, 5% to Patreon, 5% to the payment processor.

110
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You end up with a number that's lower than what gets posted on Patreon's page there.

111
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's a best case scenario number, $1,000. That doesn't seem sustainable.

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Weren't they sponsored by Nvidia just recently, though? Didn't Nvidia contract them to add support for

113
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
the 20 series graphics cards and the new way the Nvidia encoder works there?

114
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So on their contribute page, they have several sponsors listed there.

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Most of them are individuals, and then there's different tiers you can get in.

116
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
They don't have Nvidia listed there. Games Done Quick is the only one at their gold tier,

117
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
which is $20,000 per year to OBS. There are several at the $250 level.

118
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So I'm not sure if they did, it wasn't through this. They may have sponsored them in the non-traditional sense.

119
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think it was contracted to do work. I saw Jensen Yeung on stage saying how they'd asked the OBS developers

120
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
to add this specific feature.

121
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, they say, we have collaborated with OBS, the industry leading streaming application,

122
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to help them release a new version with improved support for Nvidia GPUs. That's from Nvidia.

123
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So they're clearly not going to go out of business. They're not going to go away.

124
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think where I was going to go though with this is, part of me would really like it if they just sold

125
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
a $300 professional enterprise version of OBS. I don't even know what they could do to make it that.

126
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Maybe a service contract? I don't know.

127
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But I guess I've lost so many really, really great high-end applications that require a ton of work like this

128
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
over the years, that there is this part of me that goes, please take my money.

129
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Please make a way for us to pay you so that way you don't go away.

130
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I feel that same way about Reaper, Wes.

131
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah, right. I mean, these are tools that we want to be able to depend on.

132
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So whatever method that can be to ensure that that will continue, I want to support.

133
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Whether that's trying to find ways to contribute, develop a healthy community, or financial support.

134
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So it's just probably a completely different angle, but you pay for Final Cut and that's kind of changed

135
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
its goal significantly and you pay for Adobe Premiere and paying isn't necessarily a guarantee that it will

136
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
stay around forever. But I do agree that, you know, a few hundred dollar support is probably not enough

137
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
for something that's used by all of Twitch.

138
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You think there'd be some sort of partnership they could have more with more streaming services?

139
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Like, you know, we're here, we're open, we'll make sure that people are there to use your services.

140
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think they actually have, if you follow their Twitter, it does look like they've been talking about a little of that.

141
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They're not super good about advertising on their website, but on their Twitter feed 24 hours ago,

142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
they were talking about new Twitch mixer integrations and stuff like that.

143
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I think that's based on, like, direct working with Mixer. I don't know.

144
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I think that's happening more and more. And I'm not trying to, like, even try to scare them on the green side.

145
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like, OBS is screwed, it's going away, it's being taken advantage of.

146
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm just noticing in myself this tendency to start to get a little worried when they don't directly take money for exchange of the product.

147
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I feel, maybe it's me that's feeling like a Patreon fatigue, but I feel like if I go throw in another number there,

148
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
like, it's such a small way of helping. I'd much rather, I don't know, maybe the way to do it is just a direct donation.

149
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Maybe that's the way I should do it.

150
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Right. We want to feel like there will be others who contribute and that the whole thing could be sustainable that way,

151
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
but it feels like you're kind of burned out. It works for a couple applications.

152
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's not to say that that can't be done, but there's so many projects that have fallen by the wayside where there just wasn't enough support.

153
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is there a feature in OBS that you're missing at the moment, Chris?

154
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The only thing that I would say its commercial competitor Wirecast does that would be extremely nice to have OBS do, there's probably two things.

155
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The first one is they have this Rendezvous. I've never used it. I'm not intimately familiar with it. I have seen it in use though.

156
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's called Rendezvous and it is a peer-to-peer video calling service where each host gets a HD, they get a URL, they click it.

157
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It sets up an HD video session and in Wirecast, it gives them a dedicated video shot and their own audio track

158
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
automatically sets them up as a video shot so they get their own camera source in the application.

159
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,000
They all have their own independent audio. They get program playback directly from Wirecast sent back to them automatically.

160
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That sounds incredible. That sounds like that's the best thing ever.

161
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That would have been so amazing when we were doing Linux Action Show.

162
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The only thing they have, they've had for a long time is Desktop Presenter, which is a little tiny application that captures your screen

163
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,000
and I think it encodes it as H.264. I don't know what it does. It's using hardware acceleration if it is and sends that over the network as another camera source.

164
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So any computer on your network, you can screen cap and it shows up automatically using DNS discovery as a camera shot in the Wirecast application.

165
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That would be great because it would even do like 30 frames per second or so if you're on Ethernet. It could even do more than that.

166
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So you could actually capture video gameplay and video playback.

167
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Wow.

168
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's so cool. Yeah. And you know, there's cool things that OBS has too like network sound card support and NDI support and all that kind of stuff.

169
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That's totally killer, but I would love to see those couple of features come to OBS. Not necessary for what we do.

170
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So if you're looking for some significant features in OBS, then perhaps the way to go is to find out what it would cost for the OBS developers to add the features that you want.

171
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And instead of just dropping a random amount of money on the project, invest some money in the project to add the features that you want to see.

172
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And then you get both things. You get the features you want and you get to support the project.

173
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So I would say I am 100% on board, something we've actually considered on a couple of occasions and have found a bit of a pushback.

174
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And maybe it was the route that was taken. I'm not sure. I'd have to dig into the history of it.

175
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But the project is very established and has a very clear direction they want to go.

176
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Additionally, Windows seems to be a pretty clear priority for the project.

177
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And so when you come along and say, hey, we'll even hire the developer and have the developer do the work or we could contribute to the project.

178
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And the answer is kind of like, yeah, we're not really going to upstream it, even if you do do the work. So don't bother, really.

179
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's not what's in our plan right now. So sometimes you get that and sometimes you get acceptance.

180
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It just kind of depends on what the topic is in the project. But I agree, Wimpy, that's a great way to go.

181
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I think it's a cool project. And I'm really glad to see that they added hardware accelerated video support, even more. There's already been some, but I'm glad to see more.

182
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So that's nice. That is nice. But enough talking about that stuff. Enough talking about the OBS project.

183
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I think it's pretty cool, though. It's one of those, I think one of the things that I love about OBS Studio.

184
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I know I said I was just done, but I just got to bring this up now that I was talking about Wirecast.

185
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It lets you do stuff on Linux that when I started this thing, oh my gosh, I had to build crazy ass, horrible Hackintoshes and run Wirecast.

186
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And I had to buy Wirecast, a thousand dollars, and I bought it several times. I did not like spending that money.

187
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And I did not like building Hackintoshes and I did not like having Hackintoshes in production.

188
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah, it really does stuff that otherwise on Linux you would have had to do some like arcane G streamer magic to get anywhere close to this.

189
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, and they just keep adding new stuff in like great, great.

190
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Just a little while ago, they added in support for doing video playlists, which makes like doing reruns and pre-played videos and stuff really nice.

191
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's just it's super great. And the guys that run the live stream here at Linux Academy have ended up using OBS in totally different ways than we use it.

192
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Like they took that setup that I built for them back around Texas Linux Fest and they've just they've they've they've added like switchers and controllers and remote audio.

193
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And they've got a preview station and they've got a director's like it's they've really taken it to the next level.

194
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's so cool to see what you can do with it. It's all in that same Linux box I built for them, you know, last last June.

195
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So it's pretty cool. Speaking of which, we have a lot coming up, the most we've ever ran at one time on our meetup page right now.

196
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So this is our housekeeping section of the show. And I want to take this moment to mention meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting next Tuesday, March 5th.

197
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:27,000
We have our study group, the Linux operating system fundamentals. Then Saturday, March 9th, we have dinner at scale Saturday night.

198
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And then Saturday, April 27th, it's the Linux Fest Northwest parking lot barbecue where we always have a good time.

199
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:44,000
So there's a lot going on. Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting to get all of that because we'll be adding to that and growing that over time.

200
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's kind of nice because when we travel, meetups a pretty well established platform.

201
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And when we travel places, we can drop a meetup in there and it alerts people that are on the meetup service in that area that we're there and that we're doing a thing.

202
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah, people already have accounts for various meetups that are happening in their city. So it's not a one off thing you have to do for us.

203
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Just come find us and make it easy to meet up.

204
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I still have friends that we talk to regularly from Texas Linux Fest last summer. So it's not just a short term thing.

205
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You know, Elle, who's on our team now, she met Anthony, the CEO of Linux Academy at Texas Linux Fest.

206
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's that's how she started working here. I know that a lot a lot happened at that Texas Linux Fest. It's not even that huge of a fest.

207
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But there's there's so many ripple effects when people get together like that.

208
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And that's kind of why we try to replicate it on a smaller scale here with the virtual lug.

209
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's not the same thing, but it gives us sort of like echoes of that, which is pretty great.

210
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And we will have our study group next Tuesday. It just follows Linux unplugged live here on the stream.

211
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The mumble room will be open. We'll be taking your questions.

212
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Kenny, the training architect who put together this course, which is the Linux Operating Systems Fundamentals, is a great guy.

213
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And we sat down and we're talking to him about stuff and kind of, you know, preparing, trying to have our ducks in a row, as they say.

214
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And of course, we couldn't help ourselves. We started talking about Linux.

215
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Hello, listener. Welcome to like one day ago, actually, about 24 hours ago.

216
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
We're sitting here in the studio having a little chat with Kenny Armstrong.

217
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
He's a training architect over at Linux Academy.

218
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He'll be joining us next week for the study group after the show, the little thing we've been looking forward to.

219
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And we're doing the Linux Essentials and we were strategizing about what we should talk about.

220
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And as always happens, after we got done talking about the business, we started talking about desktop Linux.

221
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It just sneaks in. So I started by asking Kenny, I'm like, oh, hold on, save it for the show.

222
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I want to know what you're using as your daily driver.

223
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So my daily driver for the last, I'd say, probably about 10 to 12 years or so has been Fedora.

224
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm currently running the latest and greatest Fedora.

225
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't do raw hide because I like to use my machine on a daily basis.

226
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Did you try like I just recently had a go at it.

227
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What, a raw hide? Yeah.

228
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I've done it before in the past, but I have enough experience with raw hide to know that if I need,

229
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
if I got schoolwork or something to get done that night, then no, we're going to stick with stable and we're going to roll with it.

230
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But yeah, so I use Fedora on a ThinkPad. That's my that's my main machine at home.

231
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I run BSD firewalls and I have a CentOS server that I use for a database server and file storage.

232
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And I also have two other Fedora server additions that I use for front end bastion hosting for a Web proxy

233
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and my GitLab personal server and media server that I use for various various tools.

234
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Like what kind of media server? Are you talking Plex here?

235
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I run Plex, but I've actually gotten into MB a lot more lately. Is that right?

236
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes, I have found that MB suits my needs far better than Plex has done.

237
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And I know a lot of people shy away from MB from the whole, oh, but it's written in.NET.

238
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Well, here's the deal. They used to run the mono.net, which would be problematic trying to run it with an Apache server.

239
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But with Microsoft giving all kinds of love to the Linux world, they decided to release their.NET core for free.

240
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And along with that, they run it on all the other platforms, certain components they can actually pull down the source code to.

241
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So when that happened, people found that it operated so much smoother. It was a lot easier to work with.

242
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It didn't go haywire like mono would sometimes do.

243
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And the MB project ported their core code over to the actual.NET SDK from Microsoft.

244
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And I got to say, it runs like a champ.

245
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I've got far less crashes and far less issues out of MB running on.NET than I do with Plex, even though its core is Python.

246
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Is that what drove you to switch to MB? Was the stability?

247
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Well, the stability, the feature set that came with MB out of the gate, as opposed to what you had to pay the extra Premiere features for with Plex.

248
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
There are certain features out of MB that I get more out of.

249
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So how long have you been using Linux on the desktop?

250
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Linux on the desktop, I have used it nonstop since, I'd say 2005 is when I first started using it like every single day.

251
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You're a veteran for sure.

252
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's not bad.

253
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yeah, yeah. So I used it off and on before then I tried Mandrake and OpenSUSE.

254
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
What about, do you dabble in the land of Debian at all?

255
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yes, I have. I have a soft spot in my heart for Debian as a Debian itself.

256
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Ubuntu, you know, I get it. I've used Ubuntu for a while.

257
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Oh, yeah. We all get it.

258
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah, we all get it.

259
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But when you're an assist engineer by trade and a hardcore, I just like to really tinker with things.

260
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You can either do Arch if you want to build it up from scratch on your own.

261
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Or if you still need to get stuff done, but you still want to tinker, then to me Fedora is a nice, lovely fit.

262
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And I was on the Red Hat bandwagon for a long time, working for my RHCE and everything.

263
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And pretty much everywhere I've worked at, it's always been, you know, everything is RHEL based.

264
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So it was a lot easier to translate the skill sets from Fedora to the RHEL environment.

265
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And the cool thing is when people would ask about, hey, what's coming up in RHEL?

266
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You already know because you ran Fedora.

267
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That's true. I do like that.

268
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So desktop since 2005, did you use Linux and other capacities before the desktop?

269
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Or did you start with the desktop and then get into server stuff and get into furthers from there?

270
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
When I very first started out, I actually started out in Solaris Unix back when I was in the Army.

271
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:53,000
We had – I was a missile systems technician and some of our equipment ran on like a very – I don't want to badmouth it.

272
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But it was an interesting – it was very interesting how they put it together, slimmed down version of Solaris Unix.

273
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And so I cut my teeth on that.

274
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And when I got home, I was all like, you know, hey, I found that – this is back when they used to sell Linux box sets on the shelves at stores in Walmart in South Carolina.

275
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
And the backwater of South Carolina of all places.

276
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Those were the days.

277
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
They were.

278
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Yeah.

279
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I cobbled together 30 bucks and bought a box of Linux Mandrake off the shelf, took it home, ran it.

280
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I was like, hey, this is – the core utilities are essentially the same.

281
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
There are some minor differences.

282
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So I dabbled with it for quite a while.

283
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And then when I went to go work for an internet service provider in South Carolina, everything was done on Red Hat Linux in the background.

284
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But then, of course, we had to use PuTTY from Windows machine to get in.

285
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Been there.

286
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Been there.

287
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And I was like, oh, okay.

288
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You know what?

289
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So bad.

290
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So when I went home, I was like, I got rid of Windows.

291
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I got tired of dealing with Windows.

292
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I threw – back when it was FedoraCore, I threw that on the desktop and I didn't look back.

293
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Wow.

294
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That was – I've been there ever since.

295
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Hmm.

296
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Well, I got to say, when I was going through your course, I took your course.

297
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Kenny's got a course that we're going to be doing like a snapshot of in our study group coming up.

298
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The part that I enjoyed the most was the history stuff.

299
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Even though I've kind of been here since the 90s.

300
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And I wondered if that was the part you put together that you enjoyed the most creating.

301
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Absolutely.

302
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
As I said previously, I'm a history major.

303
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So anything delving into the history is something that I enjoy.

304
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
That's going to spark my passion.

305
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And it's really difficult to get me to shut up once I get started on it.

306
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Well, thank you, Kenny.

307
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
As somebody who's been appreciating history a lot more recently, I really enjoyed that part.

308
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I look forward to the study group next week.

309
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's going to be with you right after Linux Unplugged.

310
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
All the details are over at the meetup page, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

311
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Kenny, thank you.

312
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
If you can't make it to the study group next Tuesday, I've got good news.

313
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
As the VP of community, I have the lever on the free content.

314
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And in March, I'm releasing Kenny's course, the Linux Operating Systems Fundamentals,

315
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
as free to all community users at Linux Academy.

316
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So if you're not a free community user yet, linuxacademy.com slash join, sign up for the free account.

317
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And then March, when I pull that lever, we're going to release the full course that Kenny put together.

318
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's about two hours of video content as well as some other information in there.

319
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I took it. I thought it was great.

320
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But speaking of freeing all the things, we need to free up the Internet of things in the studio, Mr. Payne.

321
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I know, right?

322
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
How can we let proprietary software so deep into the heart of JB?

323
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yeah, things like random things that run Linux or things that integrate with other things.

324
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And it's all functional, actually.

325
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So far, I've got to say that's been nice.

326
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But we've always wanted to move it over to something that was free and controlled by our own systems.

327
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And so Wes and I have been trying to put together a segment to talk about this for a while.

328
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And we realized where we were getting hung up on was an area that we thought maybe some of you are getting hung up on.

329
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And so we thought we'd put together some tests and figure this thing out.

330
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And Ironic Badger, Alex in the Mumble Room, also has an active deployment.

331
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And we'll chat with him about his setup in a minute.

332
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So to sort of preface it, I've been really hung up on which solution to use, Wes, because there's like a few of them.

333
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
As is so often the case in open source, we have too many options to choose from.

334
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And that's everything from like a framework in Python that would let you talk to these things at a low level

335
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and roll your own solution to Home Assistant, which is kind of the does everything, discovers your devices and presents a shiny GUI.

336
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So it can be hard to know like how deep do you want to go and how much control do you actually need?

337
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yeah. And then there's also what devices do you need to talk to?

338
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Because there's other products out there, not products, but I guess projects would be the way to put it,

339
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
like Homebridge that can manage a whole other range of devices that can fit in with some systems or can be standalone.

340
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's very confusing, Wes. So how did you how did you even kind of wrap your head around it and break it down?

341
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah, that's a good question. Well, first, I spent just like a lot of time reading, surveying,

342
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
talking to some of my friends and co-workers and people I know who played with automation, smart things in general.

343
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And it seemed like there was kind of a couple general classes.

344
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Obviously, like lighting comes into play and smart switches.

345
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Hughes is a particular one. And then maybe controlling a couple other things on the network.

346
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Then you have sound applications, things like Sonos. Maybe you're interfacing with a Chromecast or DLNA on the network.

347
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And maybe you're using Z-Wave. I in particular have like some window and door sensors that I've got set up

348
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
or you've already bought into MQTT. There's so many different little communities that you might actually want support in.

349
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So I just try to get enough, a roughly representative sample going on my own home network.

350
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And then I picked the ones that I thought were both the most interesting to me and seemed like they had kind of the most momentum.

351
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And that looked like Home Assistant, OpenHAB, and Domotics.

352
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
All right. Home Assistant, OpenHAB, and the other one that I'm not as familiar with, is it Domotics you said?

353
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Domotics. Yeah, exactly.

354
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
All three open source?

355
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
All three open source. Yeah. Now, they're all relatively simple to get started with.

356
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I installed all of them on Raspberry Pis, on my laptop, on a server machine, on a desktop.

357
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
All pretty simple, but I got to say Home Assistant is by far the easiest.

358
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Both OpenHAB and Home Assistant provide Raspberry Pi images that are good to go.

359
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And OpenHAB in particular has fantastic documentation really just throughout.

360
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But Home Assistant also has VM images.

361
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's got it really easy to just install using Python if you've already got pip going there.

362
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
And of course, more advanced instructions for Linux, Raspberry Pi setups, basically whatever you want.

363
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So it sounds like out of the two of them, Home Assistant is a little easier to get going on an existing Linux install that you might already have on a LAN.

364
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Now, if you get Domotics set up, you'll kind of understand what's going on.

365
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But they didn't have a first party Docker image that I could find.

366
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So it took a little bit more to get involved.

367
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That said, they have this really great long PDF.

368
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I know, I know it's long, but it's just this great documentation that they've got that really covers exactly what's going on.

369
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And it made me start to feel that Domotics is almost like if I can make like a really terrible distro analogy here.

370
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Domotics is sort of free BSD where it doesn't have quite as much plug in support.

371
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And it has its kind of own style of getting configuration done, maybe moves a little slower.

372
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And then in the middle, you've got OpenHAB, which is maybe Manjaro.

373
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's arch like, but they're trying to get easier.

374
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You can do a lot more in the GUI these days, but it has tons of flexibility.

375
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But you might have to dig in a little bit.

376
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And then way at the front over here, you've got Home Assistant, which is maybe elementary.

377
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
They do things for you.

378
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Like I just showed up in the studio, right?

379
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I was running here on my laptop.

380
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And I've already discovered like half the stuff that's running here.

381
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It just presented it.

382
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It didn't ask anything to me.

383
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So I can control the TV.

384
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I can control the shield.

385
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Just done.

386
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You can control the TV.

387
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I was wondering about that.

388
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
That would be really nice.

389
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It kind of depends on where you think you might want to fall in that spectrum.

390
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And when I'm looking at our show notes here, it looks like, Alex, you landed on Home Assistant as well.

391
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Was it for ease of use for you?

392
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,000
What compelled you to choose Home Assistant out of maybe the other most common one that I see emailed into the show would be OpenHAB?

393
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah, so a friend of mine, he, before Christmas, wanted to automate his Christmas tree lights.

394
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And he found a video on YouTube, had an ESP8266 node MCU LED light strip thing that was based around an Arduino kit.

395
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And he used Home Assistant to control that, to turn his Christmas tree lights on and off.

396
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And I thought, hmm, that looks pretty fun.

397
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Let's give that a go.

398
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And there's been a few things that have really impressed me about Home Assistant in particular.

399
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I must admit, I can't comment on OpenHAB at all, but Home Assistant is so good that I don't feel the need at this point to look around.

400
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And for me in particular, the community really is fantastic.

401
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
There's an extremely active Discord channel that you can join.

402
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And just last night, actually, I was trying to debug some lights in my house that are running on an MQTT protocol.

403
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And every time I restarted the Docker container that was running Home Assistant, the lights would go off,

404
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
which was getting really annoying when you're tinkering and you're restarting things all the time.

405
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The lights would go off every two or three minutes and wife did not like that and etc.

406
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And I jumped into Discord and 10 minutes later, that helped me rewrite the firmware that was running on the ESP8266 that I have, the node MCUs,

407
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
helped me rewrite the firmware to get rid of that issue.

408
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So now when I restart the container, nothing goes wrong.

409
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So yeah, community is brilliant.

410
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The documentation also for Home Assistant is extremely good.

411
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
They have an unbelievably high number of different device integrations.

412
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
As Wes said, a lot of it is self-discovered, but for things that aren't, like Google Assistant, for example, is supported,

413
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:31,000
you can just read the documentation and within 10 minutes be a quote unquote expert on the topic.

414
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:41,000
The other thing that I like is I try to drive everything through automation and where possible Ansible and config files.

415
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So for me, I've written an Ansible role, which it just installs the config, does a config check on the server,

416
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and then I can store the whole thing in Git.

417
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So it lowers that barrier to entry.

418
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Like you say, when you want to nuke and pave a machine or a server or whatever,

419
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
you don't really want to spend days resetting up the automation for your house.

420
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And so for me, I can store all of that stuff in Git and never have to worry about it.

421
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So that's great as well.

422
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The projects that you can do with this stuff is really cool.

423
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So the house we've moved into in America has a washing machine that's in the garage, which is out away from our main living area.

424
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Now in England, a washing machine, we used to walk past it and see the cycle had finished and be like, right, okay, time to take the clothes out.

425
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
But here, the laundry area is out of sight, therefore out of mind.

426
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So what I've done is I flashed a smart plug with an open source firmware.

427
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It monitors the current draw of the washing machine, and once it dips below a certain threshold for a certain period of time,

428
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
it then says, hey, I think your laundry is done, go check.

429
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And it will post to a telegram bot, which I have to reply to that says, yes, I've emptied the laundry before it will get rid of that.

430
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And it will keep reminding me every 30 minutes until I do that.

431
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Wow, okay, that is a clever solution.

432
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
That's pretty cool.

433
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I really like that.

434
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I have been thinking after the studio, I want to expand this to measure all kinds of stuff and voltages and tank levels and positions of gear in the RV.

435
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And I think I also want to have something set up here in the studio in Texas.

436
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So I'm really excited by both.

437
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Wes, you seem to like Home Assistant.

438
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Alex, you've been using it for a while.

439
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You've got a GitHub repo that we'll link.

440
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It looks like, is this for using Ansible with Home Assistant?

441
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Is that what you've got here in your repo?

442
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah, so I wanted to be able to develop my configuration on my laptop and then push it to my server instead of having to use Vim over SSH all the time.

443
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So I just use Ansible to literally copy the files from one place to another.

444
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You can do that however you want, but I love Ansible.

445
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So that's what I did.

446
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I was about to say, looking at it, audience members, don't be put away by the Ansible.

447
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Even if you don't use it, like there's some YAML and then some regular config files.

448
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So it's all very readable.

449
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So Wes, your takeaway from using Home Assistant and the others is that we're going to set one up in the studio.

450
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It sounds like Home Assistant would be a pretty good way to go.

451
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Is there anything we're really missing out on that you could tell from your initial looks?

452
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
A couple of things.

453
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It seemed like OpenHAB is super capable.

454
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I really don't want to sell OpenHAB short because I was super impressed.

455
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It probably has the most plugins at least.

456
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I don't know about the most, like if you weighted them by relevancy, but just going on bare number.

457
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So many different plugins and it seems like they've got a really robust model.

458
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You can model your whole house and kind of put like, have it understand which devices are in which rooms.

459
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
They've got home bridge integration.

460
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
They've got integration with IDE or with cloud services.

461
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So even if you're not using a Smart Assistant or something, you can still use the cloud APIs to convert speech to text.

462
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Super robust, but you don't quite get the same level of first use ease.

463
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
When I first set up Home Assistant, it prompts you to create a new user, get logged in.

464
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
OpenHAB was easy too, but you're presented with like three different UI choices.

465
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It's not clear where the default is or what you should do.

466
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And while that's been improving a lot, the UI that they're building still doesn't expose everything the configuration file does.

467
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So either way, you're stuck learning and going into the deep end.

468
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So I'm going to be giving a talk on Home Assistant at Linux Fest Northwest.

469
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Thanks, Chris.

470
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And one of the other things that I haven't mentioned about Home Assistant is that they do offer a cloud-based hosting of Home Assistant with has.io.

471
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So you can self-host it, which is what I do because I prefer to keep everything on my LAN that I possibly can.

472
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But they do also offer a hosted service, which is super duper, duper easy to use.

473
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Can I ask you really quick then, one thing I've been using Home Assistant in the past and sort of came back to it, rebuilt my install, which was all very easy.

474
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And I was surprised to see how much more stuff can be configured in the GUI than when I last used it.

475
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But what I was disappointed by is the app I'd been previously using no longer worked.

476
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I guess at some point they changed their authentication flow.

477
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Have you run into those problems or do you have an app that you like that has just kept working?

478
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I just use the browser.

479
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So this is something that's changed fairly recently.

480
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Their default UI has changed to something called Lovelace.

481
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And this is based around the concept of cards.

482
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And you can do pretty much whatever you can conceive of with a card.

483
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You could have a map of your house on an iPad on the wall, for example, and just tap this part of the screen.

484
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You want to turn the lights or the climate control on or off in.

485
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I interact primarily, though, with my has through the UI on my computer, but also through the telegram bot that I mentioned.

486
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So if I want to set the heating, I'll just send a telegram message or I will use Google Assistant.

487
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I very rarely actually use the interface, I must be honest.

488
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Oh, interesting.

489
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
See, one of the things I really enjoyed, I remember sitting in bed at one point in a previous home

490
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and couldn't quite yell at my assistant enough to do what I wanted and having Home Assistant right there

491
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
where it turns on or off my light over the land with no reliance on any cloud service.

492
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
That was really nice.

493
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Yeah, so for that you could build a very simple MQTT button that publishes to a topic.

494
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Cool.

495
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,000
You press the button that's on your nightstand and then that just sets the bedtime routine going.

496
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So in my house, for example, I just say it's bedtime and 20 minutes later all my lights fade out and it's very slow, gradual process.

497
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And then one minute before the lights go out, so I know to put my phone down, the lights do a little blip and then they go off completely.

498
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
That's pretty great.

499
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That's pretty great.

500
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I like all of the effort putting in re-implementing a button and a switch, but worth it.

501
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
That's pretty good.

502
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Well, last week after the show I bought a Raspberry Pi rack that was recommended to me on Twitter.

503
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It's like an acrylic for Raspberry Pi stand.

504
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Yeah, what do you think?

505
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Do you think it would work on there?

506
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

507
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I mean, oh, there's so many services we can get deployed.

508
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
All right.

509
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That will be our next project now is the Raspberry Pi JB1 server farm.

510
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I was really waiting to see which way that went.

511
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I didn't want to sway your vote, so I didn't mention this before, but I did do an interview with the, I believe, the founder of Home Assistant.

512
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And I'll have a link to that in the show notes way back.

513
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And it was just a great chat.

514
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So if you want to watch a little bit additional Home Assistant content, link in the show notes.

515
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Hey, let's talk a little Raspberry Pi.

516
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
We have some updates for you Raspbian users out there.

517
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:55,000
The Raspberry Pi Foundation is finally rolling out the 4.19 kernel, which is a nice improvement because the last version was based on 4.14, like a CentOS user.

518
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And now going to 4.19, you get a lot of nice improvements with that.

519
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And you might be wondering, friends, well, geez, with these faster kernels and updates to 18.04, is there is there changes coming down the road for Ubuntu Mate on the Raspberry Pi?

520
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So we went to the one, the only Martin Wimperis and we said, Wimpy, what's going on in the land of Raspberry Pi and Ubuntu Mate, sir?

521
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Yeah, we're making new images at the moment.

522
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I say we, me, I'm making new images for the Raspberry Pi 2, 3 and 3 plus for Ubuntu Mate.

523
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:38,000
But this is really a bean work that's delayed and there's been some background goings on that I've been aware of at work.

524
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So I'm standing on the shoulders of giants here.

525
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
In December, we decided to double down on the Raspberry Pi at Canonical.

526
00:43:48,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And with the 18.04.2 release, which came out two weeks ago, I think now, you can get full blooded cloud enabled Ubuntu server images for the Raspberry Pi 2, 3 and 3 plus for 18.04.2.

527
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Both the 32 bit and 64 bit for the Pi 3 boards.

528
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:20,000
So what that means is we've shined off the rough edges that existed in the in the Raspberry Pi implementation.

529
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And those are legit images now that are being regularly produced alongside all of the rest of the build images.

530
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Does Canonical see like a server workload here, like Raspberry Pi's in production type thing?

531
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Well, yes, we see Raspberry Pi's in production all the time, not just the Raspberry Pi, but also the compute module boards.

532
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
But in a server capacity like like running services?

533
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Not in the server sense that you're thinking of.

534
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So we've obviously got Ubuntu Core, which has had reference images for the Pi since day one.

535
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And those have improved as a result of this work as well.

536
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So there are new images of those.

537
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But there are some customers that are working on IoT stuff.

538
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And they want to use snaps for all of the reasons why snaps were designed for IoT and are good for IoT.

539
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But they don't want to make the full paradigm shift to Ubuntu Core just yet.

540
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So they want a classic Ubuntu system on which they can deploy their snaps.

541
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So we're seeing this as a bridge to getting people using snaps in the Ubuntu ecosystem.

542
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And also, increasingly, people want to develop and test snaps on platforms.

543
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And the Raspberry Pi is ubiquitous.

544
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So by having 32 bit and 64 bit images of the Pi, then pretty much anyone for a low barrier of entry can create snaps, test snaps and do development.

545
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And target on that platform.

546
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And then as a spinoff, now that work has completed and that finished a couple of weeks ago.

547
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I've been wanting to update the Ubuntu Mate images for the Raspberry Pi since 1804 came out.

548
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
But I knew all of this work was going on.

549
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And I wanted to base the next images of Ubuntu Mate on a proper Ubuntu kernel.

550
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:31,000
In the past, I took a kernel from the Raspberry Pi Foundation and side ported that and was using that as a mean.

551
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So it's basically the Raspberry Pi Foundation kernel with Ubuntu user space.

552
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So technically, it's not really Ubuntu.

553
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You know, there's a bunch of stuff that doesn't work there as a result.

554
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:51,000
These new images use the Ubuntu kernel that's maintained by the Ubuntu kernel team and the Ubuntu security team.

555
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And they're on the same release and security patch cadence as the other kernels we produce.

556
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So I'm much happier about that.

557
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
A proper pedigree.

558
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yeah, that does sound like great news, Wimpy.

559
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And that's all for 1804, though.

560
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
This isn't even work for 1904.

561
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Does it pay it forward?

562
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah, these images, obviously, will be recreated for the 20 series.

563
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But for the Pi images, we're just targeting the LTSs.

564
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Oh, okay.

565
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And then there's some other work going on as well.

566
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So I've spoken about this in the past, is that the thing that makes the Raspberry Pi so successful,

567
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,000
one of the things that makes the Raspberry Pi so successful is there is this software ecosystem that you can buy into.

568
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And there is hardware components, there are hats and all manner of goodies.

569
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And then the software to enable and utilize all of these add on peripherals and devices all exists in the Raspbian archives.

570
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And that's what makes it a really compelling platform because all the tools are there to build whatever you want to make.

571
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So there's a guy at Canonical now called Dave Jones.

572
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
He's a longtime Raspberry Pi community member and contributor.

573
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And he's working on bringing that whole ecosystem of software over to Ubuntu.

574
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So all of that stuff that's packaged up in the Raspbian archives and only exists there,

575
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:36,000
he is working on bringing it to the Ubuntu archives and all of that work or at least most of that work is going to get SIUed to 1804.

576
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And Dave is also one of the lead contributors to a project called Pi Wheels,

577
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:48,000
which is a whole bunch of pre-compiled Python modules specifically for the Raspberry Pi.

578
00:48:48,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And he's going to be standing up infrastructure on Ubuntu, which is a rebuild of all of that software archive available for Ubuntu.

579
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Because there are differences in the library versions between Debian and Raspbian and Ubuntu and he's taking care of all of that.

580
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So there's quite a lot of work going on there.

581
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
It's an exciting time and it was the right time to reboot the Ubuntu Mate images for the Pi.

582
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
That is delighting to hear.

583
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I just don't know what my problem is, but I just bought myself another Raspberry Pi.

584
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I was listening to Choose Linux and the guys were talking about Raspberry Pis and I was like, you know, I'm getting another one.

585
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So Wimpy, I have one quick question.

586
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
All of that was really interesting.

587
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
What's SIUed?

588
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
What does that mean?

589
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Oh, right.

590
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Okay, it's the name of the process of taking a new or updated piece of software and bringing it back to the LTS or a past release.

591
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So if it needs significant patching in some respect, then it gets patched and then it gets brought back into the, in this case, the 1804 archive.

592
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And in some cases that can just be simply adding a patch to the Debian package or in some cases, you know, not many people realize this, but sometimes software actually gets revved up to a newer version.

593
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So sometimes it's non-trivial to apply all of the necessary security patches.

594
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And if there's no, you know, ABI or compatibility breakage, then a potential option is to just bring a newer version of the package to the archive.

595
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So an SIUing is the means by which we manage that.

596
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah, it is something you read when you see it, when you see like a news article about like the GNOME performance fixes we were talking about earlier.

597
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You read at the bottom of like Michael Larable's post, he talks about how it's getting SRUed for 1804 or 1810, I think he might have said. And you look at that and you go, what does that mean?

598
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Well, that's it right there. And it's something that is just sort of a, I don't think Canonical is the only company that uses that term, but I don't really see it used anywhere else.

599
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Yeah, it stands for stable release update.

600
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Okay. Is that something you guys created? It feels like it's, is it an interesting term or is it a Canonical term?

601
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The acronym predates me. I don't know if this is a Debianism that Ubuntu has inherited or if this is an Ubuntuism, it's just the term that I know.

602
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:28,000
You know, I guess I wish, I am just so tempted right now. If this wasn't a live show, I would take, I'm trying to do it as I talk, I would take the 30 seconds and I would go Google this because I want to know now.

603
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:40,000
But let's see. Yeah. Okay. That's what I get when I Google it. Not enough. Well, thank you, Wimpy. Thank you very much. Why don't we get my attention back by talking about some great picks.

604
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I found one and Wes found one. Let's start with Mr. Paynes. It's called SubSync. Oh, I bet I can guess what this is, Wes. This is for keeping all of your submarines in sync.

605
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Oh yes. I mean, it's very dangerous when you've got those thermonuclear warheads on board. You got to make sure you're in sync. No, no. Think language agnostic automatic synchronization of subtitles to video.

606
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:18,000
What? Yeah, I know, right? I'm sure you've all been there. You got this subtitle file, some generous soul on the internet bothered to go write out all the subtitles for something, but it's not quite working with the version that you have. So here we go.

607
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Is this watching the video, watching their lips and figuring out how to sync the video or is it using like a time code? It's in the subtitles. How does that work? How much magic is involved?

608
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:38,000
They don't talk too much about how they're doing it. No, they don't. But they even talk about you can like you can actually even send the results right to VLC. Of course you can. Of course you can.

609
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I tested it a little bit and it did seem to work. Yeah, so OK, they're looking at a 10 millisecond window of time to determine if that window contains speech.

610
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:58,000
They look at that and they say we have two binary strings, one for the subtitles and one for the video. We try to align these strings by matching the zeros with the zeros and the ones with the ones.

611
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:14,000
We score these alignments as matching digits or mismatched digits. The best scoring alignments determines how offset the subtitles in time, how to offset them and how to properly sync them with the video. This is great, Wes. This is so cool, Wes.

612
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yeah, the other nice part, too, is I mean, it's written in Python. It's easy to get going and it's really not that long. So I think I'll be giving it a read after the show.

613
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Now, my pick is it's on topic for me. This is something that I'm pretty passionate about, and that's making it easier for people to podcast.

614
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:36,000
We've been releasing tools on our Jupiter Broadcasting GitHub to sort of enable some of that. And this is in that vein.

615
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:44,000
It's called Podcast Generator at PodcastGenerator.net. It's an open source podcast publishing solution.

616
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It promises, now I will admit I do not use this, but I just think it's such a neat initiative and I love that it's open source. So I wanted to make you all aware of it.

617
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Because, surprise, surprise, I'm not willing to migrate our entire infrastructure over to this project just to try it out for the show.

618
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
If we had not already found a solution, this would be really worth looking into.

619
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Yeah, I mean, we are thrilled with our solution, so we're good. But it's obviously something we're keeping an eye on and we wanted to let you know about it.

620
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:20,000
They offer kind of a click and go sort of setup. It basically works on any web host that has PHP and gives you a nice intuitive web interface to publish audio and video podcasts.

621
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Yeah, that's the part. Like, think of this as a CMS system that helps, like, once you've got your finished, edited show, where are you going to put it?

622
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
How do you submit it to stores? Where do your tags go in your descriptions and how do they get the MP3? Podcast generators for that.

623
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Yeah, you know, and maybe you want to do a podcast and you're not a web developer and you want something that looks great on mobile where people can get links and stuff like that, check it out.

624
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Link will be in the show notes, which is in your mobile player, or you can go to linuxunplug.com slash 290 for subsync and podcast generator.

625
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Okay, well that'll bring us to the end of this week's show, so I'm going to just take a moment and say go over to linuxunplug.com slash contact and send us your screenshot of your.files.

626
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:11,000
How bad is that? We have a reckoning coming. We have a reckoning coming. We're keeping that soapbox fresh and ready to go, so let us know, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

627
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,000
You can, like, post it up on Imgur or something and send us the link, or you can tweet me at Chris LAS and attach a screenshot of it.

628
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:25,000
We're collecting the evidence now because I suspect it's real bad. It's real bad. Let us know.

629
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
At Chris LAS for me, he's at Westpane. Go find Wimpy over at the Ubuntu podcast, ubuntupodcast.org.

630
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Mr. Wimpress, since you're on holiday over there on the show, is there anything else you want to give a little plug ski for this week?

631
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
How about User Error? I've really been enjoying that recently.

632
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Yeah, yeah. How about User Error? I agree. I agree. That show is so great. It is absolutely one of my, as soon as it's out, I download and listen to it.

633
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Even if it's super early in the morning, Error.show, Popey, Joe, and Daniel Foray just really have meshed, just made that show so great, so great plug.

634
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:12,000
All right. There you have it. Links to everything we talked about, including Alex's Ansible repo, links to the stories, all of that.

635
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Linuxunplug.com slash 290 or in your podcast player of choice.

636
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Also, take a look at those chapter markers. If you're not in a podcast player that supports chapter markers, consider an upgrade.

637
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
If there's a segment you want to hear again or something you want to skip, chapter markers make that really easy.

638
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Or if you're trying to go back and find something we talked about, they make it really easy to jump right to that spot.

639
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I'm a big fan. I'd love to hear from you at Chris LAS.

640
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Join our telegram group, jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram and meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

641
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
See you next Tuesday!

642
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:23,000
All right. Let's go pick our title. JBtitles.com. Let's go see if we can find something.

643
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah. Brent, did you do your job today?

644
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Oh, yeah. Let's see how Brent did. I mean, he's I believe he's under the wire.

645
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I know. I know.

646
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yeah. He might not even have. I mean, no, I know. I saw he was IRCing. So there's no excuse.

647
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Yeah, I'm here. Wes, I think you took one of my titles here. I think you well, you went up.

648
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
You went up my title. I think you deserve this.

649
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:55,000
That is you're right. So so Brent submitted a proper pedigree and Wes came in one minute later with with proper pie pedigree, which is a little better.

650
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It's got more P's in it.

651
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Maximum alliteration, right? Isn't that the rule?

652
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah, I was literally typing that out when I saw him submit it.

653
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
You should submit it and we should give it to you then.

654
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Oh, come on, Wes. We can share.

655
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I keep picking Coda Radio titles. So it's like it's going to my head.

656
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
That is one of our moves on Coda Radio is to have to have the alliteration like that.

657
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Wes, was there was there like a small package at the studio when you got there today?

658
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, man.

659
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
You would be doing me the biggest solid if you'd break that thing open and put one of those little discs in the fish tank for me.

660
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
That's their long lasting food. And it didn't arrive before I left. And I've been worried the fish weren't going to get fed.

661
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Yeah, absolutely. No problem.

662
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Joe was right. Joe was right about the fish tank.

663
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,000
That's so funny to hear on air, guys. Oh, yeah. Can you do the dishes too?

664
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Oh, actually, I do need to take the garbage out.

665
00:58:44,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I can handle that, too.
