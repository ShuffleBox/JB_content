WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Ah, Wes.

00:01.000 --> 00:03.000
The Cone of Silence.

00:03.000 --> 00:09.000
In our rush to plan two episodes, we didn't prepare pre-shows for either one of them.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
I thought you were bringing the pre-show.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Yeah, I thought Alex was bringing the pre-show.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
We've been, like, livestreaming for 45 minutes.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
How do we not have a pre-show?

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Normally they just happen.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I don't think that's how podcasting works, Wes.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
I wish I could hear those guys, but they're in, like, a Cone of Silence.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Hello, friends, and welcome in to your Unplugged program.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
My name is Chris.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
My name is Wes.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
Hello, Wes.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
I am elated about today's episode.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
There's a lot going on.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
We have a real treat today.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
We're checking in with Hayden Barnes, who is intimately involved with the Windows subsystem for Linux

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
and now works at Canonical.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
We'll talk about some of the big things coming to that surprisingly more and more prominent platform.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Hold on.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Did I just call it a platform?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
That's actually a thing now.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
We'll tell you what's going on there, what their interest is,

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
and some of the big things that are about to happen just even in early 2020 that we've got to wrap our heads around.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
So it's a great time.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
It's been just over a year since Hayden was on the show.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
And a lot has changed.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Mm-hmm.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Mm-hmm.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
But before we go any further, I got to say how you doing to Alex and Cheesy.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Hello, gents.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Hello.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
How are you doing?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I'm all right.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm pretty good.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
We're recording doubles today live.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
So it's a big, big live day.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Extra unplugged.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I should say, though, that we will not be live for the next few weeks.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
So check the calendar because we're going into holiday mode.

01:36.000 --> 01:45.000
So it is with some honor for the last time this year I say hello, virtual lug, and time appropriate greetings.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Hello.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Hello, everybody.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
We've got a good showing in there today, and we have a lot to get into.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
So let's start with the community news.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
And I wanted to just talk a little bit about GNOME 3.4.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Yes, I know it's already out.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
It's not news anymore.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Although not everybody has it yet.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
But there was something in the last round of reviews and discussions that got missed.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And it's a simple thing, but I think it shows some promise.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
And I wanted to give it some attention.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
And so that is the new extensions tool that is now built into GNOME Shell.

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
It's a tool just conveniently called GNOME Dash Extensions that makes it easier to create and manage GNOME Shell extensions.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
And you can go in there and turn them off, turn them on, much like the UI in GNOME Tweaks.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
But this is something actually built into the shell now and doesn't require you to install GNOME Tweaks.

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
Yeah, it looks like it comes with a lot of nice everyday features that you actually want to use when you're making an extension.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
So it's less of an arcane process and something that's provided first class support from upstream.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
I think it's a sign perhaps of a seriousness.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
The project is starting to take extensions, and this is the first step.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
So that's kind of why I wanted to give it a little attention.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
Because I didn't mention it when GNOME Shell shipped, when version 3.4 shipped.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
But I thought it's something we should talk about.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
But now I want to tell you about what's coming in GNOME Shell 3.36, the next version.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
And that's big for those of you that have multiple GPUs, particularly if one of those is an NVIDIA GPU.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Oh, yes.

03:19.000 --> 03:27.000
GNOME developer Bastion Nocera has been cleaning up the switcheroo control code so that it doesn't rely on the kernel's VGA switcheroo.

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
And so that it can support more than two GPUs, hey, that's nice, and better support of handling main and secondary options and configuration.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
But the big addition for end users is proprietary NVIDIA support.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
That's nice. It's nice.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
I'm a child that I just find the actual project name is switcheroo control.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
That's awesome.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Adorable.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
That is.

03:52.000 --> 04:02.000
And so in recent releases of Mudder, they've made particular changes in how it handles multiple GPUs and rendering and the logic around that and how the shell is handling external GPUs.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
There's like a lot of stealth GPU work being done in GNOME Shell right now.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
And there's some general cleanups and improvements in the way it communicates with other applications.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
So the entire GNOME Shell will handle GPU switching much smoother in 3.36.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
It's not all the way there, but a lot better.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It's just getting more and more stable.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
It doesn't feel like all the little pieces that we've been worrying about in GNOME Shell, they're getting patched up.

04:25.000 --> 04:36.000
Of course, none of that matters if you're WireGuard, ZFS, Python, Redis, and many other things just go away, which could potentially happen for some.

04:36.000 --> 04:45.000
There is a, I mean, a very apparently hardworking maintainer for a bunch of very important PPAs for the Ubuntu ecosystem.

04:45.000 --> 04:56.000
Like I mentioned, ZFS, WireGuard, Python, 2.7 through 3.7, Perl 6, Open JDK, a bunch of other stuff that's really important.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
And he's had it.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
The maintainer, his first name's Jonathan, is sick and tired of commercial companies, presumably large commercial companies,

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
coming to him and asking for help and refusing to pay for his time.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
And so as such, he has announced that he is flipping his PPA repositories private.

05:16.000 --> 05:25.000
He writes, I will be removing most of my PPAs from public access due to the continued and persistent abuse by companies using these packages for commercial gain

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
with flagrant disregard to the knowledge and effort required to maintain them.

05:29.000 --> 05:37.000
These companies are quite happy to charge thousands of dollar sign currency per month for their product slash service.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
But when they make a request, will absolutely not pay someone else for their time.

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
And then he finishes it with a nice solid, this is why we can't have nice things, just to really kind of get it in there.

05:50.000 --> 05:59.000
And I am really torn on this one because for me, it bubbles up a lot of the frustrations I have with the Ubuntu ecosystem right now

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
in such that it brings a lot of questions to my mind.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
Oh, you're talking from the end user perspective here, just as a consumer of Ubuntu.

06:08.000 --> 06:17.000
Yeah, I'm frustrated that this quote unquote enterprise grade platform that I can somehow deploy and get 10 years of support for,

06:17.000 --> 06:31.000
but yet something as critical as Perl or Python or OpenJDK or Wirecard or ZFS can just be pulled because a developer is having a bad day.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Like, why has this not been solved yet by Canonical?

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
Why have snaps not matured to the point where they solve this problem?

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Why are we still even dealing with PPAs in nearly 2020?

06:42.000 --> 06:51.000
And the reality of it is the market is wholly dependent on the PPA sauce to make Ubuntu a practical operating system at scale.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
That's the reality of it. And it's dangerous.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
PPAs full stop are dangerous.

06:57.000 --> 07:05.000
They're dangerous from a stability standpoint, as in this case, as just proven by this particular PPA author.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
But what if they were dangerous in another way?

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
A way that hasn't really happened that we know of, but could be extremely devastating.

07:13.000 --> 07:21.000
What if instead of rage quitting in a public forum, that developer decides to screw somebody and they put something malicious in those bills?

07:21.000 --> 07:28.000
We don't really have a clear understanding of the trust model with these PPAs, but yet we're putting them in production.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
I'm frustrated that this isn't solved.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
I'm frustrated that Ubuntu has grown to the size it is and they haven't gotten over the line on this.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
And I'm frustrated that one angry developer can screw with a whole bunch of people's day like this.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
I also am frustrated that he expects to get paid.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
And I know that's a really controversial thing to say, and I wish he would get paid.

07:50.000 --> 08:00.000
I wish that the market dynamics were such that every bug request that comes in had a tip amount automatically attached to it, and you could put 15 bucks on a bug request.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I wish it was like that.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
But he signed up for a job to be a free maintainer of free software, regardless of who the user is.

08:08.000 --> 08:17.000
Whether it's individual Chris or if it's a multi-billion dollar corporation, you don't pick and choose who the user of free software is.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
I will note that in the post, it specifically stresses that it's not just about money.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
It's about donations, sponsorships, employment.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
That's all money.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
It is money, but 20 percent time.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
I mean, I think there's a more effort being, you know, if development was being pushed upstream to help maintain these PPAs.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Because the other thing here is I think you're missing a part where PPAs are definitely used at scale.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
But if you're a real big player, this doesn't matter to you.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
You can set up, you have engineer time that you can throw and fix your own problems.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
It's the people deploying it in the middle who have taken on the risk of trusting PPAs.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
I think that might be a safe majority.

08:51.000 --> 08:59.000
But not a lot of shops have the time to set up their own local repos and get all their developers to put all their dependencies in those repos.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And then make sure they're all on the systems that are on the network.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
Like it's definitely doable, especially with a Debian system.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
But I don't know.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
I bet a lot of organizations just say, ah, screw it.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Just add the PPA.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
It's got everything you need.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I think it happens a lot.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Oh, yeah, of course you do.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
I'm just saying the ones in the middle are the ones that are affected by this the most because they lack the ability to pivot in an easy way.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
And I totally completely understand that, you know, here's this guy.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
He's doing volunteer work, right?

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
He's got a lot of other things going on in his life.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
This isn't how he gets paid.

09:31.000 --> 09:39.000
And now with these kinds of requests and changes and pleas to support something that takes an extremely large amount of time, he's being put off by this.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
He's being put out.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
He's being asked to work a full time job and he's not getting compensated for it.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
It's not fair.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
What's the alternative, though?

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
You know, do Canonical pay him for that work?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Is that a sustainable model for Canonical?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Maybe, maybe not.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Do you go to an AUR style model?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Do you not provide them at all?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
You know, what's the alternative?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
I think there's two issues.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
The first issue is that's the job he signed up for.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
So while it's not fair and it asks for way more than it should.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
That also doesn't take into account like you don't always know what you're signing up for when you start a project or start.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm going to maintain this PPA for me and my friends or my company.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And then in two years, it's giant.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
Well, that was very much the case for me with Linux server.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Right.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
So when does it transition to a responsibility from I'm just doing this?

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
My answer would be to that is that it's a systemic issue that it's not solvable by the individual maintainer.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
It has to be solved at the system level.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
And I was joking when I said it, but I mean, why the hell not?

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
Why not be able to throw a cold 50 on a bug and say whoever fixes this bug gets to claim that 50 bucks?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
It's a bug bounty program.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
There's systems out there.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Elementary OS uses one.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
There's systems out there for this.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
But like so many things, we just fail to adopt and move because the tooling is good enough.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
We got a job to do.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
And here we are.

10:59.000 --> 11:06.000
But now the end result is people that are using Ubuntu in production have a less reliable, less stable system now.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Or they always did.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
But it's you're more aware of it now.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Yeah.

11:10.000 --> 11:10.000
Right.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Because it's always been a problem.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
It's not like it's just that we're really feeling that there was always a risk anytime you've added a PPA.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
They can't let this stand.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
They can't let this guy pull WireGuard and ZFS and Python and Redis.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Ansible.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
He's the maintainer for Ansible on Ubuntu.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
That's kind of a big deal.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
So then the other question is you're talking about snaps.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Are there room?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Why are these PPAs needed?

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
Obviously a lot of these are already in the repositories in older LTS style versions.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
And then there are other means.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
Is it just that the people who are actually responsible for the projects are not doing that work to package them and provide them in ways their users.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Or is it not possible to use snaps to supply ZFS and WireGuard?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I genuinely don't know the answer to that.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
I mean it seems like there's been a lot of exploration in core snaps.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
I'm not sure.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
But I would assume that's how you would add support for it to Ubuntu core.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
But I don't know.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Well and I think that you could extend this to beyond PPAs.

12:03.000 --> 12:15.000
If you look at other forums like GitHub where a lot of projects run into the same issue where someone's just developing it out of their own will and want.

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
And then it gets used by these larger corporations and they're up against the same thing.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
Where they're doing a project that they like to do and then now there's demands being brought on them.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
I think GitHub has done a pretty good job though in the way that they handle it.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
And they have begun to sponsor certain projects and developers.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
And I could definitely see that being the same scenario with PPAs or things like them.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah it's unfortunate that we keep circling back to this.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm thinking about the open SSL developer story too.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Every couple of years, every couple of months this comes up.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
I think it's actually worse here because it is further down the food chain.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
He's not even the one that's developing the software.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
He's packaging it for one distribution.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Now it happens to be a large one.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
But this issue happens across all the distributions.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
And it's even more pronounced in some smaller niche distributions.

13:09.000 --> 13:17.000
Where you're really, you're just not registering on the Linux Foundation's radar or on whoever.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Because you're not actually writing the code.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
You're just packaging it.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
It is an absolutely, fundamentally vital role for the consumers of the distribution.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Right, that's what I'm talking about right now.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Right.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
So it's a real humdinger because it's sort of a thankless position.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
The person who is constantly keeping something up to date in a distribution,

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
satisfying dependencies, resolving bugs and quirks that are applicable to that distribution,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
it's a never ending job.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Right, you're taking on both not having direct control over the software

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
and interacting with all the downstream consumers.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
I think in this particular scenario, perhaps now that Jonathan has gotten enough attention,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
maybe he could start a Patreon.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
But that's not going to solve it for everybody.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
And there's a lot of Patreon fatigue out there.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Yeah, he's got a link to a Ko-fi post.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
So there are some options there.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
But you're right, that's not, I mean, that's clearly not a solution that's working universally.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
This is a topic contributing to open source development that we're going to touch on pretty early in 2020

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
that we have some big thoughts on and some things to talk about.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
But I think for now, we should probably just move forward because it's a really difficult situation.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
You can see it from his perspective.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
You can see it from the end consumer's perspective.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Nobody wins.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
But it's one of our key challenges in our ecosystem right now.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
But one of the benefits of our ecosystem is we see a lot of innovation.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
And the popcorn pocket computer or pocket popcorn computer, something like that, could be just that.

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
Imagine a device dedicated to a terminal in your pocket.

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
A full QWERTY keyboard with a 1920 by 1080 IPS 4.9 5-inch screen.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Oh.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
So it's meant for terminals.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Yeah, QWERTY keyboard.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
QWERTY, 1.2 gigahertz quad-core ARM processor, 2 gigs of RAM.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
I can work with that.

15:01.000 --> 15:08.000
Lots of different connectivity options, lots of different connectivity options, as well as four USB-C connectors.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Whoa.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
This is a real device.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
It's called the Pocket Popcorn Computer.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
And it's available as sort of a pre-order Kickstarter now.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
I was about to say, how do I get me one?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
I know.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
It looks really good.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And geez, they've made some devices before.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
They've shipped hardware.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
So this isn't their first product.

15:25.000 --> 15:31.000
Yeah, so I'm not 100% sure it's done by the same creators, Next Thing Co.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
I was looking, or Next Thing Company, I was looking to see if it was some of those creators.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
And I'm not 100% sure.

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
But this is very similar to the Pocket Chip.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
The Pocket Chip Pro actually used the same CPU.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
You know, I'm curious.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
I think it would be a neat device to have.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
The keyboard, the renderings, everything, it looks pretty slick.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
I like how they've managed to put such a nice screen in a small device.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
Like you said, they're about halfway to being funded right now.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
I think it would be a neat device to have.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
I just don't know, for me, if it would be incredibly useful.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
Yeah, if you're doing a lot of support over terminals, if you're doing a lot of remote work over SSH,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I think it might be a no-brainer.

16:18.000 --> 16:28.000
Yeah, I mean, with the Pocket Chip, which I had, it was an inexpensive device, like $70 or $80.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
The keyboard wasn't great.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
It was kind of an afterthought anyway.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
It was a neat device, but it wasn't really a practical device.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
Like I wouldn't really use it to get any work done,

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
whereas this particular device looks a little better.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
It looks like they've actually put some thought into the keyboard.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
You know what I like?

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
I'm digging the fact that it has as many USB-C ports as a MacBook Pro.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Amazing.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah, that is incredible.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
And it's got a 3200 milliamp hour battery.

16:59.000 --> 17:05.000
It's got LoRa, the GNSS built into it.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
So, I mean, you've got a lot of other options there that you didn't have with the Pocket Chip.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
So I think it's definitely a neat device.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
You know, I'll wait for you guys to pick it up.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
Maybe since Chris and I picked up the PinePhone, maybe Wes can pick this up and let us know how it goes.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Yeah, there you go, Wes.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
I kind of would love one just sort of bouncing around my glove box whenever I needed it.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
I'm curious if anyone in the Mumble Room would buy a device like this.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
So it fits in, you know, a bag.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
It's pretty thin.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
They focused on giving it a pretty nice QWERTY keyboard,

17:37.000 --> 17:42.000
so it's got a decent Enter key, Shift, Escape, Tab.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
And, you know, the CPU has been around.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
It's been optimized.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
It's totally capable of what they're promising in this thing.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
I mentioned IoT, too, which kind of makes sense.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
You could see carrying this out from the field.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Maybe you're trying to troubleshoot with some devices

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
and you walk up and attach to it and away you go.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
And with a 3,200 milliamp battery, this thing is going to go for quite a while.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
So it's sort of like a go-to, you know it's going to work.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
All I need is like a rugged case so I don't break it.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
So they've raised $20,000.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
They're trying to get to $50,000 to launch this thing.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Okay.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
So they're about halfway-ish.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
The pricing, once it's done, would sort of fall around $199,000 for right now,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
if you do the pre-order for a device.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
And if you want one with the LoRa radio and the Wi-Fi and all of the fancy radios,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
that one's $299,000.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Okay.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
That's not terrible.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I mean, we're in sort of like what, Chromebook territory?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Yeah, I suppose so.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
Two gigs of RAM, 32 gigabytes of built-in, plus an expandable microSD slot,

18:38.000 --> 18:44.000
4.9-inch, 4.95, 1080 screen IPS.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
I kind of like it.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't have a need for it.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
Like, geez, it's like I don't do a lot of SSH that I wouldn't just do from a tablet

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
or from my desktop.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Right.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
When I need it, my phone works.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
It's not super pleasant, but it's not.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
If I didn't have an iPad, I think I would do this.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
I ended up getting an iPad just mostly so I could watch videos on airplanes,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
which I would not be able to use this for.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
So that's the main use.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
I've got to catch up on my shows, Wes, on my stories.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
It should be said, too, that it runs Debian 10 with a mainline kernel.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
It's compatible with Gadget OS, Buildroot.

19:18.000 --> 19:24.000
The keyboard is an open source keyboard, and the LED controller firmware is also open.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
So the device itself seems like it's a pretty open device,

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
and some of the other little firmware bits are open and available

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
where you don't get that on some other open source hardware.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
So I think that is pretty neat as well, that they're opening it up completely.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
So we'll see where it goes, you know?

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
We'll put a link in the show notes if you are curious yourself.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Really, I like the whole aesthetic overall.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
So even if this one's not for me, I'm excited to see.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Hopefully this project is successful and then we see more things like it.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Yeah, absolutely.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
Well, before we go any further, before we get into a big housekeeping

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
and before we jump into the future of WSL, how about a round of applause?

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
Hello to Mr. Big Daddy Linux, Rocco joining us in the Mumba Room.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Hello, Rocco.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Hey, Chris, how are you?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
You have perfect timing.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
This is exactly the moment in the show I wanted to mention that this week

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
on Rocco's Linux Spotlight, it's my turn.

20:20.000 --> 20:25.000
I'll be coming out with a video with Rocco and I chatting about everything.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
It's great.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
So perfect timing, Rocco.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Welcome to the show.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Well, it didn't feel like perfect timing because I was pretty late,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
but I guess it works out.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
We're just sitting here running our mouths, you know?

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
It takes us a while to get to the important stuff.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
Well, speaking of the important stuff, the interview that we had

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
the talk that we had was absolutely awesome.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
If anybody wants to know anything about you and your history,

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
we covered pretty much everything from your history into Linux

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
to your sysadmin days to a great story on your nightmare scenario.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
That was fabulous.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Well, I really enjoyed it and I appreciated the opportunity

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
because the two joys I have on the weekend right now

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
are Brunch with Brent and Linux Spotlight.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
So it was great to be able to participate.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
And also, you got to me before Brent did, so congratulations.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Another round of applause on that.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
Hey now, hey now.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
But no, it's really a great show.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Jill's been on there.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Jill was on Linux Spotlight and on Brunch with Brent.

21:29.000 --> 21:35.000
And you get a good sort of flavor of people that are talked about a lot

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
on these shows across a lot of the different podcasts.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
You'll hear people's names get dropped or mentioned.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
And so this just sort of fills in the background.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
I'm still getting my way through the recent Wimpy episode that's fantastic.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Good to have you here and you're welcome to hang out with us.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
So we're going to be chatting about stuff and all that

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
and doing a little housekeeping.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
We have some big news ourselves.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
But so Raka, when does that video come out?

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Let's finish that business.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
When's that out and where do people find it?

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
So you can go to bigdaddylinux.com for the links or the YouTube channel.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
But it comes out Wednesday, December 18th at 6 a.m. Eastern time.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
There you go.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Maybe we'll get an updated link in the show notes when that's out there.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
We can do that.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
We sure can.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
Yeah.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
And that's stuff that, you know, if you've been listening for a little bit,

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
you may have heard bits and pieces of my history,

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
but we never really sat down and put it all in one place either.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
So it's a good opportunity to do that.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
Well, now with that said, we do have ourselves a little bit of housekeeping

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
to get into this week.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
First of all, a huge announcement.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
I am elated to announce – this is my word today, elated.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
It's the second usage.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
I need a new one.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
I am – give me a new one, Wes.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
You don't want to burn words out.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
No, no.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
I don't want to say excited because I'm done using excited for the rest of the year.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Jumping for joy.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
I'm pretty lazy.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Pretty lazy.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
I haven't seen you jump in a while.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Damn it, Wes.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Oh, dang it.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
I am –

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Thrilled.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
Thank you.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Ecstatic.

22:55.000 --> 23:05.000
I am thrilled to announce that a cloud guru at Linux Academy are joining forces as one.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
This is a huge announcement.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
We'll have a link in the show notes to check it out.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
And I'm here to tell you this is going to be great for Linux content.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
This is a huge area of commitment for them going forward.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
As we record a frequently asked questions in the work, put it all together,

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
and they'll have that out like later in the week.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
We'll put that in the show notes too.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Yeah, we could do that.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
And also, if you just follow on social or check the blogs, a lot of information there.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Huge.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Huge.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
There's a lot more core stuff.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
That's just like massive, but right now, right now it's the holidays.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
So we don't have a lot to say.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
We're going to get through the holidays, and then we'll follow up.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
But we'll have links in the show notes for more information.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Massive.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
Talk about a massively growing area too.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
So much stuff going on there.

23:52.000 --> 23:59.000
Now, we have ourselves quite the guest on Brunch with Brent.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
Brent, this episode, this episode that you just did with Jason,

24:03.000 --> 24:07.000
inspired a whole other episode of this program that's coming up soon in the feeds.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
But Jason joined Brent.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
Now, Jason, I'm going to go for it, Brent.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
I'm going to go for it.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Uh-oh.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
You could do this.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Speziac.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Speziac.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Speziac.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Very good.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
I'm sorry, Jason.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
I'm sorry.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
There's a bell over there.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
You can ring for us.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Yeah, I got bells.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
I got bells for days.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
So Jason.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
You done it.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
Jason contacted us and just said, hey, just so you know, I'm watching.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
All right, listen.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
Probably doesn't watch, huh?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
And I really like the podcast.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
By the way, I do a little bit in the business, and I use Linux to record it.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
I'm like, oh yeah, what do you do?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Everything.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Everything.

24:43.000 --> 24:50.000
Jason is a well-established voice actor who's been involved in many cartoons that I cherish

24:50.000 --> 24:54.760
officially, and many other things, including great video games and Hollywood productions.

24:54.760 --> 24:58.300
And he does his work on Linux.

24:58.300 --> 25:01.960
So Brent sat down with a brunch with Jason, and it's so good.

25:01.960 --> 25:02.960
We're doing a two-parter.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.520
So part one is out now.

25:05.520 --> 25:11.160
I listened to it on my way in and was like, I had to pause it and write down an idea for

25:11.160 --> 25:12.160
the show just by listening.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.160
It's so great.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.160
It's so good.

25:14.160 --> 25:15.560
Because Jason's really been around for a long time.

25:15.560 --> 25:18.320
He's been a Linux advocate since the early days.

25:18.320 --> 25:22.640
And so there's some trips down nostalgia lane that really, really made me smile.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.680
And then part two is coming out later this week.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.280
It's a two-part brunch.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.120
You guys must have been really full by the end, Brent.

25:28.120 --> 25:31.640
Hey, you got to serve the good stuff for the good guests.

25:31.640 --> 25:33.760
So I pulled out all the stops.

25:33.760 --> 25:34.760
That must have been a thrill, huh?

25:34.760 --> 25:35.760
Yeah.

25:35.760 --> 25:38.320
You know, it was such a treat that he got in contact with us and just said, hey, how

25:38.320 --> 25:39.320
are you guys doing?

25:39.320 --> 25:40.320
I've been listening for a while.

25:40.320 --> 25:46.100
And our chat, I knew the moment he and I got connected on the phone to say hello initially

25:46.100 --> 25:48.760
that our chat was going to be really great.

25:48.760 --> 25:53.920
And it did not, it totally, brunch was well served, let's put it that way.

25:53.920 --> 25:54.920
Yes.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.040
That's why we're all going to get seconds, right?

25:56.040 --> 25:57.400
I will serve seconds to everyone.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.400
Yeah.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.080
Part two is going to be great too, but part one's out now.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.540
So totally worth checking out.

26:02.540 --> 26:07.160
He's hilarious as of course, many voices, but at the same time, just a lot of insight

26:07.160 --> 26:10.360
into the Linux desktop and community.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.120
And he's really put his heart into it.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.820
A deep thinker too.

26:13.820 --> 26:17.520
And you get a deep thinker with Brent together and it's magic.

26:17.520 --> 26:18.520
It's magic.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.520
Just take off the rest of the afternoon.

26:19.520 --> 26:20.520
You might as well.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.080
And you may have to pause it and take notes.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.360
So just prepare yourself for that.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.500
But you get that at extras.show.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.900
That's where the brunch with Brent's premiere extras.show.

26:27.900 --> 26:33.080
And that one in particks is extras.show slash lucky four zero.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.040
If you want to get that and listen to that.

26:35.040 --> 26:40.840
Now I also want to let you know that, uh, our daily Linux news podcast, Linux headlines

26:40.840 --> 26:46.060
every single weekday, three minutes or less, all the news that's happening in that day,

26:46.060 --> 26:48.040
it will be off throughout the holiday season.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.320
So you just said every single weekday.

26:50.320 --> 26:52.280
I know I did, didn't I?

26:52.280 --> 26:55.900
With an asterisk, but you just couldn't see it cause it's an audio podcast.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.840
So that's your bad, not mine.

26:57.840 --> 27:01.920
Uh, Monday, December 23rd through Friday, January 3rd, we are taking headlines off.

27:01.920 --> 27:05.800
I just wanted to let you know here because if you're not listening to headlines, then

27:05.800 --> 27:10.820
you've made a mistake in your life and I'm not going to point, I won't bring it up again,

27:10.820 --> 27:13.040
but now that we've talked about it, you probably should fix it.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.800
So Linux headlines, you got to get that.

27:14.800 --> 27:15.800
All right.

27:15.800 --> 27:16.800
Now we don't need to talk about this again.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.800
Okay.

27:17.800 --> 27:18.800
Done.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.800
It's good.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.120
I think we're all clear on this and just so you know, it's taking some time off and I

27:21.120 --> 27:23.340
forgive you for not listening.

27:23.340 --> 27:25.620
But now that we've talked about this, you're definitely gonna be listening cause it's,

27:25.620 --> 27:26.620
it's a great show.

27:26.620 --> 27:28.040
It's a great show.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.040
Anything else West?

27:29.040 --> 27:30.040
Now that I've shamed everybody.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.040
I don't know.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.040
That got weird.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
Yeah.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.040
We better just move on.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.040
I know.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.960
Linux headlines.show for that.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.160
And um, you know, it's the holiday season.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.160
You got to cut me some slack.

27:40.160 --> 27:43.280
That is our holiday housekeeping right there.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.280
It's really festive.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.280
Wes.

27:45.280 --> 27:46.280
I think I just got some marker on my shirt.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.280
Yeah.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.840
There should be lots of good holiday content to keep everyone pleased and we'll be hitting

27:49.840 --> 27:51.320
it hard in the new year.

27:51.320 --> 27:57.120
We will be off air live streamies, but we will be on air RSS feedies.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.440
So we will still be posting to the site, to the feeds.

27:59.440 --> 28:03.960
We'll still have content for you because I'm a manic that won't let anybody rest ever.

28:03.960 --> 28:04.960
We can't stop.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.960
No, it's I drink diet coke all day long.

28:07.960 --> 28:15.080
We're not sure, but we think if the podcast drops below 55 miles per hour, it'll blow

28:15.080 --> 28:16.800
up.

28:16.800 --> 28:17.800
Also subscribers.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.160
That is part of the equation.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.160
Thank you.

28:20.160 --> 28:25.160
Also, uh, thank you to everybody who came to the new live stream time.

28:25.160 --> 28:31.640
You know, uh, I was really kind of worked up about it because a bedrock aspect of this

28:31.640 --> 28:35.440
show is our virtual lug and our chat room.

28:35.440 --> 28:40.840
And so I fought tooth and nail for many years not to ever change the time, but there's just

28:40.840 --> 28:45.160
a lot of factors and including, and everyone on the team knows this now.

28:45.160 --> 28:46.160
It's so funny.

28:46.160 --> 28:50.200
You guys all know me so well now I am just sharper and more with it earlier in the day

28:50.200 --> 28:51.200
than I am in the afternoon.

28:51.200 --> 28:55.880
I'm an old man and by about two, three o'clock I'm not on my game anymore.

28:55.880 --> 28:56.880
Right.

28:56.880 --> 28:59.440
And we tried the nap live stream and it just didn't perform.

28:59.440 --> 29:04.400
So the new lifetimes worked out really well and I just really appreciate everyone who's

29:04.400 --> 29:06.240
come over to jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.920
We recognize you have to take time out and it means a lot when you show up.

29:08.920 --> 29:09.920
It does.

29:09.920 --> 29:14.080
Uh, and we can get that in your time zone at jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar.

29:14.080 --> 29:17.840
And of course there's the IRC room, which is also a huge part of this, that chat room.

29:17.840 --> 29:21.840
Wes and I are reading the entire time the show is going at just like Alex and cheese

29:21.840 --> 29:22.840
and everybody else's.

29:22.840 --> 29:26.680
We're watching that as we go and they're absolutely a fundamental part of the show.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.740
Our titles come from our chat room.

29:28.740 --> 29:35.360
So this is my last live show of 2019 and everything else after this will be prerecorded.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.020
So I just wanted to take this opportunity and say thank you so much because it really

29:38.020 --> 29:42.040
does make this show and I hope you can join us in 2020.

29:42.040 --> 29:49.080
Now with that said, let's transition into a little future casting for 2020 because Wes

29:49.080 --> 29:53.320
and I have been reading the tea leaves, watching the industry news, and we've seen a lot of

29:53.320 --> 29:59.240
hubbub development around the windows subsystem for Linux, especially since version two lands

29:59.240 --> 30:01.480
in early 2020.

30:01.480 --> 30:07.300
And with that, there is industry support forming, including Canonical has made a strategic hire.

30:07.300 --> 30:11.720
They've opened another position and they have declared that WSL is an official platform

30:11.720 --> 30:17.200
that they will support much like AWS, as well as a few other key industry players and a

30:17.200 --> 30:19.800
big event is all just around the corner.

30:19.800 --> 30:24.000
So this seemed like the perfect moment after a year and change to bring Hayden Barnes back

30:24.000 --> 30:29.440
on the show and see what's going on and what big changes have happened in his life.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.520
Well Hayden, welcome back to the program.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.200
Thank you for having me on Linux Unplugged again, this is great.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.960
So a lot of has changed since we chatted, but I think the last time we were on, it might

30:37.960 --> 30:42.480
have been with your chat with Joe talking about Penguin at the time, right?

30:42.480 --> 30:45.740
I think now it's actually called the, it's out, it's like WSL Linux.

30:45.740 --> 30:47.280
It's called WSL Linux now, right?

30:47.280 --> 30:50.080
Or do we swap it to Penguin?

30:50.080 --> 30:51.080
Fill me in.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.640
It was WLinux and then we became Penguin.

30:53.640 --> 30:54.760
Got you.

30:54.760 --> 30:59.640
You can tell I'm not a big Windows user, but I'm fascinated about the potential of WSL,

30:59.640 --> 31:02.040
especially version two.

31:02.040 --> 31:06.760
And I understand you've had a bit of a job change too since the last time we talked.

31:06.760 --> 31:07.760
I have.

31:07.760 --> 31:13.200
I've recently joined Canonical as the developer advocate for Ubuntu on WSL and Hyper-V.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.020
That's great.

31:15.020 --> 31:21.100
But to me it also seems to speak to a much larger commitment on Canonical's part to the

31:21.100 --> 31:23.080
Windows subsystem for Linux.

31:23.080 --> 31:25.680
That must have been a surprising conversation when that started.

31:25.680 --> 31:26.680
It was.

31:26.680 --> 31:32.840
Canonical is leveling up on WSL, devoting more resources to it, more advocacy, more

31:32.840 --> 31:37.600
engineering, certainly more than any other mainstream Linux distribution.

31:37.600 --> 31:44.080
Do you think it's the transition to WSL2 and the KVM backend that made it just such a clearly

31:44.080 --> 31:48.680
viable platform for them, or is it just simply the reach?

31:48.680 --> 31:50.240
What are your thoughts on that part of it?

31:50.240 --> 31:56.240
Well, it's the opportunity to engage new Linux users, and that's what WSL is.

31:56.240 --> 32:00.340
It's an onboarding experience into the Linux ecosystem.

32:00.340 --> 32:05.480
Not necessarily desktop Linux, although some of our users do go there, but to Linux on

32:05.480 --> 32:09.360
server, Linux on IoT, Linux on mobile.

32:09.360 --> 32:19.800
But seeing the commitment to WSL from Microsoft with WSL2, which is powered by Hyper-V, certainly

32:19.800 --> 32:24.480
I think helped Canonical make that decision that this is a platform they wanted to continue

32:24.480 --> 32:26.360
investing in and growing.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.360
That's great.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.260
I think it's pretty clever on Canonical's part.

32:30.260 --> 32:35.560
That's very insightful because there's a bit of a barrier to get over to look at this and

32:35.560 --> 32:37.560
say, this is something we could make an official platform.

32:37.560 --> 32:43.220
We could target it like we do AWS and really see an opportunity there.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.320
How has it been on the other end of that?

32:45.320 --> 32:50.120
Working with Microsoft on things that are maybe a little esoteric or affect only a single

32:50.120 --> 32:55.600
distribution or implementation of Linux on WSL, how receptive are they to this large

32:55.600 --> 32:56.600
company?

32:56.600 --> 32:59.840
WSL is just a small part of a much bigger product for them.

32:59.840 --> 33:05.120
Do you end up talking to a wall or have you seen reception to concerns and issues and

33:05.120 --> 33:07.280
fixes and things like that?

33:07.280 --> 33:12.080
Microsoft is incredibly receptive to everything that we've asked of them.

33:12.080 --> 33:19.000
Adding new features, supporting, helping us track down bugs, whether we were at Penguin

33:19.000 --> 33:24.520
or here at Ubuntu, the team on the WSL team have been amazing.

33:24.520 --> 33:29.800
I actually worked with several different teams at Microsoft on various projects and every

33:29.800 --> 33:35.240
single one of them has been incredibly positive, incredibly receptive to collaboration.

33:35.240 --> 33:39.120
Is people involved in WSL across teams in Microsoft, across multiple teams?

33:39.120 --> 33:45.760
Well, I don't just work with WSL, I also work on Hyper-V and we have some other friends

33:45.760 --> 33:48.600
at Microsoft and other areas we collaborate on.

33:48.600 --> 33:53.560
I've been part of those conversations as well and it's been great.

33:53.560 --> 33:59.660
There's a lot of opportunity for collaboration and there's some that people might be aware

33:59.660 --> 34:06.960
of like the Skype Snap in the Snap store, Azure Storage Explorer is there.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.680
We hope to bring teams there shortly.

34:09.680 --> 34:15.480
What people don't realize is that the default Linux images, GitHub actions are Ubuntu and

34:15.480 --> 34:20.720
that's something developed between Canonical and Microsoft.

34:20.720 --> 34:25.080
Really collaboration between Canonical and Microsoft is nothing new, this is just a new

34:25.080 --> 34:27.280
entry point and how that works.

34:27.280 --> 34:32.800
It seems to be somewhat of a growth of an ongoing thing that's benefited both companies.

34:32.800 --> 34:38.260
But the reason I was asking you about the specifics of that is just simply I've known

34:38.260 --> 34:43.200
Microsoft basically my entire life growing up here in the Redmond area and there are

34:43.200 --> 34:49.760
times when a company will launch the initiative and they will not properly staff it and they

34:49.760 --> 34:53.760
will not respond to requests and emails, they wouldn't cooperate with the community simply

34:53.760 --> 34:55.360
because they didn't have the time.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.640
Then there's other initiatives, which it sounds like these are among them, where they have

34:58.640 --> 35:03.240
properly staffed them and supported them and made them a priority within the company.

35:03.240 --> 35:06.480
I think that speaks pretty good to the future of that thing.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.480
I think it's pretty clever, like I said earlier, to expand that.

35:09.480 --> 35:12.640
That kind of leads me to the conference.

35:12.640 --> 35:17.920
There's an actual WSL conference in the works, what can you tell me about that?

35:17.920 --> 35:22.200
That's WSL Conf, it's scheduled March 10th and 11th.

35:22.200 --> 35:27.320
Our first conference will be at Redmond on the campus of Microsoft headquarters.

35:27.320 --> 35:33.320
That is a conference I began organizing for my position at Penguin and I brought it over

35:33.320 --> 35:35.120
with me to Canonical.

35:35.120 --> 35:42.040
It is sponsored by Canonical and hosted by Microsoft and we are gathering for two days

35:42.040 --> 35:48.080
and it is shaping up to be two days of just incredibly intense informational sessions

35:48.080 --> 35:55.480
and workshops on what everyone is doing on WSL, things you can accomplish on WSL, web

35:55.480 --> 36:01.920
development, IoT, InfoSec, Kubernetes, so much Kubernetes.

36:01.920 --> 36:02.920
Wow.

36:02.920 --> 36:03.920
Yeah.

36:03.920 --> 36:04.920
Good.

36:04.920 --> 36:08.160
Wes and I have registered and we have our press passes, so we'll be there.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.160
Yeah, looking forward to it.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.160
Yeah, absolutely.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.440
I am curious with your new position though, what's going on with Penguin?

36:13.440 --> 36:15.600
Is that still actively being developed?

36:15.600 --> 36:16.600
It is.

36:16.600 --> 36:23.920
The goal with Penguin and the startup around at Whitewater Foundry was to create an independent,

36:23.920 --> 36:30.080
sustainable, open source startup and I think we definitely met that goal.

36:30.080 --> 36:39.300
It had a revenue stream, it has now continued on through leadership change and it was profitable

36:39.300 --> 36:40.360
from day one.

36:40.360 --> 36:46.580
In terms of this ongoing discussion we've been having in open source about funding development

36:46.580 --> 36:54.560
and I think we've added something to that showing how stores can contribute to that

36:54.560 --> 36:57.280
and solve some of those issues.

36:57.280 --> 37:03.080
So it's continuing now, one of the team members, Carlos Ramirez, who's a former contributor

37:03.080 --> 37:06.600
to Wine, has taken over the leadership position.

37:06.600 --> 37:12.040
They've published a complete roadmap for 2020 and we had products in the pipeline when I

37:12.040 --> 37:17.840
made the leap and those have since launched, including Raft, which is the GUI management

37:17.840 --> 37:21.720
tool for WSL distros for Windows 10.

37:21.720 --> 37:22.720
Well that's really neat.

37:22.720 --> 37:26.800
It's nice to see that it's sustainable and that Penguin's going to stick around for a

37:26.800 --> 37:29.400
while and we can keep getting benefit out of that.

37:29.400 --> 37:32.880
And they're going to continue developing the Fedora Remix for WSL as well.

37:32.880 --> 37:38.840
They're going to be able to put more resources into that than we were able to under my leadership.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.320
So they're growing and expanding.

37:41.320 --> 37:49.720
So that switch to Canonical, we proved a point in that you could build this sustainable independent

37:49.720 --> 37:54.220
open source startup and that we met that goal.

37:54.220 --> 37:59.040
And then we also wanted WSL to be taken more seriously by the major players and we certainly

37:59.040 --> 38:00.400
met that goal.

38:00.400 --> 38:04.880
So I felt comfortable moving on from that position.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.960
We never needed a big buyout or anything because we never took any VC money.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.520
It was always funded by the users.

38:10.520 --> 38:15.240
But I can move now to Canonical and from this position I have more resources and a bigger

38:15.240 --> 38:20.320
platform to continue advocating for WSL and WSL users.

38:20.320 --> 38:26.560
And bring all of that experience to one of the world's largest operating systems.

38:26.560 --> 38:30.840
It's really a fantastic kind of move on, not just your part but their part too.

38:30.840 --> 38:35.840
So looking at your crystal ball since you have access and control to everything that

38:35.840 --> 38:38.040
will happen with WSL, no questions asked obviously.

38:38.040 --> 38:43.080
Where do you see things going in 2020 for this thing that a lot of us are still trying

38:43.080 --> 38:44.080
to wrap our heads around?

38:44.080 --> 38:51.960
Well, for most users, 2020 is when WSL 2 will launch, which is the WSL that's powered by

38:51.960 --> 38:54.280
Hyper-V components.

38:54.280 --> 38:59.040
It's not required like Hyper-V Manager is on Pro, it will work across all SKUs of Windows

38:59.040 --> 39:06.220
10, but it's there and it is powered by a Linux kernel.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.040
So you get performance improvements.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.560
This was a major architecture overhaul in V2.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.000
Yeah, you just do much cooler things.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.080
So 2020 is when that will launch for most users.

39:17.080 --> 39:21.720
It's available now in the fast and the slow ring for Windows 10.

39:21.720 --> 39:23.280
Of course, of course.

39:23.280 --> 39:26.840
But that will hopefully be launching in the spring.

39:26.840 --> 39:33.640
And then here at Ubuntu, we have some interesting ideas that we hope to implement in our distro

39:33.640 --> 39:36.120
in 2020.

39:36.120 --> 39:37.120
We're seeing on that.

39:37.120 --> 39:38.960
I love to hear that.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.200
Maybe maybe a peekaboo at WSL Conf.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.840
I mean, I'm just saying going to be in the area.

39:43.840 --> 39:44.840
We'll see.

39:44.840 --> 39:45.840
Yeah.

39:45.840 --> 39:46.840
Okay.

39:46.840 --> 39:47.840
Okay.

39:47.840 --> 39:51.040
Well, Hayden, I really appreciate your patience as I work through understanding this, because

39:51.040 --> 39:53.280
I'm very excited about the potential of it.

39:53.280 --> 39:58.520
And you are really good at explaining it to me and obviously have a great depth of knowledge

39:58.520 --> 39:59.520
with it.

39:59.520 --> 40:00.520
A passionate advocate.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.520
Thank you so much.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.520
Yeah.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
So do keep us in the loop as stuff develops too.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.760
And can't wait to shake hands at WSL Conf.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.200
Really looking forward to it.

40:07.200 --> 40:14.280
Thank you for coming and giving Penguin that initial boost by having us on Linux Unplugged

40:14.280 --> 40:19.400
and Jupyter broadcasting podcasts and for joining us as this journey continues.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.640
Hey, man, you bet.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.880
We recognize we know good work when we see it.

40:22.880 --> 40:23.880
Absolutely.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.880
We got an eye for quality.

40:26.880 --> 40:31.920
But also, you should know that Kali Linux is going to be there and Penguin is going

40:31.920 --> 40:32.920
to be there.

40:32.920 --> 40:35.080
So it's everyone is going to be there.

40:35.080 --> 40:38.800
The registration is going to probably fill up soon.

40:38.800 --> 40:43.000
We're working on a live stream option for people who can't make it to Redmond.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
That's great.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
If that does materialize, do let us know.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.040
We'll try to let people out there know about it.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.040
Sure.

40:49.040 --> 40:52.400
If you want to do the live stream, you can go ahead and register instead of registering

40:52.400 --> 40:55.480
general admission, register live stream online.

40:55.480 --> 40:56.960
Good to know.

40:56.960 --> 40:57.960
Good to know.

40:57.960 --> 40:59.720
Well, I have links to that in the show notes.

40:59.720 --> 41:01.300
Hayden, good to chat with you again.

41:01.300 --> 41:02.300
Thank you.

41:02.300 --> 41:03.300
Thank you so much.

41:03.300 --> 41:06.680
I'm excited about the conference because it's here in our backyard, first of all, so not

41:06.680 --> 41:07.680
much travel required.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.440
Yeah, really, we have to go.

41:09.440 --> 41:11.880
Well, I don't know about that.

41:11.880 --> 41:16.480
But it was really good to hear from Hayden and get a little update on where that's at.

41:16.480 --> 41:22.120
I got to be honest, when I'm chatting with him, my Windows 10, my Windows ignorance kind

41:22.120 --> 41:23.120
of starts to show.

41:23.120 --> 41:25.760
It's been a long time.

41:25.760 --> 41:27.400
Almost motivated enough to try it.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.440
But I gave it a go a while back and that was enough for me.

41:29.440 --> 41:33.760
I know it's difficult when you already have all the Linux you need and want right in front

41:33.760 --> 41:34.760
of you.

41:34.760 --> 41:39.160
But it is nice to see that it's getting easier and easier to have that even if you have to

41:39.160 --> 41:42.000
use or want to use Windows for other parts of your life.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I'd like to see you take a Windows challenge.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.080
Oh my gosh, I've done it once for Coder.

41:46.080 --> 41:49.400
So I have done it.

41:49.400 --> 41:54.080
I'm shocked that WSL 2 isn't out there for everybody yet because I feel like it was at

41:54.080 --> 41:56.200
the beginning of this year we tried it.

41:56.200 --> 41:59.560
So it's just not my cup of tea.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.080
I can appreciate people like it.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.080
It's just not my cup of tea.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.400
It's not for me.

42:03.400 --> 42:07.320
But the thing he said in that interview that jumped out at me and I noticed it jumped out

42:07.320 --> 42:13.560
at you too was when we asked him, what's Canonical's like motivation here?

42:13.560 --> 42:19.360
And he said, we want to get to the Linux users that are using WSL.

42:19.360 --> 42:22.120
They see it as a whole new generation of Linux users.

42:22.120 --> 42:24.480
Well, and that kind of reminded me of what we were talking about when we talked about

42:24.480 --> 42:26.480
this before from the Microsoft world, right?

42:26.480 --> 42:30.320
Where it's also sort of onboarding for Azure, which is running Linux.

42:30.320 --> 42:33.760
And so it's just when you have it at hand, when you can use it right there on your system,

42:33.760 --> 42:36.800
you can easily pivot and jump to other ecosystems.

42:36.800 --> 42:37.800
Huh.

42:37.800 --> 42:38.800
Huh.

42:38.800 --> 42:39.800
That's what I say.

42:39.800 --> 42:42.320
I think it's a good move.

42:42.320 --> 42:45.760
Well, I'll tell you what, the cafeteria at that venue looks awesome.

42:45.760 --> 42:49.440
You'll have to let me know how the food is.

42:49.440 --> 42:54.220
You know, if Microsoft's involved, the chances are that the cafeteria is pretty good.

42:54.220 --> 42:55.360
That's for sure.

42:55.360 --> 42:56.360
They know how to eat over there.

42:56.360 --> 43:00.080
I think it's a test of our sort of pragmatism sometimes as a community too, because it is

43:00.080 --> 43:01.080
weird.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.360
I mean, you mentioned even in the interview that we're still, you know, wrapping your

43:03.360 --> 43:08.280
head around what it is, but I think so far it's clear, like when you talk to Hayden and

43:08.280 --> 43:11.720
other people who use it and are involved, these are the same, these are the same folks

43:11.720 --> 43:12.720
who love Linux.

43:12.720 --> 43:14.480
There's just another platform.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.680
We're going to get into this more next week.

43:16.680 --> 43:21.240
But and Jason talks about this too and his brunch with Brent in a way that really made

43:21.240 --> 43:24.480
me recollect a little bit.

43:24.480 --> 43:28.040
It's just, I made a statement in this week's Linux Action News that is, it's really kind

43:28.040 --> 43:29.160
of stuck with a lot of people.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.880
I've gotten a lot of comments about it and I've thought about it a few times since I

43:31.880 --> 43:38.880
said it, but I had this really weird realization while we were recording that my desktop right

43:38.880 --> 43:42.800
now is better because of Microsoft.

43:42.800 --> 43:46.440
My Linux desktop is better because of Microsoft.

43:46.440 --> 43:48.800
I really like Visual Studio Code.

43:48.800 --> 43:49.800
It's nice.

43:49.800 --> 43:50.800
It's cute.

43:50.800 --> 43:51.800
It's cool, which I'm thrilled about.

43:51.800 --> 43:56.040
I mean, I like VS Code too.

43:56.040 --> 43:57.040
It's the holidays, Wes.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.040
I'm sorry.

43:58.040 --> 43:59.040
I know.

43:59.040 --> 44:00.040
Some things are sacred.

44:00.040 --> 44:03.480
I still SSH on the systems and you've aliased nano to vim.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.280
Oh, Wes, I love you.

44:05.280 --> 44:10.160
The only pleasure I get from it, from it all, is watching you struggle every time you sit

44:10.160 --> 44:14.600
down on a system that doesn't have vim and you type vim over and over and over.

44:14.600 --> 44:17.240
It's just what my brain reaches for when I need to change a file.

44:17.240 --> 44:22.360
The great thing is on systems where vim is installed, generally Vi is automatically aliased

44:22.360 --> 44:26.600
to vim, so you could have just taught yourself Vi all along and you'd be good to go on any

44:26.600 --> 44:27.600
system.

44:27.600 --> 44:28.600
I know.

44:28.600 --> 44:29.840
The fingers do what they want.

44:29.840 --> 44:30.920
And it never ends.

44:30.920 --> 44:31.920
It's great.

44:31.920 --> 44:39.480
So I get mine, but I really have no words for this whole thing, this whole phenomenon,

44:39.480 --> 44:45.160
this whole WSL on Windows and how the numbers are getting ridiculous.

44:45.160 --> 44:49.020
But I'm being told numbers by certain developers that seem impossible.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.280
So I don't know.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.280
I don't really.

44:52.280 --> 44:53.280
So I'm really curious.

44:53.280 --> 44:55.520
I mean, we know Windows is in all kinds of places, right?

44:55.520 --> 44:58.720
I've been even told that somebody has a million installs.

44:58.720 --> 44:59.720
Wow.

44:59.720 --> 45:01.760
I just don't know if I buy that.

45:01.760 --> 45:02.760
Seems impossible.

45:02.760 --> 45:06.160
But I'm sure you can see why Canonical would be interested in having a strong presence

45:06.160 --> 45:07.160
there.

45:07.160 --> 45:08.160
Yeah.

45:08.160 --> 45:09.160
I mean, the Windows base is huge.

45:09.160 --> 45:10.160
So it is a big market.

45:10.160 --> 45:15.720
But I think I believe WSL Conf will serve as sort of a catalyst for my brain.

45:15.720 --> 45:20.480
Like it'll all kind of crystallize in my brain when we go to WSL Conf.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.480
We shall see.

45:21.480 --> 45:22.480
That'll be coming up.

45:22.480 --> 45:25.320
We have a link to that in the show notes if you're in the area and you want to go.

45:25.320 --> 45:27.360
Or if you're in the area and just want to say hi to Wes and I.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.120
Yeah, we're always up for that.

45:29.120 --> 45:30.120
I mean, I don't know.

45:30.120 --> 45:32.360
It's not, you know, it's not out of the question.

45:32.360 --> 45:35.000
We might want to go out to lunch, say hi to a few people.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
We like snacks.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
Damn right we do.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
All right.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Let's get into some feedback.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.400
This is what we've been doing here at Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

45:42.400 --> 45:45.740
And we got some feedback in about our grub butter fs advice.

45:45.740 --> 45:49.980
And I will just say, while we're doing a little follow up feedback here, we just got done

45:49.980 --> 45:52.480
with the big old upgrade.

45:52.480 --> 45:53.480
Get ready for this.

45:53.480 --> 46:06.760
The other day, a new kernel, new wire guard, new ZFS on Linux and a new system D in one

46:06.760 --> 46:07.760
round of updates.

46:07.760 --> 46:09.480
Those are all the things that we use.

46:09.480 --> 46:13.640
That's basically I mean, if you add a Docker in there, then that would be the whole system.

46:13.640 --> 46:19.300
This was a massive first update in production for our new arch server and Wes Payne.

46:19.300 --> 46:24.300
How did it do?

46:24.300 --> 46:29.040
Fantastic.

46:29.040 --> 46:33.300
We've got a few little things, mostly ordering issues to iron out between some some containers

46:33.300 --> 46:35.240
that aren't quite starting right.

46:35.240 --> 46:36.240
But I mean, that's it.

46:36.240 --> 46:38.760
And that's just because it's a new system.

46:38.760 --> 46:39.760
So good.

46:39.760 --> 46:40.760
It was so good.

46:40.760 --> 46:44.680
And it did the snapshots as the package upgrades before and after were happening.

46:44.680 --> 46:46.720
So I'm very pleased with that.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.380
So two weeks in service still rocking.

46:49.380 --> 46:54.580
And we did our first major like upgrade all of the core system components that did break

46:54.580 --> 46:57.240
once or once or twice actually on fedora.

46:57.240 --> 47:00.160
Sometimes those what would happen is it would install the new kernel.

47:00.160 --> 47:03.520
But the DKMS modules would be for the running kernel at the time of the upgrade.

47:03.520 --> 47:07.120
It would reboot and you'd have to reinstall anything that used DKMS and then it would

47:07.120 --> 47:09.520
build against the running kernel.

47:09.520 --> 47:14.320
However, if you can't boot because it didn't build the modules, you got a chicken and an

47:14.320 --> 47:15.320
egg.

47:15.320 --> 47:16.320
That's what happened to us.

47:16.320 --> 47:17.520
Anyways, Nikolai writes in.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.480
Hello, Chris and Wes.

47:19.480 --> 47:27.600
I run on ButterFS and since Chris's ButterFS nightmare, which was years ago, when I lost

47:27.600 --> 47:31.800
the system to ButterFS, and then it was like right before the episode two, so I came on

47:31.800 --> 47:36.920
all guns blazing, just fired up and pissed off like half of the SUSE community.

47:36.920 --> 47:37.980
First Ubuntu, then Arch.

47:37.980 --> 47:45.280
My current Arch Linux desktop is from May of 2016 with two MVME drives in a RAID 0.

47:45.280 --> 47:50.560
I have my server on Arch and ButterFS since October of 2018 with RAID 1.

47:50.560 --> 47:53.880
I use RAID 1 for the system and RAID 10 for my data.

47:53.880 --> 47:57.320
I've had no issues with ButterFS.

47:57.320 --> 48:01.720
I want to mention that SUSE's grub is patched to boot the default sub volume, which will

48:01.720 --> 48:04.000
be your system after a snap or rollback.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.060
So that's good to know.

48:06.060 --> 48:10.360
After you ran snap or rollback and reboot, you should edit it in the grub menu.

48:10.360 --> 48:12.800
He's given us tutorials on how to use the snaps.

48:12.800 --> 48:13.800
Yeah.

48:13.800 --> 48:18.760
And you know, it's probably good advice as we as we've mentioned, we have not yet tested

48:18.760 --> 48:20.240
that little safety net.

48:20.240 --> 48:24.920
Because what he's saying here is if you don't do this right during a snap or rollback, you'll

48:24.920 --> 48:26.840
end up in a read only system.

48:26.840 --> 48:28.480
And so this is his solution to that.

48:28.480 --> 48:31.040
So if this happens to you, we'll have a link in the show notes for that.

48:31.040 --> 48:33.560
Yeah, we'll have to test a rollback here one of these weeks.

48:33.560 --> 48:35.880
You know what, fair enough.

48:35.880 --> 48:39.960
I brought this on myself when when we decided to use ButterFS.

48:39.960 --> 48:43.320
All the people that have been using ButterFS this entire time, they totally earned the

48:43.320 --> 48:44.800
told you so moment, didn't they?

48:44.800 --> 48:49.080
So you know what, I'll take your told you so's, go ahead, give them to me.

48:49.080 --> 48:50.080
I earned it.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.080
You're right.

48:51.080 --> 48:52.080
It's fine.

48:52.080 --> 48:53.560
As long as you use it right.

48:53.560 --> 48:54.760
Problem was, I was holding it wrong.

48:54.760 --> 48:55.960
I acknowledge it now.

48:55.960 --> 48:56.960
It's not your fault.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.640
It's not ButterFS's fault.

48:58.640 --> 49:01.080
It's my fault for holding ButterFS wrong.

49:01.080 --> 49:05.960
All right, Wes, do you want to read this second email that comes into the old show skis here?

49:05.960 --> 49:07.460
Oh, it's not an email.

49:07.460 --> 49:08.460
It's a feedback on Reddit.

49:08.460 --> 49:11.460
I haven't mentioned the subreddit in about 15 years.

49:11.460 --> 49:17.440
They're still out there from six from now Dooley Dooley writes in five days ago to the

49:17.440 --> 49:18.440
show.

49:18.440 --> 49:22.920
No, don't do this with CFS, NFS, Libver, D, Docker.

49:22.920 --> 49:27.280
You have way too many low level moving parts to juggle.

49:27.280 --> 49:30.840
March is going to be a constant nightmare.

49:30.840 --> 49:34.480
I stick with my original recommendation of Debian or CentOS.

49:34.480 --> 49:37.320
Hearing about the struggles with Fedora is no surprise.

49:37.320 --> 49:42.600
Oh, there's a whole new wing of I told you so's in the waiting.

49:42.600 --> 49:48.880
I won't lie, when I told Jim of TechSnap about it, he rolled his eyes.

49:48.880 --> 49:51.920
I mean, I couldn't see, but I could hear the eye roll over the microphone.

49:51.920 --> 49:56.720
I mean, I want to remind everyone, the premise here is we're doing this so you don't have

49:56.720 --> 49:57.720
to.

49:57.720 --> 50:00.340
We know this is not necessarily a good idea.

50:00.340 --> 50:01.720
We are testing a theory.

50:01.720 --> 50:06.760
If you take a belt and suspenders approach to arch and you build a simple system, is

50:06.760 --> 50:08.720
it maintainable over the long term?

50:08.720 --> 50:13.080
Now what I like about this is what Dooley is saying is you haven't built a simple system,

50:13.080 --> 50:14.080
right?

50:14.080 --> 50:15.080
That's his that's his core criticism.

50:15.080 --> 50:19.920
He's saying you're using look, guys, you got NFS, you got ZFS, you got Libver, D and you

50:19.920 --> 50:20.920
got Docker.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.440
It's too many moving parts.

50:22.440 --> 50:25.280
Well, do we have liberty?

50:25.280 --> 50:27.040
We did on the previous system.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.800
We didn't set up any VMs this time.

50:28.800 --> 50:29.800
We don't have any VMs.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.760
So we're only containers on this one.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.760
And then net data on the host.

50:33.760 --> 50:39.080
He missed Samba though, so you know, it kind of works out to be the same.

50:39.080 --> 50:40.760
And actually, we haven't set up NFS yet.

50:40.760 --> 50:44.920
Now that I think about it, we haven't really needed to because the rare occasions I just

50:44.920 --> 50:48.560
connect over Samba now, like a monster, which is fine.

50:48.560 --> 50:49.560
It works.

50:49.560 --> 50:50.560
Yeah, it's fine.

50:50.560 --> 50:52.800
I think I argue his premise.

50:52.800 --> 50:56.720
I think a Samba ZFS Docker base is not too much.

50:56.720 --> 51:00.640
Yeah, there's enough things that aren't, you know, exceptional, I guess WireGuard out of

51:00.640 --> 51:01.640
the tree.

51:01.640 --> 51:02.640
That'll be nice when it goes.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.120
WireGuard on that list, too, right?

51:04.120 --> 51:05.120
Yes.

51:05.120 --> 51:09.360
Okay, that ZFS, I feel like ZFS is the biggest outlier is additional complexity in the fact

51:09.360 --> 51:14.240
that it's, you know, it's kind of foreign as its own admin style and regime, right?

51:14.240 --> 51:18.360
But we're we both used it for a long time, and I think are willing to adopt that.

51:18.360 --> 51:20.320
I think it's funny.

51:20.320 --> 51:25.880
It's funny because of our perspectives, because you and I and the audience, we really know

51:25.880 --> 51:27.480
the source material.

51:27.480 --> 51:31.800
But if you're an enterprise user from the outside, they would laugh at us because ZFS

51:31.800 --> 51:35.140
is clearly more safe of a choice than ButterFS.

51:35.140 --> 51:38.920
And here we're arguing that it's the riskier choice, because we're talking about it from

51:38.920 --> 51:41.080
a kernel modules and update standpoint.

51:41.080 --> 51:43.700
And they're talking about it from a data integrity standpoint.

51:43.700 --> 51:48.200
And so it's not like we're talking about, you know, Larry's crazy open source project

51:48.200 --> 51:49.200
here.

51:49.200 --> 51:58.440
We're talking about Samba, Docker, ZFS, like production grade, impacts millions of people

51:58.440 --> 52:01.000
if they screw up kind of thing.

52:01.000 --> 52:05.780
So yes, it is a bit of a moving risk because there's a lot of pieces in there, but they're

52:05.780 --> 52:08.200
all kind of enterprise grade pieces.

52:08.200 --> 52:11.840
The other part to the thing we liked about Arch was was the simplicity in that we we

52:11.840 --> 52:13.820
know exactly what we've installed on the machines.

52:13.820 --> 52:18.200
We have a sense of exactly what we have to maintain and what's what isn't there to move.

52:18.200 --> 52:23.560
It's so simple that both you and I in our head can we have it memorized, how it's set

52:23.560 --> 52:27.420
up, how the partition scheme is laid out and what software is installed just off the top

52:27.420 --> 52:28.420
of our heads.

52:28.420 --> 52:31.340
And I particularly like how simple things like make package, you know, package builds

52:31.340 --> 52:36.300
are in the sense of like if if we have a problem like, you know, the AR AR package goes missing

52:36.300 --> 52:40.280
or isn't maintained anymore, those are all easy to build because they're laid right out

52:40.280 --> 52:41.280
there.

52:41.280 --> 52:43.640
We know how to use the tools that make up the distro.

52:43.640 --> 52:45.240
That's I think the key thing.

52:45.240 --> 52:49.020
And that's again, why I go back to we're doing this so you don't have to, because we're comfortable

52:49.020 --> 52:50.300
doing those kinds of things.

52:50.300 --> 52:53.460
We're comfortable booting into a separate operating system and then cherooting in here

52:53.460 --> 52:55.200
and recovering and repairing it.

52:55.200 --> 52:59.200
We're comfortable reloading kernel modules if they don't load properly after a boot,

52:59.200 --> 53:01.100
etc, etc.

53:01.100 --> 53:04.200
Most people don't want to fuss with that for good reason.

53:04.200 --> 53:08.400
We want to fuss with this stuff temporarily, at least for a while.

53:08.400 --> 53:13.440
So we can see if there are benefits, because what happened here was, is I said Fedora is

53:13.440 --> 53:14.920
not a good server OS.

53:14.920 --> 53:20.160
We can't use like like right here, like like Dooley says, I had no surprises hearing about

53:20.160 --> 53:21.720
the struggles with Fedora.

53:21.720 --> 53:24.600
No surprise to me.

53:24.600 --> 53:26.560
That's a stereotype right there.

53:26.560 --> 53:29.080
And I challenged it and we put Fedora on there.

53:29.080 --> 53:31.080
And it changed the game.

53:31.080 --> 53:34.940
That server went from an idle storage appliance to something that's fundamentally integrated

53:34.940 --> 53:36.880
into our day to day workflow.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.920
And it changes everything.

53:38.920 --> 53:44.280
And so with that, I learned that I had a incorrect stereotype.

53:44.280 --> 53:45.560
It was absolutely doable.

53:45.560 --> 53:47.400
You just had to take the right precautions.

53:47.400 --> 53:52.060
And I thought, well, what's the next big stereotype I have about how you run a Linux server?

53:52.060 --> 53:53.060
And it was Arch.

53:53.060 --> 53:54.120
It's not the distro.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.120
It's how you use it.

53:55.120 --> 53:58.460
Oh, my God, amazing.

53:58.460 --> 54:02.120
So anyways, Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

54:02.120 --> 54:04.600
Get your feedback in here, because I love having that.

54:04.600 --> 54:07.680
And it's just it's a great source of conversation, too.

54:07.680 --> 54:10.520
And even if we don't get it on the air, we always read it.

54:10.520 --> 54:11.520
We do read it.

54:11.520 --> 54:17.800
So Cheezy is going to wrap us up today with a command line utility that will finally allow

54:17.800 --> 54:20.240
you to uninstall your browser forever.

54:20.240 --> 54:21.240
Absolutely.

54:21.240 --> 54:24.720
But before that, I'd just like to say I think you're still both savages for using Arch on

54:24.720 --> 54:25.720
the server.

54:25.720 --> 54:26.960
I mean, I get it.

54:26.960 --> 54:28.640
I'm glad that you're doing it.

54:28.640 --> 54:30.760
Like you said, you're doing it so that I don't have to.

54:30.760 --> 54:33.520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

54:33.520 --> 54:38.840
So look, you know, the thing about Arch is it's just taking Linux to its ultimate conclusion,

54:38.840 --> 54:39.840
isn't it?

54:39.840 --> 54:40.960
It's like the end game.

54:40.960 --> 54:41.960
That's the Linux singularity.

54:41.960 --> 54:42.960
What do you mean?

54:42.960 --> 54:45.560
Well, you have full control over everything.

54:45.560 --> 54:48.280
You know, if something doesn't work, it's your fault.

54:48.280 --> 54:53.920
You know, with Apple, with a normal distribution, you're almost subscribing to like the Apple

54:53.920 --> 54:58.760
style approach of letting other people make those decisions for you.

54:58.760 --> 55:02.120
But with Arch, if something breaks, it's on you and it's your fault.

55:02.120 --> 55:04.320
And I kind of like that about it.

55:04.320 --> 55:07.400
There's also and I have a hard time articulating this, so I have not said it on air.

55:07.400 --> 55:12.040
But I've tried to say it to Wes, and he knows what I mean because he's experienced it.

55:12.040 --> 55:16.440
But there is something to the fact that if you're starting from zero, it's often easier

55:16.440 --> 55:19.400
to get going than when you're starting from 80 percent done.

55:19.400 --> 55:20.400
Right.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.600
Well, you don't have to discover when you go on some systems, some distro, you're like,

55:22.600 --> 55:24.320
OK, well, I know I need this piece.

55:24.320 --> 55:26.920
How have they configured it and you configure it?

55:26.920 --> 55:28.560
It's not configured.

55:28.560 --> 55:30.000
And you're like, well, where does that matter?

55:30.000 --> 55:34.400
Well, recently on my workstation, I needed to set up containers and I needed to set up

55:34.400 --> 55:35.920
virtualization.

55:35.920 --> 55:37.740
The Arch Wiki is so damn good.

55:37.740 --> 55:41.520
And when you're just when you're starting with nothing, it's just a few commands these

55:41.520 --> 55:44.040
days to get any of this stuff working.

55:44.040 --> 55:48.400
And you don't have to wonder, like, how do I get it working in this scenario or in this

55:48.400 --> 55:49.400
configuration?

55:49.400 --> 55:50.400
It's not working.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.520
So you just turn it on and you set it up.

55:52.520 --> 55:56.600
And it's genuinely simple almost every single time.

55:56.600 --> 56:02.320
And I can't I can't give that like a name or a phrase or I can't put it in like a catchy

56:02.320 --> 56:03.320
way.

56:03.320 --> 56:07.640
But it actually makes setting up complicated services like virtualization and containers

56:07.640 --> 56:12.200
and ZFS and all of that stuff simpler.

56:12.200 --> 56:13.840
Because you're just starting from a point of zero.

56:13.840 --> 56:15.800
And I know that seems weird.

56:15.800 --> 56:20.480
And I know that if you're if you're new to Linux or you only use GUI tools, that sounds

56:20.480 --> 56:23.100
like some sort of heebie-jeebie command line nonsense.

56:23.100 --> 56:27.080
But I swear to I swear to I swear to the command line simpler.

56:27.080 --> 56:31.920
And because you always have the latest version of whatever it is, whenever you're looking

56:31.920 --> 56:37.400
at some cool guide or some Reddit post or something else that got you excited about

56:37.400 --> 56:39.280
doing whatever it is you're doing.

56:39.280 --> 56:42.280
You don't have to go and compile anything because it's already in the repo.

56:42.280 --> 56:43.280
I will give you that.

56:43.280 --> 56:47.360
And I will say that I think that ZFS is the silver lining in this.

56:47.360 --> 56:51.140
As long as you don't destroy the pool, I think everything will be perfectly fine.

56:51.140 --> 56:54.560
So it did build the modules correctly before it rebooted.

56:54.560 --> 56:57.240
We had the modules ready to go and we rebooted them right there.

56:57.240 --> 56:58.240
Exactly.

56:58.240 --> 56:59.240
All right.

56:59.240 --> 57:04.720
So let's ramp up to a pick that I set up as a really with a completely ridiculous premise

57:04.720 --> 57:05.720
to begin with.

57:05.720 --> 57:06.720
Yeah.

57:06.720 --> 57:12.040
So if you don't need a browser anymore, obviously you still need Wikipedia and maybe on your

57:12.040 --> 57:14.320
pocket chip computer, you got a terminal.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.080
Hey, I like it.

57:16.080 --> 57:19.660
So this week's pick is Wicket.

57:19.660 --> 57:23.280
It's written in Node.js and needs to be installed via NPM.

57:23.280 --> 57:27.460
But it's a cool little command line tool.

57:27.460 --> 57:32.920
If you just need to get a summary of a Wikipedia entry, it's super quick.

57:32.920 --> 57:37.760
Wicket and then Linux or Wicket and Arch or Wicket and ZFS, whatever you're looking

57:37.760 --> 57:40.360
for, you'll be able to pull that out really quick.

57:40.360 --> 57:44.320
So for me, I'm an avid user of Wikipedia.

57:44.320 --> 57:46.360
I love Wikipedia.

57:46.360 --> 57:51.440
That being said, since it is the holiday season, you should consider if you've used Wikipedia

57:51.440 --> 57:55.800
over the last year, maybe throw in a couple of bucks.

57:55.800 --> 58:00.320
I think right now they're the average donation of like $2.75 will go a long way.

58:00.320 --> 58:03.620
So check that out and donate if you can.

58:03.620 --> 58:09.160
But Wicket is a great little command line tool that I suggest everyone pick up if they

58:09.160 --> 58:11.240
are avid Wikipedia readers.

58:11.240 --> 58:13.280
I mean, I just kind of like that.

58:13.280 --> 58:17.140
I might not use it all the time, but it depends on your context when you can keep those context

58:17.140 --> 58:18.140
switches down.

58:18.140 --> 58:20.440
If it means I can just stay in the terminal, look up something real quick and get back

58:20.440 --> 58:21.440
to what I was working on.

58:21.440 --> 58:22.440
That's great.

58:22.440 --> 58:28.080
So anytime you can do something in a drop down Quake style terminal, you gain a couple

58:28.080 --> 58:29.080
of cool points.

58:29.080 --> 58:30.080
Oh yeah, instant nerd cred.

58:30.080 --> 58:31.080
Just Wicket.

58:31.080 --> 58:32.080
Wicket real good.

58:32.080 --> 58:33.080
Just Wicket.

58:33.080 --> 58:34.080
Good pick, Cheesy.

58:34.080 --> 58:35.080
Thank you.

58:35.080 --> 58:36.080
That's pretty neat.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.080
All right.

58:37.080 --> 58:40.760
Well, I think that brings us to the end of this week's Unplugged program.

58:40.760 --> 58:44.480
I say go get some more Wes Payne and Jim Salter.

58:44.480 --> 58:49.400
Jim also writes for Ars Technica, so he's got a bunch of great posts over there.

58:49.400 --> 58:54.600
I think Jim has a nice level-headed take on the recent Librem 5 developments, and he finally

58:54.600 --> 58:56.720
gave the Eero Wi-Fi system a go.

58:56.720 --> 58:57.720
I know, wasn't that great?

58:57.720 --> 58:58.720
He likes it.

58:58.720 --> 59:01.200
It was satisfying to hear because I've been waiting for him to review the Eero Wi-Fi because

59:01.200 --> 59:08.100
it's such a weird product because of that cloud dependency, but yet such a solid freaking

59:08.100 --> 59:09.160
Wi-Fi network.

59:09.160 --> 59:10.160
It's so frustrating.

59:10.160 --> 59:11.160
You can't argue with performance.

59:11.160 --> 59:12.160
You can't.

59:12.160 --> 59:14.440
So go get more of that at TechSnap.Systems.

59:14.440 --> 59:19.800
And of course, you've got to get some brunch, extras.show.40.

59:19.800 --> 59:21.400
Go listen to part one.

59:21.400 --> 59:23.080
It got my wheels turning.

59:23.080 --> 59:26.100
And if you've been around for a little while, it'll get you really nostalgic.

59:26.100 --> 59:32.000
And if you've missed the early days of Linux, it'll fill you in on some really great edge

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
pieces of history.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.940
So check that out at extras.show.40.

59:35.940 --> 59:41.280
And last but not least, go check out my spotlight with Rocco, his YouTube channel, Big Daddy

59:41.280 --> 59:44.760
Linux coming out on Wednesday right after the show goes live.

59:44.760 --> 59:47.600
Thanks so much for joining us on this here Unplugged program.

59:47.600 --> 59:48.920
We won't be live next Tuesday.

59:48.920 --> 59:50.680
We'll have an episode for you.

59:50.680 --> 59:53.920
So have a great holiday and we'll see you live back here January.

59:53.920 --> 59:54.920
Sounds like a beagle.

59:54.920 --> 59:55.920
Are you sick?

59:55.920 --> 01:00:24.920
Wounded?

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:44.160
The Drifter in the chatroom massive will review last year's predictions.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.760
You bet.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.200
We've got new predictions in the can.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.200
We've got a review.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.200
I hope I do better this year.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.400
Yeah, that will be coming out over the holiday season.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:58.640
And there's like, I know there's a couple of wins in there, but I was just reviewing

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.840
them and there's also some embarrassing calls.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.040
You had a really bold one.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.040
I don't know if you remember.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.040
I do.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.040
Yeah.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.040
Yeah.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.040
So that's coming up.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.040
Yeah, that'll be in a very future episode.

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.440
You got to go big and then eventually you go home anyway.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440
Yeah.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.440
Yeah.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.440
You went big.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.160
Also, there's one where you got like unusually, you and I both did this once where we got

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:21.240
like really hyper specific, which I don't know why we did that.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:26.200
I thought the judge sort of required that he was a little bit of a judge with a strong

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.200
ruling hammer.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.200
Which is good.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.200
We want that in the judge.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.200
Bang, bang, bang.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:51.600
Oh, Joe.
