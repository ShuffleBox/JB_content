WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.760
I don't think any of us had this in our predictions,

00:01.760 --> 00:03.060
and that was just last week,

00:03.060 --> 00:05.880
but Canonical has a job posting up on their careers page

00:05.880 --> 00:09.680
for a quote, Linux desktop gaming product manager.

00:09.680 --> 00:10.720
And the description reads,

00:10.720 --> 00:12.060
we're excited to create the role

00:12.060 --> 00:13.760
of desktop gaming product manager

00:13.760 --> 00:18.080
to make Ubuntu the best Linux desktop for gaming.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.480
We will work with partners in the Silicon world

00:20.480 --> 00:22.520
to ensure the latest graphic drivers and tweaks

00:22.520 --> 00:25.540
are built in for optimal frame rates and latency,

00:25.540 --> 00:27.420
as well as with partners in the gaming industry

00:27.420 --> 00:31.000
to ensure that mechanisms such as anti-cheat capabilities

00:31.000 --> 00:34.560
are available to ensure fairness and product availability.

00:34.560 --> 00:35.840
Where is this coming from, first of all?

00:35.840 --> 00:37.740
And second of all, what strikes me about this

00:37.740 --> 00:38.580
is I was just thinking,

00:38.580 --> 00:40.120
we're getting awfully close to the deck

00:40.120 --> 00:44.400
and no major game has announced anti-cheat compatibility.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.560
Does this feel like a response

00:45.560 --> 00:47.200
to the deck being arch, you think?

00:47.200 --> 00:48.760
Oh, I don't know.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.440
Response seems like maybe a lot.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.740
You know, you'd think there'd have to be a little more

00:51.740 --> 00:53.840
going on behind the scenes than just that,

00:53.840 --> 00:55.960
but it certainly feels like maybe it's pulling into

00:55.960 --> 00:57.920
more of these machinations we don't quite see

00:57.920 --> 00:59.480
behind the various curtains.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.080
It is weird the way this job post is written.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.600
Like, you know, half of it's talking about

01:04.600 --> 01:05.880
some of those like this graphic stuff

01:05.880 --> 01:06.960
and software development,

01:06.960 --> 01:10.120
but then there's also a lot of the phrase go-to markets.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.120
How do you find someone who's software development

01:12.120 --> 01:14.160
experience, really interested in open source of that,

01:14.160 --> 01:15.760
and then also has an MBA?

01:15.760 --> 01:16.960
I guess that's what you need.

01:16.960 --> 01:29.240
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.680
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.040
And my name is Brent. Hello, gentlemen.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.960
Welcome to our first Sunday episode.

01:34.960 --> 01:35.960
We're here together.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.600
It's nice to see your smiling faces.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.440
Coming up on the show today, we've been waiting all summer.

01:41.440 --> 01:44.760
It's a new year and it's time for a new server

01:44.760 --> 01:47.840
with some essential help from our community.

01:47.840 --> 01:50.600
We are starting off on a major migration.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.640
We're going to tell you more about it.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.920
You know some of it.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.360
We're going to tell you the complete picture in this episode.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.200
We've got two servers, new networking,

01:58.200 --> 01:59.960
a totally new balls to the walls,

01:59.960 --> 02:02.480
don't do as we do kind of setup.

02:02.480 --> 02:07.120
So you're joining us today mid-gallop into a migration,

02:07.120 --> 02:09.440
and we'll give you our first major progress report.

02:09.440 --> 02:12.240
Then we'll round out the show with the emails and the pics.

02:12.240 --> 02:16.440
You know, we've gone through and done our pre-show discussion

02:16.440 --> 02:18.200
on what would be the right pic.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.920
I think I have one that's going to be good for the timing.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.240
So I'm vouching for this week's pic.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.200
Oh, wow. Okay.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.560
I mean, the first pic of a new year is serious business.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.480
Yeah. Yeah.

02:25.480 --> 02:26.680
So before we go any further,

02:26.680 --> 02:28.400
we've got to do the business of the show.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.840
We've got to say hello to our virtual lug.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.760
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

02:31.760 --> 02:32.800
Hello, hello.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.640
Hello.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.480
Good evening.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.680
Hello.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.800
Namaskaram.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.640
Sunday.

02:37.640 --> 02:38.480
Hello.

02:38.480 --> 02:39.800
Welcome to the Sunday episode.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.040
We're trying out the old jitzy today.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.880
Should be interesting to see how that goes.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.280
Nice to see some of their faces.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.120
They're like real people.

02:46.120 --> 02:46.960
It is, wow.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.760
And I mean, they did not bat an eye

02:48.760 --> 02:50.360
at following us right over here.

02:50.360 --> 02:51.520
Yeah, well, it helped that we kept dropping

02:51.520 --> 02:52.520
our connection to Mumble.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.280
That didn't change it.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.640
As you probably guessed, I'm out of the woods.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.480
Made it out of the woods.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.720
Yeah, you didn't die.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.160
Yeah. A nicey death. Good work.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.640
So if you didn't catch last week's episode,

03:00.640 --> 03:01.880
I got stranded out in the woods

03:01.880 --> 03:03.560
after the Pacific Northwest got slammed

03:03.560 --> 03:05.880
with an unusually cold winter storm

03:05.880 --> 03:08.400
and didn't have enough fuel, didn't have enough propane,

03:08.400 --> 03:10.480
didn't have enough water, tanks were full.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.920
I was freezing my, you know what's off.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.000
And our ideal scenario is we were gonna get out of there

03:15.000 --> 03:17.200
after last week's show on Tuesday.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.600
We didn't make it out till Thursday.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.600
Ooh.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.440
Yeah.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.440
Now, the nice thing was is the longer we stayed out

03:22.440 --> 03:24.720
in the woods, the more we kind of learned to live out there.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.160
Still real hard on the rig.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.160
And there has been damage to our water system.

03:28.160 --> 03:33.000
But what happened is a bunch of ice formed

03:33.000 --> 03:35.400
on top of our slides, like thick ice,

03:35.400 --> 03:36.960
much thicker than I realized.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.800
And it must've been a combination of just melt

03:38.800 --> 03:41.400
and then refreezing that just made this thing huge over time.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.760
And so it was hours per slide to get that ice out.

03:43.760 --> 03:44.960
Wow.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.080
Took forever.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.240
Of course, I tried to not do it and just saw it,

03:48.240 --> 03:49.760
see, well, maybe it'll break when it comes in.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.480
No, no, you could drive a car on this ice.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.040
So it was like that thick.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.880
So we had to like chip each slide.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.960
It took hours and you know, it's 20 degrees,

03:56.960 --> 03:58.560
15 degrees outside.

03:58.560 --> 04:01.160
There's only so many, and it's right at winter solstice too.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.480
So there's only so many hours of daylight.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.400
You've got a few hours of daylight

04:03.400 --> 04:04.480
to do the work out there.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.000
You can only be out in the cold for so long.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.160
We're making no solar, right?

04:08.160 --> 04:10.040
It was just worst case scenario.

04:10.040 --> 04:13.280
And so we didn't actually make it out till Thursday.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.960
And then that evening, another huge snowstorm came in.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.920
If we hadn't made it out that day,

04:18.920 --> 04:21.320
we would have been trapped again that evening.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.000
It was like down to the wire.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.240
Yeah, you probably would have just gotten out now.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.440
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.480
Cause it's just now gone,

04:27.480 --> 04:28.600
for the first time since Christmas,

04:28.600 --> 04:29.480
it's gone above freezing.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.560
So yeah.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.680
But then, you know, fast forward,

04:33.680 --> 04:35.360
like we're here at the studio Saturday,

04:35.360 --> 04:38.520
last night, day after New Year's,

04:38.520 --> 04:40.040
even though Wes has friends in town,

04:40.040 --> 04:41.880
he still came, spent the day up here,

04:41.880 --> 04:42.800
brought Brent up.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.760
Brent's in from town.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.440
Wait, Brent's in from out of town.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.280
Nice to have Brent here.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.120
Out of country.

04:49.120 --> 04:49.960
Right, right.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.160
And you had quite the experience.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.000
I had a saga.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.320
I think it's a podcast length story in itself

04:56.320 --> 04:57.640
that I won't go into details,

04:57.640 --> 05:00.280
but it took me, let's say two days to get here.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.280
Yeah, you had to end up crossing the border

05:02.280 --> 05:03.280
a total of five times.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.080
Yeah, yeah, I did.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.800
Customs got to know me really well.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.840
And that's not usually a good thing.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.880
Also, you learned almost the hard way

05:11.880 --> 05:13.960
that if you buy something in the duty-free store

05:13.960 --> 05:15.920
and then bring it back into your own country,

05:15.920 --> 05:18.080
there's like a 200% fee for that.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.400
Yeah, it turns out they don't tell you that

05:19.400 --> 05:20.520
when you buy these things.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.720
I guess it's an edge case.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.320
Yeah, so just be aware of that, listener.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.560
Brent'll save you some money there.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.360
So before we get into our service stuff today,

05:28.360 --> 05:31.720
I just wanna mention that we do have a meetup

05:31.720 --> 05:34.000
on the 30th planned at the studio here

05:34.000 --> 05:36.680
in the Seattle area, it's up in the town of Arlington.

05:36.680 --> 05:40.160
So it's about 45, 50 minutes North of Seattle.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.440
And we're gonna do phase two of the server launch.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.000
We're gonna have a get together potluck here,

05:46.000 --> 05:48.560
just have a good old time, do a live lup

05:48.560 --> 05:50.960
and hang out at the JB studio,

05:50.960 --> 05:53.000
assuming that it's safe to do so.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.640
You know, we just will watch all that,

05:55.640 --> 05:58.000
but so we'll have more information on that soon.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.200
But if you're in the Pacific Northwest area,

06:00.200 --> 06:02.920
start making your plans for that.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.480
But all right, let's talk about server stuff

06:05.480 --> 06:07.320
because you guys know that if you've been listening

06:07.320 --> 06:08.320
to the show for a while,

06:08.320 --> 06:12.600
we have this really super reliable, super micro box

06:12.600 --> 06:14.480
that has been around forever.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.600
We bought it used.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.400
It's really done good work for us, right?

06:17.400 --> 06:18.280
I mean- Sure has.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.560
In the bedrock of the studio for a few years now.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.960
And it's lived through some real hot summers

06:22.960 --> 06:25.600
because it's a garage that has an exposed roof

06:25.600 --> 06:28.120
and it's also where the afternoon sun is.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.000
So it gets really hot in there, even for the Seattle area.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.480
You know, it could be over a hundred and something degrees

06:32.480 --> 06:33.520
in there in the summer.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.960
Survived multiple OS transitions, many Arch updates.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.840
Yeah, it started life as a FreeNAS box,

06:39.840 --> 06:41.600
then it became a Fedora box,

06:41.600 --> 06:43.720
and then it became an Arch box.

06:43.720 --> 06:47.800
And there are legacy artifacts of that

06:47.800 --> 06:50.520
going all the way back to the FreeNAS installation.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.600
It's pretty funny.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.320
And Alan Jude set up our original ZFS setup on FreeNAS.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.480
And so that has been carried forward

06:58.480 --> 07:00.320
through all those installs as well,

07:00.320 --> 07:02.240
which is something we're gonna kind of finally modernize

07:02.240 --> 07:04.560
and update on, which we'll get into that in a little bit.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.440
But I mean, it really has served us well.

07:06.440 --> 07:09.400
It's loud, it takes a ton of power,

07:09.400 --> 07:11.280
and it's been through a lot of seasons.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.320
And this last summer,

07:12.320 --> 07:14.800
it started hard locking on us a few times.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.120
Probably the most fatal one

07:16.120 --> 07:18.960
was during the final few weeks of the road trip

07:18.960 --> 07:22.960
when we were all AFK and it went down

07:22.960 --> 07:25.080
and I had like some backup infrastructure on Linode

07:25.080 --> 07:26.560
because we knew it was sketch.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.400
And that was the only thing

07:27.400 --> 07:30.200
that kind of saved the day on that.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.280
So we realized goal number one

07:33.280 --> 07:36.840
when we go for a new server is stability.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.760
We gotta make sure this thing's not locking up on us.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.480
We wanna have remote management.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.680
We wanna be able to figure out what's happening

07:42.680 --> 07:44.960
even when we're not in the studio.

07:44.960 --> 07:45.800
And along with that,

07:45.800 --> 07:48.360
we wanna build like a cooling box for it in the spring

07:48.360 --> 07:49.800
and all that kind of stuff.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.920
That was like, and probably, obviously,

07:51.920 --> 07:54.720
something that's just will last us a few more years too.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.960
It's not just reliability,

07:55.960 --> 07:57.560
it's also sustainability for a few more years.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.440
Yeah, right, we're kind of getting some work in now

08:00.440 --> 08:03.440
to forestall having to do this again sometime soon.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.640
Yeah, I love getting four or five years

08:05.640 --> 08:07.600
out of something like this if we can't even longer,

08:07.600 --> 08:10.200
which we definitely did with this last box.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.560
So that's like 50% of our goals right there.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.280
The other 50% of our goal

08:14.280 --> 08:17.640
is to increase the available storage that we have.

08:17.640 --> 08:21.240
We archive FLAC versions of our show productions on there.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.240
We archive special projects on there.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.400
Anytime we go to a community event,

08:25.400 --> 08:27.680
if we record audio or we film it,

08:27.680 --> 08:30.000
we archive all the source material on there.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.600
There's also a media collection

08:31.600 --> 08:34.960
for people in the studio that's on there.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.200
I have some family stuff on there,

08:36.200 --> 08:37.640
like videos and things like that.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.640
There's a ton of our archives

08:39.640 --> 08:42.280
from the object storage up in Linode.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.360
You guys, we've talked about this before,

08:43.360 --> 08:45.320
but just as a recap,

08:45.320 --> 08:48.080
we run Nextcloud up on Linode.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.280
Object storage is the backend.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.960
And then to prevent excessive growth,

08:50.960 --> 08:53.480
we just carve off every few months some of that

08:53.480 --> 08:57.200
and we throw it on the physical server here in the studio

08:57.200 --> 08:58.920
that has this.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.960
And that way we keep what's in object storage

09:00.960 --> 09:03.000
to like three or four months.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.720
And then anything older than that lives in an archive storage

09:05.720 --> 09:07.960
kind of like a cold storage here at the studio.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.440
Then we run Nextcloud on each of them

09:09.440 --> 09:11.800
and it helps us manage that and it's really nice.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.560
And so we need to be able to grow that as well.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.720
So right now the current system has two terabytes free.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.120
It's running Arch.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.560
We haven't updated it since the last time

09:19.560 --> 09:20.880
we updated it on the show.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.040
That's been a few months.

09:22.040 --> 09:26.840
It's like, it's definitely due for some updates.

09:26.840 --> 09:27.680
Yeah, I think so.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.120
Let's just see here.

09:29.120 --> 09:29.960
How many?

09:29.960 --> 09:32.120
You think, you know,

09:32.120 --> 09:33.600
it'd be really dumb to do one more update

09:33.600 --> 09:35.440
just because we're in the middle of a migration.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.720
Yeah, no, we don't need to update it.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.440
But boy, I tell you what, there was a second there.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.280
I'm like, let's do it.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.320
Let's kick off the millionaire.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.240
Let's update this sucker.

09:41.240 --> 09:44.280
But no, no, this is not that time.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.760
So we wanted to move over to something

09:45.760 --> 09:47.320
that gave us additional capacity,

09:47.320 --> 09:49.320
some runway for storage.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.760
Ideally, although this is a long shot,

09:52.760 --> 09:55.000
ideally something that gets us through the rest of the year

09:55.000 --> 09:59.160
because buying high capacity SAS hard drives right now

09:59.160 --> 10:03.320
is like buying them made out of gold or Bitcoin even.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.680
It's ridiculous.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.000
We were looking at prices last night

10:06.000 --> 10:08.760
for even just, you know, maybe two terabytes.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.520
Some of the drives are going for nearly $800 right now.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.760
It's just not happening.

10:12.760 --> 10:13.600
Too much.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.360
So we wanted to try to get as much storage runway

10:16.360 --> 10:19.440
as possible with this migration.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.720
And did you get the updates there, the number there?

10:21.720 --> 10:22.640
Oh, yeah.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.360
Oh, you know, hey, net upgrade size only 24 megs,

10:25.360 --> 10:28.800
but 229 packages, three gigs of updates.

10:28.800 --> 10:32.240
Three gigs of updates and a 24 megabyte net size.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.520
That just makes me smile.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.120
You know, that's just so damn impressive.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.040
We'll miss you, Arch.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.000
Mm-hmm.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.760
So it really was a matter of getting new hardware,

10:42.760 --> 10:46.320
trying to get the right price to performance ratio,

10:46.320 --> 10:47.840
and then finding time to set it up

10:47.840 --> 10:49.280
and finding a new physical spot to put it

10:49.280 --> 10:50.800
that we could build a box around later.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.440
You know, as with a lot of these things,

10:52.440 --> 10:55.120
it's an exercise in engineering compromises, right?

10:55.120 --> 10:58.160
Like, we have the resources we have entirely, you know,

10:58.160 --> 11:00.400
thanks to the amazing community that we have.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.680
And we're trying to figure out, like,

11:01.680 --> 11:03.720
for our particular needs, which, you know,

11:03.720 --> 11:05.400
it's kind of an odd combination of things.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.000
And it's not necessarily,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.480
it's not the thing hosting the shows.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.440
It's not the stuff, you know, if something happens

11:10.440 --> 11:12.480
or we need to do some work on it, that's okay.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.160
But it is still, you know, important to the studio.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.840
Yeah, it's not in the pipeline of production,

11:17.840 --> 11:20.400
but it's in the support area of, like, infrastructure,

11:20.400 --> 11:21.920
which is, like, a second tier of infrastructure.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.120
So it works kind of good for this sort of thing.

11:24.120 --> 11:25.560
It's definitely, and it's something

11:25.560 --> 11:26.520
we definitely have in production,

11:26.520 --> 11:29.480
so if it breaks it, you know, we feel it.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.320
When I was looking at buying something, you know,

11:31.320 --> 11:34.480
I was looking at, like, a $1,000, $2,000 rig, you know.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.480
I was, you know, looking at something budget-friendly

11:36.480 --> 11:37.520
because I knew I was gonna have to put

11:37.520 --> 11:39.840
a bunch of money into storage.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.080
But, like Wes said, like,

11:41.080 --> 11:43.080
we have a f****** amazing community.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.040
It's, like, you can't put it down as an asset

11:46.040 --> 11:48.560
on a balance sheet, but it has gotta be

11:48.560 --> 11:50.440
one of the strongest assets of this company

11:50.440 --> 11:54.960
because we had two different individuals step up

11:54.960 --> 11:57.960
and hook us up with incredible hardware

11:57.960 --> 12:00.960
that is really, it changed the focus

12:00.960 --> 12:02.280
from, like, how the hell are we gonna afford this

12:02.280 --> 12:05.680
to, like, let's get some storage and focus on the setup.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.600
Both of these servers that were donated to us

12:08.600 --> 12:10.040
are nicer than I would have bought.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.040
Right? No kidding.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.600
Like, you know, we could have got something decent,

12:13.600 --> 12:15.120
but not this.

12:15.120 --> 12:19.400
Yeah, and both servers, one came with no disk

12:19.400 --> 12:20.880
and one came with disk, but both servers

12:20.880 --> 12:24.600
ended up having 48 terabytes of total storage available.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.720
Ironically, like, they both,

12:25.720 --> 12:27.960
that's where it worked out to be, is 48 terabytes.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.640
Which is interesting because right now

12:29.640 --> 12:32.160
we have about 20 terabytes, and we have two terabytes free

12:32.160 --> 12:34.080
in our current system.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.520
One is a set of spinning disks that I picked up

12:36.520 --> 12:38.680
from two different vendors on eBay,

12:38.680 --> 12:43.120
and the other came with 24 low-right threshold SSDs.

12:43.120 --> 12:46.640
But they're all SSDs, and man, is that a thing of beauty.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.560
So when we saw this, what we saw was a real opportunity

12:49.560 --> 12:51.640
here for us to play with disaster recovery

12:51.640 --> 12:53.400
and failover setups over time.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.880
Especially, not maybe so much from, like,

12:55.880 --> 12:57.840
an OS hot standby standpoint,

12:57.840 --> 13:00.160
but more, like, from a data recovery.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.680
For some of these really big, you know,

13:01.680 --> 13:03.560
archived files of productions and stuff

13:03.560 --> 13:06.000
that right now they're just not properly backed up

13:06.000 --> 13:07.520
because it's difficult to do so.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.560
Yeah, it's a lot of storage.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.240
So how do you do that?

13:11.240 --> 13:13.520
And especially when you have a Comcast connection

13:13.520 --> 13:16.280
that has, like, a kind of crappy upload speed

13:16.280 --> 13:17.880
and stuff like that.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.280
So we're gonna talk more about that.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.000
That's more down the road.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.720
What we're gonna focus on today is the box

13:24.720 --> 13:28.200
that has 24 SSDs in it.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.280
And that's gonna be the first box we deploy in this

13:31.280 --> 13:34.280
because it's got some great CPUs in it.

13:34.280 --> 13:39.280
It has got a couple of Intel E5-2667 Xeons,

13:39.880 --> 13:41.960
clocked at 3.6 gigahertz.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.320
And these are just beautiful CPUs.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.360
And there's 16 cores total here.

13:46.360 --> 13:50.480
And it has 755 gigabytes of usable RAM.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.440
It's just, we're using, like, something like 0.4% right now

13:53.440 --> 13:55.160
just in the base setup, it's insane.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.440
Yeah, we're talking RAM disk here.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.260
We're gonna be getting there.

13:57.260 --> 14:02.260
So it's a Dell R730 XD, and it's a hell of a box,

14:02.260 --> 14:04.780
but it was a little bit above my pay grade.

14:04.780 --> 14:07.700
Yeah, I gotta say, our community once again stepped up.

14:07.700 --> 14:10.260
And joining us this Saturday, we had a listener

14:10.260 --> 14:13.140
who helped gave the hardware a once over

14:13.140 --> 14:14.940
and get things rolling.

14:14.940 --> 14:17.140
Just don't confuse them with old Wes.

14:17.140 --> 14:18.540
My name's Wesley.

14:18.540 --> 14:22.540
I'll go by that, just we're not confusing me with Wes Payne.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.660
But yeah, so I'm kind of local here to the Seattle area.

14:26.660 --> 14:30.100
And when I heard Chris say that he would love

14:30.100 --> 14:32.580
to have some extra help, I was like,

14:32.580 --> 14:34.700
I'm a guy who lives in Seattle, the Seattle area,

14:34.700 --> 14:36.260
and I would love to help you guys.

14:36.260 --> 14:39.460
So yeah, I'll come on down and see what I can do.

14:39.460 --> 14:42.160
I actually told new Wes, don't come.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.380
I said, don't show up.

14:43.380 --> 14:44.540
The roads are frozen.

14:44.540 --> 14:46.380
It's a two hour drive from where you're at.

14:46.380 --> 14:48.420
Plus we're having to get together on the 30th.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.980
That's just too much work, that's crazy.

14:49.980 --> 14:51.020
Don't come.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.460
It's no, it's just not, we're not worth it.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.100
But he didn't listen to me.

14:56.100 --> 15:00.620
He headed out and he really, really knows this particular

15:00.620 --> 15:02.740
line of Dell hardware in and out.

15:02.740 --> 15:04.560
So that worked out like perfectly

15:04.560 --> 15:06.140
because it's what he deals with his day job.

15:06.140 --> 15:08.380
No kidding, he could not ask for anything better.

15:08.380 --> 15:11.180
Now, Seuss on the other hand,

15:11.180 --> 15:13.740
well, we're all kind of on the same page there.

15:13.740 --> 15:16.300
Yeah, I knew it was a distro

15:16.300 --> 15:18.960
and that's about the level that I had.

15:18.960 --> 15:19.800
Yeah.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.620
We had some fun moments.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.220
I think that's how we feel sometimes too.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.040
We're slowly learning.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.020
The net install had some learning curves for us.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.260
Yeah.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.540
We also chatted about how much of a great deal

15:28.540 --> 15:31.220
you can get from used server hardware.

15:31.220 --> 15:34.500
I think that is really the gold point here

15:34.500 --> 15:36.360
is everything we got is used.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.900
And yet it's still amazing for what we need to use it for.

15:39.900 --> 15:43.200
And maybe something people should consider more often.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.500
Absolutely, it's very affordable

15:44.500 --> 15:46.260
because you got companies who, you know,

15:46.260 --> 15:48.180
they go through their stock,

15:48.180 --> 15:51.980
a third of their servers at a time, they do upgrades.

15:51.980 --> 15:55.660
And they'll go for like 700 bucks, 800 bucks.

15:55.660 --> 15:58.860
Yeah, and they're ridiculously powerful for that too.

15:58.860 --> 16:00.180
Yeah, they also have a nice feature

16:00.180 --> 16:03.060
that I think we're excited about, IPMI, right?

16:03.060 --> 16:07.340
But NUEST wanted to warn us and tell us to be careful.

16:07.340 --> 16:08.700
Oh yeah, IPMI is great.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.460
It's easily one of the best things

16:10.460 --> 16:13.380
about sort of enterprise hardware.

16:13.380 --> 16:16.420
There is a downside though, of course, as with everything.

16:16.420 --> 16:19.380
There's a major security component there

16:19.380 --> 16:22.060
because it's its own separate board before

16:22.060 --> 16:22.900
the rest of the motherboard.

16:22.900 --> 16:26.540
That's how you can turn the server on while it's off.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.540
It's because it's its own own board

16:28.540 --> 16:31.140
that has the ability to control the server remotely.

16:31.140 --> 16:33.900
And so when you expose this over IP, right,

16:33.900 --> 16:35.900
which is how you want to for convenience,

16:35.900 --> 16:38.500
now you've got this huge attack surface

16:38.500 --> 16:41.460
that has the ability to control your entire box.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.580
That's definitely something we'll have to keep in mind.

16:43.580 --> 16:44.420
Definitely.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.420
Because I think a big part of this for us was IPMI,

16:46.420 --> 16:48.180
getting some kind of remote management.

16:48.180 --> 16:51.340
You can really think of it as a computer inside your server.

16:51.340 --> 16:53.860
And so I think what we'll probably do is lock down

16:53.860 --> 16:56.420
what IPs can connect to it and that kind of stuff.

16:56.420 --> 16:57.940
But it also was why we did this.

16:57.940 --> 17:00.940
Because if I had IPMI while I was on that road trip,

17:00.940 --> 17:02.300
I could have rebooted the server

17:02.300 --> 17:03.820
and got it back up and running again.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.860
And it wouldn't have been out for a few weeks.

17:05.860 --> 17:07.820
So just, I mean, a huge thank you to NUEST

17:07.820 --> 17:09.060
for making it all the way up here

17:09.060 --> 17:10.740
and helping us get the ball rolling on this.

17:10.740 --> 17:11.860
We really kind of needed that

17:11.860 --> 17:16.260
because I ended up way behind on getting this going

17:16.260 --> 17:17.340
because I got stuck out in the woods

17:17.340 --> 17:19.420
for a week longer than I intended to.

17:19.420 --> 17:22.700
So all the time after Christmas,

17:22.700 --> 17:24.300
between Christmas and New Year's,

17:24.300 --> 17:25.500
was when I was gonna be working on it.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.500
And I was stuck.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.180
And there were a lot of different moving pieces,

17:28.180 --> 17:30.140
which is why it's having extra hands around too, right?

17:30.140 --> 17:31.660
Because like, okay, there was the physical setup

17:31.660 --> 17:33.240
in the studio, getting that wired up,

17:33.240 --> 17:34.660
plugged into the network, up and going.

17:34.660 --> 17:36.900
Then there was actually getting the OS installed.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.260
And we still needed to figure out like disk layouts

17:39.260 --> 17:40.900
and operating system configuration,

17:40.900 --> 17:41.740
and all kinds of things.

17:41.740 --> 17:44.620
Even just having his knowledge there on the BIOS,

17:44.620 --> 17:46.300
because he knew those BIOSes in and out

17:46.300 --> 17:47.500
and what we wanted to do with it.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.340
Yeah, that could have been a rabbit hole.

17:48.340 --> 17:49.820
We wasted way too much time on it.

17:49.820 --> 17:50.660
Right.

17:50.660 --> 17:53.540
And also a big thank you to those of you

17:53.540 --> 17:55.060
who donated the hardware.

17:55.060 --> 17:56.380
Real Zombie Geek hooked us up

17:56.380 --> 17:57.820
with one of these awesome servers.

17:57.820 --> 17:59.700
That's the one we'll be telling you more about soon.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.940
We had anonymous listener give us the one with the SSDs

18:01.940 --> 18:03.300
that we put into production now.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.160
And it's great for us because it allows us

18:06.160 --> 18:08.660
to just get to work and get back to making the shows

18:08.660 --> 18:10.100
and learning this stuff

18:10.100 --> 18:11.480
and be able to relay that to you guys.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.160
So let's talk about what we're excited about

18:13.160 --> 18:14.000
with this server.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.140
It's definitely IPMI.

18:15.140 --> 18:16.580
That's a big game changer for us,

18:16.580 --> 18:18.640
but there's a ton in this box.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.780
A lot of it we haven't even told you about.

18:20.780 --> 18:25.780
Linode.com slash unplugged.

18:25.780 --> 18:29.960
Boy, have I really just gained a whole new appreciation

18:29.960 --> 18:31.640
for Linode this week.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.260
I don't want to do any more of these.

18:34.260 --> 18:38.460
Setting up an actual physical server is a lot of work.

18:38.460 --> 18:39.700
Yeah, no kidding, right?

18:39.700 --> 18:41.180
Just even the physical aspects of it.

18:41.180 --> 18:43.620
Rather than just clicking a button in a web UI, perhaps.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.820
And I honestly wouldn't be surprised

18:45.820 --> 18:47.540
if the power draw of that server

18:47.540 --> 18:51.220
is probably about the cost of a base Linode, right?

18:51.220 --> 18:53.780
But then that base Linode is gonna be in their data center

18:53.780 --> 18:55.740
with their screaming fast connections

18:55.740 --> 18:57.820
and their awesome hardware

18:57.820 --> 19:01.100
and also 11 data centers I could pick from.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.540
Plus they can handle the backups if you want.

19:03.540 --> 19:06.180
Yeah, I mean, it's really just a whole other ball game.

19:06.180 --> 19:09.520
And it's honestly why we have 98% of our infrastructure

19:09.520 --> 19:10.700
up on Linode.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.220
That's how we really deploy everything.

19:12.220 --> 19:14.340
Anything that the team uses,

19:14.340 --> 19:16.940
anything that our listeners interface with,

19:16.940 --> 19:18.460
that's what we use Linode for.

19:18.460 --> 19:19.580
But I hear from so many of you out there

19:19.580 --> 19:21.420
that have tried it out for something like Nextcloud

19:21.420 --> 19:23.020
or replaced Zoom with Jitsi

19:23.020 --> 19:25.380
or have decided to migrate to GitLab

19:25.380 --> 19:26.900
and you put that on Linode.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.340
You're just having that peace of mind

19:28.340 --> 19:30.060
that you've got the root password.

19:30.060 --> 19:31.740
You can make a backup when you want it.

19:31.740 --> 19:33.500
You can get your data when you need it.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.820
You can have full control over that setup.

19:35.820 --> 19:38.620
I think that's worth a lot.

19:38.620 --> 19:39.780
It's a kind of peace of mind

19:39.780 --> 19:42.300
or almost a stress that gets lifted off your shoulders

19:42.300 --> 19:43.740
when you move to that kind of setup.

19:43.740 --> 19:45.300
And then the great thing about Linode

19:45.300 --> 19:46.780
is they give you all the tools to manage that

19:46.780 --> 19:48.260
in a way that's not super complicated.

19:48.260 --> 19:49.180
It's not gonna be overwhelming.

19:49.180 --> 19:51.100
So if you wanna take steps in this direction,

19:51.100 --> 19:52.820
but you've never done it before,

19:52.820 --> 19:55.820
you're not gonna get scared by their horrible interface

19:55.820 --> 19:56.860
or their complicated UI.

19:56.860 --> 19:59.500
Like I picture something like the big hyperscalers,

19:59.500 --> 20:01.100
that is its own ecosystem, right?

20:01.100 --> 20:03.000
That is its own language.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.420
That's its own tooling.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.700
There are people that can become specialists

20:06.700 --> 20:10.580
in those hyperscalers that can't do anything else.

20:10.580 --> 20:12.620
It's not necessarily a good or bad thing.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.900
It's just not where I wanna invest my time.

20:14.900 --> 20:17.180
It's not where I wanna develop my skillset.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.020
And it's also, it's not gonna enable me

20:19.020 --> 20:21.860
to use multiple cloud providers should I ever need to.

20:21.860 --> 20:23.380
And Linode then has all these great tools

20:23.380 --> 20:25.600
like APIs and command line tools you can use as well

20:25.600 --> 20:28.000
or integrate with Kubernetes or Terraform.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.940
So it's just like, it's sort of sitting in this perfect spot

20:30.940 --> 20:32.660
for people that really are advanced

20:32.660 --> 20:34.100
with their infrastructure management

20:34.100 --> 20:36.500
or for people that just need a $5 Linode.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.220
And their pricing is 30 to 50% less

20:38.220 --> 20:39.180
than the major hyperscalers.

20:39.180 --> 20:42.660
So go try it out, get $100 and really kick the tires.

20:42.660 --> 20:43.820
And you support the show.

20:43.820 --> 20:45.940
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.380
You go there, you get $100 in 60 day credit

20:48.380 --> 20:49.220
and you support the show.

20:49.220 --> 20:50.860
What a great way to start the year.

20:50.860 --> 20:53.020
Linode.com slash unplugged.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.580
Well, after new West put in a lot of hard work

20:58.580 --> 21:00.140
getting us all set up and configure,

21:00.140 --> 21:02.180
you know, the OS was installed.

21:02.180 --> 21:04.420
Then we realized, oh right,

21:04.420 --> 21:06.660
I've got to set up this new disk array.

21:06.660 --> 21:09.500
And we hadn't really gotten quite that far in our planning.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.160
Yeah, this was tricky too

21:11.160 --> 21:14.580
because we had to make a couple of decisions.

21:15.420 --> 21:18.400
And one of the things we seriously gave consideration to

21:18.400 --> 21:21.900
was doing everything in ButterFS.

21:21.900 --> 21:24.980
Traditionally, we have the root file system in ButterFS

21:24.980 --> 21:28.220
and then we have the data pool in ZFS.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.700
And we thought this time,

21:29.700 --> 21:32.900
perhaps we just ButterFS the entire thing.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.420
And we didn't really have like a hard line

21:35.420 --> 21:36.340
on like requirements.

21:36.340 --> 21:38.020
So we had to actually hash out,

21:38.020 --> 21:39.540
well, what do we actually want to do?

21:39.540 --> 21:41.900
How much storage do we actually want available?

21:41.900 --> 21:43.340
And by having that conversation,

21:43.340 --> 21:46.140
we kind of whittled it down to ultimately,

21:46.140 --> 21:48.340
well, we're going to actually end up using ZFS.

21:48.340 --> 21:49.380
You know, it was interesting though.

21:49.380 --> 21:51.380
It was a fun discussion and thought experience

21:51.380 --> 21:52.220
in some sense, you know,

21:52.220 --> 21:54.620
it kind of showed what things, you know,

21:54.620 --> 21:56.260
what parts worked well in a world

21:56.260 --> 21:58.140
where it was all in on ButterFS

21:58.140 --> 22:01.100
and kind of unified some of the tooling we could have used.

22:01.100 --> 22:03.340
But, you know, it came down to just the available features

22:03.340 --> 22:05.500
and the amount of the pool we could actually use

22:05.500 --> 22:07.820
because at the end of the day,

22:07.820 --> 22:09.160
if we just had the same amount of space,

22:09.160 --> 22:11.020
that's still an improvement,

22:11.020 --> 22:12.340
but we were kind of running into issues

22:12.340 --> 22:13.940
down the road in 2022

22:13.940 --> 22:15.740
that we would just have to immediately address.

22:15.740 --> 22:17.620
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised

22:17.620 --> 22:19.380
if we wouldn't have made it more than three months

22:19.380 --> 22:21.820
with what we have available on the current system.

22:21.820 --> 22:24.500
And with the price of storage right now,

22:24.500 --> 22:26.660
I just can't really see us being able to

22:26.660 --> 22:28.720
replace a bunch of those disks right away.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.220
Right, and so if we, you know,

22:30.220 --> 22:31.980
if we had kind of copied a similar setup,

22:31.980 --> 22:35.140
the current array was set up by Alan back in the day,

22:35.140 --> 22:37.180
and it's set up with a bunch of mirrors in the pool.

22:37.180 --> 22:38.540
Probably a sensible way to do it.

22:38.540 --> 22:40.820
Totally, yeah, you know, Alan and Jim over the years

22:40.820 --> 22:41.860
have shared a lot of great stuff.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.020
There's some good wisdom on how you might want to set up CFS,

22:45.020 --> 22:46.500
in particular, what kind of use case you've got

22:46.500 --> 22:48.240
and, you know, what uptime reliability

22:48.240 --> 22:50.780
and how much data protection you need.

22:50.780 --> 22:53.100
But with mirrors, you know, you're making a copy there.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.220
You're mirroring that data over,

22:54.220 --> 22:58.260
and that means that you're only gonna get 50% utilization.

22:58.260 --> 23:01.060
So we ended up with exactly the amount of free space

23:01.060 --> 23:02.220
our current system has.

23:02.220 --> 23:04.860
Yeah, and you, when we told you that,

23:04.860 --> 23:06.060
you looked over at the calculator,

23:06.060 --> 23:08.020
and you weren't exactly happy.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.340
I'm like, we just can't do this.

23:09.340 --> 23:12.220
Like, we should, especially because these are-

23:12.220 --> 23:13.540
We kept reading all the arguments, you know,

23:13.540 --> 23:15.500
we went and looked up all these kind of guides,

23:15.500 --> 23:16.340
I'm like, how do I think about

23:16.340 --> 23:17.900
setting up your CFS storage and stuff,

23:17.900 --> 23:20.900
and be like, yeah, okay, yeah, I mean, that argument,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.020
I can't say that's not good reasoning.

23:23.020 --> 23:27.940
Right, I like PMed Neil on Matrix last night,

23:27.940 --> 23:29.300
I'm like, Neil, what do you think about this too?

23:29.300 --> 23:30.700
Cause we were in this, we were all sitting here

23:30.700 --> 23:33.500
in the studio trying to decide what to do about it.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.660
And, you know, you throw out a couple of options

23:35.660 --> 23:37.400
we could use to try to get some available storage

23:37.400 --> 23:39.340
out of a ButterFS setup, which was very helpful.

23:39.340 --> 23:41.400
Thank you for taking the time to do that.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.600
When we were talking about it, it was,

23:43.600 --> 23:45.420
the main constraint you had was,

23:45.420 --> 23:50.040
you didn't foresee expanding your physical topology

23:50.040 --> 23:51.920
within this year, right?

23:51.920 --> 23:54.980
That was the constraint that you ultimately put down to me.

23:54.980 --> 23:57.780
And I said, the main concern you should make sure

23:57.780 --> 24:00.380
you think about is avoiding a topology

24:00.380 --> 24:02.820
which can lead to cascade disk failure.

24:02.820 --> 24:05.300
Because if you're relying, for example, on parity rate

24:05.300 --> 24:07.340
and you say, all right, I'm okay with accepting

24:07.340 --> 24:09.620
two disks failing, you have to make sure

24:09.620 --> 24:12.140
your rate configuration is set up

24:12.140 --> 24:14.740
so that you reduce the likelihood

24:14.740 --> 24:17.580
that two disks will fail at the same time, right?

24:17.580 --> 24:20.300
And because you can't replace the disks

24:20.300 --> 24:22.500
and you can't afford and you can't figure out

24:22.500 --> 24:24.340
whether those disks were bought at the same time

24:24.340 --> 24:25.580
or if they're different times,

24:25.580 --> 24:27.500
you have to go with the worst case assumption

24:27.500 --> 24:29.500
that they're all bought at the same time.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.840
And that means that they will all fail at the same time

24:31.840 --> 24:33.040
when they get to failing.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.360
I expect that to be the case.

24:34.360 --> 24:35.200
You're right.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.460
So expect that to be the case and design it accordingly.

24:37.460 --> 24:39.800
Like I recommended, for everyone else,

24:39.800 --> 24:43.140
if you're doing Butterfess, I recommend using a RAID 10

24:43.140 --> 24:45.500
and using Z standard compression

24:45.500 --> 24:48.340
to increase the available space

24:48.340 --> 24:50.340
to be somewhere closer to what you would get

24:50.340 --> 24:52.940
with the RAID 6 arraignment

24:52.940 --> 24:55.380
because the RAID 10 configuration

24:55.380 --> 25:00.180
is less punishing to disks than the other options.

25:00.180 --> 25:02.660
With ZFS, you can do an equivalent configuration

25:02.660 --> 25:05.700
with you putting mirrors

25:05.700 --> 25:07.220
and then striping the mirrors on top

25:07.220 --> 25:08.920
because that's essentially what a RAID 10 is.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.540
It's a striped mirror.

25:10.540 --> 25:13.180
But don't do RAID Z or parity RAID

25:13.180 --> 25:16.400
because with the higher density disks that exist today,

25:16.400 --> 25:19.860
the likelihood of cascade disk failure goes up.

25:19.860 --> 25:22.500
I have personally experienced this at work

25:22.500 --> 25:24.640
and in my home setups.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.860
And I basically don't use parity RAID

25:26.860 --> 25:29.180
unless I absolutely have to.

25:29.180 --> 25:30.900
So don't, if you can avoid it.

25:30.900 --> 25:31.740
Yeah.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.540
And to make it more poignant,

25:33.540 --> 25:36.340
these are low right SSDs to begin with.

25:36.340 --> 25:39.500
So they have a lower life cycle than an average SSD.

25:39.500 --> 25:42.520
So they will fail sooner than an average SSD as well.

25:42.520 --> 25:43.360
Right.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.940
And so like, this is where if you're using Butterfess

25:45.940 --> 25:47.660
and like what I told Chris,

25:47.660 --> 25:49.220
and I'll say it repeated again for everyone else,

25:49.220 --> 25:51.900
is make a separate Butterfess pool

25:51.900 --> 25:54.100
for your data with your disks

25:54.100 --> 25:55.540
and configure it differently

25:55.540 --> 25:57.980
than how you would set up your OS pool

25:57.980 --> 26:00.520
so that it's optimized for those characteristics.

26:00.520 --> 26:04.800
So for example, set it up so that discard is async,

26:04.800 --> 26:07.000
set it up so you use Z standard compression,

26:07.000 --> 26:08.480
probably at a higher compression level

26:08.480 --> 26:11.180
because you're willing to eat more CPU cycles

26:11.180 --> 26:13.660
in return for less IO on disk,

26:13.660 --> 26:15.420
set it up with RAID 10,

26:15.420 --> 26:18.860
make sure that you've got proper monitoring and alerting

26:18.860 --> 26:22.620
to catch the warning signs quick, those kinds of things.

26:22.620 --> 26:23.460
Thank you.

26:23.460 --> 26:24.380
Thank you for taking the time.

26:24.380 --> 26:25.740
That's some great advice.

26:25.740 --> 26:29.620
And that is exactly the kind of rational setup

26:29.620 --> 26:30.740
everyone should follow.

26:30.740 --> 26:33.420
And I wanna be clear,

26:33.420 --> 26:36.260
what we ended up with is nowhere as good as that.

26:36.260 --> 26:40.260
And it is better than what we had on the whiteboard

26:40.260 --> 26:43.140
for quite a while, which was simply YOLO.

26:43.140 --> 26:45.900
And it was just a JBOD with no RAID at all,

26:45.900 --> 26:48.100
which we ultimately decided against.

26:48.100 --> 26:51.780
But what we chose seems a little more rational

26:51.780 --> 26:54.820
when you consider we considered no RAID at all.

26:54.820 --> 26:57.700
But I will also remind you that we have a server

26:57.700 --> 26:58.980
with the identical amount of storage

26:58.980 --> 27:00.260
that we have as a failover box.

27:00.260 --> 27:03.460
So that ultimately played a role in our decision.

27:03.460 --> 27:06.980
So we decided to go with ButterFS on the root,

27:06.980 --> 27:10.740
which is a hardware RAID one using the Dell RAID controller.

27:10.740 --> 27:13.980
It's got these two drive slots in the arse of the box

27:13.980 --> 27:15.360
back where the ports are.

27:15.360 --> 27:18.300
There's two disks in there that run the OS.

27:18.300 --> 27:20.740
Then we've got 24 solid state disks

27:20.740 --> 27:22.940
that are getting passed through on the controller.

27:22.940 --> 27:24.820
And we're going with ZFS.

27:24.820 --> 27:27.520
And because you should never do like what we do,

27:27.520 --> 27:30.340
we are doing RAID Z2.

27:30.340 --> 27:33.580
And like you should never do like we do,

27:33.580 --> 27:37.820
we're doing one big VDEV, which you should never do,

27:37.820 --> 27:39.740
especially with 24 disks, right?

27:39.740 --> 27:40.580
So don't do that.

27:40.580 --> 27:42.180
We basically tried to read all the advice we could get

27:42.180 --> 27:44.340
and then not do it.

27:44.340 --> 27:46.540
I mean, it seems pretty rational, right?

27:46.540 --> 27:47.380
I mean, no one-

27:47.380 --> 27:49.280
But you liked the number when we said you could get,

27:49.280 --> 27:51.740
we had like 82.5% capacity.

27:51.740 --> 27:52.580
That was the number you liked, I think, right?

27:52.580 --> 27:54.620
That's what it came down to, right?

27:54.620 --> 27:57.440
Is this migration just doesn't happen

27:57.440 --> 27:59.100
if we don't have more storage.

27:59.100 --> 28:01.780
So ultimately we wanted as much storage

28:01.780 --> 28:03.900
available as possible.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.540
So we went with a parity RAID,

28:05.540 --> 28:06.820
which we're really gonna be screwed

28:06.820 --> 28:08.580
if we have a couple of more than two disks fail

28:08.580 --> 28:09.860
at any point in time.

28:09.860 --> 28:12.820
And it's extra screwy because the time it's gonna take

28:12.820 --> 28:14.260
to get a replacement disk will probably be

28:14.260 --> 28:16.420
about the amount of time it takes for a third disk to fail.

28:16.420 --> 28:18.360
So we're really kind of going down to the wire

28:18.360 --> 28:21.420
with the idea being that we have the second box

28:21.420 --> 28:23.940
that will have an identical copy of everything

28:23.940 --> 28:27.700
that we could do like a ZFS send to recover should we need.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.460
The IRC thinks we hate our data.

28:29.460 --> 28:30.300
They might be right.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.620
I mean, we did almost YOLO this whole thing, right?

28:32.620 --> 28:34.100
You know what's been fascinating to me

28:34.100 --> 28:37.020
watching all of these discussions happen, Chris,

28:37.020 --> 28:41.300
is just your, the difference in your capacity

28:41.300 --> 28:42.500
to accept risk.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.960
And it was basically Wes for a few hours

28:44.960 --> 28:48.420
just trying to bring you back from those cliffs there.

28:48.420 --> 28:49.260
So-

28:49.260 --> 28:50.140
You know, I'm not trying to,

28:50.140 --> 28:53.740
it's more just to make sure we presented the facts

28:53.740 --> 28:54.580
as they may be.

28:54.580 --> 28:55.400
I appreciate it.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.320
So one of the things you kind of workshopped

28:57.320 --> 28:59.780
on your laptop was we were curious,

28:59.780 --> 29:02.820
like what happens if you just do a big ass

29:02.820 --> 29:04.500
ButterFest volume with 24 disks

29:04.500 --> 29:05.940
and a couple of those disks pop off,

29:05.940 --> 29:08.300
like how does ButterFest handle that?

29:08.300 --> 29:11.340
So Wes kind of replicated that on a smaller scale

29:11.340 --> 29:12.160
on his laptop.

29:12.160 --> 29:13.000
Tell us what you did.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.740
Oh yeah, it was just fun playing around with ButterFest

29:14.740 --> 29:16.900
and ZFS and you can set up some loopback devices,

29:16.900 --> 29:20.380
you know, just make some raw files you treat as disks

29:20.380 --> 29:22.160
with the loopback system in Linux,

29:22.160 --> 29:23.900
which is super handy to play with.

29:23.900 --> 29:25.760
You know, it's the Mount-O-Loop option

29:25.760 --> 29:27.040
you may be familiar with.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.500
And then yeah, you can set them up

29:28.500 --> 29:30.920
and then play with whatever type of raid configuration

29:30.920 --> 29:31.940
you might want, right?

29:31.940 --> 29:34.620
Great way to start learning on ButterFest or ZFS tooling

29:34.620 --> 29:37.140
without necessarily touching your real disks.

29:37.140 --> 29:39.140
Yeah, and no big loss

29:39.140 --> 29:40.940
if one of those loopback devices disappears

29:40.940 --> 29:41.780
and you want to see how the system reacts.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.060
Yeah, right, that's also, so yeah, exactly.

29:43.060 --> 29:44.200
And then you can sort of modify things.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.220
You can just write arbitrarily to it without worry

29:46.220 --> 29:49.060
or take it offline entirely and see what happens.

29:49.060 --> 29:51.620
And you know, ButterFest, it did degrade,

29:51.620 --> 29:54.060
but we would have had to do like a full restore from backup,

29:54.060 --> 29:56.760
which, you know, isn't, we should be able to do.

29:56.760 --> 29:58.220
That's the point of having the backup,

29:58.220 --> 30:02.900
but ultimately we decided that probably wasn't reasonable.

30:02.900 --> 30:04.860
So why only one VDEV?

30:04.860 --> 30:05.860
Because we did actually,

30:05.860 --> 30:08.060
didn't we initially do four VDEV, six sticks?

30:08.060 --> 30:10.220
Well, so it was basically just trying to figure out

30:10.220 --> 30:11.620
what storage, right?

30:11.620 --> 30:14.380
It ended up being the storage capacity metric.

30:14.380 --> 30:15.460
Yes, right.

30:15.460 --> 30:17.940
And so if we were splitting it up,

30:17.940 --> 30:20.820
that just meant there were more total parity disks.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.540
More parity disks, so there's less available space.

30:22.540 --> 30:24.540
But with the amount of disks we have,

30:24.540 --> 30:25.700
it actually would make a lot of sense

30:25.700 --> 30:27.060
to split it up into multiple VDEVs

30:27.060 --> 30:28.260
because then it kind of isolates

30:28.260 --> 30:31.620
like the rebuild degradations to that VDEV

30:31.620 --> 30:33.220
and doesn't screw with the entire.

30:33.220 --> 30:34.380
Yeah, you can find some tips out there

30:34.380 --> 30:36.760
for just how many you should stick to

30:36.760 --> 30:37.740
for the various rate levels

30:37.740 --> 30:39.340
and how to take your total desists

30:39.340 --> 30:41.940
and place them up into VDEVs that'll perform nicely.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.460
And then there's also of course concerns around

30:43.460 --> 30:45.460
if you're trying to optimize for IOPS and stuff like that.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.060
That wasn't our concern in this case,

30:47.060 --> 30:49.020
but it gets complicated

30:49.020 --> 30:51.260
and you definitely shouldn't do like we're doing.

30:51.260 --> 30:52.180
Don't do it like we're doing.

30:52.180 --> 30:54.100
Now here's something that you might wanna consider

30:54.100 --> 30:55.860
and we're gonna just be honest with you

30:55.860 --> 30:57.780
on how this part goes.

30:57.780 --> 31:00.320
And we kind of have a luxury

31:00.320 --> 31:02.860
because the old server hasn't crashed recently.

31:03.740 --> 31:06.400
Doesn't mean we wanna take our time doing this,

31:06.400 --> 31:09.500
but it means instead of just like whole hog

31:09.500 --> 31:10.860
picking up the Docker environment

31:10.860 --> 31:12.820
and dropping it on the new server,

31:12.820 --> 31:14.860
which was what plan A was,

31:14.860 --> 31:18.140
now we're thinking because they're both running,

31:18.140 --> 31:21.900
why don't we do a application migration to Podman?

31:21.900 --> 31:24.860
So we'll go from Docker in this migration

31:24.860 --> 31:27.380
to Podman running on the openSUSE Tumbleweed

31:27.380 --> 31:28.220
in the new setup.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.300
We thought we didn't have enough to learn

31:30.300 --> 31:32.100
with a new server operating system,

31:32.100 --> 31:34.860
so why not introduce something new into the mix?

31:34.860 --> 31:36.660
You know, really we've been, you know, I've been playing

31:36.660 --> 31:37.660
with Podman a little bit on the side.

31:37.660 --> 31:39.500
I think you have too, and it's come a long way.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.060
It's been exciting to watch its development.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.860
There's a lot of stuff to like about it,

31:42.860 --> 31:45.820
especially with the mixed sort of changes

31:45.820 --> 31:48.340
that the Docker test top world has been seeing lately.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.780
So kind of felt like maybe this was just the excuse

31:50.780 --> 31:52.460
we needed to really see.

31:52.460 --> 31:53.740
You know, it's not, again, as we said,

31:53.740 --> 31:55.420
like there's some stuff that needs to run,

31:55.420 --> 31:57.820
but it's not exactly business critical day to day.

31:57.820 --> 32:00.620
So we can have a little time here to try to figure out

32:00.620 --> 32:03.420
and learn, frankly, learn a lot more about Podman

32:03.420 --> 32:04.700
is also what we need to do here.

32:04.700 --> 32:05.540
And then we have the luxury

32:05.540 --> 32:09.140
that the production implementation is still running.

32:09.140 --> 32:12.000
So we're gonna start with like a simple applications

32:12.000 --> 32:14.020
and then kind of work our way up.

32:14.020 --> 32:15.420
Eventually we get to a bunch of applications

32:15.420 --> 32:16.380
that are all kind of intertwined

32:16.380 --> 32:17.920
with a whole bunch of storage and all that kind of stuff.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.480
And that's where we're gonna have to just move

32:19.480 --> 32:22.140
like three or four things at a time.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.060
But I think, although we haven't actually,

32:24.060 --> 32:25.180
have we tried this yet?

32:25.180 --> 32:26.420
I don't know, cause you might've been plugging away

32:26.420 --> 32:27.340
at this before the show started,

32:27.340 --> 32:30.620
but we're thinking because we were using

32:30.620 --> 32:33.820
the Docker ZFS driver on Arch,

32:33.820 --> 32:35.740
we have a sub volume for each Docker container.

32:35.740 --> 32:37.700
Yeah, we've got, there's a lot of sub volumes.

32:37.700 --> 32:40.020
So there's both the layer of, there's the volume layer

32:40.020 --> 32:42.020
and a lot of ours are set up on that setup.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.060
And then there's the sort of container storage layer

32:44.060 --> 32:45.900
for the images and the current setup,

32:45.900 --> 32:47.660
those are both on ZFS.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.060
And so should we just be able to ZFS

32:49.060 --> 32:50.460
send those to the new box?

32:50.460 --> 32:52.460
Yeah, so the application data we can just do.

32:52.460 --> 32:53.520
Yeah, that's gonna be nice.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.900
And then it'll be a matter of starting the app in Podman

32:56.900 --> 32:59.480
and just connecting it to its moved data, hopefully.

32:59.480 --> 33:00.560
I mean, Podman's come a long way

33:00.560 --> 33:01.740
in some of the Docker compatibility

33:01.740 --> 33:06.020
and I have not really used it in anger or in production.

33:06.020 --> 33:06.900
I don't think either of us have.

33:06.900 --> 33:08.660
So that's, I think that's gonna be what's interesting

33:08.660 --> 33:10.580
is to figure out what pieces move easily

33:10.580 --> 33:13.460
because we've tested a few simple apps in the new setup

33:13.460 --> 33:14.620
and they seem to be working just fine,

33:14.620 --> 33:17.380
but nothing with complicated interdependencies

33:17.380 --> 33:18.940
and networking and a whole bunch of state

33:18.940 --> 33:19.980
that we're trying to migrate.

33:19.980 --> 33:21.660
Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be interesting,

33:21.660 --> 33:24.780
but I think it'll be good to learn and try something new.

33:24.780 --> 33:27.380
No, I'll also be learning the Tumbleweed tooling

33:27.380 --> 33:29.160
along at the same time.

33:29.160 --> 33:30.620
So there's quite a bit actually,

33:30.620 --> 33:31.940
there's a lot of moving parts to it.

33:31.940 --> 33:33.860
It has been neat to see some of that integration though.

33:33.860 --> 33:36.620
You know, like for instance, Podman has its EFS driver,

33:36.620 --> 33:38.220
but it also has a ButterFS driver

33:38.220 --> 33:41.500
and Tumbleweed has that set up for you out of the box.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.140
Yeah, well, of course.

33:43.140 --> 33:44.380
And so it's just been interesting

33:44.380 --> 33:45.620
since we've kind of been, you know,

33:45.620 --> 33:49.100
like we hacked on Snapper to our Arch setup.

33:49.100 --> 33:51.500
And so it's one thing I'm excited to explore

33:51.500 --> 33:53.260
in this new world is just some of those pieces

33:53.260 --> 33:54.900
in a system that someone else has been thinking about

33:54.900 --> 33:56.900
how to compose those pieces and work with ButterFS

33:56.900 --> 33:58.700
and not just the stuff that we've come up with.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.660
Then phase two-ish, I suppose,

34:00.660 --> 34:01.900
after we get everything migrated

34:01.900 --> 34:05.500
is going to be attacking this DR box.

34:05.500 --> 34:06.700
We have a couple of routes we could go there.

34:06.700 --> 34:08.700
We could do another Tumbleweed box

34:08.700 --> 34:10.780
and just kind of keep them in sync,

34:10.780 --> 34:13.100
or we could Proxmox that machine

34:13.100 --> 34:16.800
and allocate a VM to be like a backup server

34:16.800 --> 34:19.100
and do like some cron jobs to ZFS send.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.780
I don't know if we have a complete picture

34:21.780 --> 34:22.700
of how we wanna do that yet.

34:22.700 --> 34:24.700
Like one thing we're considering is like sync it up here

34:24.700 --> 34:26.940
and then Wes takes to his house

34:26.940 --> 34:30.100
and it runs there as an actual legit

34:30.100 --> 34:32.700
for realsies offsite backup.

34:32.700 --> 34:33.540
What an idea!

34:33.540 --> 34:36.700
That would be a big step up for that data.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.700
There is like some stuff that we've just decided

34:38.700 --> 34:39.900
like if a disaster strikes,

34:39.900 --> 34:43.020
I guess we're just gonna lose this

34:43.020 --> 34:44.660
because I mean, where do you wanna pay

34:44.660 --> 34:47.100
for 20 terabytes of backup storage?

34:47.100 --> 34:49.300
And we're adding to it every single episode.

34:49.300 --> 34:51.540
Like it just gets crazy, right?

34:51.540 --> 34:53.700
So this is a real solution for us now.

34:53.700 --> 34:55.380
So if you have ideas or suggestions,

34:55.380 --> 34:57.980
nicksonplug.com slash contact for that.

34:57.980 --> 35:00.900
Oh yeah, I'm sure you guys have some very clever ideas.

35:00.900 --> 35:02.400
Now that being said,

35:02.400 --> 35:05.720
that seems like a pretty performant box

35:05.720 --> 35:07.100
to just be doing backups.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.380
Wes, do you think you'll have other plans for this thing?

35:09.380 --> 35:10.220
Yeah, we got it right.

35:10.220 --> 35:11.620
Something tells me we'll find some use cases.

35:11.620 --> 35:13.260
That's kind of why I was thinking Proxmox

35:13.260 --> 35:15.460
because you could have a lot of the storage

35:15.460 --> 35:17.980
and like a tumbleweed VM

35:17.980 --> 35:21.340
and then you slice off like the other stuff

35:21.340 --> 35:22.620
because the other box that we're not using,

35:22.620 --> 35:25.100
it has four Xeons in it.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.820
And another like 700 gigs of RAM or something,

35:27.820 --> 35:28.900
just a crazy amount of RAM.

35:28.900 --> 35:30.660
Something tells me it doesn't need all of those

35:30.660 --> 35:32.300
for copying bytes off the network.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.260
Especially when they're gonna become one

35:33.260 --> 35:34.980
over at Comcast connection.

35:34.980 --> 35:37.000
So it does make me think like,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.220
one of the things Wes and I were talking about

35:39.220 --> 35:42.680
is offloading the CPU video encoding

35:42.680 --> 35:46.100
that we do in the cloud right now to one of those boxes.

35:46.100 --> 35:49.700
They also, these Dells let you set power caps,

35:49.700 --> 35:50.540
which is fascinating.

35:50.540 --> 35:51.580
So you can say, just don't let the system

35:51.580 --> 35:53.460
use more than 600 Watts or something.

35:53.460 --> 35:54.300
That's pretty nice.

35:54.300 --> 35:55.420
Maybe you don't always want that,

35:55.420 --> 35:58.240
but it's cool to have some of these more,

35:58.240 --> 36:00.540
you know, customizable options down at the firmware level.

36:00.540 --> 36:03.180
I noticed an option in there while we were playing

36:03.180 --> 36:05.020
to cap it by BTUs as well,

36:05.020 --> 36:06.460
which I thought was really fascinating.

36:06.460 --> 36:10.060
Yeah, I gotta say the SSD box is quite enough

36:10.060 --> 36:11.060
that you could have it on your desk

36:11.060 --> 36:11.900
when it's not under load.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.380
That's been pretty surprising too, yeah.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.620
It's also big enough to be your desk.

36:15.620 --> 36:16.580
That's true.

36:16.580 --> 36:19.180
It is a monster and they're heavy.

36:19.180 --> 36:21.480
That is a thing, but it's up and running.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.660
The migration is in progress.

36:22.660 --> 36:25.860
We're starting with like network test pinging applications,

36:25.860 --> 36:27.540
stuff that just as really simple,

36:27.540 --> 36:30.380
but has obvious application data history

36:30.380 --> 36:33.020
so we can verify that the migration worked correctly.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.120
And then we'll start moving over

36:34.120 --> 36:35.580
the more integrated tooling,

36:35.580 --> 36:38.160
things like NextCloud and our production tools

36:38.160 --> 36:40.820
and workflow things and media stuff.

36:40.820 --> 36:43.740
And I imagine we'll have it probably done

36:43.740 --> 36:44.700
within a couple of weeks.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.380
I mean, we're not in a rush,

36:46.380 --> 36:48.480
but once you get one or two of them going,

36:48.480 --> 36:50.460
it's just sort of rinse and repeat.

36:50.460 --> 36:51.620
Yeah, definitely.

36:51.620 --> 36:56.460
All right then, how about just a spot of housekeeping.

36:56.460 --> 36:58.900
Thank you to our members, unpluggedcore.com

36:58.900 --> 37:01.180
and our network members at jupyter.party.

37:01.180 --> 37:04.440
It's now 100% ad free feed or the live feed,

37:04.440 --> 37:05.860
which has a lot more show.

37:06.740 --> 37:07.940
You want more Westpain?

37:09.060 --> 37:09.900
That's where you get it.

37:09.900 --> 37:11.440
Right there, right there.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.580
So thank you to our members.

37:12.580 --> 37:13.800
You get all our screw ups.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.800
So you're welcome.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.480
If you have feedback or ideas, segment ideas for the show,

37:18.480 --> 37:21.020
then it's unplugged.com slash contact.

37:21.020 --> 37:22.660
You can join our growing matrix community

37:22.660 --> 37:25.260
at linuxunplugged.com slash matrix.

37:25.260 --> 37:28.340
Our matrix server is colony.jupyterbroadcasting.com.

37:28.340 --> 37:31.220
And you know, if matrix isn't your thing,

37:31.220 --> 37:32.540
we have a telegram group.

37:32.540 --> 37:35.660
It's always going, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

37:35.660 --> 37:37.180
We'd love to have you there.

37:37.180 --> 37:41.060
And don't forget our virtual lug meets on Sundays

37:41.060 --> 37:42.020
before the show.

37:42.020 --> 37:43.280
And we're going to be meeting on Tuesdays

37:43.280 --> 37:44.660
at the old showtime too.

37:44.660 --> 37:47.260
So go get your mumble set up, which is actually jitzy.

37:47.260 --> 37:49.580
This is practice, practice both, right?

37:49.580 --> 37:51.140
You know, get mumble installed.

37:51.140 --> 37:52.300
Maybe get your mic working.

37:52.300 --> 37:53.980
For goodness sake, it's 2022.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.540
Probably also install an audio editor,

37:55.540 --> 37:56.900
something you can record your mic

37:56.900 --> 37:58.340
and then listen back to and make sure you sound all right.

37:58.340 --> 37:59.260
Yeah, Audacity.

37:59.260 --> 38:00.100
There you go.

38:00.100 --> 38:00.920
It's free.

38:00.920 --> 38:01.760
Try it out.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.100
Goodness sake, it's 2022.

38:03.100 --> 38:03.940
Goodness sake.

38:06.980 --> 38:09.080
We've gotten a lot of great feedback.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.260
Here's a quick one that we can get into.

38:11.260 --> 38:14.460
Bedrick wrote in, he says, dear Linux Unplugged,

38:14.460 --> 38:17.100
you've talked about monetizing Linux desktop apps

38:17.100 --> 38:19.980
in Linux Unplugged 4.3.8.

38:19.980 --> 38:22.140
I would like to pay for applications I use,

38:22.140 --> 38:25.020
but I personally dislike the feeling of being forced to.

38:25.020 --> 38:27.540
My new year's resolution is yet again

38:27.540 --> 38:29.660
to go over the open source projects I use

38:29.660 --> 38:31.240
and set up donations.

38:31.240 --> 38:33.420
What I would personally like to see

38:33.420 --> 38:35.340
is a tool that makes it easier to donate

38:35.340 --> 38:39.500
without the hassle with individual project payment details.

38:39.500 --> 38:42.420
I imagine a GNOME software welcome screen

38:42.420 --> 38:44.220
to set up credit card details

38:44.220 --> 38:46.500
as a flat hub account or something similar

38:46.500 --> 38:49.740
and an autopay option with an opt out possibility.

38:49.740 --> 38:51.880
This autopay option would be default,

38:51.880 --> 38:53.860
regularly pay the recommended price

38:53.860 --> 38:55.380
for all apps installed on my system

38:55.380 --> 38:58.480
that satisfy a few defined conditions.

38:58.480 --> 39:00.220
One, the app is already installed

39:00.220 --> 39:02.180
for some minimum amount of time,

39:02.180 --> 39:04.740
so longer than a trial period, for instance,

39:04.740 --> 39:07.460
and is used frequently enough to be useful,

39:07.460 --> 39:10.020
like at least once a year or something.

39:10.020 --> 39:12.100
Some additional configuration would be appreciated,

39:12.100 --> 39:15.260
like global and per app configuration for the price

39:15.260 --> 39:19.260
as an absolute value or a factor of the recommended price,

39:19.260 --> 39:23.020
configuration of the trial period and usage frequency

39:23.020 --> 39:25.060
and some payment breakdowns.

39:25.060 --> 39:27.020
I feel like the Linux desktop community

39:27.020 --> 39:29.780
needs to feel in control and not be forced to.

39:29.780 --> 39:31.540
You know, I think we've seen various takes

39:31.540 --> 39:33.680
on some pieces of that.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.180
Nothing that's quite got all of it

39:35.180 --> 39:38.700
but more so really seems to have taken off.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.860
Yeah, open collective comes to mind,

39:40.860 --> 39:43.340
but it doesn't quite do it at this level.

39:43.340 --> 39:45.260
The days of what, Flatter, was it?

39:45.260 --> 39:46.700
Yeah, yeah, right.

39:46.700 --> 39:49.020
There's a few out there,

39:49.020 --> 39:51.340
and I don't think I'd want something,

39:51.340 --> 39:53.220
much like he doesn't want to feel forced to pay.

39:53.220 --> 39:54.680
I don't know if I agree with that take,

39:54.680 --> 39:56.580
but I understand the sentiment.

39:56.580 --> 39:59.460
I wouldn't really want this to be a GNOME software solution.

39:59.460 --> 40:02.060
Try as I might, I still struggle to use GNOME software,

40:02.060 --> 40:03.300
and I wouldn't want it to be something

40:03.300 --> 40:06.300
that only could be done in GNOME software.

40:06.300 --> 40:07.420
Now, Chris, you and I this morning

40:07.420 --> 40:10.660
were throwing around ideas around podcast networks

40:10.660 --> 40:12.460
and how they could monetize shows.

40:12.460 --> 40:15.820
Do you see any of that being applicable in this case?

40:15.820 --> 40:18.540
So next week, Dave Jones is gonna join us on the show,

40:18.540 --> 40:21.660
and Dave works with the Podcast Index

40:21.660 --> 40:23.980
and Podcasting 2.0 Initiatives.

40:23.980 --> 40:25.900
And one of the things Dave's gonna talk to us about

40:25.900 --> 40:28.860
is how they use the Bitcoin Lightning Network

40:28.860 --> 40:31.300
to pay content creators.

40:31.300 --> 40:32.580
And the idea is roughly,

40:32.580 --> 40:33.460
he's gonna tell us more about it,

40:33.460 --> 40:35.460
but from my rough understanding,

40:36.360 --> 40:38.860
you say you have a podcast app, an open source podcast app,

40:38.860 --> 40:42.500
and it's got a Bitcoin wallet in there.

40:42.500 --> 40:45.300
And what you do is you throw like 30 bucks of Satoshis

40:45.300 --> 40:49.000
in that wallet that's built into the podcast catcher.

40:49.900 --> 40:51.620
And then you go in there and you say,

40:51.620 --> 40:53.940
you send this amount to Jupiter Broadcasting,

40:53.940 --> 40:56.700
you send this amount to name your favorite podcast,

40:56.700 --> 40:58.980
and kind of like you might with a Patreon

40:58.980 --> 41:01.780
where you can kind of subscribe at different tiers.

41:01.780 --> 41:06.780
And then what the app does is it uses the Lightning Network

41:06.780 --> 41:10.780
to kind of stream Satoshis to the creator as you listen.

41:10.780 --> 41:14.060
So you set a threshold and you set a total amount,

41:14.060 --> 41:15.700
and then based on your listening,

41:15.700 --> 41:18.100
it funds the creators you're actively listening to,

41:18.100 --> 41:19.340
which I think is a really interesting thing

41:19.340 --> 41:23.160
because it's part of what they call a value for value model.

41:23.160 --> 41:26.900
And it could be applied to free software as well,

41:26.900 --> 41:28.340
I would think.

41:28.340 --> 41:29.260
I don't know if people wanna pay

41:29.260 --> 41:31.420
by their hour usage of software,

41:31.420 --> 41:34.260
but there could be something in there that says,

41:34.260 --> 41:38.900
hey, you used this editor for eight hours this week,

41:38.900 --> 41:40.060
or this month, or this year.

41:40.060 --> 41:42.580
Or you launched it 28 times this month,

41:42.580 --> 41:43.420
something like that.

41:43.420 --> 41:46.940
Would you like to send the average amount?

41:46.940 --> 41:49.820
Yeah, ways to lower that barrier in a practical way.

41:49.820 --> 41:51.340
Because then yeah, many of us mean well, right?

41:51.340 --> 41:53.680
But even when you are intentional enough

41:53.680 --> 41:55.500
to maybe think like, oh yeah, year-end things,

41:55.500 --> 41:57.140
I wanna donate and such,

41:57.140 --> 41:59.120
you might think about nonprofits in years,

41:59.120 --> 42:01.420
but how often are you also thinking of software?

42:01.420 --> 42:03.200
It just doesn't always easily happen

42:03.200 --> 42:04.460
if you don't actively do it.

42:04.460 --> 42:09.460
I like this idea of the Bitcoin wallet in the podcast app

42:11.080 --> 42:12.860
using the Lightning Network,

42:12.860 --> 42:16.000
because it's all free software, the entire stack,

42:16.000 --> 42:19.540
even the payment system is free software, all of it.

42:19.540 --> 42:20.620
And yeah, there's scammers out there

42:20.620 --> 42:21.640
that use this same stuff,

42:21.640 --> 42:23.740
but that's true for cash and everything else.

42:23.740 --> 42:26.100
And so there's something interesting there

42:26.100 --> 42:29.240
about monetizing free software

42:29.240 --> 42:31.380
with a free software currency

42:31.380 --> 42:33.980
that tends to grow in value over time.

42:33.980 --> 42:36.400
And doing it in a way that is transparent

42:36.400 --> 42:38.580
because everything on the blockchain is transparent.

42:38.580 --> 42:41.860
And so the project by the very use

42:41.860 --> 42:44.740
of a blockchain payment system is held accountable,

42:44.740 --> 42:47.380
or a podcast network is held accountable, right?

42:47.380 --> 42:48.860
Because it's all of the accounting

42:48.860 --> 42:50.300
is there on the blockchain.

42:50.300 --> 42:53.060
And there's something about free currency,

42:53.060 --> 42:55.900
free software, and a public ledger

42:55.900 --> 42:58.100
that seems like there's probably some kind of,

42:58.100 --> 43:00.300
as they would say, synergy

43:00.300 --> 43:02.060
that we just haven't really fully explored yet.

43:02.060 --> 43:04.620
Do you feel like these tools are ready

43:04.620 --> 43:07.860
for prime time action, like the Lightning Network and?

43:07.860 --> 43:08.760
Oh, sure, yeah.

43:08.760 --> 43:09.600
Oh, yeah.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.140
So well-tested and totally ready

43:11.140 --> 43:11.980
for us to take it on full speed?

43:11.980 --> 43:14.720
Yeah, I mean, like with the podcasting index,

43:14.720 --> 43:17.220
like that monetization system's

43:17.220 --> 43:18.580
been in practice for a bit now.

43:18.580 --> 43:19.400
Nice.

43:19.400 --> 43:20.740
Yeah, so maybe.

43:20.740 --> 43:22.020
Yeah, you never know.

43:22.020 --> 43:24.600
We could see something there or nothing, absolutely.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.560
It all happens and we still struggle

43:26.560 --> 43:27.940
to pay free software developers.

43:27.940 --> 43:29.380
Yeah, I mean, I think you're just trying to lobby

43:29.380 --> 43:30.940
to get people to implement your prediction.

43:30.940 --> 43:32.460
That's what's going on here.

43:32.460 --> 43:34.340
Oh, yeah, that's right, right.

43:34.340 --> 43:38.220
Although I didn't work NFTs, you see, that was, yeah.

43:38.220 --> 43:41.940
All right, so I have a pick that I feel like is

43:41.940 --> 43:43.520
the kind of pick you only really do on the show

43:43.520 --> 43:44.580
right after the holidays

43:44.580 --> 43:46.860
where people may have gotten a Kindle.

43:46.860 --> 43:48.860
So what I wanted to link in the show notes,

43:48.860 --> 43:50.640
and I know it's not for everybody,

43:50.640 --> 43:52.140
but it's a Kindle comic converter.

43:52.140 --> 43:55.100
It'll take like a JPEG or a PNG or a PDF

43:55.100 --> 43:57.100
of your comic that you might be reading,

43:57.100 --> 43:58.580
probably a Star Trek comic,

43:58.580 --> 44:01.540
and then it will convert it to a format that is readable

44:01.540 --> 44:03.100
on your new Kindle that you got

44:03.100 --> 44:05.280
without having to go through like some Kindle Cloud

44:05.280 --> 44:06.860
or Amazon authorization.

44:06.860 --> 44:09.220
And it's simply called Kindle Comic Converter.

44:09.220 --> 44:11.020
We'll have a link to the website

44:11.020 --> 44:12.940
or we'll have a link to the Flat Hub as well.

44:12.940 --> 44:14.080
Isn't the Kindle just one of those things,

44:14.080 --> 44:16.980
like so many of those that were,

44:16.980 --> 44:18.880
I'm sure there's plenty of open source behind it

44:18.880 --> 44:21.240
and the device works pretty nicely.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.100
I have one, I use it, I like eBooks,

44:23.100 --> 44:26.700
but it's just, I'm so grateful for open source things

44:26.700 --> 44:28.480
like this that can put you a little bit more in control

44:28.480 --> 44:30.500
because otherwise it's really very much feels

44:30.500 --> 44:31.820
like a locked-in ecosystem.

44:31.820 --> 44:33.140
I wonder if I could find our old

44:33.140 --> 44:35.100
Linux Action Show Kindle review.

44:35.100 --> 44:36.060
That was pretty rough.

44:36.060 --> 44:38.720
Linux Action Show is the very first Kindle.

44:41.180 --> 44:43.420
Yep, there it is, 13 years ago, there's us.

44:43.420 --> 44:48.460
I'm gonna put a link to this into the show notes.

44:48.460 --> 44:49.420
Wow, it's only two minutes long.

44:49.420 --> 44:51.700
I think it was an outtake, so it's not the full review,

44:51.700 --> 44:52.960
but it's pretty bad.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.340
I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

44:54.340 --> 44:55.740
Oh boy, I don't think I've seen this one.

44:55.740 --> 44:57.640
12 years ago, we were talking about

44:57.640 --> 44:59.460
the very first Kindle on the Linux Action Show.

44:59.460 --> 45:00.900
Season two.

45:00.900 --> 45:03.100
Yeah, that was just after we started calling it Seasons,

45:03.100 --> 45:07.480
which I think was around 100 episodes, I think.

45:07.480 --> 45:08.420
I don't remember for sure.

45:08.420 --> 45:10.260
So it was like 100 episodes in when we started.

45:10.260 --> 45:11.100
The whole thing is...

45:11.100 --> 45:12.380
Definitely a system that makes sense.

45:12.380 --> 45:13.980
Very foggy, it's very, very foggy.

45:13.980 --> 45:15.480
I have to be honest with you.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.980
Well, thankfully you documented it,

45:17.980 --> 45:19.020
so you can review it later.

45:19.020 --> 45:20.640
I look back and I go, who are those people?

45:20.640 --> 45:21.480
Who are they?

45:21.480 --> 45:23.020
What are they talking about?

45:23.020 --> 45:24.420
And every now and then I find myself agreeing

45:24.420 --> 45:26.100
with my past self and I realize,

45:26.100 --> 45:27.700
oh, I'm just like a robot.

45:27.700 --> 45:28.740
If you give me the same input,

45:28.740 --> 45:30.460
I pretty much give you the same output.

45:30.460 --> 45:31.820
Is that a good sign or a bad sign?

45:31.820 --> 45:32.980
I guess you're consistent.

45:32.980 --> 45:34.940
Yeah, I suppose on some things.

45:34.940 --> 45:36.540
Although you can find some reviews of me

45:36.540 --> 45:38.380
really dogging on Butterfess and Fedora,

45:38.380 --> 45:40.260
so some things do change.

45:40.260 --> 45:42.020
And more recent ones about Seuss,

45:42.020 --> 45:43.420
now that I think about it.

45:43.420 --> 45:44.300
If you'd like more show,

45:44.300 --> 45:45.580
remember that we do have a log

45:45.580 --> 45:46.740
that gets together every Sunday

45:46.740 --> 45:48.540
and now on Tuesdays at noon Pacific.

45:48.540 --> 45:49.620
If you're in the tech industry,

45:49.620 --> 45:52.280
make sure you're not missing linuxactionnews.com.

45:52.280 --> 45:53.180
There's a lot going on there

45:53.180 --> 45:54.940
that doesn't make it into this show.

45:54.940 --> 45:58.300
But now we have a new Same Bat Time.

45:58.300 --> 46:01.220
It's Sundays now at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

46:01.220 --> 46:02.500
See you next week.

46:02.500 --> 46:04.820
Same Bat Time, Same Bat Station.

46:04.820 --> 46:05.660
There you have it.

46:05.660 --> 46:06.920
Of course, the show will just kind of come out

46:06.920 --> 46:08.120
like a little bit earlier in the feed,

46:08.120 --> 46:11.540
so for most of you out there, just a little bit sooner.

46:11.540 --> 46:14.220
Linux Action News will be towards the end of your week now,

46:14.220 --> 46:15.780
so make sure you're at linuxactionnews.com

46:15.780 --> 46:17.340
slash subscribe for that.

46:17.340 --> 46:18.900
Links to the things that we talked about,

46:18.900 --> 46:20.700
which is not much, not much,

46:20.700 --> 46:22.620
because it's, you know, it's a special episode.

46:22.620 --> 46:26.780
But we'll have those at linuxunplug.com slash 439.

46:26.780 --> 46:28.380
Yeah, anything else, gentlemen?

46:28.380 --> 46:29.220
No.

46:29.220 --> 46:30.140
It's been good.

46:30.140 --> 46:30.980
Good work, guys.

46:30.980 --> 46:31.820
Well, thank you.

46:31.820 --> 46:32.640
We got ourselves a new server.

46:32.640 --> 46:35.140
Yeah, and a new day.

46:35.140 --> 46:36.040
A new year.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.200
All right, everybody, thanks so much for joining us

46:37.200 --> 46:38.900
on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

46:38.900 --> 46:40.700
See you right back here next Sunday.

46:40.700 --> 46:56.700
We'll be right back with another episode of Unplugged.

47:10.700 --> 47:22.580
All right, jbtitles.com, let's go vote, everybody.

47:22.580 --> 47:24.340
Go pick your title.

47:24.340 --> 47:25.180
You got something there, Bryn?

47:25.180 --> 47:26.420
What you got?

47:26.420 --> 47:29.020
Throughout all this discussion, I got really curious.

47:29.020 --> 47:30.060
Two things, I think.

47:30.060 --> 47:31.180
Okay.

47:31.180 --> 47:32.700
Maybe I'll throw them at you one at a time.

47:32.700 --> 47:33.540
Go for it, go for it.

47:33.540 --> 47:36.740
Okay, number one, what's gonna happen to the old server?

47:36.740 --> 47:40.020
Well, we've had someone who's requested it,

47:40.020 --> 47:41.420
so we might donate it to a listener.

47:41.420 --> 47:42.420
Oh, well, that's nice.

47:42.420 --> 47:43.860
It's like a full circle kind of thing.

47:43.860 --> 47:44.700
I like that.

47:44.700 --> 47:46.340
Yeah, so that's sort of plan A,

47:46.340 --> 47:47.420
although if they don't want it,

47:47.420 --> 47:50.420
then I haven't really figured out plan B yet.

47:50.420 --> 47:51.660
But that's plan A.

47:51.660 --> 47:52.780
Okay, I like plan A.

47:52.780 --> 47:53.620
All right, let's question two.

47:53.620 --> 47:54.980
Okay, question number two.

47:54.980 --> 47:56.720
It's a good question.

47:56.720 --> 47:57.940
How's Arch been?

47:57.940 --> 47:58.940
What's the debrief?

47:58.940 --> 48:02.660
Like, are you feeling like it did what it needed to?

48:02.660 --> 48:04.580
We should have done an Arch exit interview.

48:04.580 --> 48:05.500
Yeah, really.

48:05.500 --> 48:06.380
We should have done that,

48:06.380 --> 48:09.180
because I think it worked better than we expected.

48:09.180 --> 48:10.660
And we thought it'd be okay,

48:10.660 --> 48:13.580
but I think it was solid as hell,

48:13.580 --> 48:16.320
and it's not going out of production

48:16.320 --> 48:17.240
because of any Arch issue.

48:17.240 --> 48:18.380
It's because the hardware's dying.

48:18.380 --> 48:19.220
Yeah, really, right.

48:19.220 --> 48:20.700
We could have kept this train rolling.

48:20.700 --> 48:23.100
The will of the community in our vote.

48:23.100 --> 48:25.180
Yeah, and stepping up and saying,

48:25.180 --> 48:26.740
yes, you're gonna go this direction in the polls,

48:26.740 --> 48:27.980
so we're doing it,

48:27.980 --> 48:29.400
even though the lizards may have conspired

48:29.400 --> 48:31.760
to make sure the poll went their direction.

48:31.760 --> 48:32.860
I will say, you know, it was one of the,

48:32.860 --> 48:34.740
I've had a few personal Arch servers

48:34.740 --> 48:36.220
or similar type things in the past,

48:36.220 --> 48:39.380
but I think this was the lowest touch of those,

48:39.380 --> 48:40.500
which is not generally necessarily

48:40.500 --> 48:42.180
maybe what you think of in the Arch setup.

48:42.180 --> 48:44.840
So it was kind of a test of that kind of stability as well,

48:44.840 --> 48:46.500
because it was maybe monthly

48:46.500 --> 48:48.940
or maybe sometimes a little less on those updates

48:48.940 --> 48:49.780
that we did.

48:49.780 --> 48:50.600
Someone can do the math.

48:50.600 --> 48:52.820
But yeah, I think that worked pretty well too.

48:52.820 --> 48:54.160
I mean, I think just to recap,

48:54.160 --> 48:56.940
what made it work well was,

48:58.180 --> 48:59.000
we say it all the time,

48:59.000 --> 49:01.380
but put our FS on the route and not ZFS,

49:01.380 --> 49:03.780
because when the ZFS module a couple of,

49:03.780 --> 49:05.260
maybe three times on us,

49:05.260 --> 49:07.280
failed to build or install correctly,

49:07.280 --> 49:08.120
we could still boot the system.

49:08.120 --> 49:10.260
That could have been catastrophic otherwise.

49:10.260 --> 49:12.020
You fixed a little timing issue,

49:12.020 --> 49:15.380
so that way ZFS got mounted before the containers start.

49:15.380 --> 49:16.460
Oh yeah, just to make sure

49:16.460 --> 49:17.940
that was gonna play nicely together, yeah.

49:17.940 --> 49:19.420
Because, you know, that's the thing about Arch,

49:19.420 --> 49:21.020
is like, there's no distro maintainer,

49:21.020 --> 49:23.420
like, you know, kind of making sure that works.

49:23.420 --> 49:25.380
Like we had to figure that out on our own,

49:25.380 --> 49:27.380
because sometimes the Docker containers would start

49:27.380 --> 49:28.580
and the pool wouldn't be available,

49:28.580 --> 49:30.220
and they'd be like, where's my storage?

49:30.220 --> 49:31.260
And then things would be broken,

49:31.260 --> 49:32.420
but the applications would be running,

49:32.420 --> 49:34.220
so it's not immediately available or obvious.

49:34.220 --> 49:36.500
Yeah, but like, you know, we tweaked that ages ago.

49:36.500 --> 49:37.500
Yeah, it just stayed.

49:37.500 --> 49:38.340
It just worked.

49:38.340 --> 49:39.380
It was never a problem again.

49:39.380 --> 49:44.140
And then I think the LTS kernel helped.

49:44.140 --> 49:45.160
We weren't taking advantage

49:45.160 --> 49:46.540
of the cutting edge kernel features.

49:46.540 --> 49:47.540
Not in that box.

49:47.540 --> 49:49.200
It got updated more than I expected,

49:49.200 --> 49:50.620
but it was point updates.

49:50.620 --> 49:52.340
And then I think, obviously,

49:52.340 --> 49:54.580
having our applications in containers

49:54.580 --> 49:59.060
and not like installed from the AUR or the Arch repository

49:59.060 --> 50:03.020
meant that the OS could pretty much roll independently

50:03.020 --> 50:04.740
and not affect the applications.

50:04.740 --> 50:08.260
And so we didn't have things like AUR installs breaking

50:08.260 --> 50:10.380
that no longer updated or anything like that.

50:10.380 --> 50:11.620
And I think that also contributed

50:11.620 --> 50:13.260
to being a successful Arch box.

50:13.260 --> 50:16.700
Are we gonna do some occasional like zipper live updates?

50:16.700 --> 50:17.600
Oh yeah, I think we should,

50:17.600 --> 50:21.020
because I mean, the whole thing is holding it accountable.

50:21.020 --> 50:23.660
And if it, you know, and not sugarcoating if it breaks

50:23.660 --> 50:26.880
and not hiding if it's been a big success

50:26.880 --> 50:28.460
and if it's been really great and, you know,

50:28.460 --> 50:29.940
we have to own that, then we own it.

50:29.940 --> 50:31.540
Either way, I think we do it publicly

50:31.540 --> 50:34.340
as a, you know, as sort of an example

50:34.340 --> 50:36.820
of how to run something so you don't have to, right?

50:36.820 --> 50:37.900
It's sort of how I always looked at it.

50:37.900 --> 50:40.180
Like we'll try this and we'll try it with something

50:40.180 --> 50:41.740
that really matters to us.

50:41.740 --> 50:44.580
So that way you listening can do it the right way

50:44.580 --> 50:46.100
and don't do like we do.

50:46.100 --> 50:47.540
And I think there's some value in that.

50:47.540 --> 50:48.940
We've gotten quite a bit of feedback

50:48.940 --> 50:50.900
in the last several months of people saying,

50:50.900 --> 50:52.460
oh yeah, I remember, you know,

50:52.460 --> 50:55.060
when I first caught some Linux unplugged

50:55.060 --> 50:57.180
and the thing that really grabbed me

50:57.180 --> 51:00.500
was you guys doing live Arch updates.

51:00.500 --> 51:02.180
We've gotten that so many times

51:02.180 --> 51:05.020
and it feels like it's both memorable

51:05.020 --> 51:07.020
and really valuable, perhaps.

51:07.020 --> 51:07.860
We'll see.

51:07.860 --> 51:11.980
Hopefully it's also fun and valuable with the SUSE setup.

51:11.980 --> 51:15.140
And I actually, I could imagine if it, you know,

51:15.140 --> 51:17.020
if it actually failed on us,

51:17.020 --> 51:18.900
it would like wreck the rest of the show.

51:18.900 --> 51:19.720
Like, what are we gonna do?

51:19.720 --> 51:20.900
Just keep on doing the show?

51:20.900 --> 51:22.180
That's a bummer, yeah.

51:22.180 --> 51:23.140
Yeah, we're bummed out.

51:23.140 --> 51:26.340
Like at worst, like we stop the show and fix the server

51:26.340 --> 51:29.300
and at best we keep going knowing the server's busted

51:29.300 --> 51:30.980
and we got a big job after the show.

51:30.980 --> 51:32.900
Wes will just do like his tap dance routine

51:32.900 --> 51:35.980
to fill the extra waves that we gotta fill for the show.

51:35.980 --> 51:37.460
You know, we should probably just set up a mic

51:37.460 --> 51:38.900
in the garage directly already.

51:38.900 --> 51:41.940
One of us just moves out there.

51:41.940 --> 51:43.700
You better get your finger on the beat button.

51:43.700 --> 52:03.700
All right.
