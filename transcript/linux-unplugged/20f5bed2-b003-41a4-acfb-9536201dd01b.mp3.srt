1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,120
Everybody suffers from downtime every now and then.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,220
And there was recently a major DDoS attack,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,240
and with that, we got some great fodder.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,080
Air, Azure, what is it?

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,640
airsazurethrows.tumblr.com.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,360
airsazurethrows.tumblr.com.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,280
Of course it's a Tumblr.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,440
Is a collection of Azure Airs that are really great.

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,040
And you know, recently I've been struggling

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,520
where I have services where part of them is broken,

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,960
and I've realized it because they depend

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,920
on all these different various microservices

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,300
that keep going offline.

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,920
I'm looking at you Telegram bots.

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,980
This is a great Tumblr if you want to smile.

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,120
airsazurethrows.tumblr.com.

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,020
This is hilarious.

18
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,560
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 168,

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,040
recorded on October 25th, 2016.

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:01:00,840
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,440
that has a real soft spot for open hardware.

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,280
My name is Chris.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,120
My name is Wes.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,640
Hello, Wes, we'll be getting into a little

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,600
open hardware purchase that I just made.

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,840
Very excited.

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,520
We'll talk about that a little bit in the show,

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,080
but as is our traditional recipe these days

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,720
for an unplugged show, we'll be going through

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,400
some great community updates.

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,960
We're gonna start with one that I'm personally

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,240
super excited about.

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,360
Am I not just dancing right now?

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,080
Oh, you are dancing off the wall.

35
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,680
I was totally just dancing on the intro there

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,260
because I'm so excited about this.

37
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,080
Then you've probably heard about Dirty Cow by now,

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,220
but did you know it's going after your Samsungs

39
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,880
and your Motorolas and your HD, yeah, your Android phones.

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,720
It's everywhere.

41
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,480
It's a train wreck, and we'll give you

42
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,960
a little more specifics about Dirty Cow,

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,680
and if you really need to worry if you're

44
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,360
an up-to-date Linux user, then we'll get into archival

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,240
of some of our long-term memories digitally.

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,920
We'll get an update from Popeye and Wimpy

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,920
about their trip to a recent event, that's right,

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,840
and then we'll get into that hardware surprise.

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,340
Oh, man, this is something I have been waiting for

50
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,540
for two years.

51
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,400
Well, yeah, waiting for this product for about two years.

52
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
We have had people that have created this product

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,480
on two different Jupiter broadcasting shows,

54
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,600
and I'm gonna play an interview for you today

55
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,320
in today's episode of Unplugged.

56
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,840
Then I'll unveil what it is that I got.

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
I am so excited.

58
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
I'm gonna have it right here in the studio.

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,340
I have no idea.

60
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,180
Oh, I know, I know.

61
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,520
And it actually relates to something

62
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,320
we were just talking about in the Poe Show last week.

63
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,440
Oh, no way.

64
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,520
It all ties together.

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,340
It all ties together.

66
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,440
But before we can get into any of that, Wes,

67
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,220
there's a protocol that must be followed,

68
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,840
a duty that must be followed through on,

69
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,080
and that's bringing in the most important part of the show,

70
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,920
our virtual log.

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,000
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
Hello.

73
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,660
Hello, it's time.

74
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,500
Hello, good evening.

75
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,320
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

76
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,160
Hello.

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,000
Woo!

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,820
Hello.

79
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,660
Beautiful people.

80
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,000
That is a virtual log right there.

81
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Yes.

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,040
Okay, now tell me you can't be a little excited about this.

83
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,420
I am super excited about this.

84
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,920
Freeablo.

85
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,320
Freeablo, a work in progress,

86
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,040
free open-source replacement for the Diablo 1 engine.

87
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,820
Simply import your Diablo assets

88
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,840
and enjoy the same old game with better performance,

89
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,240
modern resolutions, and first-class support for mods.

90
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,040
Is that Linux I see on the top right

91
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,880
of your screen, Wes?

92
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,720
Yeah, it is, buddy.

93
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,540
No way.

94
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,380
Yeah, it is.

95
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,040
They love the original Diablo.

96
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,360
In fact, they love it so much,

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,240
they say they're gonna spend their precious time

98
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,120
developing a free and open-source solution

99
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,440
for those that wanna play it on a modern computer.

100
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,960
I think-

101
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,780
I'm down with that.

102
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,760
Yeah, and they say it's legal.

103
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,660
They won't distribute any of the copyrighted game assets.

104
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,380
You have to have a copy of those assets to play.

105
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,000
But everything else around it, they're gonna open-source.

106
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,840
See, that's great.

107
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,420
That seems like a pretty clever way to do it.

108
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,840
Yeah, and they're working on multiplayer right now.

109
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,080
So, I am so excited.

110
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,920
I had not seen this.

111
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,740
Did you find this?

112
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,880
How did I find out about this?

113
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,720
Good job, Wes.

114
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,840
How did you find out about this?

115
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,680
Where'd you see this?

116
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,500
You know, I actually don't know,

117
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,080
but I had it sticking in one of my open tabs.

118
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,640
I was like, okay, this deserves to be in the show,

119
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,600
because I had left it for myself, obviously,

120
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,640
because I wanted to play it.

121
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,040
Yeah, when I saw that come across the link list,

122
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,800
I was like, yeah, yeah, we are freaking talking about that.

123
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,240
What better way to exercise your left mouse button, right?

124
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,340
That's true, that's true.

125
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,660
All right, well, we did it last week,

126
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,180
and the tradition continues this week.

127
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,200
We're gonna open up the show

128
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,160
with a little bit of breaking news here.

129
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,040
This is CNN Breaking News.

130
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,320
So, you've probably heard to death by now

131
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,960
about the dirty cow vulnerability in Linux,

132
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,640
the most serious Linux vulnerability quote ever.

133
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,800
Ours said that, a few others have said that.

134
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,360
Now it seems that Android phones

135
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,760
are getting rooted by this vulnerability.

136
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,720
This feels like this is where this matters.

137
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,160
Yeah, your router, your fridge, your IP camera.

138
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,760
But that's still pretty niche to the main consumer.

139
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,480
Yeah, so it looks like there's a new method

140
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,120
for rooting Android devices that's believed

141
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,760
to work reliably on every version

142
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,920
of the mobile operating system,

143
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,840
and of course, a wide array of the hardware.

144
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,800
Individuals can use it to bypass limitations

145
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,120
imposed by manufacturers or carriers,

146
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,080
but they can also use it to sneak apps in

147
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,040
for malicious purposes.

148
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
The technique comes courtesy

149
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,120
of the Linux privilege escalation bug

150
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,120
that we talked about on Linux Action Show called Dirty Cow.

151
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,040
And so, some people are calling the vulnerability,

152
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,160
or it goes back to kernels,

153
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,680
the vulnerability goes back to kernels since 2007,

154
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,480
which pretty much means every damn Android phone ever made.

155
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,320
Right.

156
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,040
And several independent security researchers

157
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,280
are doing proof of concepts right now.

158
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
Ours interviewed two of them.

159
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,400
David Manchouser told Ours that the proof of concept code

160
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,640
that exploits Dirty Cow on Android

161
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,040
gets devices close to root.

162
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,520
And with a few additional lines of code,

163
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,080
he can get persistent root access

164
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,560
on all five of Android devices he's tested.

165
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,920
A separate security researcher asked not to be identified

166
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,200
said that several other people

167
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,760
have developed separate root exploits

168
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
based on this Dirty Cow exploit.

169
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,440
They say we're using a rather unique route

170
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,280
that we believe we can use elsewhere in the future.

171
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,120
And because of that,

172
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,760
they don't want to tell Google about it.

173
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,600
Oh, of course, right?

174
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,720
Because they don't want Google shutting down the vulnerability.

175
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,000
So they're keeping it on their own.

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
This is bad, right?

177
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,000
This is an example of why

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,920
sure you can get your Fedora machine updated,

179
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,360
you can get your Ubuntu machine updated

180
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,400
and your Archbox updated.

181
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,240
But-

182
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,080
What are you gonna do about your Samsung phone?

183
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,840
Joe Smith walking around with an S6 or an S5 or an S3

184
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,040
or a Motorola X or whatever.

185
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,160
Yep.

186
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,400
Especially on one of our big name carriers here.

187
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,640
Oh!

188
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,920
She'd have to buy a new phone

189
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,680
once there's a phone that is patched, I guess.

190
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,520
Yeah.

191
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,360
And I don't know,

192
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,200
anybody in the mobile room

193
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,280
think we're worrying too much about this stuff?

194
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,080
Because personally, I feel like I can't overemphasize this.

195
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,120
I feel like I'm sitting here

196
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,600
yelling down from the mountain top.

197
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,120
You're walking around with vulnerabilities in your pocket

198
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,000
that could expose your personal data.

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,480
A disaster is coming.

200
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,680
A flood is coming.

201
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,840
That's something you've been thinking about

202
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,800
a lot personally, I think,

203
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,680
in the last year or so.

204
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,440
Am I overreacting?

205
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,280
Sometimes.

206
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,960
With the personal data thing,

207
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,880
I feel like Android does that pretty well

208
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,640
by just vaguely saying what an app will do with your data.

209
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,840
Yeah.

210
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,660
And they do have sandbox.

211
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,120
And only once.

212
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,960
And there is, I mean,

213
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,280
and ours does a good job of mentioning it.

214
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,360
You know, there is that double-edged sword

215
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,520
of some users will benefit.

216
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,000
I have already linked this article

217
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,680
to some of my friends who are on phones

218
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,480
that they've wanted to root but can't.

219
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,320
So there are benefits.

220
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,440
Yeah, I was thinking that too.

221
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,600
I do also worry about that.

222
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
I mean, realistically,

223
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,800
I don't know what other people are going to do,

224
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,020
but does it just further the bad press

225
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,080
about the Linux kernel?

226
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,120
Does it make other people less likely

227
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,400
to build a similar platform using that kernel?

228
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,560
It also makes me feel like all of those people,

229
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,980
like the black phone,

230
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,480
or everybody who's created these ultra-secure Android phones,

231
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,780
there's a dozen different models right now,

232
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,280
they're all bullshit.

233
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,120
Because they're all walking around

234
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,040
with this kernel vulnerability.

235
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,640
The only phone that's legitimately safe

236
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,280
is probably a Nexus that gets the patched in

237
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,320
or a Pixel phone.

238
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,160
Yeah, that's probably true.

239
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,760
Or one that's not Android.

240
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,680
And speaking of this,

241
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,560
I want to give you a little more details about Dirty Cow.

242
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,520
Also, quaintly known as CV 2016-51-95.

243
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,660
Rolls right off the tongue.

244
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,560
Dirty Cow, which naturally has its own logo

245
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,080
and webpage now, which is kind of actually a funny one.

246
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,920
It's a sign of our times.

247
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
It is kind of a good one, though.

248
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,000
They do a very good job of it, actually.

249
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,920
It's a race condition

250
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,200
in the kernel's memory management subsystem.

251
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,120
By timing things right,

252
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,220
a local attacker can exploit the copy-on-write mechanism

253
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,160
to turn a read-only mapping of a file

254
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
into a writable mapping.

255
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,920
And then with that,

256
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,000
a file that should not be written,

257
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,840
you could write to,

258
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,440
you could write to,

259
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,060
which means change certain parameters,

260
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,220
change the permissions,

261
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,060
change the ownership.

262
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,120
Secondly, I'm in the pseudoers.

263
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,840
Yeah, it doesn't take much integrate,

264
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,680
or I'm sorry,

265
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,360
it doesn't really probably take much imagination

266
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,360
to see how the ability to overwrite files

267
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,160
could be used to escalate privilege in a number of ways.

268
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,080
The known exploit depends on access

269
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,480
to slash proc, slash self, slash mem,

270
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,980
which is not universally available.

271
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,320
Even some systems that don't provide it at all

272
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
or access to it.

273
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,280
But there are still ways to exploit the bug, potentially.

274
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,800
The exploit happily bypasses

275
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,160
almost every hardening technique out there.

276
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,840
Strong sandboxing with mechanisms

277
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,120
like seccomp might slow it down,

278
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,120
but counting on that is probably not wise either.

279
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,060
This is an article at LWN.

280
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,320
The only real protection

281
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,900
is to upgrade a kernel containing the fix.

282
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,280
You have to upgrade with a kernel that has the fix.

283
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,000
The workarounds aren't even all that reliable.

284
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,800
So DirtyCow's a real son of a bitch.

285
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,280
And it's not the only one

286
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,120
that's being exploited on Android right now.

287
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,680
So there is also the rowhammer vulnerability,

288
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,520
which allows the attacker to bit flip over to root.

289
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,960
Researchers have devised an attack

290
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,480
that gains unfettered root access

291
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,120
to a large number of Android phones,

292
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,760
exploiting a relatively new type of bug

293
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,140
that allows adversaries to manipulate data

294
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,960
stored in the memory chips.

295
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,200
This is actually, I believe, a vulnerability

296
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,880
more at the CPU level than it is on the fricking OS level.

297
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
The break. Yeah, it's a hardware problem.

298
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,080
Yeah, the breakthrough has the potential

299
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,800
to make millions of Android phones vulnerable,

300
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,920
at least until the security fix is available,

301
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,840
to new form of attack that seizes control

302
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,000
of core parts of the operating system,

303
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,020
and neuters key security defenses.

304
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,960
Neuterism.

305
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,360
Equally important, it demonstrates

306
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,400
that the new class of exploit, dubbed rowhammer,

307
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,320
can have a malicious and far-reaching effect

308
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,420
on a much wider number of devices than previously known,

309
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,440
including those that are on ARM.

310
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,520
So this seems to be an issue so far

311
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,040
tested on the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, and the G4 from LG,

312
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,160
the Moto G models from 2013 and 2014,

313
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,280
made by Motorola, the Galaxy S4, the S5 from Samsung,

314
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,720
the One from OnePlus.

315
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,920
However, not in all cases the results are consistent.

316
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,840
Only 12 of the 15 Nexus model 5s that were tested

317
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,960
were successfully rooted,

318
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,960
and only one of the two Galaxy S5s were compromised.

319
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,880
So it's something to do with the chip,

320
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,080
and the researchers that are testing this

321
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,440
have made an app that you can sideload

322
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,400
to test to see if your CPU is vulnerable

323
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,900
so they can get a wider sample base.

324
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,600
Holy crap!

325
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,920
And this they did tell Google in July.

326
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,760
Well, that's good.

327
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
Yeah, they say they're vulnerable at Google,

328
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,140
so the vulnerability is critical,

329
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,860
which is their highest rating,

330
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,840
and have awarded the researchers four grand.

331
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,360
So Google thinks this is a legit issue.

332
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,200
I like that.

333
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,440
Until recently, we never even thought about hardware bugs,

334
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,480
and software was never written to deal with them,

335
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,820
and there is no quick software update to patch the problem

336
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,560
and go back to business as usual.

337
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,240
That's a shame.

338
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,840
I do wonder though, it's kind of making me think,

339
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,640
I feel like we don't see the same kind of press

340
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,760
about jailbreaking on the iOS side as we do about

341
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,600
getting into it. That's because

342
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,800
it's a superior system.

343
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,640
Ah.

344
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,800
Really, I mean, come on, let's just admit it.

345
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,980
I mean, yeah, you can have your fanboy position,

346
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,260
but you're right, you don't.

347
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,880
You don't have this problem on iOS,

348
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,560
and if you do have this problem, they patch faster,

349
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,840
and that's a frickin' reality of the market right now.

350
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,800
Maybe another vendor will hopefully do it better soon,

351
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,320
but this is not what Google is good at.

352
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,200
It's kind of the perfect example of why, you know,

353
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
they do have problems on iOS,

354
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,240
but they patch them, and you know.

355
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,220
My hope is the Pixel fixes this particular gap.

356
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,940
I really hope the Pixel fixes this

357
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,160
in a way that a lot of people have.

358
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,000
I just.

359
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,820
You ordered one, right?

360
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,660
Yep.

361
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,560
Yeah, see, I really hope, man,

362
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,120
maybe you'll be our canary, because this is bad.

363
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,840
And be honest, you know, the other thing

364
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,920
that really pisses me off is that comment that,

365
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,280
well, until recently, we never considered hardware

366
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,720
vulnerabilities and didn't design our operating system.

367
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,980
Bullshit!

368
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,880
What is data execution prevention?

369
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,520
Come on, give me this, come on.

370
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,840
Really, why did Apple design the secure enclave

371
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,400
so that it doesn't pass any information

372
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,160
to the underlying operating system or the ARM chipset?

373
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,080
There's a reason they designed it like that.

374
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,920
Of course we know of hardware vulnerabilities.

375
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,160
X86 is filled with them.

376
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,400
And surely ARM is as well.

377
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,040
So just say, well, we, you know, wow.

378
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,960
Well, especially when, no.

379
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,880
It's like, it's like, bullcrap.

380
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
And even this one has been, you know,

381
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,960
the row hammer's been around for a while now.

382
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,320
What do you think, Swift?

383
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,800
I honestly think that for the most part,

384
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,320
people can't afford the Pixel,

385
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,280
so it's asking a lot to expect them to get it.

386
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,560
They need this security for a cheaper phone.

387
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,280
Yeah, I definitely agree there.

388
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,680
What do you think, MiniMac, about the Pixel?

389
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,360
Yeah, I would hope that the Pixel

390
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,440
gets more than three years of support

391
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,680
because of just these kind of vulnerabilities.

392
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,480
I don't pay a thousand bucks for a phone

393
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
only for three years,

394
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,960
and then have these bucks coming on me

395
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,480
and I can change anything.

396
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,640
This is probably the number one bit of feedback we got

397
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,280
on last week's User Air where we talked about the Pixel,

398
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,400
and we talked about the update cycle,

399
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
and so many people wrote in and said,

400
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,240
man, everybody in my extended friends and family

401
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,640
that is not, oh yeah, we also covered this on TechSnap.

402
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,080
We got a bunch of emails on TechSnap.

403
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,140
So both shows, we got a lot of people writing and say,

404
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,760
I might update my devices more frequently,

405
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,900
or I can't update my devices more frequently,

406
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,600
but you know who never updates their devices

407
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
is all of my friends and family who aren't tech.

408
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,420
Exactly.

409
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,260
People that aren't into tech.

410
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,460
To them, an update is just an annoyance.

411
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,300
It might break things.

412
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,320
They update their phone when it breaks.

413
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,880
Or you go into the store and they update it for you,

414
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,680
or whatever.

415
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,280
Maybe when they all die off, that'll change,

416
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,360
but that seems to be the way people operate right now.

417
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,280
And so these have to be five-year devices.

418
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,680
How do we teach the next generation that updates are good,

419
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,280
that updates are something you should do?

420
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,320
They sure like buying things.

421
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,160
Yeah, right.

422
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,800
Maybe they already got it.

423
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,120
I think the other thing that really drives me crazy

424
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,120
about all of this is I don't accept the answer

425
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,820
that it's not possible to update these devices

426
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,400
for five years.

427
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,220
That's, tell that to the banks that are running,

428
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,360
or just Red Hat in general.

429
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,160
I mean, they're backboarding crazy.

430
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,880
Tell that to the servers that have been running

431
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,060
a Red Hat distro for seven or eight years.

432
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,780
Tell that to the banks that have mainframe

433
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,480
still getting support by IBM

434
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,600
that are in there for 30 years.

435
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,560
Yeah, but Chris, to be fair,

436
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,120
the people who are getting updates from Red Hat

437
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,600
are paying for them.

438
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,840
Once you've gone through the retail experience

439
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,360
and you've walked out with a phone,

440
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
you give zero money to HTC or Samsung.

441
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,760
It all goes to Google.

442
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,600
I would say that,

443
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,380
but it's Google's responsibility to do the updates,

444
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,220
not HTC.

445
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,960
There's also no option for me to pay anyone

446
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,240
to do that if I wanted to.

447
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,060
I guess I...

448
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,540
Except for those maybe value-add people.

449
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,660
I don't see how this isn't just a technology problem.

450
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,360
This seems like it actually, this doesn't,

451
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,600
I guess here's what I mean,

452
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
is to me, Poppy,

453
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,920
this doesn't seem like a technology problem at all.

454
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,720
They technically could update the software

455
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,200
for as long as they want.

456
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,300
I think technologically possible,

457
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,820
they simply don't have the will

458
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,600
from a corporate standpoint.

459
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,160
No, I'm not suggesting it's not a technical issue.

460
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,040
It's a purely financial one.

461
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,680
Nobody's paying them to do it.

462
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,560
And it's probably also easier for them to,

463
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,400
otherwise you have to do things separately

464
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,280
and so they can roll their features.

465
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,280
Android 2 and devices never getting updates to...

466
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,240
This has been the same for years and years and years

467
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,800
that devices wouldn't get updates

468
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,560
and it slowly got better,

469
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,600
but it's always been the case that

470
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,480
if you don't pay for someone to actually do the hardware

471
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,760
enablement and do the back porting,

472
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,440
then that, I mean,

473
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,840
you're not getting any revenue from those customers.

474
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,900
They've walked out the door, right?

475
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,000
You're getting revenue from people

476
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,180
who are buying the Pixel phones

477
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,080
or the next phone or the next phone.

478
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,680
You're getting nothing from those people

479
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,880
who walked out the door three years ago.

480
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,320
Really though?

481
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,540
Google's not making any money off of Android users

482
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,380
besides the hardware.

483
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,220
So I'm not, I don't agree.

484
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,280
HTC and Samsung and all the others are.

485
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,480
Well, that's their, then they made a mistake

486
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,360
shipping Android because that's a separate argument.

487
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,720
That's a totally separate issue.

488
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,600
The fact that they can't make money off of Android.

489
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,800
Well, they've done pretty well off it.

490
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,520
I'm not saying they're not making money off of it.

491
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,760
I'm saying they're making money off,

492
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,680
they're making continual forward revenue

493
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,160
off the new devices they're being sold.

494
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,520
They're not making any money off the ones

495
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,780
that have already been shipped out.

496
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,560
You know, Toby, I understand

497
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,880
that they're not making money off of it.

498
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,820
I think this is Google's responsibility.

499
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,480
Just like Canonical can now live patch

500
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,560
the running Ubuntu 16.04 kernels

501
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,200
of servers all over the world.

502
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,240
I don't see why Google couldn't live patch Android handsets.

503
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,880
Why, the technology is there.

504
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,160
It's a possibility.

505
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,740
They just simply don't have the will

506
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,280
or the corporate contracts

507
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,160
or the bureaucratic structure to enable it,

508
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,000
but yet they still have the nuts

509
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
to sell these devices to consumers

510
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,560
and literally put their personal lives at risk.

511
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,280
It seems like a total disconnect to me.

512
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,640
Right, and I agree with you.

513
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,960
You know, I go to a store,

514
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,520
if you went to a Verizon store and bought a device,

515
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,200
my contract is with Verizon.

516
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,120
That's who I made the retail purchase with.

517
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,960
I understand, right.

518
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,720
If Google reached into my phone

519
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,040
and flipped some bits on my phone,

520
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,360
I would be pretty angry as Verizon

521
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,560
that Google are reaching into devices

522
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
and screwing this up.

523
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,760
I think that is an old argument.

524
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,640
The carriers have to test the devices

525
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,280
to make sure they work on the network,

526
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,940
but yet there are hundreds of millions of iPhones

527
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,600
receiving updates directly from Apple,

528
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,080
and there are tens of millions of Android devices

529
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,020
running CyanogenMod, and the carriers don't have any.

530
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,640
How many hardware, how many different hardware devices

531
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,440
are there that Apple support, like right now?

532
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,520
Not that many.

533
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,880
Look at how many different devices there are

534
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,360
that even one manufacturer, Samsung, has.

535
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,480
Look at the range of devices that one manufacturer has.

536
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,360
It's a completely different ball game,

537
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,020
Android devices than Apple devices.

538
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,020
That is true.

539
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,880
Although I wonder if something like that

540
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,560
could be fixed with like an SLA type agreement

541
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,600
between Google and Verizon.

542
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,460
You know, if they do cause Verizon real problems,

543
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,200
support calls increase by a certain amount

544
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,140
on these supported phones with upgrades.

545
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,980
You could have business arrangements around that.

546
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,240
All right, well I wanna give other people a chance

547
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,960
to jump in and kind of push back a bit too,

548
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,280
cause I know people have been tagging me.

549
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,920
Mosinrath, you had a comment about shipping Android,

550
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,320
about going with Android and not making any money.

551
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,920
Go ahead.

552
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,320
Yeah, just like a lot of people have been saying in there,

553
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,780
such as Demerit, and I believe Sweet Lou has also

554
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:28,160
made the point, you're gonna wanna get to him on it as well.

555
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,500
Swift 110 also made a statement about that.

556
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,680
You gotta take a look at, with Apple, as you see,

557
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,880
they have the enclosed garden set up,

558
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,240
so they're making money off of the software,

559
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,280
the hardware, you even thinking about it,

560
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,360
they're making money off of it.

561
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,400
The fact that you even used the word Apple,

562
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,240
yes, somehow they were in your pocket already.

563
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,140
But with say Samsung and HTC and all those other companies,

564
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,480
they ship the product, you're buying the hardware from them,

565
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,120
and as was stated, I believe it was by Popeye

566
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,960
a couple moments ago, that's it for them.

567
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,640
Yeah, well is that fair though,

568
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,840
because Samsung's charging $800 for a Note 7,

569
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,400
the Pixel, if you want a decent one, is $750,

570
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,280
the 6P is an expensive device,

571
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,480
they seem to be making a shit ton of money,

572
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,600
the device hardware costs as much, if not more,

573
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,640
in the case of Samsung, as an iPhone.

574
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,120
Yeah, but as a lot of people have stated,

575
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,440
they make the money off of you once, that's it.

576
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,920
That's the only cash they get from you,

577
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,000
so of course they're gonna try to get as much as possible

578
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,240
in order to develop the next product.

579
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,920
After that, they don't get any more money from you.

580
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,480
Well, Samsung doesn't, but Google,

581
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,800
Google's constantly monetizing the Android platform.

582
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,640
That's why they made it.

583
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,560
Yes, but that's Google that's monetizing the platform.

584
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,880
I think that's who should be developing the updates too.

585
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,300
But Google can't develop the updates,

586
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,240
because there's no cooperation between them

587
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
and the hardware manufacturers,

588
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
because the hardware manufacturers

589
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,640
keep the source to themselves.

590
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,480
That's why.

591
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,180
Well, that's not always,

592
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,900
it actually works the other way.

593
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,960
Google hold back Android updates

594
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,080
from handset manufacturers as well.

595
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,360
So Google will hold back the latest version of Android,

596
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,320
so they can ship it on their own devices

597
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,800
before it goes out to Samsung, HTC,

598
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,440
even the tier one handset manufacturers

599
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,960
don't get it as fast as Google get it themselves.

600
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,520
This is why the Pixel's a thing now.

601
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,340
I mean-

602
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,720
The only one with that Google Smart Assistant, guys.

603
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,120
Sorry, it just cracks me up.

604
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,160
Yeah, the only way to get it.

605
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,200
But I think it just tells you,

606
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,240
it just shows you that even Google themselves

607
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,760
recognize this is a core issue.

608
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,640
This disconnect between the carriers,

609
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,240
the handset manufacturers and Google.

610
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,440
It is not a great ecosystem.

611
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,120
Yeah, it is not a great ecosystem.

612
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,960
And everybody's paying patent fees

613
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,920
to Microsoft that gets in it.

614
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,500
Everybody's getting screwed at all ends,

615
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,400
and Google's the only one making money.

616
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,240
Samsung was, but.

617
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,800
All right, so does anybody else,

618
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,640
tag me again in the moment

619
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
if anybody else wants to jump in before we move on.

620
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,440
I think what I feel is I understand,

621
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,400
I understand how the business relationships

622
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,240
are structured today.

623
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,320
I understand how the source code

624
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,280
dumps over the fence work from Google.

625
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,920
I understand how monetization works of these devices

626
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,280
and how they make their money,

627
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,400
and how the carriers wanna add their layer on top of it.

628
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,780
I get all of that, and I ask you,

629
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,760
if you were an alien traveling from Mars

630
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,520
and you arrived here and you looked at the situation,

631
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,480
would you not think this is a dumb arrangement?

632
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,720
And say, well, the only thing that makes it this way

633
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,080
is the artificial constructs

634
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,440
that you hairless monkeys have set up to do this.

635
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,080
And if you just simply did it differently,

636
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,920
it would be better.

637
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,160
And it would literally be better for consumers.

638
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,400
It would protect their privacy better.

639
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,360
Mr. Swift, go ahead.

640
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,840
The fact that they don't protect people's privacy

641
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,600
is something that's gonna become a larger issue over time.

642
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,120
And I mean, if you just have an affordable way

643
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,960
to protect people and show that you respect them,

644
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,000
I think you'll make more over the long term

645
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,680
versus trying to grab, grab, grab in the short term

646
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,000
and charge all this money,

647
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,280
but you're not providing them

648
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,160
with the kind of comfort that they deserve.

649
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,560
Right, like you might need that to change the market.

650
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,040
Yeah, they're in their walled garden

651
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,000
and they feel safe and secure there.

652
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,720
If you can offer the same thing in the free software

653
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,320
or with regards to the phones,

654
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,000
then you'll be in a much better spot.

655
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah, and in fact,

656
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,480
WW, that's kind of what you're thinking, right?

657
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,720
I mean, geez, don't we hope that this is where free software

658
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
could really help us?

659
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,040
Yeah, because if you think about it,

660
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,440
console game developers, to put it,

661
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,520
to situate it kind of like that,

662
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,640
when you see an update on that, it's paid for.

663
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,440
The software development is paid for

664
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,560
and they pay for the actual update process

665
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,840
to get it on that hardware

666
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,560
and to be tested on that hardware

667
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,840
and whatever licensing fees.

668
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,320
And that kind of sucks.

669
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Where on PC you can do whatever.

670
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,800
So I'm really hoping that with Ubuntu phone,

671
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,280
and maybe Poppy or would be good answer,

672
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,120
that's that, or maybe Poppy,

673
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,600
that would it be open?

674
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,200
So like, if you're a developer, you can solve these issues,

675
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,640
you can contribute to Ubuntu phone OS

676
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,560
and make it better without having to wait

677
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,400
and all that stuff.

678
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,280
Because as I see it now,

679
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,720
the only way this will be ever solved

680
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,520
is having an open system

681
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,320
where things could be more rapidly patched out.

682
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,600
Right, WW, when we were talking about,

683
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,080
well, it doesn't make HTC any money

684
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,920
to update these devices, in the back of my head,

685
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,760
I'm thinking, that's never been an issue

686
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,960
for Linux development.

687
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,840
No, you're right, it hasn't.

688
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,120
We've developed and people have put in their-

689
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,840
It's like the community can solve this problem.

690
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,760
And that would be Ubuntu phones advantage, right?

691
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,600
Yeah, maybe.

692
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,960
May I add something in here?

693
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,560
Yeah.

694
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,400
So what I know is that manufacturers like Qualcomm

695
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,680
and others, they only build devices for the Android platform.

696
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,680
So the device is not open, they ship their own drivers.

697
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,600
So you can't just build a Linux infrastructure

698
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,720
and put Ubuntu phone on it.

699
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,040
That's why Ubuntu phone and Sailfish is based on Android

700
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,760
because all these phones only run Android.

701
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,920
So it's not as easy as WW thinks.

702
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,120
Okay, fair point.

703
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,640
Yeah, I have noticed that.

704
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,240
And that is probably a fair point.

705
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,600
With the Linux development point you just made,

706
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,040
the difference with Linux is

707
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
the people who are doing these patches

708
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,760
are working for companies that want the code

709
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,880
because it helps them.

710
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,720
With Android, it's just being done by the companies

711
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,760
to help support the device

712
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,720
and then they'll gain money after that.

713
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,560
So I guess we need Google with its deep pockets

714
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,960
to step up and incentivize these carriers

715
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,480
or when hardware manufacturers to consent to updates.

716
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,520
Or as a market, the Pixel phone needs to be successful enough

717
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,680
that it forces the market to react.

718
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
And that might be what happens.

719
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,840
Or we just keep having these horrible problems

720
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,480
and enough that the platform is at risk.

721
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,160
Yeah, and like Sweetloo points out too,

722
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,080
not everybody can afford these latest and greatest phones

723
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,480
which also puts them at security risk.

724
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,800
I wanna address that in just a second.

725
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,920
But before I forget, I wanted to mention

726
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,800
that I got a note from the developer

727
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,360
of the tool we talked about last week

728
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,560
called the Magic Device Tool.

729
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,400
Oh, really?

730
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,000
That allows you to install Ubuntu or Cyanogen

731
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,840
or Phoenix OS or Android on your device.

732
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,800
And I made the mistake,

733
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,480
because I think I misread this,

734
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,360
yeah, I misread this article.

735
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,640
He actually does support the Google Apps.

736
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,000
He's like, hey, thanks for the coverage,

737
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
but by the way, we do support the Google Apps.

738
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,240
Hey, even better.

739
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,080
Yeah.

740
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,920
That's great.

741
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,440
Thank you for writing this to tell us.

742
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,280
Yeah, it was really nice.

743
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,480
And so what a cool tool.

744
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,000
And it's called, again, it's called the Magic Device Tool.

745
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,040
And it allows you to deploy

746
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,120
the latest Ubuntu Touch release, Cyanogen mod,

747
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,720
with or without the Google Apps,

748
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,840
and the factory Android app image, like a backup,

749
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,040
including Phoenix OS on the BQ line of devices,

750
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,080
pretty much all of them that matter,

751
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,440
including the tablets, the Nexus 5, the Nexus 7 2013.

752
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,940
Yeah, which is, a lot of us have that one

753
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,080
with nothing to do with it.

754
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,000
Also the 2012 Nexus 7, Samsung Nexus 10,

755
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,400
which is a great tablet, and the OnePlus One,

756
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,720
and the Fairphone 2 are all supported

757
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,280
by the Magic Device Tool.

758
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,080
So it's also just a nice way to create backups

759
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
to restore your device.

760
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,520
And it's nice that Ubuntu Touch is a top-supported option.

761
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,440
So basically, I bring this up

762
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,240
because if this is something that you've been chewing on,

763
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,480
because it's something I've been thinking about,

764
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,040
like Wes mentioned for a while,

765
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,240
I kind of feel like this is at least,

766
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,640
my boat is now on the beachhead and I have options.

767
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,960
And once the 6P is added to that list, if it ever is,

768
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,400
that'll be the day.

769
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,240
The day, yeah.

770
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Yep.

771
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,400
I really, I'm really hoping I could.

772
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,240
That'd be a great device for it.

773
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,440
Oh my God, if I could ever, ever run Ubuntu Touch

774
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,240
on the 6P, I would be so happy.

775
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,080
Because I mean, I am willing maybe one day

776
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,960
to just get like an MX Pro type device.

777
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,760
Oh man, I would love it on the 6P.

778
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,200
Because I don't mind the 6P hardware.

779
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,840
It's a little big, a little heavy, but the core is nice.

780
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,200
Great screen, great battery.

781
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,440
And if you hold it real still, it takes a good picture.

782
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,360
So that may be something that happens.

783
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,040
And the Nexus devices you can pick up for super cheap too

784
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,440
if you want to play with Ubuntu Touch.

785
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,640
You know, there is another component

786
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,840
that is sort of something we have to attack from both ends.

787
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,520
And that's the carrier side of this.

788
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,040
Because they're a bunch of bastards

789
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,280
in this entire thing too.

790
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,440
So let's take a moment and mention our sponsor,

791
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,920
which is a carrier that does this differently

792
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,960
and does it right.

793
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,400
Go to linux.ting.com.

794
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,880
They don't get in the way of your updates.

795
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,120
They don't have like a ting experience

796
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,360
that they have to develop and integrate into the image.

797
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,720
They don't put their bloatware on their apps

798
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,840
because they don't have any bloatware.

799
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,880
They don't like prevent you from updating

800
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,440
over the wireless if you want.

801
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,640
Like this just simple wireless.

802
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,920
You pay for what you use, minutes, messages, and megabytes.

803
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,720
You pay for each for what you use.

804
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,800
So if you don't text a lot, you don't pay for any texting.

805
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,360
If you don't call a lot, you don't pay for any calls.

806
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,840
If you don't use a lot of data, you don't pay for data.

807
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,040
When you use it, you do pay and it all averages out.

808
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,200
You go to linux.ting.com to get $25 off your first device

809
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,640
or $25 in service credit if you bring a device,

810
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,200
which will pay for more than your first month likely

811
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,440
if you average it out.

812
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,560
This is something that's really nice

813
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,880
because there's no contracts.

814
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,600
There's no early termination fee.

815
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,160
The devices are unlocked.

816
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,680
They're not locked to Ting.

817
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,080
You can move them around if you want,

818
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,520
which makes it really nice to bring devices to.

819
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,120
When you do need help, you just talk to a person,

820
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,760
not a phone tree, but a person.

821
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,640
You don't have to press zero like seven times.

822
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,680
You don't hit mash it, ma'am, ma'am, yeah.

823
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,240
And they have CDMA and GSM,

824
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,680
which I know outside the US,

825
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,280
that's not very common to use CDMA,

826
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,080
but in the States with at least-

827
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,920
We just love it.

828
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,760
Well, especially on the West where you have,

829
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,000
we have the Rockies, there's a ton of trees.

830
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,520
CDMA has some serious advantages.

831
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,640
And you know, GSM has been absolutely rock solid

832
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,240
for me as well, so it's really nice to have both options.

833
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,800
So you can get a little bit of a taste of it

834
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,200
by going to linux.ting.com.

835
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,540
And then speaking, addressing Sweet Lou's point,

836
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,480
speaking of flagship-type devices

837
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,220
that aren't super expensive,

838
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,080
yesterday Ting just put up a blog post

839
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,240
about five inexpensive smartphones

840
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,400
with flagship performance.

841
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,840
It was brilliant.

842
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,040
So you can go get an unlocked phone

843
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,720
with great performance, with no contract,

844
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,760
$6 for the line, and you pay for what you use.

845
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,200
And you can read the blog by going to linux.ting.com

846
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,000
and then click on their blog link.

847
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,520
I think this is kind of, it's just a sort of end,

848
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,240
bookend our conversation.

849
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,720
This is a huge part of that entire formula.

850
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,100
Yes, it is.

851
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,400
Yeah, I really, if I could give you,

852
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,260
if you could afford it,

853
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,920
and I could give you one recommendation

854
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,040
about how to be secure with your mobile device,

855
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,120
get a device from the Play Store

856
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,360
and put it on the Ting network.

857
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,120
Yep, it's expensive, but you're right,

858
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,720
like that's probably the best option.

859
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,120
You can go this route too, you know,

860
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,700
and if these devices are getting updated

861
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,600
by their manufacturers, Ting will not interfere with that.

862
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,400
And so go read the devices they've listed here

863
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,680
because the prices are like under 300 bucks,

864
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,020
except for the OnePlus 3.

865
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,240
But you know, there's really some serious options

866
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,440
like the Huawei, is that how you say it?

867
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,280
Hawaii?

868
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,360
Huawei, the Honor 5X, 199.

869
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,560
The 5X, the 5X, still a great phone.

870
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,600
I mean, it would be a big upgrade

871
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,440
for what this has got right now.

872
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,520
Yes, it would.

873
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,160
In fact, you know what I love about Ting,

874
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,080
this is from their blog right here.

875
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,000
Here at Ting, we don't want to pressure you

876
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,080
to buy a phone from the Ting shop.

877
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,200
There's lots of special deals online

878
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,400
and we recommend that you take a look around.

879
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,440
Just by waiting a few months

880
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,640
and doing a bit of online research,

881
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,140
you can get all the smartphone you need

882
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,700
at a much smarter price.

883
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,080
That is so plainly written

884
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,360
and it is so refreshing to hear that

885
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,280
from a mobile phone carrier.

886
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,240
They're not trying to create a giant vertical monopoly.

887
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,460
They just want you to use their service

888
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,520
because it's good.

889
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,160
They give you the couple of tips you need

890
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,360
to go do a little searching.

891
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
They link you to the Ting compatibility checker

892
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,880
to make it even easier.

893
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,320
They say over 80% of the phones made

894
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,840
in the last few years are compatible with Ting.

895
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,680
Wow.

896
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,500
There you go.

897
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,840
I think this is such a refreshing take on this.

898
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,780
So get started by going to linux.ting.com.

899
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,620
That gives you the discount,

900
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,500
but also lets them know you heard about it right here

901
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,880
on the unplugged program.

902
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,260
And right there in the middle, what would you save?

903
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,160
Just experiment with that.

904
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,000
That's fun.

905
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,520
And consider like if you made a couple of changes,

906
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,160
say you marked your music to play offline

907
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,560
and you download your podcast over Wi-Fi,

908
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,360
how much data would you use when you're commuting

909
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,200
if you did that?

910
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,680
And if you switched to Ting

911
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,840
and you made those two adjustments,

912
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,440
how much could you save?

913
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,280
Check it out.

914
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,320
Go to linux.ting.com and a big thanks to Ting

915
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,520
for sponsoring the unplugged program.

916
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,520
So Wes, there was this post about the X, Z,

917
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,120
is that how you say it?

918
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,960
Yeah, X, Z.

919
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,520
X, Z is the X, Z form.

920
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,360
It's only two letters.

921
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,640
It seems like we could say them.

922
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,120
I know, but I don't know if it's Z or X, Z.

923
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,960
I actually don't know.

924
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
I think I always say X, Z, but I'm probably wrong.

925
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,000
Yeah, well, it doesn't really matter

926
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,840
because there's a post over at nonganoo.org that says,

927
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,040
so we can't just let that go by, right?

928
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,400
It's nonganoo.org, nonganoo.org.

929
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,800
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

930
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,640
They say that the X, Z format is inadequate

931
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,320
for long-term archiving.

932
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,040
I think this entire post is bullshit,

933
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,760
but I was kind of curious what you thought about it

934
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,120
because you were the one that found this link.

935
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,800
And then I wanted to kind of roll this into

936
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,120
a slightly larger conversation with our mumble room

937
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,440
about what they do for their long-term data archival needs

938
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,200
because, and I know a couple of them in there are parents,

939
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,320
couple of them in there probably have keepsakes

940
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,240
that they want to have forever, videos, things like that.

941
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,880
The idea of like, before, I feel like a lot of people

942
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,720
had kind of discovered, right?

943
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
You had like pictures that you found in your garage

944
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,360
or your parents' attic or something.

945
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,920
You're like, oh, I have these from when I was a kid,

946
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,520
but if it's on a hard drive,

947
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,200
that is not the same in the digital age.

948
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,720
God, that is such a good analogy.

949
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,600
So I have photo albums from my childhood

950
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,440
that my mom gave me.

951
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,280
She's like, here, these are yours to hang onto now.

952
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,400
And once every 15 years or whatever,

953
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,040
I've opened them up and I'm like, holy crap,

954
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,640
remember when we had chickens?

955
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,200
Remember when we cut a hole in the side of the house

956
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,020
and put a window in?

957
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,860
That's so neat.

958
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,160
I'll look through it and I'm like, this is really great.

959
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,800
And maybe one day my kids,

960
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,880
like I've gone through my dad's photo album

961
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,960
and I found that to be fascinating.

962
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,120
Wow, look at my dad as a kid.

963
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,960
He looks like a kid.

964
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,800
Totally.

965
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,640
My dad's just a kid.

966
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,460
Those are good memories, right?

967
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,300
You get to experience that.

968
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,440
Nothing like that.

969
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,200
There's no book my kids are gonna go grab of them

970
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,880
because it's all on a hard drive.

971
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,480
Or it's in some cloud account

972
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,320
they don't have access to.

973
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,480
And I'm gonna be honest with you,

974
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,200
this is one of the reasons I sacrifice

975
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,800
every sacred freedom and privacy aspect I have

976
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,760
by uploading all my photos to Google Photo

977
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,000
because I'm just desperate to have

978
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,480
some sort of long-term archival

979
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,420
so that way when my kids are 15,

980
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,960
I can look at them when they were four and five

981
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,520
and remember what that was like.

982
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,000
I don't wanna not have that.

983
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,440
So I keep trying to think, well, how can I do this

984
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,680
where I control the data, I have a good archival system,

985
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,600
and it is, I guess I want the digital equivalent

986
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,000
of a photo album or other things like it.

987
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,120
And I'm kinda curious what your thoughts were

988
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,020
before we get to that.

989
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,860
Yes.

990
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,600
What are your thoughts about this particular article

991
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,000
about how the XZ format's a bastard

992
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,200
and shouldn't be used because of checksums?

993
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,520
Well, one, I think the Savannah, the non-GNU website,

994
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,800
they support free software.

995
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,200
I don't know their long history,

996
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,880
but I know they support free software,

997
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,280
but they're not associated

998
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,440
with the Free Software Foundation,

999
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,160
which as we've discussed on the show,

1000
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,280
you can love them or hate them,

1001
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,920
but they definitely have an ideology.

1002
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,920
Zombies don't run Linux.

1003
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,460
Exactly.

1004
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,120
So this is, fair disclosure,

1005
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,880
this is written by the author of the LZIP tool,

1006
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,920
which is kind of a competing tool to XZ.

1007
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,400
They both use the LZMA compression algorithm,

1008
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,540
which let's see, that's a fun one.

1009
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,860
What is it?

1010
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,700
Oh, LZ.

1011
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,720
ZIV Markov Chain Algorithm.

1012
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,920
LZ is great because it's not the best compression ever,

1013
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,160
but it's great speed, works great on a file system level.

1014
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,400
I've used it in combination with ButterFS in the past.

1015
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,720
Sure, yeah, yeah.

1016
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,920
And so this XZ also implements that.

1017
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,240
That's what it uses to compress files inside,

1018
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,360
but it also implements its own container format.

1019
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,400
And so this blog post,

1020
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,360
there are some things where I think

1021
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,800
that for the majority of use cases,

1022
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,040
it doesn't really matter.

1023
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,600
One big thing I think that did kind of ring true

1024
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,280
is they talk about how it doesn't support garbage data

1025
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,800
after the end of the file, that sort of thing,

1026
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,000
where I think if you were gonna do things

1027
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,280
with tape style backups, that sort of stuff,

1028
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,840
there may be some validity.

1029
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,060
I think there are also some things

1030
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,840
that generally ring true

1031
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,760
and are good design principles here

1032
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,160
about you want to keep things simple,

1033
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,600
you can over-engineer things.

1034
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,040
There are some plausible arguments here

1035
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,080
about how XZ may be over-engineered,

1036
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,720
especially for the most common use cases.

1037
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,040
Here's why I feel like the argument

1038
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,880
that using XZ for backup in archival is bad.

1039
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,100
The reason why it's bogus, he hangs his hat

1040
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,440
on things like checksums and whatnot not being built in,

1041
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,360
but there are so many other tools

1042
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,440
that if you just use the Unix philosophy,

1043
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,760
if you use SHA256SUM and PAR2,

1044
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,160
there's ways you can do this

1045
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,980
and supplement the deficiencies of XZ

1046
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,160
that are just built-in tool chains on the Linux system.

1047
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,880
Right, I think that's exactly.

1048
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,440
But I wonder, does anybody in the Mamba room,

1049
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,760
so InagoGo, Mr. GoGo, you just made a great point.

1050
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,280
You said, in fact, speaking of you, your thing is next,

1051
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,040
but Mr. GoGo, you had a, I forget what it was,

1052
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,200
but you combine TarSnap with something else

1053
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
and that this is your solution?

1054
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,840
Well, I don't use it though.

1055
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,760
I guess forward being an interesting way of doing it.

1056
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,800
Using a free NAS to do ZFS stuff

1057
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,000
and then doing, putting some of the stuff

1058
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
you want to keep onto TarSnap

1059
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,840
and then also having a photo album

1060
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,040
just in case any of those two fail.

1061
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,120
But that's not, yeah, that is a great way

1062
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,720
to protect the data.

1063
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,560
But I don't feel like it,

1064
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,040
it doesn't have that accessibility that I'm looking for

1065
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,160
that a generation from now,

1066
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,360
when I'm not there to tell them how to get access to it,

1067
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,680
I'm not there to provide them the login,

1068
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,960
but I want them to have access to it.

1069
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,100
That's what the physical photo album for.

1070
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,940
Print them out.

1071
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,760
Mosinrath, what do you think?

1072
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,720
Is there a digital way to do this with like, this?

1073
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,120
Probably not.

1074
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,400
Like we've been discussing it in the chat room here

1075
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,880
in terms of like how long things will last and all that.

1076
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,040
But as you can see by my last comment

1077
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,320
and what other people have said,

1078
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,780
it's like, I dare you to try to use your free NAS

1079
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,440
when there's a power outage.

1080
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,280
Go ahead.

1081
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,200
Let's see you do it.

1082
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,300
You can't.

1083
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,500
And therefore that physical media,

1084
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,440
even though it is going to fade,

1085
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,560
no matter what it is that you do,

1086
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,240
is still the best one.

1087
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,120
Like I got a pile of pictures and a couple of photo albums.

1088
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm looking at them right now, right?

1089
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,800
I don't have those in any kind of digitized format.

1090
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,400
I had them at one point in time, scanned them all,

1091
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,360
lost them all because I formatted the wrong disk.

1092
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,200
Oh, wait a second.

1093
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,760
You could do that just about anywhere,

1094
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
any place, any time, couldn't you?

1095
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,640
Because there's no such thing as a setup,

1096
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,920
as far as I know,

1097
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,320
that if you can access it to put stuff in,

1098
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,400
that you cannot access it and wipe things out.

1099
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,440
Right, and something that you know

1100
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,960
they're going to have access to generations later.

1101
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,240
A kind of like TechMav's solution is create a dead man switch.

1102
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,960
So maybe once you stop punching the button every few years,

1103
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,280
it automatically delivers the login credentials

1104
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,640
and a URL to your kids.

1105
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,400
Yeah, that would be pretty neat.

1106
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,240
You know what?

1107
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
Let's punt this to the listeners

1108
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,760
that are listening after the fact,

1109
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,680
and let us know.

1110
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,000
Comment wherever you're catching this

1111
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,260
or wherever you prefer to comment or email or tweet,

1112
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,560
and let me know what you would do for this.

1113
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,120
And I obviously want it to be Linux based.

1114
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,640
Right, I mean, open source, right?

1115
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,800
I mean, you need things that you can,

1116
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
if you need to do something 20 years,

1117
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,000
100 years from now that you can.

1118
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,880
Really, seriously?

1119
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,120
Yeah, that's a key thing.

1120
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,440
Because that way you could send the code along with the files.

1121
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,520
So Mr. Gogo, was it in the post-show last week

1122
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,120
that I was talking about how I'd love to have analog meters

1123
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,040
to represent my CPU usage?

1124
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,320
I think it was in the pre-show.

1125
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,740
Pre-show, okay.

1126
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,400
So after talking about it on the unplugged program,

1127
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,800
Mr. Inagogo submitted this to the subreddit,

1128
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,120
a video where he's connected a VU,

1129
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,960
or I think it's a voltage meter, I think,

1130
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,080
connected over USB to his laptop.

1131
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,080
And you can see he's got Gnome system monitor running here,

1132
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,040
and the CPU load that's in Gnome system monitor

1133
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,160
is translated to this volt meter's analog dial.

1134
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,400
Have I described this correctly so far?

1135
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,240
Kind of.

1136
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,080
Okay.

1137
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,960
The Gnome system monitor was just me demonstrating

1138
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,680
that it's quite accurate to where it's pointing.

1139
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,720
Sure.

1140
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,840
But there's an Arduino sitting between the laptop

1141
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,840
and the volt meter, which is having data sent

1142
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,160
from the laptop by a Python script,

1143
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,560
which then turns that into a PWM signal

1144
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,260
that changes where the needle is.

1145
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
WW says it needs more Nixie tubes.

1146
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,960
This is pretty awesome, though.

1147
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,760
I'll be honest with you, when I saw this,

1148
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,040
the first thing I thought to myself was,

1149
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,440
God, I'd love to have some bigger versions

1150
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,000
of these mounted on the wall by the main broadcast machines,

1151
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,880
the OBS machine and the Wirecast machine,

1152
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,240
and be able to have these analog dials.

1153
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,040
So I knew how hard these systems were working.

1154
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,200
I would love to have these as props in the studio

1155
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,600
and also actual useful readouts.

1156
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,880
How long did it take you to do this?

1157
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,520
A day, after getting the VU meter.

1158
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,840
Ha ha ha!

1159
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,720
That is so cool.

1160
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,440
And then you put the code up on GitHub to do it

1161
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,960
so other people can play, too.

1162
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,060
See, the other thing this makes me think of

1163
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,140
is like cloud stuff.

1164
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,120
Like what if you got your dropout

1165
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,720
that's running the server for your people?

1166
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,960
You want to see like any random metric

1167
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,880
that you just kind of want.

1168
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,720
Is that a thing?

1169
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,920
Could you do that?

1170
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,440
I mean, if you can make a time series data,

1171
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,600
I don't see why not.

1172
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,440
So you could have like your fricking droplet CPU load

1173
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,920
represented with a V with a little...

1174
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,980
I mean, there'd be a lot more intermediate steps,

1175
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,820
of course, but...

1176
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,660
That is so cool, Wes.

1177
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,120
Man, as the sysadmin in me wants that for all the things.

1178
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,560
Or like load average over the fleet.

1179
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,560
Like, wouldn't it be great for like the different SATCOMs

1180
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,000
to know how hard the different SATCOMs

1181
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,240
are working right now for us?

1182
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,400
Or what's your, yeah, throughput on your bandwidth?

1183
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,640
What's the, yeah.

1184
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,240
Oh, you could do, oh, you could, oh, oh, man.

1185
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,880
It's Delta Flyer B2.

1186
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,080
So here's what we need.

1187
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,080
Now let's, I need Mr. Gogo and others.

1188
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,720
I need you to come to the JB1 studio

1189
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,840
and we need to spend two days out here.

1190
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,700
I'll film the whole thing.

1191
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,080
You guys build these things

1192
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,440
and we'll make an episode out of it.

1193
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,280
We need to do this.

1194
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,240
That sounds amazing.

1195
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,280
I think that is so awesome.

1196
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,900
That is, gosh, that's cool.

1197
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,840
All right, well, we gotta keep moving

1198
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,680
because this is the longest episode ever.

1199
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,160
This is a big show, yeah, right?

1200
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,760
So I wanted to give a chance to chat with Mr. Popey

1201
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,440
and I wanted to take a chance to chat with Mr. Wimpy

1202
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,920
about a recent event they went to

1203
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,340
and it's not too uncommon, I think,

1204
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,920
but maybe just to recap, we could kind of set the stage.

1205
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,120
Here, there's these events that Canonical holds

1206
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,880
from time to time where they bring their team

1207
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,120
or different members together

1208
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,520
and they focus on a few things

1209
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,240
and they say, let's really focus on development

1210
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,160
in this area right now.

1211
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,720
We have a distributed team all over the world

1212
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,040
and we're gonna leverage having all of them in one space

1213
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,320
for a short period of time.

1214
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,680
There's gonna be a hyper level of productivity

1215
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,360
and we're all gonna walk away with this

1216
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,560
with sort of a shared picture,

1217
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,880
a shared idea of what the next set of goals are

1218
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,040
and a lot of things often get produced here

1219
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,360
but they don't often get discussed.

1220
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,040
People don't realize that this is happening.

1221
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,160
I don't know, guys, how am I doing so far?

1222
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,760
Have I kind of set up with the general premises

1223
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,000
of what these events are?

1224
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,440
Kind of, it depends.

1225
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,500
Some of them are development sprints

1226
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,760
where the developers get together

1227
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,380
and actually hack on stuff.

1228
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,040
Others are planning sprints

1229
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,740
where there's loads of meetings and discussion

1230
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,200
and this was more of a planning than a hacking sprint.

1231
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,120
Oh, cool, so you can break them out.

1232
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,960
Some hacking.

1233
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,800
That's brilliant.

1234
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,660
Yeah, well, we have sprints all the time.

1235
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,600
There was one the week before we were there,

1236
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,720
there's another one this week

1237
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,340
and there'll be another one the week after

1238
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,400
but with different teams.

1239
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,800
So the one that we went to last week,

1240
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,640
both myself and Martin went,

1241
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,400
was in the Netherlands in The Hague

1242
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,960
and there was 200 and something people there,

1243
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,340
250 people there.

1244
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,340
All from Canonical or where?

1245
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,820
No, there was mostly Canonical people.

1246
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,940
So design team, desktop team,

1247
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,600
Snappy team, community team,

1248
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,300
and others who I don't recall.

1249
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,140
Unity 8 team, Mere team.

1250
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,500
Unity 8 team, Mere team, yes, well done.

1251
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,860
And like loads of other people

1252
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,420
who I've never seen before

1253
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,780
and also there were some community people there

1254
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,260
as in non-Canonical people there as well

1255
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,860
who were invited.

1256
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,180
But it was mostly meetings.

1257
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,580
There was a room we had set aside for hacking

1258
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,180
because the Snappy team were working hard

1259
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,900
on getting a release out the door

1260
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,540
and the release candidate was last week

1261
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,500
while they were there

1262
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,300
and the final release is this or next week.

1263
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,900
And so they were hacking but mostly it was meetings.

1264
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,060
And I imagine that for a company

1265
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,660
that is sort of dispersed,

1266
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,860
I mean, I understand there's offices,

1267
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,900
but for a company that has a very dispersed workforce,

1268
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,780
it seems like these would be pretty essential

1269
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,760
to getting everybody that's working

1270
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,520
on this particular thing on the same page.

1271
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,160
So even if it's not developing code,

1272
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,000
you're getting everybody to-

1273
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,980
Making it feel like a team.

1274
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,340
You're buying it on the idea.

1275
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,400
Is that accurate?

1276
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,460
Yeah, it's very much that.

1277
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,820
I mean, everyone like regularly meets up anyway online.

1278
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,540
We all use Hangouts and Mumble and IRC.

1279
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,820
We use all the tools, Rocket Chat, whatever.

1280
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:57,940
But when you meet face-to-face, different things happen.

1281
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,860
You can have a conversation in a corridor

1282
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,700
and someone will say,

1283
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,780
wouldn't it be great if this happened?

1284
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,540
And then someone will go back to their hotel room

1285
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,540
or the bar usually and sit back on their lap

1286
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,240
and then give a demo, a lightning talk later that day

1287
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,020
saying, we discussed this thing and look, it's now a thing.

1288
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,220
Wow, cool.

1289
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,600
That kind of stuff is quite good fun,

1290
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,900
especially when you've got a couple of hundred people

1291
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,760
who are all working in the same direction.

1292
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,440
You could reach out to the right people

1293
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,980
who have the knowledge about whatever it is

1294
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,820
you want to achieve.

1295
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,500
Yeah, that's not just productive.

1296
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,340
What's fun about that is when I've been in those situations,

1297
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,740
that's been some of the most personally satisfying work

1298
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,540
I've done is it's just a lot of fun professionally

1299
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,140
to be working in a team environment

1300
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,500
that's firing on all cylinders or close to it.

1301
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,220
And so I kind of want to poke Wimpy's brain for a second

1302
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:49,940
because I imagine except for the snap sprint

1303
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,160
that happened a little bit ago,

1304
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,260
but this is Wimpy's first canonical event

1305
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,540
as a canonical employee.

1306
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,780
And I would imagine starting at a place,

1307
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,400
you've heard these names,

1308
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,300
you've talked to these people online,

1309
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,340
you've met some of them,

1310
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,060
but now all of a sudden you've jumped in the deep end

1311
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:12,020
and you're working with them, you're shaking hands.

1312
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,460
This must have gone from real to very real,

1313
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,380
I would imagine for you.

1314
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,140
Is that true, Wimpy?

1315
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:18,980
It is.

1316
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,180
I mean, I got to meet all of my team in person

1317
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,540
who I've got to know most of them

1318
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,780
over the years of contributing that never met before,

1319
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,820
including my manager, so that was obviously good.

1320
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,500
But then yes, there's lots of people in canonical

1321
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,180
who've helped me along the way,

1322
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,380
some of whom I got to meet in Heidelberg earlier this year

1323
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,340
and some who I got to meet for the first time

1324
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,820
this time round.

1325
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,820
But these sprints are pretty intense efforts.

1326
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,080
They're absolutely exhausting for all the right reasons.

1327
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,220
It's pretty sort of a breakneck speed during the day

1328
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,100
and then the exhaustion falls into beer and food

1329
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:07,140
in the evening and lots of fun with everyone.

1330
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,540
So yeah, they're really good fun.

1331
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:13,540
And I was, I think, a stereotypical first time

1332
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,780
sprint attendee in that I came back with the Ubu flu,

1333
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,020
which I hear is something of a tradition.

1334
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,060
Of course.

1335
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,580
One thing that was different about you being,

1336
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,580
this being your first one, which most people don't get,

1337
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,940
was you were thrown in as a track lead,

1338
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,580
so you had to manage a track of sessions

1339
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,740
and not many people have to do that.

1340
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,580
Sounds about right.

1341
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,140
That is the deep end.

1342
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,420
Yeah, the deep end was quite deep.

1343
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:43,780
That's where he thrives, I think.

1344
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,420
I just stepped on West's switch.

1345
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,260
Wow, Wimpy.

1346
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,660
Well, that sounds like it must,

1347
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,900
so now you're back at home, other than the sickness,

1348
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,700
you must really feel like you have a job job now.

1349
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,380
I do have a job job now, yeah.

1350
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,100
And we know what's in store for the next six months now,

1351
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,420
not just within our team, but in all of the teams

1352
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,580
and how all of the teams are gonna be pulling together.

1353
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,360
To give you a flavor of what went on,

1354
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,180
we were all given T-shirts at the end of this event

1355
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,820
and on the front of these T-shirts,

1356
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,820
it simply says, snap, snaps, snappy, snapped, snapcraft.

1357
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:21,740
So if you're in any doubt what the theme was,

1358
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,500
I think that underscores it rather clearly.

1359
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,020
I think it's such a fascinating time right now

1360
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,940
and Canonical has moved very fast on the snap packages.

1361
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,780
Today, Flatpak got a big update,

1362
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,220
so this is an area that's getting a lot of attention

1363
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,820
and a lot of focus right now,

1364
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,420
but Wimpy, I guess going from the outside in,

1365
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,620
I think you are sitting in a position

1366
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,420
where you maybe had suspected

1367
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,700
that there was people in there

1368
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,820
that were passionate about this stuff

1369
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,980
or you probably hoped there was people in there

1370
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,280
that followed current events,

1371
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,340
but as an external viewer,

1372
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,900
when you look at the Canonical group,

1373
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,240
you know a few names,

1374
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,620
but maybe you could name four, five, six people

1375
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,920
at Canonical, the people at the top,

1376
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,940
the people that join us frequently in the communities,

1377
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,860
but I wonder, Wimpy, going in now,

1378
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,860
did you walk away with a sense

1379
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,140
that people there are hardcore Linux advocates,

1380
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:20,980
they're Linux users?

1381
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,820
What was some of the senses you walked away with

1382
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,640
and some of the things you suspected but were confirmed,

1383
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,040
what you can share at least?

1384
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,980
Without a doubt, these were the 250, 300,

1385
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,980
and 300 most smart people I've been in a place with ever.

1386
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,340
Everybody is an expert in something.

1387
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,180
Wow, that must be exciting.

1388
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,380
You'll not hear the names of many of the people

1389
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,220
that were there,

1390
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,820
but they're all doing impressive things

1391
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,060
and creating great technology.

1392
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,900
Geez.

1393
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,700
And that was my impression was

1394
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,020
there are some seriously clever people around me

1395
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:55,860
at the moment.

1396
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,700
Isn't that a great feeling?

1397
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,540
That must feel very rewarding

1398
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,860
to work with a group like that.

1399
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,700
Yeah, it is.

1400
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,520
That's cool.

1401
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,580
It's terrific.

1402
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,060
So yeah, that was my sort of general feeling

1403
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,500
was what an excellent group of people

1404
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,260
Canonical have got working for them.

1405
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,260
And I only got to see this one group

1406
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,100
cross-section of the people in Canonical.

1407
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,460
And I imagine it's the same

1408
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,700
as you go across the other divisions as well.

1409
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,540
I think, you know,

1410
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:27,700
I universally I have had an incredible experience

1411
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,260
when I go meet these companies

1412
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,420
and I talk to the people

1413
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,140
who don't come out publicly

1414
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,180
and I walk away going,

1415
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,220
holy crap, they're doing some amazing stuff

1416
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,940
that they're not even discussing.

1417
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,140
They have people that are advancing technology

1418
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,500
that they're not bragging about.

1419
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,340
Exactly.

1420
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,140
A lot of these companies,

1421
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,820
you know, Canonical included,

1422
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,380
when I meet the people I'm like,

1423
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,660
geez, how come you guys aren't telling the story?

1424
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,820
This is really something.

1425
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,100
I think it's impressive

1426
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,660
and it's extremely reassuring

1427
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,340
when you get down below the surface,

1428
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,980
you get below the spokespersons,

1429
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,100
you get below the blogs,

1430
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,780
you get below the Twitter feeds

1431
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,860
and you look at the people

1432
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,340
that are actually contributing.

1433
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,180
That is some of the,

1434
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,660
at least if you're a tech head,

1435
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,220
that's some of the most inspirational stuff

1436
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,660
about this industry.

1437
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,900
So that's really cool.

1438
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,660
And guys, I don't know if there,

1439
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,700
is there anything that we should be looking forward to

1440
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,660
that's coming soon with Snap packages

1441
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,500
or anything like that

1442
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,340
that you can tease us with?

1443
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,180
Yeah.

1444
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,140
So there were some lightning talks

1445
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,460
at the end of the days

1446
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,140
and one of the ones that I was quite pleased to see

1447
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,940
was Delta updates for Snap packages.

1448
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,780
No way.

1449
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:40,180
So like if you have like a LibreOffice Snap,

1450
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,500
it's quite chunky,

1451
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,180
but they're adding the ability

1452
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,380
for the backend to do Delta

1453
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,420
so that when next time you get a Snap update,

1454
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,020
it only does a binary Delta,

1455
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,660
it uses XDIF or something.

1456
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,860
And the guy who was talking about this

1457
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:55,780
gave a presentation,

1458
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:58,060
not just about the technology underneath.

1459
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,140
I mean, he gave a quick lightning talk about

1460
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,660
his name's Tommy Richards.

1461
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,860
And he gave a talk about,

1462
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,420
a lightning talk showing downloading,

1463
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,940
I think it was Inkscape or something.

1464
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,340
And then he enabled Deltas

1465
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,060
and then showed downloading the same thing again.

1466
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,140
And it was super fast.

1467
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,180
I mean, it was like noticeable difference

1468
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,980
between many, many seconds

1469
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,260
and a couple of seconds.

1470
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,500
And then he gave a talk about how that's implemented

1471
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,420
and the analysis that they did

1472
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,660
in order to determine

1473
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,340
what types of packages compress well.

1474
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,700
And it turns out there are some

1475
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,260
that don't compress particularly well.

1476
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,540
And there are good reasons for that.

1477
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,140
And it was a great learning exercise

1478
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,420
for them to figure out,

1479
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,780
what are the best algorithms to use

1480
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,020
and what's the best methodology

1481
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,700
to develop this kind of software.

1482
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,500
And it was quite fascinating to watch.

1483
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,340
Holy smokes, you know,

1484
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,140
as somebody who's home connections on a MiFi

1485
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,900
and somebody who occasionally broadcast from the road,

1486
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,300
I thank you so much for Delta updates.

1487
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,700
They are my favorite thing

1488
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,980
when I have a distro that supports Delta updates.

1489
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,980
It's a, that is,

1490
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,500
my bandwidth thanks you too.

1491
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,980
I am legitimately excited about both Flatpaks and Snaps.

1492
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,500
I am probably personally

1493
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,540
a little more interested in Snaps

1494
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,300
because I'm already using a bunch of them

1495
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,140
and I don't have any Flatpaks that are actually like,

1496
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,020
the practicalness, the easy to use level faster.

1497
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,860
And so therefore, yeah, that's what I want to use.

1498
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,140
Yeah, and the apps, the couple of apps

1499
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,420
that I wanted to try real quick

1500
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,260
or the ones I don't want to futz with are already available.

1501
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,700
And I would love to see more, absolutely.

1502
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,620
And I could totally see,

1503
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,060
I could see a huge place for this

1504
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,260
in like enterprise or proprietary type deployments of things

1505
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,620
where you already have all your own dependencies

1506
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,100
and you just want a little bundle that you ship to

1507
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,140
and you're going to probably run

1508
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,700
some sort of Ubuntu cloud type operating system already.

1509
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,260
No kidding, Wes.

1510
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,980
I would have used the hell out of that back in the day.

1511
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,580
Yeah, you're just like, oh, everything works.

1512
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,420
It's in its wonderful little Snap, bam,

1513
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,060
on in the server, you're good to go.

1514
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,100
Geez, that makes me want to be a sysadmin again right there.

1515
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:51,220
That would be so convenient and straightforward.

1516
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,380
Damn, yeah, absolutely.

1517
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:56,060
And you know, Wes, I still have a chance.

1518
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:56,900
You still do.

1519
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,740
There's still a chance.

1520
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,300
Perhaps I could use my fleet of DigitalOcean droplets.

1521
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,020
One of our sponsors here on the Unplugged program,

1522
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:06,020
go to digitalotion.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1523
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,460
That's one word and it's lowercase

1524
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,900
and you plug it in there on your dashboard

1525
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,980
and you get a $10 credit.

1526
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,380
And this is why you want a $10 credit.

1527
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,500
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider

1528
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,220
that is dedicated to offering the most intuitive

1529
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,340
and easy way for you to spin up a badass Linux box

1530
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,100
on their crazy great infrastructure.

1531
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,300
They got great connections.

1532
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,860
They got all SSDs.

1533
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,700
They have a super sweet interface

1534
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,020
that's better than it could even,

1535
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,860
like if this was a desktop app

1536
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,660
that you like had to like install as a package

1537
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,500
on your desktop,

1538
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,100
I'd be like, man, this is just such a great app.

1539
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:34,940
It's a web app.

1540
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:35,860
It's all HTML5.

1541
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,700
It's a web app.

1542
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,540
It works on your phone.

1543
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,980
It works on your crappy browser.

1544
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,940
It's a web app that actually is useful

1545
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,740
and it's easy to use, but it's also extremely powerful.

1546
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,100
If you're a total noob

1547
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,620
or you've been setting up Linux servers for like 15 years,

1548
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,020
you're gonna find this to be a nice UI.

1549
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,380
Do you agree as somebody, you agree?

1550
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,660
Yeah, absolutely.

1551
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,820
And I gotta tell you,

1552
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,180
when you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED

1553
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,500
and you get a $10 credit,

1554
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,100
you could actually get a lot of distance out of that

1555
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,700
because you can use hourly pricing over DigitalOcean.

1556
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,420
So if there's something you wanna play with,

1557
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,860
like OpenVPN or TinkVPN,

1558
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,340
or maybe you wanna play with MB for 15 minutes

1559
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,220
or Nextcloud. I still am using it

1560
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,420
to compile my kernels.

1561
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,340
When you have a custom arch kernel,

1562
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,500
you just spin up a droplet.

1563
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,340
Super fast.

1564
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,460
You run the code to compile the kernel,

1565
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,100
which is a make or whatever.

1566
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,220
Which level droplet do you go with?

1567
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,820
I usually go to the, what's the two-core one?

1568
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,660
That's what I usually go with.

1569
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,500
This is what I was gonna say,

1570
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,420
because for three cents an hour,

1571
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,260
I was gonna say,

1572
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,100
because I know,

1573
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,580
because a lot of everybody goes with the $5 droplet.

1574
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,420
Which is a great deal.

1575
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,260
It's a wonderful,

1576
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,100
a little web presence,

1577
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,380
your own domain, a blog, perfect.

1578
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,420
But if you're just gonna build,

1579
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,620
so if you go with the two-core,

1580
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,700
so if you go with the Westrig,

1581
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,580
it's three cents an hour,

1582
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,420
it's two gigs of RAM,

1583
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,260
a two-core processor,

1584
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,340
40 gigabyte SSD,

1585
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,380
they're all SSDs,

1586
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,980
and three terabytes of transfer.

1587
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,380
I don't have a reason to go

1588
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,980
with the high-memory droplets yet,

1589
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,620
but man, these things, they're crazy.

1590
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:51,940
Like 64 gigs of RAM, 224 gigabytes of RAM,

1591
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,940
and they're a ton of money, monthly.

1592
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,340
But of course, if you need that much RAM,

1593
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,180
that's probably not a big deal.

1594
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,500
But something where you're already doing some caching,

1595
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,460
or maybe you just need a big Redis that runs,

1596
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,300
or Memcache.

1597
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,860
And look, dude, if you switch it over to hourly,

1598
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,060
okay, you know what?

1599
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:05,900
I could afford 18 cents an hour.

1600
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,180
Those are all numbers that I'm okay with.

1601
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,900
Those are, even the $2 an hour,

1602
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,780
like if I'm doing it for two hours.

1603
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,660
At most a day, at most a day, maybe.

1604
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,060
And you're like, okay, well then that's fine.

1605
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,620
Yeah, it's a pretty cool system.

1606
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,900
And then on top of all of it,

1607
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,380
they have really great tutorials.

1608
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,140
So you can just deploy a stack of apps,

1609
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,620
or you can use one of the, like here's one,

1610
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:27,300
pretty relevant, how to protect your server

1611
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,980
against the Cal Linux vulnerability.

1612
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,100
Well, it might be good to know.

1613
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,620
Oh, that's topical, look at that.

1614
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,600
Look at DigitalOcean over there.

1615
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,220
So here's what I want you to do.

1616
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:38,380
Go to DigitalOcean, set up an account,

1617
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,060
and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1618
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,740
We'll give you a $10 credit,

1619
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,820
and then you can try any of this stuff for free.

1620
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,580
You can run the $5 rig for two months,

1621
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,500
or you can go run the Crazy Memory rig,

1622
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,940
or you can run the West rig,

1623
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,300
and build your kernels and stuff like that.

1624
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,340
And I think the West rig's like three cents an hour.

1625
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,100
Yeah, it's really, it's not that much.

1626
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,500
I should do that for the, you know what, after the show?

1627
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,020
If I remember, let's talk about how I could do that for my,

1628
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,300
because you know, I got that MacBook running Arch

1629
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,180
that you set up during the show.

1630
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:11,180
And the kernel builds, they're like an hour, they're long.

1631
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,220
So you know what the nice thing about Arch is?

1632
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,380
It's pretty easy to run your own like Arch repo,

1633
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,460
or it's something you can add.

1634
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,140
And so then you just, you build everything on a big droplet,

1635
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,260
you transfer it over to your $5 a month droplet,

1636
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,040
because all you need is it to be like an HTTP endpoint.

1637
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,760
And now you've got your own custom little Chris repo.

1638
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,460
Man Wes, I'm gonna buy you a beer.

1639
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,460
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED,

1640
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,980
and go build your kernels in the cloud like a boost.

1641
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,200
DigitalOcean.com, big thanks DigitalOcean

1642
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,420
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1643
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,700
All right guys, I wanted to talk about something

1644
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,740
that I'm beginning to change my tune on.

1645
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,060
Do you remember that when I did a road trip to Noah's house

1646
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,380
to like witness his home automation system?

1647
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,020
And I was actually really impressed.

1648
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:56,860
I was impressed as well.

1649
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,020
And it's even cooler than we could capture on camera.

1650
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,020
That guy's got chaps.

1651
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,140
And on top of that, he's added on to it.

1652
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,940
And so I have kind of changed my tune a little bit

1653
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,100
on home automation, and there's this great-

1654
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,500
You're tired of Rekai leaving the oven on?

1655
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,340
Is that what you're saying?

1656
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,180
You're farting.

1657
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,920
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1658
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,140
Ah ha ha ha ha ha.

1659
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:15,980
Oh.

1660
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:16,820
Sorry Rekai.

1661
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,640
Oh, I catch it.

1662
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,740
You've listened to user error.

1663
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:19,980
I was listening to it on the way up.

1664
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,980
Yeah, isn't that funny?

1665
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,380
Yeah, isn't that funny?

1666
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,540
Man, and you know what?

1667
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,360
I've done that too.

1668
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,080
The pizza situation since that episode has been rough.

1669
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,620
All right, so this is really cool though,

1670
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,940
because it's building a home automation system

1671
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,500
where you run it all on your own land,

1672
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,240
powered by Raspberry Pis.

1673
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,500
And I've been experimenting with something recently.

1674
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,740
This is gonna sound so stupid,

1675
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,940
but just go with me for a second.

1676
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:44,620
I've been experimenting with, during the weekdays,

1677
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,260
leaving my monitors on.

1678
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,300
Okay, tell me more, tell me more.

1679
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,060
Well, traditionally, I've got these two.

1680
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,460
Yeah, what's the monitor situation?

1681
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,140
Oh man, I've got these great monitors.

1682
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,740
They're 27-inch ASUS monitors.

1683
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,260
I got two identical monitors.

1684
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,300
One is vertical. Full HD, something else?

1685
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,540
2K, so they're like, what is it, like 2560 by 1440

1686
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,220
or whatever, but one is vertical and one's horizontal.

1687
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:11,860
I love it, I love it for doing research, show prep,

1688
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,340
or even just having like a terminal that's doing updates

1689
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,180
and a telegram session.

1690
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,620
The vertical monitor is wonderful.

1691
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,580
It's killer, it's totally, totally killer.

1692
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:22,300
However, one's hooked up over HDMI, or no,

1693
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,740
one's hooked up over DVI

1694
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,060
and one's hooked up over DisplayPort.

1695
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,740
Let me guess, DisplayPort, oh man.

1696
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:31,020
And it is, I've actually got a good system,

1697
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,120
but so when I wake the system up,

1698
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:37,340
the vertical monitor never fires up.

1699
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,500
That's the DisplayPort monitor.

1700
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,740
Yeah, you've been here.

1701
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,020
Oh yeah, I've been dealing,

1702
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,380
I just got some new monitors at work.

1703
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,220
So we have six monitors now in a row

1704
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,900
in the room I'm sitting in with verticals on the left

1705
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,940
and right-hand most side.

1706
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,140
So it's a really nice setup,

1707
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:52,300
but one side is all DisplayPort and the other side,

1708
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,980
I have one HDMI and then one DisplayPort

1709
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,180
and then a DisplayPort chained to the third monitor,

1710
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,620
which the chaining is actually working wonderfully,

1711
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:02,420
but the power save, man, it's crazy.

1712
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,420
I have a trick, I have a trick.

1713
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,300
So what I do is my main monitor,

1714
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,380
which I set via Gnome's display manager,

1715
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,660
because otherwise the DisplayPort

1716
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,740
would by default be the main display.

1717
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,520
And in fact, when GDM starts up,

1718
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,460
the login screen is sideways on the vertical monitor

1719
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,940
and the horizontal monitor that sits in front of me is off.

1720
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,780
Perfect.

1721
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,500
And then I log in and Gnome 3 starts

1722
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,700
and it rearranges the displays like a champ every time.

1723
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,340
See, I'm on Unity too, so it's not even, it's worse.

1724
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,660
Oh, okay.

1725
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:38,700
But that's only if I've booted the system.

1726
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,660
If I'm waking the system from sleep

1727
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,120
or if I've just turned the monitors off

1728
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,420
but left the system running

1729
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,220
and maybe like let the drive spin down,

1730
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,860
when I move the mouse and hit the power button

1731
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:52,340
on both monitors, only the DVI monitor wakes up.

1732
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,100
The DisplayPort monitor never wakes up,

1733
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,100
which is where my telegram is

1734
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,020
and where my terminal session is and all that.

1735
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,020
I need that monitor.

1736
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:05,020
So what I have done is I've installed a Gnome extension.

1737
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:06,340
Of course.

1738
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,500
That you just, you click it

1739
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,220
and it puts your displays to sleep.

1740
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,820
So what I do is I click it,

1741
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,440
I have the horizontal monitor on, it is powered up,

1742
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,900
and the vertical monitor, the DisplayPort monitor is off.

1743
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,340
I hit the sleep.

1744
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,180
Yep.

1745
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,820
I turn the DisplayPort monitor on,

1746
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,660
I hit the control button on the keyboard,

1747
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:34,100
it then sends a new wake-up command to all the displays

1748
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:36,500
and the DisplayPort monitor comes back,

1749
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,340
pops right back.

1750
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,740
Okay.

1751
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,740
But this is about a 55-second process.

1752
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:43,580
Yeah.

1753
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,620
I've kind of timed it.

1754
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:45,860
And it's super frustrating.

1755
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,700
And one of the things I've done recently

1756
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,020
is during the weekdays,

1757
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,900
I've decided to just leave my monitors on.

1758
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,460
And by God, I actually feel more,

1759
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,140
I just sit down and I immediately start working.

1760
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,780
All you do is the lock screen and you're good.

1761
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,220
Or what, maybe not even that.

1762
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,060
Boom.

1763
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:02,900
No, just, I mean.

1764
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,320
I mean, it's the studio, so.

1765
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,820
If anybody hacks me, there's only one person

1766
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,380
it's gonna be, and it's gonna be the beard.

1767
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,500
And I don't think that lock screen's gonna be

1768
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,340
what prevents him, so.

1769
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,180
No, no.

1770
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,020
Don't do it.

1771
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:14,020
He's had rude since he got here, Chris.

1772
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,540
Yeah, not only that, but he knows what the password is

1773
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,780
for my account because all my studio machines

1774
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,420
have a shared password.

1775
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,100
And so I don't bother with the lock screen,

1776
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,580
I immediately sit down and start working.

1777
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:26,540
And I have just, I have been, Wes,

1778
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,620
I gotta tell ya, it's made a difference.

1779
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,940
I feel great, but now,

1780
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:33,420
now I got this really annoying problem.

1781
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,220
Like, I gotta like, turn on my lights,

1782
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,420
and then there's two different places

1783
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,100
I gotta go to flip a switch,

1784
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,700
and sometimes I gotta turn on the fan,

1785
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,060
depending on the temperature.

1786
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:45,500
All this other hassle I gotta do before I get to work.

1787
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,780
It's really highlighted the little,

1788
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,340
how much the little things make a difference

1789
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,180
in your everyday work.

1790
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,100
This is actually what I'm saying.

1791
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,420
And so I kind of have been,

1792
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,940
I've kind of been turning around to the idea

1793
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,220
of automating a couple of things.

1794
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,500
Like, if I could automate the monitor wake-up process

1795
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,780
so they could be turned off.

1796
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,300
If I could automate the lights turning on

1797
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,660
at the right time and the fan turned on

1798
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,100
so that when I sit down, I am ready to go.

1799
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,580
If I could have like an NFC checkpoint

1800
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,180
or something at the entrance of the studio.

1801
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,580
Or when your phone joins the wifi.

1802
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:09,420
Exactly. Or whatever.

1803
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,500
And if this, then that triggers all of that stuff

1804
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,340
and turns it on.

1805
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,600
I've been thinking more and more like,

1806
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,660
not only would that just be nice to have, but great.

1807
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,960
I'll film the entire setup,

1808
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,200
and it would make great content too.

1809
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,220
So it kind of seems like a double win, right?

1810
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,060
Yeah.

1811
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,580
I've been thinking about this setup

1812
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,660
on how they've done it.

1813
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,940
And man, this is sitting pretty with me.

1814
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:31,060
They said it was a huge project for their office,

1815
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,860
and they wanted light control, conference call room,

1816
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,140
occupancy signalization, individual access codes,

1817
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,500
audio systems with wireless music streaming,

1818
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,580
manageable audio experiences in different rooms,

1819
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,060
like the bathroom.

1820
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:43,900
Honestly, with all this,

1821
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,020
I'm impressed that they were able to take the time

1822
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,020
to focus on this totally out of,

1823
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,740
like this is a major accomplishment

1824
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:52,780
for not exactly a business request, you know?

1825
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,620
I agree.

1826
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,460
And they worked on like light controls

1827
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,300
and all that kind of stuff,

1828
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,140
and they wanted to be able to control it

1829
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,500
via web application.

1830
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,220
What matters is they built it all

1831
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:03,100
with this super badass Raspberry Pi system.

1832
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,740
They have one master Raspberry Pi,

1833
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,820
which controls all the low level hardware.

1834
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:10,140
And then they have this thing called the distribution board,

1835
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:11,180
and I'm showing a picture of it.

1836
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,580
Oh, that's beautiful.

1837
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,920
It's so beautiful that before the show,

1838
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,100
I just sent a picture of this to Noah.

1839
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,260
I'm like, Noah, look at this.

1840
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,300
Noah, just look at this.

1841
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,420
This is so gorgeous.

1842
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,820
This is so great.

1843
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,160
And then they have a second device

1844
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,880
called the relay driver board,

1845
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,300
which does what you would expect.

1846
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,140
It also runs a web server on the main Pi

1847
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,180
with a web application that allows the controls.

1848
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,380
They have occupancy signalization via movement sensors,

1849
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,220
which is how Noah does it in his house.

1850
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,660
They have TV panel management

1851
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,500
with Pis connected to different TVs,

1852
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:41,500
and they have the Pis all centrally located in this rack.

1853
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,380
So if a TV, they have an HDMI feed that goes out to the TV,

1854
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,700
but all of the Pis are in one place.

1855
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,060
You don't have to go out to the TV to service it.

1856
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:48,900
Genius.

1857
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,740
That's smart.

1858
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,900
It's like bringing a patch panel to Raspberry Pis.

1859
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,940
It's a patch panel of Raspberry Pis,

1860
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,600
and this is the part of home automation

1861
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,780
that's really, I'm loving,

1862
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:03,780
because I could do HDMI over Ethernet for long runs,

1863
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:07,020
and I'm loving this.

1864
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,780
I don't know how you'd ever afford all of it,

1865
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:09,860
but I think it's a great system.

1866
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,380
And they talk about how they set up their audio

1867
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,420
and all of that.

1868
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,060
After looking at this,

1869
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,820
it's really kind of turning my head

1870
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,380
towards home automation again,

1871
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,500
but in a way that doesn't feel like

1872
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,020
it's tied to a product or a brand.

1873
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,240
I think that's part of the part.

1874
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,380
Noah uses a lot of interesting things,

1875
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,000
and I think that he's a very cool,

1876
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,620
it's almost like an analog approach,

1877
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,340
but it does necessarily involve

1878
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:32,260
a certain amount of products or boxes,

1879
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,620
and it feels hard to replicate,

1880
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,100
or very much like,

1881
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,780
well, I've invested in this company's way,

1882
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,380
or at least I've invested in these things,

1883
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:40,460
and I need this equipment to do it.

1884
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,220
Raspberry Pis are $35,

1885
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:45,940
and Ethernet is whatever by the spool.

1886
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,500
Plus I have Ethernet run to all the rooms

1887
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,340
in the studio already.

1888
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:50,580
You probably have the infrastructure to do it.

1889
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:51,580
You have the,

1890
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:52,420
I mean, you don't have the time,

1891
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:53,620
but you have the Linux knowledge

1892
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:55,260
and the wherewithal to do it.

1893
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,740
Yeah, we need somebody to come out in the studio

1894
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,580
and work with us, Wes,

1895
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,420
to do all this kind of stuff.

1896
01:04:58,420 --> 01:04:59,900
We need some serious projects we can do,

1897
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,220
because I've got like three or four Pis

1898
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,060
in the studio right now.

1899
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,540
They're just sitting around, right?

1900
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,980
Or like Onion Omegas or who knows what.

1901
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,580
Yeah, yeah, or Arduinos.

1902
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:08,500
We'll be eating that in a moment.

1903
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,620
Anybody in the Mamba Room experimenting at all

1904
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,180
with any form of home automation,

1905
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,060
even if it's like the Hughes brand

1906
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,820
like I mess around with or anything like that,

1907
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,460
anybody in the virtual log?

1908
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:18,300
Yeah, go ahead.

1909
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,380
I've been actually looking into using two Raspberry Pis

1910
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,700
to solve an issue in my house,

1911
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:28,700
which is the thermostat that I have is in one location

1912
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:34,100
and my bedroom is at the other end of the house,

1913
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:39,100
which means my bedroom in the winter is always cold.

1914
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,660
So I was thinking about replacing

1915
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:45,140
my simple, stupid thermostat with a Raspberry Pi,

1916
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:48,340
which I already have sitting and doing nothing,

1917
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,420
just connecting a relay to it

1918
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:54,380
and making it switch the thermostat on and off.

1919
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:58,820
And then having a second Raspberry Pi in my bedroom

1920
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,700
that talks to that other Raspberry Pi.

1921
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,220
And I can tell, you know, during the night,

1922
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:11,420
maybe switch that thermostat to the temperature reading

1923
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:14,060
from the other Raspberry Pi in my bedroom.

1924
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,420
And during the day, switch it to the living room.

1925
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:20,420
Solves that problem with, I have to buy a relay

1926
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:23,900
and two thermometers.

1927
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,660
You know, I've been thinking, it's funny you say this,

1928
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:29,860
because I've been thinking about the same thing

1929
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,620
when I finally set up whatever storage solution

1930
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,420
and server solution I'm gonna have in Lady Jupiter

1931
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,740
for being able to do on the road production.

1932
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:42,580
It's all gonna be inside a dinette booth, which is...

1933
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,020
Oh, right, this is in the rig.

1934
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:44,860
Right, and you've seen it.

1935
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,980
They're like plush leather seats.

1936
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:47,820
Pretty comfy.

1937
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,980
And they're made out of wood.

1938
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:52,540
It's like you're putting inside a box that's insulated.

1939
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,500
And so I've thought about putting a Raspberry Pi

1940
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,500
or something in there with a temperature sensor

1941
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,260
that could automatically shut down when things get too hot

1942
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:02,300
because sure, in October in Washington,

1943
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,860
I'm probably not gonna have an issue.

1944
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:05,780
But what about in August?

1945
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,620
In Arizona.

1946
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:07,900
And I'm not, yeah.

1947
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,180
Or I'm going down to California in a few weeks.

1948
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:11,460
It could be a little warmer.

1949
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,620
You park in the shade.

1950
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:15,620
I have no idea, or one day maybe that side of the rig

1951
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,540
is parked in the sunlight

1952
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,900
and it's just getting beat with sunlight.

1953
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,500
The temperature's gonna be all over the place.

1954
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,260
And I've thought about, well, wouldn't it be great

1955
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:24,540
if I had something in there that not only was charting it

1956
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,620
so I had an idea of how things were going trend-wise,

1957
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:29,420
but also a fail-safe that said, oh, God,

1958
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,580
this is getting bad, shut down the cradle point,

1959
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,940
shut down the storage array, shut down the NUC

1960
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:34,780
or whatever it is.

1961
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,500
Yellow alert, just power down.

1962
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,820
And then send me a message.

1963
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,660
That would be my ideal situation.

1964
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:43,060
So that's where I've thought about using it too.

1965
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,140
Even in the RV.

1966
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:45,980
You know, I've thought about it.

1967
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:46,820
It seems like there's a lot of applications.

1968
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,380
Once you've got that kind of like,

1969
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,620
I mean, if this, then that, that sort of style response.

1970
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:51,820
Like there's a lot of things you can handle

1971
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,980
like pet feeding or care, you can handle-

1972
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:57,860
Turning on the AC, turning on a fan.

1973
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:00,500
Yeah, that could be the route I go too, right?

1974
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,380
I really just want like a home API.

1975
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:08,380
Yeah, I looked into it and if you don't like doing things

1976
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:13,380
by just using components that you buy on the wheel

1977
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:17,540
or whatever, you can buy these relay boards

1978
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:21,540
for Raspberry Pis and they can handle anything

1979
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:26,220
from switching five volt circuits to 220 volt circuits.

1980
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:27,820
Oh, that sounds really handy.

1981
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:31,020
Anything from thermostat to lights and power.

1982
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,020
Like you could literally just shut off power

1983
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:38,020
to your entire computer with that Raspberry Pi relay.

1984
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:39,740
Just before you do that,

1985
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:43,340
make sure that that relay board in your mind

1986
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:47,060
can handle the voltage before you burn anything down.

1987
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,540
That could be bad.

1988
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:51,820
Yeah, but they make those and then all you have to do

1989
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:56,820
is they will probably be like I2C IO.

1990
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:59,300
So you can just plug it into your Raspberry Pi

1991
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,260
and start hacking.

1992
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,740
And so if you're a software guy and not a hardware guy,

1993
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,060
they make it pretty easy for you.

1994
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,900
It's just a few extra bucks.

1995
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,740
I like it.

1996
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:09,900
This is exciting and I could see,

1997
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,300
I don't know if I'll get it to the, I don't know.

1998
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,620
God, I hope I get to it this year.

1999
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,220
But with winter, I don't feel like it's the top

2000
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:16,420
of my priority list, but I could see early spring

2001
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,420
as being a project that I actually tackle.

2002
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,580
It's kind of just interesting to think about it now

2003
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,260
because as I start to deploy this stuff,

2004
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,460
I'll have this in the back of my mind

2005
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,140
of how I want to do this properly.

2006
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:27,980
So I'll set the power up and the networking for it.

2007
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,820
So it's all there when I'm ready to pull the trigger.

2008
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,140
And then just, yeah.

2009
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,620
And then when it comes time in the spring

2010
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,820
before it gets too hot,

2011
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,020
I'll have all the groundwork laid down.

2012
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:37,300
That could be pretty, so if you've got ideas,

2013
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,140
feel free to let me know.

2014
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:38,980
Please do.

2015
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:39,820
Yeah, if you've done this,

2016
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:41,340
if you tackle this particular problem.

2017
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:43,180
And you got a VU meter that'll work with it, right?

2018
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,020
Yes, you'll have hardware dials.

2019
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:46,660
You can get them up on the dash.

2020
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,340
That'd be great.

2021
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:50,620
Who cares about this MPH?

2022
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,700
I'm looking at how my servers are doing.

2023
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:53,540
That's so funny.

2024
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:54,660
All right, well, before we go any further,

2025
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,500
if you ever wanted to get really in depth

2026
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,900
on a particular topic in Linux

2027
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,780
or on the backend infrastructure

2028
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:00,700
or any of the things that people

2029
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,820
are really making money on Linux,

2030
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:06,340
like Ruby or Python or AWS or Azure or OpenStack,

2031
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,260
any of these kinds of things

2032
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,780
that you would like to learn more about,

2033
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:10,940
I would encourage you to visit our sponsor, Linux Academy.

2034
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:14,740
Go to linuxacademy.com all unplugged.

2035
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,020
That's where you go to support the show

2036
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:17,740
and sign up for a seven-day free trial.

2037
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:19,260
That's new.

2038
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,300
I think that's a big deal

2039
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,540
because you can go in there and get a little taste,

2040
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,020
get a little idea.

2041
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,340
Linux Academy has step-by-step video courses,

2042
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,580
comprehensive study guides that you can download

2043
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:29,820
and use offline,

2044
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,260
and the courses come with your own server.

2045
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,660
They'll spin up on demand.

2046
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,900
I think also if maybe you've been tempted

2047
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,740
by the certification life.

2048
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:37,820
Right.

2049
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,620
They have really good training on that,

2050
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:42,060
and I mention this because I have been down this path.

2051
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,500
It's been a while, but I have been down this path,

2052
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,820
and you do want training that keeps in mind your end goal,

2053
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,580
and I think they have a really good path.

2054
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,020
They have these learning paths.

2055
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,580
They're a series of courses and content

2056
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:56,500
planned by instructors for specific tracks, which is nice,

2057
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,940
and they have instructor mentoring available,

2058
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,300
so if you do have questions,

2059
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,020
you can actually talk to a real human and get your answers.

2060
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,060
It's super transparent.

2061
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,420
Yeah, you can get your question answered.

2062
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:04,860
You get a good grasp,

2063
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,540
so you really have a good grasp.

2064
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,500
You really know what you're doing,

2065
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,340
so when you go in there,

2066
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,620
you don't have that anxiety about it.

2067
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:11,860
It's not that you just prepared for a test.

2068
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:14,100
It's you learned this because you're applying it.

2069
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:14,940
You understand it.

2070
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,020
You know what to do.

2071
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,580
Especially if you combine it with their labs

2072
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,540
and their hands on exercises.

2073
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:22,340
You go in there, and you get real-world experience

2074
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:23,180
on real servers.

2075
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,380
I mean, these are servers they spin up

2076
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,620
just like you would in production,

2077
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,020
and you have the whole box to yourself,

2078
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,980
the SSHN, and you're doing the job.

2079
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,380
That is great experience,

2080
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:31,900
and it's only the kind of thing you get

2081
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,620
when a company focuses on Linux and open source,

2082
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,380
when it's not just a thing that they do,

2083
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:37,500
but it's what they do.

2084
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,540
Exactly.

2085
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:40,460
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

2086
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:41,460
Go there.

2087
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,540
Try them out, and also, you can take advantage

2088
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,340
of the new public profile feature.

2089
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:46,540
I think this is a really nice feature

2090
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:49,460
to let employers know how your training's gone,

2091
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:52,020
which, I don't know, Wes, where you work,

2092
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,940
when I was in IT, training,

2093
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:57,900
like there was a part of my yearly, not salary,

2094
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,980
but there was a part of my yearly budget for me

2095
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,340
that included a little bit of training.

2096
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:02,180
Do you get anything like that?

2097
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:03,940
Yeah, there is a general organizational level

2098
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:04,780
training budget.

2099
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:07,100
Yeah, I think I'd be curious to know

2100
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:10,260
if people out there have tried this with Linux Academy,

2101
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:11,100
because to me-

2102
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:11,940
It seems like a great way.

2103
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:13,340
They have great team support.

2104
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:14,180
Exactly.

2105
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:15,020
It's a super easy sell.

2106
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:15,860
Yeah, exactly.

2107
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:16,700
It's a super easy sell,

2108
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:17,700
plus it's something you can do

2109
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,900
where you have full control,

2110
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,820
and it's not just fluff content.

2111
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,660
It's by people that really know Linux and care about it.

2112
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,820
They're constantly renovating the content,

2113
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,740
and with the public profiles,

2114
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,420
it's very easy at the end of the year

2115
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:29,700
to show what you've done.

2116
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:30,540
Exactly.

2117
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,380
You can show your employer.

2118
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,540
You can be like, look, this is what I've done.

2119
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,660
Here's how I've improved it.

2120
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:34,500
Yeah.

2121
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,260
I think it's probably,

2122
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:38,040
if I was still in that field,

2123
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,460
it's probably my perfect solution,

2124
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,580
and I wish something like this was around back then.

2125
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:43,820
It's also the perfect thing for you.

2126
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:44,860
Like, well, I like Linux,

2127
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:45,780
and I don't really know what I'm doing,

2128
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,700
or you have a job that doesn't,

2129
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,340
you don't get to use Linux like you'd like to.

2130
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,180
Yeah, yeah.

2131
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:52,620
Linux Academy is just the golden road for you.

2132
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:54,100
For about a year,

2133
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,300
I was using Linux Academy just to scratch itches

2134
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,700
because there were so many things I'd want to try.

2135
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,500
After I got out of doing that as a daily thing,

2136
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,300
I still had these ideas that I wanted.

2137
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,460
Linux Academy with the labs and the training,

2138
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,460
it was a great resource for that.

2139
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,620
And the other thing that's kind of nice

2140
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,660
is sometimes there's a topic that I don't feel like,

2141
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:09,820
man, I've read the story,

2142
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,380
I've talked to the people that make it,

2143
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,500
and I'm still not wrapping my head around this,

2144
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,940
and Linux Academy has courseware on it,

2145
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:17,180
and the thing that's really nice about that

2146
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,020
is I look at it and I go,

2147
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,340
oh, well, that's gonna be three hours.

2148
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,700
Okay.

2149
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,500
I will spend three hours on this,

2150
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,340
and with the downloadable comprehensive study guides,

2151
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:27,340
the audio you can listen to,

2152
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:28,780
sometimes I'm podcasting this stuff.

2153
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:32,420
And if you have a little bit of downtime

2154
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,260
when you're commuting,

2155
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:35,700
maybe you're a passenger or you're on public transit,

2156
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,980
I really think the iOS and Android apps

2157
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,260
could be a great way to learn while you're on the go too.

2158
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,100
Oh, definitely.

2159
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,820
So check them out, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

2160
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,220
That's how you support the show,

2161
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,300
and you can sign up for a seven-day free trial,

2162
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,540
and a big thank you to Linux Academy

2163
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:51,460
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

2164
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:55,060
So last week, we were talking about the perfect keyboard,

2165
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:56,380
and I told you I was a little worried

2166
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:58,620
about getting obsessed with keyboards.

2167
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:00,260
And I walked away from the show,

2168
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,100
and I was like, gosh, you know,

2169
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:05,460
I remember this Keyboardio project.

2170
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,900
Does this ring a bell at all to you, Keyboardio?

2171
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,220
You know, that does sound really familiar.

2172
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:11,540
Keyboardio is pretty cool,

2173
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:15,020
and it's a group that Noah and I had a chance to talk to

2174
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,380
a little while ago,

2175
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:19,940
where they're embedding an Arduino Linux running board

2176
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:24,620
inside a keyboard, a solid piece of wood that they have.

2177
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:25,460
Look at that.

2178
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,620
Yeah, are you seeing this?

2179
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,460
Wow.

2180
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,340
Yeah, this is a really slick device.

2181
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,420
It's a split keyboard, which is ironic,

2182
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,500
because I was just recently saying

2183
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:36,660
this original Microsoft ergonomic QWERTY split keyboard

2184
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,460
is how I became a touch typist.

2185
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:39,300
Oh, really?

2186
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,140
And that was what took me up to a really fast typist,

2187
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:43,980
and I kinda wish I still had that.

2188
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:48,340
This is the Model 01.

2189
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:49,980
They say it's the best keyboard they can make,

2190
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:51,500
and it's not like other keyboards.

2191
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,780
They milled the Model 01 from two blocks of solid maple.

2192
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:59,700
It feels good to rest your hand on the wood.

2193
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,740
Instead of shallow, uncomfortable key switches,

2194
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:07,340
they use glorious, tactile, mechanical key switches

2195
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:10,660
similar to those found in the original Apple II.

2196
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:15,660
They've custom sculpted each of the 64 individual keycaps

2197
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:18,420
on the Model 01 to gently guide your fingers

2198
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,460
to the right keys.

2199
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:23,260
It's heirloom construction, they say.

2200
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:24,220
I love that.

2201
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,340
I think this, here, I'll play a little bit of their video.

2202
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,180
This is pretty cool.

2203
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,300
How hard could this be?

2204
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,980
And then we built the best keyboard we possibly could.

2205
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,700
It's not what you'd expect from a keyboard,

2206
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,420
but people love it.

2207
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:38,820
Creating a keyboard is kind of a weird thing.

2208
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:39,940
It's been an obsession.

2209
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,660
Hi, I'm Jesse Vincent.

2210
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:47,220
I'm co-founder and CTO of Keyboardio.

2211
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:48,300
I'm Kaia Decker.

2212
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,260
I'm the CEO of Keyboardio.

2213
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,900
I'm also married to Jesse.

2214
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,700
I've actually, before we go any further,

2215
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,540
you know what, I've talked to both these individuals

2216
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:59,260
in person, and I've used the original prototypes,

2217
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:01,940
and I can tell you, they've been obsessing about this

2218
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,940
for a very long time.

2219
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:08,540
This is a discussion we had with them in 2015.

2220
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:11,140
We're here with Kaia with a Keyboardio, is that right?

2221
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:12,780
Keyboardio, that's us.

2222
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:13,620
All right, Keyboardio.

2223
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:17,020
So now, there is a lot of talk of different keyboards.

2224
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:19,780
They have the SteelSeries, and they have DOS Keyboard,

2225
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:21,300
and then there's the people that just use the one

2226
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,220
that comes with their OEM ship.

2227
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,900
What is it that sets Keyboardio apart?

2228
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,220
What is Keyboardio?

2229
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:30,740
Sure, so Keyboardio is an open hardware project,

2230
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:32,580
which is why we're here at Oscon,

2231
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,700
and it is a cover project,

2232
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:37,220
and it's designed to be used in a variety of ways.

2233
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:39,940
And it is a comfortable, ergonomic keyword,

2234
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:43,900
so it's built around the shape your hands work,

2235
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:47,420
so it's designed to be more comfortable to type on

2236
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:49,420
for long periods of time,

2237
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:52,140
and it also was designed by a programmer

2238
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,260
as the primary designer,

2239
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:56,260
so there's a lot of things that you type more often

2240
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:57,980
if you're a programmer, or a sys admin,

2241
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:00,500
or someone else who does that type of work

2242
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,140
that we've moved into especially easy-to-hit places.

2243
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:05,580
So, brackets, for example,

2244
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:09,100
I'm sure probably take a huge high priority then?

2245
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,820
Yeah, so brackets,

2246
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:12,860
instead of being off on the side to your pinky,

2247
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:15,020
they're just right above home row.

2248
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,580
You hit, you can hold down the function key,

2249
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:19,100
and hit U-I-O-P,

2250
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,740
and that gets you your curly and your straight brackets.

2251
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:26,100
WASD moves the mouse if you hold down function.

2252
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:29,420
H-A-K-L move the arrow keys,

2253
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:33,420
which if you use VI or BIM might be familiar.

2254
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:38,420
Yeah, and any keys that you hit and hold down,

2255
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,620
what's called cording,

2256
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,820
so control, or shift, or command,

2257
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:44,260
we've taken off of your pinkies and put onto your thumbs,

2258
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:47,140
which is a lot better for you ergonomically,

2259
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:50,580
and yeah, it feels comfortable,

2260
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:53,100
it's a little bit faster, it's better.

2261
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,100
So, you said that this was designed

2262
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,900
specifically to be more ergonomic,

2263
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:59,220
and you used the word typewriter,

2264
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,380
and so, can you give me a little bit of history

2265
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,700
about how the typewriter keyboard was designed?

2266
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,580
Yeah, I mean, so there's a lot of,

2267
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:08,420
people have written entire theses

2268
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:10,980
on the typewriter and the QWERTY layout.

2269
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:11,940
Maybe just the clip notes.

2270
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:16,780
Yeah, so it's, I mean, it was literally designed

2271
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:19,180
in the late 19th century,

2272
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:24,100
and so, it was based around what you could build then.

2273
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:26,780
So, everything was laid out in rows,

2274
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:31,220
touch typing was actually invented after QWERTY was invented,

2275
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,620
and so, you know, there's different stories

2276
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:36,220
that I don't know if any of them have been proven around.

2277
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:38,620
Oh, it was designed so that it was

2278
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:40,700
maximally inefficient to type on.

2279
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,620
One of my favorite stories is that

2280
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,940
why shift is on your pinky,

2281
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:49,740
as opposed to sort of in a more convenient place,

2282
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:52,780
and the reason is, is originally there'd been

2283
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:55,460
an uppercase typewriter and a lowercase typewriter,

2284
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,860
and they figured out, oh, you can literally shift

2285
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:59,900
the plate and the thing that the hammer strikes

2286
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:02,740
on a typewriter, but they'd already done their tooling

2287
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,780
for the little hammers, and so, they're like,

2288
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:07,300
well, we'll just put it on the side.

2289
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:11,180
And so, like, one lazy engineer put shift on the side there,

2290
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,980
which is why, you know, now control and command

2291
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:16,220
and all these other things that didn't exist

2292
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:19,100
when the typewriter and the QWERTY layout was invented

2293
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,860
ended up there, and so, we've, you know,

2294
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:24,460
moved them into a place that we think is more sensible

2295
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:27,860
for the way that people use keyboards and computing today.

2296
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:32,100
Well, regardless of, regardless of if it can be proven

2297
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,700
that the keyboard was designed to be

2298
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:36,220
maximally inefficient, as you put it,

2299
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:38,380
there's no contesting the fact that

2300
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:40,140
if you have a hammer that rises up,

2301
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,380
that hammer takes a certain amount of time

2302
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,320
to fall back down, so if you had two of them

2303
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,900
that are crossed from each other and they hit,

2304
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,580
that'd be a bad day.

2305
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:49,100
So, yeah, I would imagine that some design went into,

2306
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,780
it certainly wasn't designed for optimum typing, right?

2307
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,060
Yeah, definitely.

2308
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,460
So, tell me some of the advantages of your keyboard

2309
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,860
versus, like, the programmable ones that I can buy

2310
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,980
in Best Buy or Office Max or Newegg.

2311
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:04,700
Sure, so it's programmable with the Arduino IDE,

2312
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:07,820
so we're going to have, we haven't built it yet,

2313
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:10,840
but have a sort of software GUI configurator,

2314
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:15,380
and then it's also, if you want to do really crazy things,

2315
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:17,980
you can, so if you want to extend it

2316
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,520
by making it wireless or Bluetooth,

2317
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,660
we give you all the pins that you have on an Arduino,

2318
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,780
so you can hook up anything that works

2319
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:28,420
in the Arduino ecosystem, and it'll work,

2320
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:30,320
play nicely with it.

2321
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,260
In addition, it's mechanical keys,

2322
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:35,400
like the comfortable layout and so on,

2323
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,260
I think are a big benefit, but in terms of programmability,

2324
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:40,380
we're trying to give people as much rope

2325
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,500
as they want to play with,

2326
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,700
like actually give you firmware source

2327
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,220
as opposed to saying, well,

2328
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:47,980
you could remap the key here and there.

2329
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,620
It's like, it's really, truly fully programmable.

2330
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:51,820
So, right now, these keyboards,

2331
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:54,500
they're being programmed with like a config file?

2332
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:58,340
Yeah, so it's a couple of text files right now,

2333
01:20:58,340 --> 01:20:59,940
is the way it works.

2334
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:03,160
There's, yeah, we're going to make it

2335
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:07,820
so that it's easy to do through a graphical interface,

2336
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:11,060
but yeah, the way it works inside

2337
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:13,980
is actually sort of astonishingly simple in some ways.

2338
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:15,820
I think that would appeal to a lot of Linux users.

2339
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:17,660
We're really used to just opening up a text file

2340
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,180
and changing the things we want.

2341
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,300
Now, where is that text file stored?

2342
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,460
Is that stored on the keyboard itself

2343
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,360
or on the computer?

2344
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,620
It's stored on the keyboard itself,

2345
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,820
and one of the things, I used to be an Emacs user,

2346
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:28,780
and my.emacs file was full of all these

2347
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:30,180
weird configurations and stuff,

2348
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:32,700
and I liked it because I could take it with me

2349
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,140
from computer to computer,

2350
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:38,860
and when I moved away from using Linux and Emacs

2351
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:42,540
as my primary operating system and text editor,

2352
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,580
I noticed there wasn't really that

2353
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:48,540
for arbitrary operating system,

2354
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:50,420
arbitrary key bindings and stuff,

2355
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:52,820
and so it was important to us to not build something

2356
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:54,100
where you have to install a driver

2357
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,580
just to use a keyboard, right?

2358
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,860
Don't install special software

2359
01:21:56,860 --> 01:21:58,620
just to use the keyboard to type,

2360
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:01,060
so any changes you make,

2361
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:04,140
you can put it onto the keyboard and flash it there,

2362
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:07,260
and it will go with you from whatever,

2363
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:10,540
laptop to desktop to work computer to home computer.

2364
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:11,820
Now, is there software that I have to have

2365
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:14,100
to flash the new config onto the keyboard,

2366
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:16,140
or can I somehow plug it in

2367
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,780
and open a text file and edit it?

2368
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:22,780
Right now, I think you would need to install the Arduino IDE,

2369
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,940
which is free and open and easy.

2370
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,540
I think we're planning on changing that,

2371
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:30,380
but that's probably a question for Jesse

2372
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,500
in terms of the actual,

2373
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:35,980
he's the guy who's doing the software engineering for it, so.

2374
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:36,920
Anything else you wanna add,

2375
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:37,760
or if somebody's interested

2376
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,020
in purchasing one of these fine keyboards,

2377
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,860
where they would go to pick one up?

2378
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:45,860
Sure, go to keyboard.io, keyboardio, or keyboardio.com.

2379
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:47,900
We've got a ton of info on our website.

2380
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,900
If they have any questions,

2381
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:53,140
we're real people answering our email,

2382
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:55,140
and are happy to talk with anyone about keyboards.

2383
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,700
It's fun to nerd out about it with people, so, yeah.

2384
01:22:58,700 --> 01:22:59,540
Well, thank you very much

2385
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:00,420
for taking the time to speak with us.

2386
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:01,340
We really appreciate it.

2387
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,740
Yeah, thank you, my pleasure.

2388
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:04,420
So, the cool thing now that they've done

2389
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:06,260
with the model that's gone up for pre-order now

2390
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:07,580
is they've kind of gone back a little bit.

2391
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,420
They're doing it QWERTY style to begin with,

2392
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:10,700
so it's not all that crazy,

2393
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,980
but it still has the Arduino Linux computer in it

2394
01:23:12,980 --> 01:23:14,620
that is fully programmable,

2395
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:18,620
that you can reset up and replace the keycaps if you want.

2396
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:19,460
And you know what?

2397
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:22,460
I have been recently reconsidering my position on keyboards,

2398
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:23,900
and since this has been something

2399
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,540
we have covered across multiple shows,

2400
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,020
it's got Linux running this thing,

2401
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:28,420
I think I'm gonna pre-order this.

2402
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,420
I'm gonna get it here in the studio.

2403
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,020
I'm gonna have it as my main keyboard.

2404
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,980
And so, I sent an email and said,

2405
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,360
hey guys, I wanna buy one,

2406
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:35,460
and I think I'm gonna do it with it.

2407
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:36,740
That is awesome.

2408
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:37,900
Yeah, I think it's nice.

2409
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,620
It's gonna look way better than your current setup?

2410
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:41,460
Yeah, oh my gosh.

2411
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:42,480
Yeah, well, this is just a free keyboard

2412
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,320
that came with the case.

2413
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,160
Oh, yeah, really?

2414
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,940
Yeah, so it's not that high-end.

2415
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:47,520
Yeah, it's just some, look at this,

2416
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,860
it's got, see how it says it's like bi-thermal take on there?

2417
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,100
Oh, you're right.

2418
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:52,940
I would never have thought,

2419
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:54,820
because it has like the blue backlit keys.

2420
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:56,300
It looks like a gamer keyboard.

2421
01:23:56,300 --> 01:24:01,300
No, it's also got like this Borg insignia style circuitry

2422
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,480
that's just lit up.

2423
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,020
Yeah, where this is like a,

2424
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,180
this is a proper set piece.

2425
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,020
Craftsman.

2426
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,940
When I do videos inside the studio,

2427
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:09,400
this is something that'll catch the eye.

2428
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,100
But on top of that, this is a project

2429
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,100
we've literally been following for years now.

2430
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,700
And I don't know, I got a soft spot for keyboards

2431
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:19,460
that run Linux made out of wood.

2432
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:21,540
Don't we all?

2433
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:26,980
I wonder how it compares to something like ErgoDox.

2434
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:31,300
Yeah, or DOS keyboard, or my Logitech G19,

2435
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,980
or yeah, yeah, I'm a little nervous.

2436
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:33,820
I am a little nervous.

2437
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:37,940
Well, actually, I mean, ErgoDox is a more

2438
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,860
similar comparison, right?

2439
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:44,240
Because ErgoDox is a DIY split keyboard

2440
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,540
that's designed to be more ergonomic.

2441
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:50,900
It has the, most designs have the shifted columns,

2442
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,840
just like the Keyboardio.

2443
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,500
And they're both designed,

2444
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,180
the way I see it is Keyboardio is maybe

2445
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:06,180
keyboard designed by people who are passionate

2446
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:09,740
about keyboards for people who just like good keyboards,

2447
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:14,740
whereas ErgoDox is a keyboard that's designed

2448
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:19,860
by people who are passionate about keyboards

2449
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:22,220
for other people who are also really passionate

2450
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,060
about keyboards.

2451
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:24,860
I think Keyboardio is-

2452
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:26,860
Not until recently, I think-

2453
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:30,620
At $329 before you pay for fancy shipping,

2454
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:33,700
Keyboardio is for people who want something

2455
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:34,980
special and unique.

2456
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,940
It fits that category.

2457
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:38,740
Like I'm looking at their keyboard layout

2458
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:42,060
and it's a little different to the LED light controls

2459
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:43,940
where I would expect my tilde to be.

2460
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:45,180
And there's things like that,

2461
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,020
they're gonna be a little bit of an adjustment.

2462
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,100
So we'll see how it goes.

2463
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,300
But it feels like it's,

2464
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:53,160
if you are a collector of fine art,

2465
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:54,740
this would be sort of equivalent to that.

2466
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:56,980
And it's much cheaper than that.

2467
01:25:56,980 --> 01:25:59,180
And I like that it's open design,

2468
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:02,980
it's open hardware, and it's easily reprogrammable.

2469
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:06,700
So there could be a potential, this is my thought,

2470
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,100
there could be a potential for this

2471
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:10,860
to be a very nice control surface for OBS.

2472
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,700
The OBS upstream-

2473
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:15,100
You've got your crazy hotkeys keyed in there, oh man.

2474
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,940
OBS upstream is working on

2475
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:19,220
some pretty sophisticated hotkey support.

2476
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:21,860
And if I end up deciding that this is a no good,

2477
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:23,740
this is bunk as a keyboard,

2478
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:25,980
and the fact that we can replace the keycaps

2479
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,220
and the underlying Arduino is reprogrammable,

2480
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:31,660
this I feel like will be a pretty good OBS controller too.

2481
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:34,100
So I kind of feel like I am kind of in a nice position

2482
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,260
to test it out and see how it goes.

2483
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:36,620
And I'll report back.

2484
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,780
The keyboard thing has been fun.

2485
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:41,700
Mohs and Rath, you found a G19 in Canada?

2486
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:42,540
Where?

2487
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,580
Actually, I can't find it again.

2488
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:47,700
I actually had found it on Kijiji.

2489
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,020
I'm currently looking as we speak.

2490
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:52,460
It was in Port Hope, Ontario.

2491
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:55,220
I'm completely serious.

2492
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:56,900
I found it last week and we were sitting there

2493
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:57,740
talking about it,

2494
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:01,340
because my friends say with some truth

2495
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,540
that I have a hoarding problem,

2496
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:06,300
which has translated to a purchasing problem

2497
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:09,820
of specifically Logitech keyboards.

2498
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:13,340
And I have a G15, a G11, a G105.

2499
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:17,420
I gave another friend of mine a G105, a G110.

2500
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:20,260
There might be another one around here somewhere.

2501
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:21,180
I don't know.

2502
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,020
Love it.

2503
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:25,340
But I actually did find one.

2504
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:28,460
And if I find it again before the end of the show

2505
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:30,900
or even shortly after the show, I will let you know.

2506
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:32,540
I'm really in the search mode for it right now.

2507
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,980
Nice, stay tuned and find out.

2508
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,940
You know, I think that's sort of an interesting note

2509
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:37,780
to end on right there.

2510
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:39,180
And Mohs and Rath, don't beat up on yourself

2511
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:42,380
because it's not that you are a hoarder,

2512
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:47,220
it's that you are documenting a precious time of development

2513
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:48,060
in our society.

2514
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,220
In 20 years, you'll have a museum on your hands.

2515
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:53,300
Yeah, you are at the forefront of witnessing

2516
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:55,980
some of the most rapid progress in humanity.

2517
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:57,460
And you can't feel too bad about that.

2518
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:58,940
At least you can tell yourself that

2519
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:01,060
and try to self-rationalize with that line.

2520
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:01,900
You're welcome.

2521
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,260
Hey, if you'd like to join us live next week,

2522
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:06,140
go over to jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

2523
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:08,980
There is some calendar changes coming up in the future

2524
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:09,820
because I'll be traveling.

2525
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:11,980
So check out jubilabroadcasting.com slash calendar

2526
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:13,380
where you can find the live times

2527
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:14,820
and get it converted in your local time.

2528
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:18,460
I'm at chrislas, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

2529
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:20,740
All of that shenanigans and a post show

2530
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,060
right here next week.

2531
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:46,020
Put it down in the comments below.

2532
01:28:46,020 --> 01:29:15,060
All right, let's go pick a title, JBtitles.com.

2533
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:19,420
Can I just say I'm loving this keyboard thing we're doing in this last episode?

2534
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:20,420
I know, it's funny.

2535
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:21,420
It's really fun.

2536
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:23,780
It's been totally organic, and it is kind of fun to talk about this because it's something

2537
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:28,460
we all use, and I can't believe I found another keyboard that runs Linux.

2538
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:29,460
I got to get it.

2539
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,500
If I find it, it's been years since I found another keyboard that runs Linux.

2540
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,500
You have to have it.

2541
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,500
I like it.

2542
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:40,660
Cow tipping is not a bad, although we've already had cow in Linux action show, but JBtitles.com,

2543
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:46,660
making IT steampunk, making it snappy, snap, snap, the snappy snaps, I don't know.

2544
01:29:46,660 --> 01:29:47,660
Are we feeling that?

2545
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:49,000
Are we feeling that?

2546
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
That's a lot of snap.

2547
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Mozan, did you find it before we get out of here?

2548
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,660
Did you find it?

2549
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:54,660
Oh.

2550
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:57,660
Get it out of here.

2551
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:58,660
That'd be a negative.

2552
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:06,620
Yeah, we have a couple of different Telegram threads that we're using for conversations

2553
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:10,220
that are related to what might work on user error or something like that.

2554
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:15,480
And so, sometimes things come up, and we're like, man, this is a show topic, but they

2555
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:20,980
come up a week before we record user error, and by the time we sit down to record user

2556
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:23,700
error, even with the Telegram thread there, we can't find it.

2557
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:24,700
We can't remember it.

2558
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:25,700
Same thing with Slack and similar things.

2559
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:26,700
Yeah, yeah.

2560
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:29,820
So in Telegram, there is a to-do bot.

2561
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:32,420
So why not use this bot to say to-do?

2562
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:38,580
Use a to-do list manager as topic show manager, basically, because that pretty much translates.

2563
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:43,780
And so I added a bot, and I start working with it, and then my first time I work with

2564
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:44,780
it, I get a response.

2565
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:48,580
And then after that, I never could get the bot to do anything, and I have no idea if

2566
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:53,980
the server the bot runs is offline, if there's some sort of account issue with me.

2567
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:56,260
Other bots seem to be working okay.

2568
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:57,940
I have no way to troubleshoot.

2569
01:30:57,940 --> 01:30:59,740
There's no error message returned to me.

2570
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:00,740
Not a phone number to call.

2571
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:03,900
And it's like computers work with ones and zeros.

2572
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,700
So send me back a one or a zero.

2573
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:07,700
Don't just say nothing.

2574
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:08,700
Yeah, right.

2575
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:09,700
I don't understand it.

2576
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:13,420
You've got to give him credit.

2577
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:16,140
He made the jump right as the new MacBooks are about to be announced.

2578
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:17,140
I know.

2579
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,140
I was going to say.

2580
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,140
No, he's like, screw that.

2581
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,140
I'm moving forward with this.

2582
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:21,140
Homey don't play anymore.

2583
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:26,060
Is there a big TLDR for why he wanted to switch platforms?

2584
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:31,040
The future of platforms for independent software development is probably in the hands of Linux

2585
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,340
and many of those servers on the cloud run Ubuntu.

2586
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:34,340
Yeah, there you go.

2587
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:41,700
I think he's placing a big bet on AI and bots, AI slash bots, to sell bots as business contracts

2588
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:42,900
to develop software.

2589
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:47,500
Also, I think he also figures, I mean, you'd have to listen to yesterday's quarter radio

2590
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:54,980
to get the full context, but I think he also figures that the app ecosystem is pretty commoditized

2591
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:55,980
now.

2592
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:56,980
Sure.

2593
01:31:56,980 --> 01:32:01,660
And most good apps that are worth their salt anyways have a huge back end infrastructure.

2594
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:03,000
Yeah, absolutely.

2595
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:09,760
So why not focus as a primary on the back end, on Linux, running on Linux, and then

2596
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:14,420
offer iOS and Android apps as part of the entire package, because so far his business

2597
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:19,520
has primarily been around developing apps for iOS and Android and some Mac desktop apps.

2598
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,820
With back ends when needed.

2599
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:21,820
Yeah.

2600
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:25,340
And so now he's going to pivot and do back ends as the primary focus, and hey, as part

2601
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:29,680
of the entire package, we'll also write the web front end, the iOS front end, the Android

2602
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:30,680
front end.

2603
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:31,680
That makes sense.

2604
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:34,900
So all those things are going with progressive web apps or React Native and those kinds of

2605
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:35,900
things.

2606
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:39,900
And so in his mind, he's like, well, why do I need to spend $2,800 on a MacBook Pro when

2607
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:45,140
I could spend $800 on a Lemur and develop on the same OS that I'm going to be deploying

2608
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,140
on?

2609
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:50,180
And I think the fact that Docker is just right there is a useful thing for him because Docker

2610
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:55,060
allows him to experiment and sort of rapidly try things.

2611
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:57,020
The cost of changing things up is like nothing.

2612
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:59,780
And you know, I've been saying this for a while, I really think there's going to be

2613
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:05,460
a lot of server-side developers and web developers that look at the Mac platform and say, OK,

2614
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:09,820
well, this new MacBook, yeah, it's got a fingerprint sensor, it's got this OLED bar on here that

2615
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:14,420
changes for the few people who wrote software that support it.

2616
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:18,300
But Mac OS itself is not going in a direction I want, it's not getting to be stable, it's

2617
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:21,100
not taking advantage of the Unix underpinnings the way I wish it would.

2618
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:22,620
Yeah, it hasn't become a better Unix.

2619
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:24,020
No, it's not at all.

2620
01:33:24,020 --> 01:33:26,140
It's gotten to be worse.

2621
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:28,380
And so I think when you're looking, well, geez, I'm just going to be creating apps for

2622
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:37,380
the cloud, cloud, anyways, why not get hardware that gets iterated faster, there's more choice,

2623
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:42,580
and the desktop OS is agnostic as to which vendor I go with.

2624
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:45,780
Because even in that scenario, you could eventually choose to go back to the MacBook hardware

2625
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:46,780
if you wanted to.

2626
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:47,860
Yeah, sure, definitely.

2627
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:52,900
So I don't, I'm not, I think this is going to be a huge win for Linux, sort of like a

2628
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,860
slow boil scale.

2629
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:57,260
Slow boil scale, I like that.

2630
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:58,260
We will see.

2631
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:59,180
Linux slow boil.
