1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
Wow, an abominable winter ale West brings us.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,080
World class beer, sustainable, Portland, Oregon.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:18,080
17 degrees, 70 IBU, 17 degrees.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,080
What is that?

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,240
17 degrees, Plato?

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
What is that?

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,440
I've never even heard of that.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,240
It's like a beer metric, because it's like, it says it's 70, it's got a 70 IBU, which

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,280
is International Bitterness Unit, it's got an alcohol volume of 7.3%, those are all things

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,120
I understand on the side of a beer, and then it's got, it's one pint, I understand what

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,680
that is, but then it says 11 degrees, Plato.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,720
You guys ever heard of that on a beer before?

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,080
Maybe I'm, am I, it's P-L-A-T-O, right, that's Plato, yeah, I mean.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,080
It's a beer, come on.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
What does that mean?

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,080
That means it's degrees proof?

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
What does that mean, Diddle?

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,360
There's apparently a Wikipedia page about beer measurement, which mentions degrees

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Plato.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
Really?

21
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
I've never heard of that before.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,160
No, I've never heard of it either.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,480
Wait, they can increase philosophers in there?

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,080
Did you see that this has a beer measurement metric on it, which I've never seen, this

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,000
thing is 7 degrees, 17 degrees Plato.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,760
It's got a 70 IBU, and a 7.3% alcohol by volume, and a 17 degree Plato.

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,320
Wow.

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,400
How many Platos do I want?

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
I don't know.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,320
I think this is the most Platos I've ever been aware of.

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
Compared to zero?

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,240
I know, I'm like thinking, is this like the philosopher?

33
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,320
Like this is how many beers, this is how many of these Plato would have drank?

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,720
Boy, he could knock them back.

35
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
Yeah.

36
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,240
Apparently, it's Fritz Plato.

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,240
It's what?

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
Exactly.

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,600
German chemist Fritz Plato.

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,760
Oh, I see.

41
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,260
The Plato scale differs slightly from the Bolling scale, whatever that, or the Baling,

42
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,400
what is this?

43
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Which is the, okay, the measurement of specific gravity used to determine the dissolved solid.

44
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Oh, wow.

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Oh, wow.

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,780
Oh, so you're getting, you're getting like, you get to know how, how they measured it.

47
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,500
So this is like a dish, this is like really, this is for people that are really into beer,

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,500
is what that is.

49
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,200
That's, you know what that is?

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,980
That's a little nod to like, if you're drinking this beer, you're a beer connoisseur.

51
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,640
So we're going to tell you about, you get to know everything.

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Even the Platos.

53
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Interesting.

54
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,720
beerandbrewing.com, I mean, they would seem to be the ones to know.

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,220
The Plato scale is used by most brewers worldwide, although brewers in the UK and those using

56
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,820
British brewing traditions tend to prefer to use the specific gravity scale instead.

57
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,160
This is derived by measuring the specific gravity of the wort, multiplying by 1000 and

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,400
then subtracting 1000 from that figure to give the degrees of gravity.

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,160
Thus a wort is specific gravity of 1.048 is said to have a 48 degrees of gravity.

60
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,580
The Plato and gravity scales can be approximated by multiplying P by four to give the degrees

61
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,580
of gravity.

62
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,580
Well, there you go guys, duh.

63
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,580
Didn't we know this?

64
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,220
See, drink beer and you learn things.

65
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,120
It's some science.

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:20,600
This is Linux Unplugged episode 180 for January 17th, 2017.

67
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,740
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that prepared for this week's episode

68
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,760
by learning more about how to measure your beer.

69
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
My name is Chris.

70
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
My name is Wes.

71
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
It's true fact.

72
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
True fact.

73
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,560
We actually did learn a little something about beer today.

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,640
I love the pre-show.

75
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,640
Wes, we have so many project updates.

76
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,760
I actually started today thinking we wouldn't have much to talk about.

77
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,160
I know, but people have been busy.

78
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Yeah, they have.

79
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,840
We got some good ones to go through, so we'll start with that.

80
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,320
Then we have a new distribution that says it's inspired by material design.

81
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,480
It's going to create cohesive Linux desktop and apps.

82
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,680
I know, it's a totally radical idea.

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,120
I've never heard it before.

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,360
So we're going to take a look at a new distro you likely haven't heard about today.

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,200
Then there's some crazy kids releasing some crazy assistant on that crazy Raspberry Pi,

86
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
the Crasberry.

87
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Raspberry Pi.

88
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Crasberry.

89
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
I got one.

90
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Here it is, Wes.

91
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Look, I think I found it.

92
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Right here, I got a Pi 3.

93
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Pi 3, right in the box.

94
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,240
If we had a screen for this sucker and a keyboard and a mouse, I'd say we should try it live

95
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,840
on the show today, but we'll tell you about it and how you can try it out and maybe report

96
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
back.

97
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,620
Then at the end, I'll be getting some feedback, so I'm going to address something that we've

98
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,320
been covering on the show recently, and it's generated a lot of feedback in the audience.

99
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,520
Chris has got to get real with you guys for just a minute.

100
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Just a minute.

101
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
We're going to take it a moment.

102
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Heart to heart?

103
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
Yeah.

104
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Just a little real talk at the end of the show.

105
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Our minds to your mind?

106
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Mind-meld kind of thing.

107
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Yeah.

108
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,320
So that's coming up on episode 180 of the Unplugged program.

109
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,880
Lots of stuff to get into, and more stuff that I couldn't even remember right there

110
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
during the intro.

111
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,120
But one thing I can't forget is that Mumble Room.

112
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,680
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

113
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Greetings.

114
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Hello.

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Hello.

116
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,560
It's good to see all of you, and I'm glad to have you all here to help us go through

117
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
the week's news.

118
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,760
So let's start with this first story, which I kind of think is maybe one of the bigger

119
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
stories.

120
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,200
It's definitely an interesting trend that's developing.

121
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:26,120
It's now possible to use OpenSUSE inside Windows 10 using that Linux sublayer.

122
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,360
Seuss's senior product manager was intrigued by the fact that Microsoft chose to enable

123
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,920
the wrong Linux distribution.

124
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,360
Ooh, strong words.

125
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,640
By default.

126
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,440
So within the Windows subsystem for Linux used by the company's latest Windows 10 builds,

127
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,600
and he decided with his own agenda, he would go off and teach people how to use Seuss inside

128
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
of WSL.

129
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,280
And he says, why Seuss?

130
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,960
And this is some really sound, solid reasoning.

131
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,160
Really gets me fired up to go try this.

132
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,360
Why Seuss?

133
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:03,400
Well, Seuss knows what they are doing because they have been in Linux business since 1992.

134
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,440
Try to find a Linux vendor, or in that case, a distributor, which is older.

135
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,740
You won't.

136
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,000
There aren't any.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,120
That was the senior product manager's solid endorsement for using Seuss, is because Seuss

138
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
is old.

139
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Fired up.

140
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,320
You know, I think people sometimes ask Chris, say, hey, Chris, how do you say, is it Seussa,

141
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
is it Seuss?

142
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Is it open Seuss?

143
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,520
Is it lowercase O, uppercase O, all uppercase, lowercase U?

144
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,960
Part of the confusion might come from when your own team doesn't even use the right language.

145
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,800
So the product manager at Seuss is calling open Seuss, Seuss.

146
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,920
Which just confuses the general public.

147
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,560
And then the news article is rightfully just quoting the words of the senior product manager,

148
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,440
who's calling another product, open Seuss, the name of his own product.

149
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,280
Which is like, yeah, okay, maybe it works for the people who, like, you're all using

150
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
it and you're familiar.

151
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,600
But for any outside observer, it's just, yeah, it's just confusing.

152
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,480
Now, that aside, pretty interesting to see this developing pretty quickly.

153
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,920
The Windows Linux subsystem, or whatever it's called.

154
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Windows Subsystem for Linux?

155
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Yes, I think that's it.

156
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
WSL?

157
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
WSL.

158
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Pretty cool.

159
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,960
And the instructions do work probably, I believe, I have not confirmed any of this, but I believe

160
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,920
they also work for Seuss Linux Enterprise, so you can also run Sles on there.

161
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,240
I would want to try, I think I would definitely want to, if I was doing this, I would definitely

162
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,680
want to try Sles, because that seems to make the most sense, because if I'm doing this

163
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,520
on Windows, it's probably to match my server environment that I manage.

164
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
That's kind of what I envision.

165
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,720
Probably a dev or admin who needs to test stuff locally.

166
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,100
Yeah, you've got Sles servers, and you want to have a common local environment, just so

167
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,640
it's sort of the same, I think, the big draw for having Ubuntu.

168
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,120
So have we seen Fedora or Centos on the sub, I don't know.

169
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
No, I don't think so.

170
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
I haven't seen it.

171
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,880
We do see, there is a couple of different efforts to get Arch on the Windows subsystem

172
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
for Linux.

173
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,400
Here's one I have linked in the show notes where you can get Arch on there, which would

174
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,680
seem to look a little bit like what just needs to be done, you know, obviously it's not that

175
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,200
much if they're all getting it working, I'm sure it's just some dealing with the boot,

176
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,260
maybe getting the, not boot, but starting the user land, getting everything working.

177
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,260
This makes a lot of sense.

178
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,760
In this screenshot for Arch under the Windows subsystem for Linux, they're using your work,

179
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,360
and now if you got access to a lot of the AUR command line applications on the Windows

180
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,600
Linux subsystem, that would be very useful.

181
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,400
I know they're just poking fun, but to say that Microsoft chose to enable the wrong default

182
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,320
distro, I feel like that's sort of the opposite of the truth.

183
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,560
It's obviously the right distro because of the massive cloud penetration, and that's

184
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,320
really why Windows admins want it in the first place and not really why anyone was ever asking

185
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,320
for SUSE.

186
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,400
It's also funny to kind of imply like, well, Canonical jumped at this or worked with them

187
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
to develop this.

188
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
You guys did not.

189
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,160
It's hard to make that wrong when they were the ones taking some of the initiative here.

190
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,360
Right, that is true, although it does demonstrate that there's nothing specific about WSL to

191
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Ubuntu.

192
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,360
That, I think, is the more promising thing.

193
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,120
Is anybody in the Mumble Room trying this or using this?

194
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,400
I thought about it for a hot moment over the weekend, I thought about trying it because

195
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,440
I saw this story come up, and I thought to myself, I wouldn't mind dual booting into

196
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,960
a system and trying Premiere again, and then using this for the tools I would undoubtedly

197
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,160
need while I'm there, and I could see a use for that, but I just can't bring myself to

198
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
use Windows.

199
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Then you have to install Windows.

200
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
That's the most painful part.

201
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Yeah, yeah.

202
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,720
The thing is, we're not the target audience for this, really.

203
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,760
It's people who run Windows full-time who want to have an environment in which they

204
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,040
can run Linux-y tools natively just in a window.

205
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,960
Your audience are probably not likely to use it, and not likely to use it on a daily basis,

206
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,320
but someone whose employment demands that they run Windows, but they want to be able

207
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
to have a shell.

208
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,200
There's probably a fair amount of people listening.

209
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,840
I see a huge thing for the enterprise where it's like, yeah, your developers are complaining.

210
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,720
Maybe they want MacBooks, but if you can be like, no, here's our already-domained, everything's

211
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,120
in Windows already for everyone else.

212
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Here's your Linux shell.

213
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
Go crazy.

214
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,960
That's a pretty big sell and a good compromise for a lot of people.

215
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,080
Yeah, especially if you can offer them a piece of hardware that's attractive, like some of

216
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,840
those XPS 13s and 15s.

217
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:30,040
If you run Windows 10 on that, and then you put SUSE or ARCH or Ubuntu on the subsystem,

218
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,400
that does seem like just the right mix of enterprise compromise for people that need

219
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,200
to use the rest of the Microsoft ecosystem like Active Directory.

220
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
It's interesting to see this developing.

221
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,560
I just wanted to give them a shout-out.

222
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,720
More so than that, guys, if you want to try SUSE out or open SUSE on your Windows 10 box,

223
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,360
there is instructions in this article on how to get it set up, and then the one we've linked

224
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,200
for ARCH, it's a script that does it for you, I believe, and it gives you a minimal ARCH

225
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,960
Linux distro that you can then go out crazy on.

226
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Can we run the show in it?

227
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Do a whole episode?

228
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Yes.

229
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Run from subsystem for Linux?

230
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,840
I don't really feel all that fired up.

231
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,640
I don't really feel too fired up about that, Wes.

232
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,480
You know what I am fired up about, though?

233
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,920
N1 going free.

234
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,720
Now they're calling it Nileus Mail instead of Nileus N1, and they're introducing Nileus

235
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Basic.

236
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Basic.

237
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,620
I really am excited.

238
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,880
This is my mail client of choice.

239
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,040
I've been trying to very cautiously recommend it because it costs money for the Pro version,

240
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,820
and if you don't want to do any work, you have to run off their intermediary host, but

241
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
this is really nice.

242
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,040
So N1 has been renamed to Nileus Mail, and they're launching a free version of Nileus

243
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,100
Mail called Nileus Basic, and by free, they mean also open source.

244
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,100
That's great.

245
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,280
Yeah, I got the GitHub link linked in the show notes.

246
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,040
They're still working on it, so there's not much to see there yet.

247
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,460
So does this mean that they're comfortable enough with their monetization as a company

248
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,360
with their being Pro only for a while, that they're ready to... Because that was one

249
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,440
of the things I was a little disappointed at when they did go Pro only.

250
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,700
They still had the open source, but it felt like there was a lot of hoops to jump through.

251
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,000
They weren't really welcoming that tier, so now that there is a basic tier, does that

252
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
mean they're feeling more established?

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,640
I think it's the opposite.

254
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
I think it's the opposite.

255
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
They need more people.

256
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,560
They're hoping to sucker people in here.

257
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,580
Well, I don't know about sucker, but I think it didn't work out.

258
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,960
I think, first of all, it's funny.

259
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:26,760
Having been a Pro user, it was not easy to give them my money, and it was clunky, so

260
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,160
I would not be surprised if they saw not a big success with that.

261
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Plus, who wants to toss a bunch of money at a no-name company, at least a company you

262
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,760
don't know, building an upstart mail client that's Electron?

263
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,560
There's not a lot of people that are going to get in on that when you've got good old

264
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,040
Thunderbird sitting there.

265
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,920
So I think that was an uphill battle for them, and I'm betting this is more of a... Well,

266
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,000
this is a plan B. This is a bit of a pivot.

267
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Interesting.

268
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
Yeah, actually, it's funny you asked that.

269
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,240
Daniel from Elementary OS jumped into a conversation thread that we were having in the Linux Action

270
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,400
Show subreddit, where an Elias employee stopped by and said, there's no Linux builds yet,

271
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,320
but we're going to get them out soon.

272
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,560
And Daniel, before I jumped in, says, well, my big question is, what's your funding model?

273
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
How has it changed?

274
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
How are you going to remain profitable?

275
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,560
Oh, right.

276
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,040
He says, to me, hearing that this service is now free is scary.

277
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Who's the real customer?

278
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Am I now the product?

279
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,400
I think Daniel's asking some good questions.

280
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,720
So I'm excited that it's going open source, but I don't understand how they're going to

281
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
fund and continue development.

282
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,320
And I know a lot of you are probably like, I don't care.

283
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
I don't care.

284
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,120
Well, that's because you are so wrong about life right now.

285
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,680
It's a really good mail client, and you don't …

286
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,720
And it's nice to see innovation in this sector, like with Thunderbird being installed and

287
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Geary.

288
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Stop it.

289
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,560
It's disappointing that we can't be like, yeah, OK, we don't have Outlook.

290
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
But you don't want Outlook.

291
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
You want this better Linux product.

292
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,000
And so if there's a good open source client that we can tell people to use, that'd be

293
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
awesome.

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,340
Here's a fundamental problem I have with email.

295
00:13:52,340 --> 00:14:01,080
And this is something that Nyleas, I guess it is, Nyleas Mail, has made better for me.

296
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,960
Email is a son of a bitch because it allows anybody to all of a sudden create an expectation

297
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,240
of you without you even knowing that an expectation has been created and now being held against

298
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
you.

299
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,860
And so anybody can drop any turd in your inbox asking something of you, requesting something

300
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,080
of you, telling you about something, hey, FYI, heads up, any of these things, they all

301
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,680
create a different set of social expectations.

302
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,400
And we all have different internal calibrations of how we treat email.

303
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,380
For me, some weeks, I check my email once a week, maybe twice.

304
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,000
Some weeks, I check it daily.

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It really ranges.

306
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,800
But people that email me, I often get emails from people that I work with that expect me

307
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,160
to be responding, not at JB, but outside of JB.

308
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,320
People in JB know.

309
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,060
But outside of JB, people will often send me an email expecting me to respond within

310
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,720
the first maybe half hour I receive the email, let alone the day, right?

311
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,240
And it will be sometimes days before I get back to them, I just have to say, I'm sorry,

312
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,380
I've been busy.

313
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,300
And the thing that now mail does for me is it allows me to take a couple of extra steps

314
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,040
to manage that situation where I can take an email, get it out of my inbox, but then

315
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,840
have it come back later and say, you asked to be reminded about this tomorrow at 8 a.m.

316
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Guess what?

317
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
It's time.

318
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Here's that email again.

319
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,560
It's a simple function along with its really sophisticated read-receipt system that's better

320
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,400
than anything else out there before.

321
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,440
It has a great set of signatures and good support for GPG.

322
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,680
And now it's open source.

323
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,320
It is a very good mail client.

324
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,840
It works on every OS you want to use it on because it's Electron.

325
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,520
And if you're an Electron app hater, you're like, I don't want, I don't like the overhead

326
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,120
of an Electron app, that's so stupid.

327
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
I understand.

328
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
That was me.

329
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,320
I was totally that guy.

330
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,620
And then I got a few Electron apps that are actually pretty good because that's the thing.

331
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,640
There's bad Electron apps and there's good ones.

332
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,920
And this is one of the good ones.

333
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,440
So I think it's encouraging for Electron as an app platform.

334
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,040
It's encouraging for people that are looking for some innovation to make email not such

335
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,200
a life suck that it is.

336
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,240
It's great.

337
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,360
And I just, I don't feel like it gets enough attention.

338
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,960
I'm hoping now that they've gone this route, they've gone free, they've gone open source.

339
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
Maybe more people start talking about it.

340
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Hopefully they can be sustainable.

341
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Yeah.

342
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,880
I will say it seems like Electron fits well with your lifestyle where you're maybe distro

343
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,360
hopping or on random computers.

344
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,000
You don't have to worry about being in the package manager.

345
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,480
You know it can run.

346
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Yeah.

347
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
It is.

348
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,460
And also it's not like these are 3D games or video editors.

349
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,720
They're not something where I have to have the just unbelievable desktop performance.

350
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,320
And then let's get off our high horse here for a second and stop pretending like Qt and

351
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:39,040
GTK are these hyper optimized lightweight toolkits that make application rendering lightning

352
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,580
fast that no other.

353
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,960
We all know that's a load of crap.

354
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,520
But the Linux desktop is not the fastest snappiest desktop and part of it is the toolkit.

355
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,960
I mean one thing I hate about using Windows is that GDI system is so crappy and old and

356
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,640
the Windows toolkit, I forget what it's called, is such an ancient piece of crap and then

357
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:02,080
they managed to throw it all into a GPU buffer now post Vista or 7 even.

358
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,480
It actually like Windows fly open on Windows.

359
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,360
Like that's the one thing Windows is good at is actually opening Windows.

360
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,760
It's funny but that is actually what it's good at is opening and displaying Windows

361
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,160
very fast.

362
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,960
This you often with a super high end machine will still sometimes see parts your UI render.

363
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
So yeah we can be on our high horse about electron apps.

364
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,040
I hear that shit every time I talk about electron app.

365
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,520
I get emails and tweets.

366
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,140
The chat room goes on about it.

367
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,560
People watch the show afterwards and then come back in the chat room and trash.

368
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,120
Can't believe Chris is once again promoting electron apps.

369
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,080
People get all their high horse about electron apps.

370
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,580
Meanwhile Qt and GTK are not like they're the second coming to UI speed.

371
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,120
So just give it a shot.

372
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,320
If you have problems with email and for you you struggle with email like I do it's worth

373
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
looking at.

374
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,600
And they do have some pretty good stuff.

375
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,780
I've always enjoyed their blog posts.

376
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:50,720
They do some they have some interesting discussions about how they a lot of their stuff's in Python

377
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,080
and how they package it and that kind of stuff.

378
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,840
So it seems like they're kind of contributing their good upstream people.

379
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,760
I want to I want to give a little attention to something that I see happening more and

380
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,060
I want to I want to also get some participation from the audience to help us with something.

381
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:11,320
So there is a trend that's beginning to take off and clever projects like the guy that

382
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,760
runs the Ubuntu Mate project have have been reaching out with their community using Patreon

383
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,880
and other funding moments been doing it for a long time to using their own custom system.

384
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,540
A lot of different developers and projects are starting ways to get funded and Patreons

385
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,300
becoming a pretty common one and I wouldn't be surprised eventually people start feeling

386
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:36,980
Patreon fatigue but what I would what I would like to what I would like to try to do is

387
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:43,260
use the audience reach of our shows to help promote some of these funding methods at least

388
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,260
for a little bit.

389
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,740
Maybe we spend one episode on it because I have a feeling that that's probably something

390
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,120
the audience feels would be a good use of our airtime would be giving recognition to

391
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,220
like this one I have up on the screen right now is a GIMP developer who is rewriting the

392
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,540
GIMP backend image processing core and if he's successful GIMP will then have high bit

393
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:10,860
depth support full CMYK support full layer effects and all of it's impossible without

394
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,260
this rewrite and now he's launching a Patreon I think he's got like a hundred and something

395
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:21,200
patrons this could really change the game and we've seen this actually work now we've

396
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,360
seen some different projects some better than others really pull this off and I think the

397
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,440
audience would feel like it's a good use of our time to give them attention and airtime

398
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,440
but I need their help finding a lot of them I have I know I know about some of the Saudi

399
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,040
developer I can think of three or four or five off the top of my head I but I know there's

400
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,540
got to be more and so wherever you're watching this I'm asking I'm asking at last and I'm

401
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,540
asking in this episode please let me know in the comments or in a tweet or submit them

402
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:55,380
to the subreddit mm-hmm and so I would just thought maybe they haven't actually watched

403
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,420
this video yet but this is this is some work that's going into GIMP that will eventually

404
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,260
yield and some big big improvements lots of stuff that we've wanted to see in GIMP for

405
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,580
a very long time which could be landing in GIMP to some of it could be landing in GIMP

406
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:19,180
2.10 I haven't seen this video yet oh yeah okay I have seen this that's right it's just

407
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:26,220
it's just a video of a giant goat or whatever that is that's what the it's just a I don't

408
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:33,740
know I guess it's kind of cool to show off what you could do with GIMP I forgot I for

409
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,040
some reason I blocked that out of my memory anyways it's really cool work that's happening

410
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,920
and I guess I'm just I'm kind of saying hey if you think that we should spend some of

411
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,000
our time giving attention to this stuff well then I need your support making it actually

412
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,500
happen exactly Wimpy do you have any thoughts on this topic I currently back a couple of

413
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:58,060
projects through their patrons that I'm interested in and I'm sure there are others so yeah I'd

414
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:04,780
be interested to hear what else is out there so that if there's things that I'm already

415
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:10,980
using or something that I think is nifty then I've got a way to support the project yeah

416
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:17,320
obviously because patreon has been hugely successful for Ubuntu mate and I would like

417
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:26,140
to see other developers have similar success yeah I agree and I think one of the nice things

418
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,480
about patreon is once you're signed up it's it's not too much more barrier to then go

419
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,160
support somebody else and you can set limits so you don't overdo it and stuff like that

420
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,300
so it's a it's a system that makes it possible to support multiple content creators without

421
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,900
having to go create an account everywhere they decide to go right and we do need the

422
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,740
scaffolding as in you know in the free open source software community yeah I want to be

423
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,700
able to give back but there's just you need a minimal set of hoops yeah we'll have to

424
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,260
jump through yeah all right so let's brainstorm more we can do more brainstorming too in the

425
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,880
post show if you guys want I want to keep going though because there's a topic that

426
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,820
we have kicked around a lot and haven't gotten updates on a little bit and so now we'll have

427
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:13,880
one plus the FSF has a new top 10 list that they want you to focus on so first let's take

428
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,380
a moment and thank ting for sponsoring the unplugged program linux.ting.com go there

429
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,300
to save money off your first device or off your service plan depending depending on if

430
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,980
you buy a new phone or bring your own phone and one of the really cool things about ting

431
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:32,320
that you're gonna love is no contract nor the termination fee and just pay for what

432
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,020
you use just your minutes your messages and your megabytes and six dollars for the line

433
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,780
I love it such a simple system because it means if I want to turn something on I just

434
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,100
pay six bucks that month and then when I get rid of it it's gone that's really nice for

435
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,120
my five for backup my files when I'm traveling it's also been really nice when I've had a

436
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,120
problem and I'm traveling and I was able to use their customer service you get to speak

437
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,740
to a real human being but I've always pretty much gotten done in the dashboard and they

438
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,620
have CDMA and GSM networks for you to use I think the perfect combo nexus device or

439
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,120
maybe a pixel device now I guess I should stop saying you gotta it's dead Chris get

440
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:15,740
over it I would do this I would get a device from the play store or get an unlocked device

441
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,800
somewhere and bring it to ting because ting's not gonna lock it up they're not gonna stay

442
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,500
in the way of updates personally if you could afford it I would recommend either an iPhone

443
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,640
or a pixel I think that's really the way to go these days if you can go there ting though

444
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,320
they've got all kinds of great options because I know those are expensive unless you get

445
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,080
like a nexus 5x or something I mean you can start at nine dollars for just a SIM card

446
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,280
if you have a device you can get a feature phone for like 20 bucks and then they are

447
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,240
they actually this one by the way the Kyocera Dura they have this one back in stock now

448
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,680
this is like the indestructible phone if you want like a phone that has like a week-long

449
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,300
battery you can hear the ringtone from anywhere in the house and it'll almost survive a war

450
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:03,160
like Indiana Jones in a fridge check that thing out lots of other phones oh wow the

451
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:13,680
iPhone 4 is only 87 bucks now from ting wow wow yeah iPhone 591 bucks iPhone 5c and then

452
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,280
they have of course all the other devices like the one plus the motos I think you should

453
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,080
go over there and just see what you might want to get if you don't have a device already

454
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,880
or you want to start fresh you can see the whole lineup over at ting including that pixel

455
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,320
phone or you could just bring one and enjoy the ting savings by going to linux.ting.com

456
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:40,920
linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program now we

457
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,040
go into the future and look back at last year yes that's right to go into the future we

458
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,360
must look back the future being Mir and Wayland of course and to look back to see how Mir

459
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:58,280
is doing this was just posted on the insights.abuntu.com blog I guess and they will go over some of

460
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,640
the things in 2016 they say it was a good year for Mir it's being used in more places

461
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,880
as better upstream support and it's easier to use by downstream projects 2017 will be

462
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,540
even better when we see version 1.0 will somebody in the mumble room to find what upstream is

463
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,920
for Mir for me I'm not trying to be clever either I really don't understand what upstream

464
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:24,280
is for Mir wouldn't upstream just be Mir's project itself nobody knows I don't I wasn't

465
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:32,360
paying attention so what is what in the context of Mir when they say it has more and this

466
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:39,180
was Alan Griffiths on the insight blog he says it's being used in more places it has

467
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,960
more and better upstream support and it's easier to use by downstream projects so what

468
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,320
does upstream support mean?

469
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,120
Maybe he's talking about back end support for things like Qt and different toolkits

470
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,800
and what have you and then here's a there was a piece here enabling Mir on Ubuntu non

471
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:04,080
or enabling I thought this is a good one enabling Mir on non Ubuntu Mesa or Mesa distributions

472
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,560
Ubuntu currently carries a distro patch for Mesa to support Mir work is planned for this

473
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,580
year to update it and and then upstream this patch we've not done so yet as we know there

474
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,040
are changes needed to support current developments such as Vulkan which brings us to the next

475
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,880
thing which I thought was interesting they're working on improving the graphics API to support

476
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,400
things such as Vulkan which requires development of the Mir plugin module and now that they've

477
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,360
actually done the work on getting the Vulkan support in as one of the first major plugins

478
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,240
they've also discovered a bunch of stuff needs to be done to the plugin architecture looking

479
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,000
forward to 2017 they'll see a cleanup of the toolkit API and better support for platform

480
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,800
plugin modules after learning so much from Vulkan I would imagine and they'll be working

481
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,280
to upstream their Mesa patch soon they also have a snapshot of all the progress include

482
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,280
they've been reducing latency and big wins and performance which are available right

483
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,160
now and we're going to complete changes and believe they will see the Mir 1.0 release

484
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:08,640
in 2017 wow yeah something to look forward to that's been a long time coming that's a

485
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,360
Mir in 2017 predictions book out here Chris I didn't make that prediction I just kind

486
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,840
of was like you know what I just I couldn't do another year of predicting Wayland and

487
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,400
Mir I even though it feels like this would be the year of all years doesn't that say

488
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,480
something I just done West despite that you're just no I couldn't do it nope Wes I couldn't

489
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,840
do it I just I had to put it to bed and because I had to come to a personal acceptance West

490
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,080
I had to come to a peace with the fact excellent forever this stuff is hard West and it takes

491
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,120
a long time and you know what else I realized is even once this shenanigan ships I'm probably

492
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,200
going to be one of those old codgers on X for a long time because I'm going to need

493
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,540
my x11 Forden or I'm going to want V and I'm going to want something West that these new

494
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:59,400
fangled Vulkan powered Wayland and Mirs from every which browser and desktop environment

495
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,960
maybe I want my clipboard to share contents between all my applications maybe I want my

496
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,520
clipboard to be able to monitor my screen even when I have like my apps stealing all

497
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,760
of my credentials that's why they're there so yeah I figure I figured this wouldn't be

498
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,760
the year to really get excited about Wayland or Mir because it probably won't be the year

499
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,320
for Chris anyways because all of the reasons that we just stated but you can read more

500
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,740
about the post on the quote unquote blog blog where they also have a screenshot of the obligatory

501
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:34,160
screenshot of GIMP running on Mir which feels like you got to do two things you got to have

502
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,260
a terminal and you got to have GIMP running to show that your new display system works

503
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:44,160
with legacy applications what should we show I know GIMP's a UI monster let's show that

504
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,760
that's what everybody does it's a monster let's put that up on the screen but it works

505
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:55,120
mm-hmm yeah I'm gonna stick with X for life you're gonna pull it from my cold dead insecure

506
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,200
hands all hacked so the Free Software Foundation I don't even need to tell you guys this because

507
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,960
I'm sure you all probably check this daily so for those of you that maybe didn't know

508
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,080
about this that don't have this as your homepage it turns out that the Free Software Foundation

509
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,760
has a high priority software projects list now I know you guys all knew that you're checking

510
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,560
it constantly that's how you make your morning prioritization decisions what should I work

511
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,720
on today I better go check Richard's list I know I understand but for those of you that

512
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,240
weren't aware the Free Software Foundation has been working on this since 2005 and they

513
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:36,760
got a lot of feedback in 2016 from about 150 free software community members the high priorities

514
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:45,040
projects committee let's just let that soak in for a second is that where my money goes

515
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,760
if I donate to the Free Software Foundation is a bunch of committees the high priority

516
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,260
projects committee what is this a government institution the high priority projects panel

517
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:03,760
recommended extensive updates to the yeah to the high priority project list the high

518
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,120
priority projects initiative draws attention to a relatively small number of projects of

519
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,480
great strategic importance to the goal of freedom for all computer users this list serves

520
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,880
to foster work on projects that are important for increasing the adoption and use of free

521
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,840
software applications and free software operating systems and here's where my here's where my

522
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,960
issue begins because that is a very fine statement to make if you just did one thing where they

523
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,160
have a period where they say the list serves to foster work on projects that are important

524
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,760
for increasing the adoption and use of free software applications and free software operating

525
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:50,160
systems instead of a period it should be comma in our opinion man they speak as if they are

526
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:55,040
the ultimate they're the absolute they're the Free Software Foundation ergo they have

527
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,400
the ultimate authority to declare what is and what is not important what must be our

528
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,560
attention must be directed to and what must be ignored and it's not it's not it's just

529
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,700
some it's something about the way this is framed to me I find it to be slightly sort

530
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,840
of it's almost like that in their mind it's a foregone conclusion you know there's no

531
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,040
element of convincing or storytelling it's kind of just like these are the facts these

532
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:26,000
are the things we've decided this we are the bastion of your freedom please read yeah yeah

533
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,240
I guess it does kind of so here you ready for it you ready for it this is the list here

534
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,360
are the high priority free software areas a free phone operating system smartphones

535
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,260
are the most widely used form of personal computing today that's the need for a fully

536
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:47,200
free phone operating system is crucial to the proliferation of software freedom yep

537
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,960
okay accurate decentralized Federation and personal services a software substitute clouds

538
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,800
a little phrase they've got here yeah I like that service as a software substitute yeah

539
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,000
that is good the large and fragmented space deals with increased centralization of web

540
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,880
activities and user reliance on servers they don't control or service as a software substitute

541
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,880
clouds the free software community provided extensive feedback regarding many projects

542
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,520
that follow this initiative also they say this is on their list free drivers firmware

543
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,540
and hardware designs man it's a good thing they got a committee to come up with this

544
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,040
list because otherwise they might have missed some of this maybe our community should come

545
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:31,360
up with a list and we can compare and contrast real-time voice and video chat so this their

546
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:40,720
list okay I guess I guess I feel like there is this does nothing there is probably nobody

547
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,400
who's sitting back oh man you know what I got 40 hours free this week and I just don't

548
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,900
know what to do I'm gonna go check Rick's list and see what he thinks I should be working

549
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:54,120
on I mean the idea is preposterous so instead of their set of my money to the free software

550
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,840
foundation going to actually funding some of these projects or paying a developer for

551
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,400
a week to do this work it goes to creating committees and updating lists from 2005 of

552
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,340
no no shit statements of course we need a free phone operating system no shit Sherlock

553
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,720
of course we need to use WebRTC better no crap yeah we need free drivers people been

554
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:19,280
working on that for years now none of this is useful what are they doing and it really

555
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,320
feels like it kind of lacks the community aspect that makes a lot of these things important

556
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,480
right like it's not it's not an ongoing discussion it's just kind of like put out

557
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,800
there as a list right so it's not let's work out together what we should work on as a community

558
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,580
bettering things you know it would be great you know it would be amazing if this was a

559
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:39,460
list of how they were organizing action around these items the free software foundation has

560
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:44,640
identified these as critical areas to the freedom and so we are organizing groups of

561
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,880
people around these particular items we don't need to sit around and wait for Google Summer

562
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,240
of Code here's their patreon pages go fund them they'll be working on these items here's

563
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,240
how you can help why does it take some stupid podcaster in Arlington Washington going around

564
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,020
go hmm you know I ought to come up with a list of ways we can contribute to open source

565
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,120
developers so they can financially afford to work on free software I can come up with

566
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,680
that idea but the free software foundation can't come up with that idea why aren't there

567
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,420
links to patreon pages on this why aren't they telling you how I actually take action

568
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,960
this just feels like they're preaching from on high to us I don't know why this list offends

569
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,600
me so much but it literally offends me reading this list all right so there you go if you

570
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:32,360
want to read that masterpiece that took a committee some go ahead is there anyone here

571
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:38,680
who's donated to the I have recently oh yeah recently last year do you do you get spam

572
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:45,640
from them yes yeah yeah I wasn't impressed about that yeah so I did I did a talk earlier

573
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:50,000
in the year which I was paid to do and it was all about you know Linux and open source

574
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,960
stuff and I said to the organizers that I wanted to donate that money so I chose to

575
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,760
donate it to the FSF because why not and now I just get spam from Richard Stallman with

576
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,960
choice photos of him gallivanting around the world and what have you right and the verbiage

577
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,080
is would you like to join our low volume mailing list and receive a monthly newsletter that's

578
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,680
the verbiage when you sign up on it I'm getting a paper newsletter as well from America like

579
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,640
a little pamphlet you know I might if I was getting mail I don't get much mail because

580
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,840
I they have my old address so but I didn't I didn't ask for this I just sent them some

581
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,440
money and now I get email spam and snail mail spam and they you know like the chairman say

582
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,120
well maybe they're not linking to patreon pages because patreon is negative in the freedom

583
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:40,000
dimension but they'll happily accept you to pay by credit card or PayPal and they'll also

584
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,200
take Bitcoin which is how I donated but they'll also happily accept PayPal so I don't think

585
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,280
it's about some sort of moral reason why they're not linking to developers patreon or bug bounties

586
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,760
and Richard Stallman doesn't have a problem with people making money from free software

587
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,480
so I yeah it's yeah wimpy that there is it's sort of I guess where I'm going with this

588
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:06,500
and I didn't even realize it is there is a real easy way for people that are creating

589
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,840
something really great to go out and seek direct funding and there does seem to be less

590
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:18,240
relevancy for this particular function of the FSF not that it's irrelevant but for this

591
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,060
particular organizing and function like this this makes no difference in the community

592
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,280
in the direction of what people work on this is this is them basically shouting into the

593
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,660
wind and pretending some sort of pretense of relevancy here we talked about it there's

594
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,000
like a couple news stories maybe and then that's it right it's done it's in a way it's

595
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,100
an average it's advertising the little bit of sway that they they seem to be lacking

596
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,340
now over the free software community it's sort of it sort of undermines their position

597
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,520
in a way to do things like this I should move on because I'm probably pissing off a lot

598
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:58,240
of people things to talk about yes including including Wes I have right here in my hot

599
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:05,180
little boxes a new distro that I bet you've never seen whoa yes never tried oh distro

600
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,900
it is very bespoke it is very very bespoke and I did a little sniffing around under the

601
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,320
hood and I I got a full report if you like going under the hood and then friends I recommend

602
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,760
Linux Academy that's right Linux Academy comm slash unplugged as a platform to learn more

603

Linux Academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the Linux ecosystem you should too that's

616
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,560
also a great point just to stay current and up-to-date on these technologies Linux Academy

617
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,000
dot com slash unplugged go there sign up for a free seven-day trial kick the tires see

618
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,160
what I'm talking about use the core scheduler for your busy week figure out how these learning

619
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,220
paths can help you lock into a specific type of learning path which help you know in those

620
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,200
moments we like I just got to get this done and I know exactly the type of content I need

621
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,320
to buzz through and instructors have built these learning paths just for your particular

622
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,980
career tasks you might be in this is really a slick system and one of the things I continue

623
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,900
to use it for and I never ever would have thought this in my and I guess is probably

624
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,360
because of the way my mind works is this feature that I thought was kind of silly at first

625
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,660
called nuggets who calls it nuggets good sound delicious actually and they turn out

626
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,040
to be just like these deep dive topics where you can go in get something it's like maybe

627
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,800
five minutes long maybe it's an hour long it depends on the content it's just whatever

628
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,720
the content dictates and you just learn that one particular thing so it's not like how

629
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,680
to do Python on Linux it's not that broad it provides a little like sandboxed area like

630
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,920
okay I'm gonna learn this one thing I can understand this one thing and you come out

631
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,840
of it with a new skill or tool I mean I got 45 minutes yeah exactly check it out linuxacademy.com

632
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,480
slash unplugged sign up for a free seven-day trial and a big thank you to Linux Academy

633
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:59,000
for sponsoring the unplugged program so they call it leery l-i-r-i l-i-r-i leery is an

634
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,840
OS and apps built with modern design and features it's available for download right now they

635
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,720
say we're building some exciting features including atomic upgrades powerful notification

636
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,840
support not average power and much much more we're leveraging the latest and greatest Linux

637
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:25,400
technologies including OS tree Wayland Qt 5 and much more wow they say by utilizing

638
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:31,040
elements and principles of material design we'll be able to create a framework that incorporates

639
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,680
components and animations that provide more feedback to users additionally a single underlying

640
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:42,060
responsive system across all platforms to allow more unified user experiences leery

641
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:46,720
is a mediocratic consensus based community interested in developing an OS and apps with

642
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,160
modern design in mind we believe in the power of open source free software and worldwide

643
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,600
collaboration as we want to build share and improve software together and make it available

644
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:02,640
to everyone a modern responsive framework based on material design and universal integrated

645
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,940
apps leery ships with a set of modern and flexible apps and the core apps are tightly

646
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:14,800
integrated into the OS yeah so I did a little sniffing I went to the downloads want to get

647
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,880
a little idea of what I was dealing with here and I something something jumps out at me

648
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,080
you can try leery OS with a live image and eventually install it from there or if you're

649
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:30,680
already using arch Linux you can add a repository to install the packages and build them for

650
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:38,400
yourself with the AUR interesting yeah yeah I could just turn this thing up into a material

651
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,320
design desktop yeah now how are they gonna do atomic transactional updates using I don't

652
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,340
know I think it's they probably got they got some distance to travel but so yeah I loaded

653
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:53,480
it up here and yeah it is a let me expand the size now this feels like one of those

654
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,800
distros that does not really that deserves to be I should put it this way this is a distro

655
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,440
that deserves to be tested outside of VM yeah bare metal they're talking about animations

656
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,800
and I've already noticed some of it it's usable and I just wanted to show it to you guys check

657
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,260
out this cray cray launcher West now for those of you on the audio feed let me I'll describe

658
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:14,240
it to you you click on what looks like it might be the gnome applications button because

659
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,000
I've got one right I've got one right next to it looks almost just like the gnome all

660
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,200
applications button but when you click it it brings up a what was your window it's like

661
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,060
a modal file manager almost but it's got like a search bar at the top yeah and it's you

662
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:33,520
type the application name so you put in like terminal there and then okay can't hit enter

663
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,720
but then you click it and it it launches terminal they have a their own terminal window decorations

664
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,760
here they have their own likes bar there that there's a gap between where the applications

665
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,160
are and the launcher is to where the clock is and the notifications are at notifications

666
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,280
slide out on a slide tray same with like network settings they slide out in there and disk

667
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,580
information as well where I can see what this are mounted and the date and time but there's

668
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,560
no calendar in there like you might expect like say from like solace I think it's kind

669
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,140
of interesting it has like built-in share buttons in the terminal window or no maybe

670
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,940
although I'm sorry those are open a new window it has a tab support even though it seems

671
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:18,480
to be their own application so they are building some of their own apps too which is they mentioned

672
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,360
that do you see anything else in there that looks let's take a look because there's not

673
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:27,480
a lot of here's not a lot of apps and pre-installed apparently and now all you get is terminal

674
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,320
no I bet here we go so yeah this is pretty much it this is pretty much let's check out

675
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:38,360
the file manager because that's kind of my my only other I'm betting this is oh nope

676
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:43,080
this is their own file manager look at that wow it does look like material design it does

677
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:49,120
yeah it looks very Android it but none of it even scrolls like Android do you see that

678
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,560
yeah I do it's got a little momentum to the scrolling it rolls a little bit after I finish

679
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,560
scrolling but not in a bad way it's not crappy really could be worth oh yeah well that's

680
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,840
that looks right flashback there yeah it looks like an Android dog box but it really I mean

681
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:10,000
it really could be worse yeah yeah yeah so I don't personally in my life have any room

682
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,880
for another distribution that wants to whole cloth create all of its own apps and its own

683
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,240
desktop paradigm use those X apps every day Chris yeah oh yeah that's right this is using

684
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:27,840
Wayland that's right it's no good it's no guy kidding what about this as like on a Chromebook

685
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:34,080
on a Chromebook or as the like desktop component to like a convergent style phone device like

686
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,480
Maru but if instead of like a Debian XFCE it launched something like this I've always

687
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:49,280
been a fan of a desktop UI that has animations that do that serve a purpose that explain

688
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,440
to you the position of Windows or they explain to you where an alerts coming from or they

689
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,920
show you where an applications land once you've installed it like there's certain animations

690
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,920
that I find actually be they help you in yeah intuitively understand and then there's some

691
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,960
animations where it's just excessive and when your systems under load you're like okay that

692
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,000
looks like crap so you got to walk that line but I actually feel like there's I feel like

693
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,440
there's more room for that kind of stuff in desktop Linux and I like that there is a project

694
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,840
out there that's willing to mess around with that if they're really gonna build some sort

695
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:21,000
of unified core running on top of Wayland I mean I'm gonna check it back in on it I'm

696
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,360
gonna see how we absolutely yeah we should put it on bare metal one no word yes no word

697
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,400
on touch support I don't see that the governance model seems interesting too for a distribution

698
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:40,760
like this the leery is a mediocratic consensus based community okay that seems very specific

699
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,320
and they have documents out that describe their governance model so they're like I feel

700
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:50,600
like they're big about it yeah hopefully that means a constructive good community can form

701
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:57,280
they have an app they have app rovers maintainers chief maintainers decision makers lazy consensus

702
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,840
decision making typically involves the following steps proposal discussion discussion by consensus

703
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,940
maintainer if consensus not reached and chief maintainer they really got some of this stuff

704
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:11,880
dialed in like they got some stuff seriously figured out about their about their organization

705
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,180
anybody the mummer have any thoughts on leery building a new distro with a you know new

706
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:20,840
desktop paradigm creating their own apps again anything like that I'll put it up to you guys

707
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:29,080
for a moment before we move on no no no I think it I think Wes was right it looks like

708
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:34,240
it'd be something it'd be good on Chromebooks but outside of that I'm not not sure we need

709
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,360
more of the same when people aren't already doing this work yeah I don't want to discourage

710
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:44,320
them from doing something cool but it's probably not for me for a little bit it might be fun

711
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,440
to play with if you got an extra machine like when West finally gets a new Sputnik or whatever

712
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,080
he's gonna get totally be cool to throw it on we should I mean I'll throw it on here

713
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:57,080
I left like half the hard drive here just for distro there's no apps though I guess

714
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,360
if you have the AUR then that's where you are yeah they probably have to pull down all

715
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:08,800
those GTK you probably I'll make that sacrifice for you guys Wow Wes you know what you know

716
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:15,160
what else we should try is that where's that what happened that what happened to the Raspberry

717
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,840
Pi story we never covered the Raspberry Pi story should we just talk about it real quick

718
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:24,320
yeah I guess we should because we forgot to so this week Mycroft released images for the

719
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,280
Raspberry Pi so you can put I secretly use yeah I know I know I know that you don't have

720
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:36,240
to interrupt the show you can put Mycroft images now on a Raspberry Pi and go all you

721
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,840
know Amazon Echo style using a pie so I got one right here so I was thinking maybe I might

722
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,600
try it eventually what do you think of this West is something to be willing to kick with

723
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,400
kick around and see if that works I don't know if I have an SD card for mine at the

724
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,920
moment yeah that was my limitation maybe I'll order a new one if I can't find one tonight

725
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,920
yeah I mean I'm kind of curious especially after you got the Alexa here in studio let's

726
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:02,440
see if it can't and there is an element like I played with it a little bit I've installed

727
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:07,800
like the the desktop version that kind of thing but there is something to be said about

728
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,320
just being able to flash it onto a drive stick it in a pie that really I'm just like same

729
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,840
with you it's like sitting on my shelf I've been waiting for a project to use it on so

730
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:21,040
I can certainly start talking to it and connecting it to things around my house and it seems

731
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,120
like a very it seems like a platform that's easy a lot of people have it and it makes

732
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,760
the barrier to entry a lot lower yeah that is a huge thing to start playing with I hope

733
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:34,080
this I would what I would hope for is that this creates some serious adoption because

734
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,880
right now we have this we have this I think we have this really bad habit in the open

735
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,760
source Linux community and maybe general tech community at all as a whole it's probably

736
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:52,720
not just us where we get all hot and bothered on specs and features and technical differences

737
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,720
that matter to some degree but don't matter in the wider market and that's premature

738
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,720
optimization so we're kind of sitting here like gosh it's gonna be so cool once Mycroft

739
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:07,160
is about as fast as an echo and can do about half the stuff that the Google home could

740
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,520
or echo can do like it's gonna be great when it gets to that point it's not even at that

741
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,160
point and we're still here talking like it's a possibility that this thing has a chance

742
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:22,960
in the market but that's only because we're geeks like the reality is the markets already

743
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,960
moving on and I really I mean to that end was I believe that so firmly and I really

744
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,760
I I spent a lot of time on this show like bringing attention to Mycroft and talking

745
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,520
about what important can be and I'd still love to see the project continue I'd love

746
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,080
to see it work on Linux desktops but I really think like the home market I here was what's

747
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:44,380
in you tell me what's in this box oh this looks new yeah I just came today actually

748
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,680
so it's kind of funny that we're covering the story this is a new brand new inbox Amazon

749
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,520
echo yeah I full one the big boy you know ten speakers and everything yeah I got that

750
00:49:53,520 --> 00:50:01,480
for the RV I you're sold huh yeah yeah yeah it is really it once what I actually like

751
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,440
I actually think it's I know people are worried about monitoring but in some ways it's actually

752
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,720
improved my network security so I like it for that reason alone but how do you feel

753
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:15,120
about Amazon's platform versus Google well I definitely feel safer about Amazon see

754
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:21,000
Amazon I think is on the this is why I think really the Mycroft doesn't have a shot is

755
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:29,440
Amazon has this huge institutional priority to get these things in your homes they don't

756
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,880
have a storefront they can't guarantee you're gonna go to amazon.com when you need to buy

757
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,400
something but if they can get an echo in your house then they have essentially get ready

758
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:46,240
for a debug term here they've disrupted the store they if they can they can do if technology

759
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,600
can give them a quantum leap over even needing to establish stores although I could see Amazon

760
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:58,400
opening stores one day but I think this is so fundamental to their long-term business

761
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,120
because it's not just about buying shit on Amazon because having three dots or two that

762
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,680
I use and one for the beard I've never bought one thing from Amazon I don't know if I ever

763
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:12,200
will buy anything from Amazon using an echo device because it's like a minor feature that's

764
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,600
not what you know what it for you know what I do buy from Amazon is I buy shit that's

765
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:21,400
compatible with Alexa now so a lot of stuff on Amazon says works with Alexa and it's becoming

766
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:27,200
a massive at part of their like accessories and technology they're selling related to

767
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,800
the Alexa so there's that entire market then there is the fact a lot of people will use

768
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,600
it to buy stuff off of Amazon that is something a lot of people will and do use it for there

769
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,960
is a massive strategic priority for Amazon to have a device like this in your home and

770
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,720
they don't need it for monitoring your metrics your data your mood they don't need it for

771
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,520
the reasons Google needs it to sell you ads they need it to make their business profitable

772
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:53,920
and sustainable they need a storefront in your home nobody else needs that like Amazon

773
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,840
does so they have a real incentive to make this thing work with as many third parties

774
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,360
as possible to make the API as generous as possible they have the biggest incentive to

775
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,740
keep updating to give it more features they're going to keep pushing the price down nobody

776
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:11,880
else even has a multi-device ecosystem now there's like three echo devices you can buy

777
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,240
directly from Amazon dot tap and echo now after CES like a dozen other manufacturers

778
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:23,240
including frickin Ford in cars has announced echo integration so we're sitting here talking

779
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,360
about mycroft now the conversation about mycroft is going to have to be how can us

780
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:32,480
geeks incorporated into our homes and our desktops not how is the market going to adopt

781
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,000
mycroft that's that's not happening I found it interesting what you were talking

782
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,040
about about the perhaps market pressure pressure for third-party integrations which I think

783
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:47,160
is important if we're going down this road of a proprietary semi-documented interface

784
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,340
rightly way better if you could use the echo and use the and use mycroft in the same way

785
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,480
because they integration spoke the same language but probably that's not what we're gonna happen

786
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:01,440
I would love that but so at least we would need an ecosystem that is right like it matters

787
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,880
less to Google do that than it does Lipsy in the chat room says this is a lot of self-rationalizing

788
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:12,040
going on that's the kind of tech arrogance I'm talking about where you think well because

789
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,480
it's open source because I could run a lot of devices and people could create plugins

790
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,200
for it and make it extensible it's obviously gonna win one day that's such bullshit like

791
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,640
if that was the case we'd all be using free software on our phones right now that's not

792
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,320
how the real world works anymore it's all about ecosystem it's all about who you integrate

793
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:32,080
with and all of that integration is closed up behind these stupid API's the world's all

794
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:37,240
gone to API's well API's mean I control what you have access to that's what an API is and

795
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:42,080
so that's how the entire world communicates now and mycroft isn't anywhere in the spectrum

796
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,160
unless there's somebody like Hughes or somebody else who just has a general public API they

797
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:51,760
make available service integration things like that only Amazon and Google and Microsoft

798
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,560
are gonna be able to make those kind of deals and right now I don't think anybody has anything

799
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:00,480
that competes nowhere near to what the Echo can do that's not self-rationalization that's

800
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,720
I thought this was a joke product for like a year I was skeptical of this thing finally

801
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,760
got one because they put the dot on sale at 40 bucks and I thought alright I'm gonna give

802
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:14,040
this a go and you know what I've changed my tune I think really have yeah I think it's

803
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,900
a really legitimate product category and it's not just me it's my entire family uses it

804
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:23,760
when they're like when the kids are here when he is here they're they've all taken to using

805
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,800
it for all kinds of things like it's it gets frequent use by other people besides me I

806
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,840
think 2017 is gonna be a really interesting like I'm really curious to see if if you say

807
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:35,320
the same thing at the end of this year right now about the family about the excitement

808
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:43,040
about your uses and then at the same time like is this like first first out there advantages

809
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,800
Amazon just gonna take off with it or are we gonna see some competitors are we gonna

810
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,840
see this as a general enough category who else has the presence they do to it like they

811
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:55,640
constantly are pushing on every box you get from Amazon it's it's covered in echo branding

812
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:00,560
they have they have the echo plastered all over their page when you go to amazon.com

813
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,160
every any device or service that works with the echo it says it right there on the on

814
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,960
the product and I agree I mean I think they have all those advantages I only ask because

815
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,760
it's still early days in some ways for this industry I think it's shifted with CES and

816
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:18,600
a little bit before I think it shifted to a couple I think also people are more the

817
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,040
industry is more willing to get in bed with Amazon because they're already in bed like

818
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:28,080
selling stuff through Amazon whereas Google is bigger risk and Amazon seems more consistent

819
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,760
right like Google's the often they're like high castle out there doing their thing deprecating

820
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,200
what they want stopping agreements whenever they want they you know like the whole they

821
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,920
bought Motorola just to sell them to Lenovo you can't really trust Google to do except

822
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,840
for their core advertising business right and I I think what I'm concerned about with

823
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:52,280
mycroft is it sort of the smartphone problem only way worse like the smartphone is sort

824
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:58,380
of was made like the iPhone part of what made the iPhone successful was the whole ecosystem

825
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:03,640
of content apps music videos and when Android first launched Google didn't really have that

826
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,500
stuff there wasn't a play store it took Google like three years to really get that stuff

827
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:12,240
all figured out and dialed in and then now they have a pretty successful ecosystem it's

828
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,980
the same with this only to a higher degree because now it's not just the music and the

829
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,960
videos that you integrate with but it's also all of the hardware products and the home

830
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:28,840
services and and it's things like alarm companies and and you know business relationships are

831
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:34,040
being made and if your device can't do those things if you know if if your Amazon device

832
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:38,320
can unlock your house or lock it when you leave it but the Google one can't then what

833
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,600
are you gonna do you're not gonna relock your whole house now I'm not saying everybody listening

834
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,560
to the show wants those things no certainly not and I think there's for me there's still

835
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,720
a I'm still gonna play around with mycroft I'm still gonna see what I can do I would

836
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,280
prefer that it does everything the echo can do but I'm pretty skeptical at this point

837
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,640
and not not not happily so either I'm kind of bummed out about it I think I think it's

838
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,160
kind of it's kind of a bit of a bad situation and I think that's something to be clear about

839
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,720
too is like you're not saying that you don't have these other qualms or this desire to

840
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,320
use mycroft right but you're you're exploring this in a practical sense of like you have

841
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,080
a studio that you run you need you want something that can help you and to help automate your

842
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:24,480
day-to-day life and the echo is meeting that need yeah it does it it I think it's it's

843
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:30,040
hard to describe the value of the product until you have one because it really depends

844
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,880
on your setup and if you don't have hardware to control it's less valuable it immediately

845
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,880
I would I would be 40 bucks asking it things it's like well I can I can do that with my

846
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:43,280
phone exactly yeah that's not a compelling use case for the kids and others like it I

847
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,480
do not I know I don't I don't do that that's not what I use it for I use it specifically

848
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:52,600
to automate things in studio and whatnot all right well let's let's move on there's been

849
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,000
something I got some feedback on a lot of people said you know we we've talked a lot

850
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,320
about recent Mac switchers and a lot of people oh Chris you're such a Mac hater such a Mac

851
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:08,120
hater and I thought there was says the man towards the man who's made how many hackintoshes

852
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:13,380
and other things well I don't it's just they're just I don't think they're good value propositions

853
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:18,120
so there's another post that I was posted just after last week's show and I I wanted

854
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,920
to instead of go through his whole why I switched to Linux but it's yet another why I'm switching

855
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:27,820
to Linux from Mac OS which is interesting in itself but what I wanted to cover was some

856
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,920
of the replacements he came up with for his Mac apps because I thought that would be kind

857
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:35,440
of interesting so for iTunes he switched to no music for Photoshop he switched again

858
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:42,240
not too surprising there for sublime text he went to Emacs for Lawrence yeah wow yeah

859
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:48,280
I know for Lightroom he went to dark table for albatron live which is audio processing

860
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,680
he went to our door for DD he went to gnome disk which is funny that he switched from

861
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,880
DD I know right yeah textual he went to hex chat mailed that app to Thunderbird I cal

862
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:03,360
the gnome calendar address book to gnome contacts I term two to terminator good choice reader

863
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,960
to feed the monkey Twitter for Mac to just using the website he says I basically stopped

864
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,640
using Twitter so it's not really a big deal he switched from no password manager to key

865
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:18,360
pass and he uses type talk which I might try out which is I guess it's a it's an app that

866
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:23,920
allows the computer to read articles to you and whatnot mmm type talk nice I could see

867
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,760
that especially if you're like well I want to read this but I'm you know doing the dishes

868
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:33,840
or I there is something fascinating about peeking into their experience because they're

869
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,600
looking at some of these applications for the first time say in 10 years and so watch

870
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,740
them evolved for the right years necessarily so to them it's like look there's this contacts

871
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:46,000
application gnome has a calendar now and me I'm like why does gnome have a calendar and

872
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,520
they're like no mess I can't wait from the coming from Mac like that makes sense you

873
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:57,760
expect that yeah yeah talks about how this is better than the disk program is macOS now

874
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,220
that's that is true though yeah it's I was just recently experimenting with a hackintosh

875
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:07,960
and I don't even know how you format things in that I don't I don't just go to the terminal

876
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,280
yeah like I just I was like this is how the disk manager works in macOS now this is this

877
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,440
is that was bad so why did I switch this is the summary this is the part I thought we'd

878
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:23,360
touch on I think it started with some dissatisfaction about OS 10 and the desire to be at least

879
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:28,200
in theory able to change things so they would work like I want them this translates directly

880
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:33,120
to the GPL with its which is the license most of these programs I use is under add that

881
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:38,440
to the feeling of membership because everyone at work is using Linux and also pride in curiosity

882
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:43,960
I'm able to look behind the scenes which he likes a lot directly at the code this is not

883
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,120
possible on OS 10 at all and to top it all off with the fact that I use Linux on so many

884
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:52,960
different hardware my laptop my desktop at work the security cam I'm running in Poland

885
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,240
the Raspberry Pi I have embedded devices in my car on the phone my router and so on all

886
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:06,840
this together right now is so compelling macOS doesn't stand a chance that's it's interesting

887
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:12,220
that the the pressure of everything else using Linux is encouraging him to give Linux another

888
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:17,080
chance to he did try Linux back in the day like he was a mandrake user he was you know

889
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,960
there are a lot of Mac Mac users in that same position like well we tried it we dabbled

890
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:26,080
with it yeah here was this like beautiful shiny Unix compatible thing that well we were

891
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:31,600
gonna go with it um it was kind of he's also just a couple other things he says you know

892
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:38,360
I started off I just love this because because this really fits my prediction I'll be honest

893
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,080
that's really why I love this because because I've been I've been seeing this and so it's

894
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,920
fascinating to see this materialize so this is exactly what I was this is exactly what

895
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,280
I've been thinking because he writes after five or six years of he admits I fell in love

896
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,920
with macOS but after five or six years I started seeing the cracks first small they introduced

897
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,560
spaces and a desktop manager that wasn't working anymore thus I wasn't able to change the speed

898
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,640
which I could change between virtual desktops which are central to my workflow then they

899
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,440
introduced iCloud into a text editor and instead of starting it and then you could save anywhere

900
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:14,860
on my hard drive I had to take an extra step and tell it not to save to iCloud I hated

901
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:18,520
it so much that I rewrote text editor myself so it would work like it did before with plain

902
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:25,260
text and he links to text Ed iTunes started getting out of control accurate yeah he says

903
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,320
and it gets worse and worse with time I wanted my computer to work a certain way and it often

904
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:33,400
worked that way before then came OS 10 update and made it possible to keep and made it impossible

905
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:39,160
to keep my workflow so I don't use macOS much and so I don't often upgrade but I have the

906
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:44,400
macbook pro that you know we installed archon during this show and a dual boots final cut

907
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,680
OS and so I went into final cut OS and I decided well if I'm going to use final cut I should

908
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,600
update the latest version of final cut OS because it's totally free so from the final

909
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:58,120
cut app store it downloads final cut OS and doesn't install and updates to mac OS final

910
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:02,720
cut Sierra I don't know and you know what the first thing it does and I went you know

911
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:08,040
what I wanted to do two different things I wanted to edit my video and go to bed it wanted

912
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:14,040
to re-index all of the photos on the computer for some sort of deep learning analysis which

913
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,040
pegged my processor cores at 40% so at least they're doing it locally right but that's

914
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:23,100
why it's pegging your processor I'm like I like and is it not like set as a low priority

915
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:27,180
like how is it not falling off into the background when I go to use final cut how is that not

916
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:33,160
a thing they thought of yeah well I actually what I did is I was so frustrated I just rebooted

917
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:38,160
back into archons and I'll edit later that sucks though it does because you know what

918
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,840
I ended up doing is I just oh yeah this thing so in the morning I booted it up and let it

919
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,920
sit there and do its thing and then just shut it down again so that way it's done so now

920
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,080
you can edit video yeah yeah because I just let it go for a while but I really feel like

921
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:54,480
I had no domain over that computer I like I guess it's not too unusual after an upgrade

922
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,880
for some backend process to work like that but I don't need my photos I don't use photos

923
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,120
on that Mac I don't need it to do those things there's just probably stuff that's in that

924
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:06,100
library because that's where stuff gets dumped like I don't need that to be done like I would

925
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:10,320
just like to go and check that box and I looked around in the OS I couldn't find anywhere

926
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:15,160
that allows me to turn off that feature it just does it I don't need my photos analyzed

927
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,440
you know right that's the kind of thing it just drives me nuts about that and I feel

928
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:22,080
like if they were focused on that platform like it was the only they didn't make an iOS

929
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:26,400
device and it was the only major platform they had to worry about these kinds of little

930
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,560
cracks wouldn't be so bad but they feel like iOS has really especially with how popular

931
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:37,740
and how much it defined the early smartphone era I feel like it changed the idea of who

932
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:42,120
their product was right and so that has changed the way that they design products well you

933
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:46,160
know I mean they send they sell they might sell a hundred million iPhones in a year and

934
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,540
they might sell 20 million racks and no one thinks that an iPhone is thinking differently

935
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:54,920
right like that that's just it doesn't it's incongruent yeah that's interesting too so

936
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,480
I wanted to move now that we've had that little brief aside unless anybody in the moment wants

937
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,240
to jump in and I thought we'd go something more technical just to sort of refresh our

938
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,760
palates this is an interesting talk that you found I think right building a billion user

939
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:14,360
load balancer this was at the USENIX conference I think is that right and this was a gentleman

940
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:20,760
from Facebook Patrick Shuff I think and he gave a talk on that and I just thought I'd

941
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,800
play just a moment before it's very interesting and I'll jump ahead a little bit here into

942
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:30,040
the presentation single server served all of Facebook so the entirety of Facebook every

943
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:35,520
request comes in and we're gonna slowly build up one by one layer by layer each of our load

944
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,640
balancing infrastructure pieces so that we get to the point where we have a multi data

945
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:45,560
center multi-continent load balancing infrastructure to serve all of the requests a couple of points

946
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:52,020
I want to make here is we use a lot of open source software so almost all the pieces in

947
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:55,960
this talk are going to be open source there is going to be some custom stuff Facebook

948
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:01,680
specific to our environment that aren't necessarily open source but all of this stuff is easily

949
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:06,200
done in open source and I will talk about all of those different projects as well and

950
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:11,440
lastly my my goal for this talk is for you guys to you know think about the patterns

951
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,720
that we use you know use doing what we do for load balancing might not make sense for

952
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:20,460
everybody but kind of looking at the patterns and how we evolve our infrastructure and applying

953
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:24,260
it to some of the things that you guys are building now he does get into numbers so when

954
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:28,480
people ask me what is a traffic what does the traffic engineer at Facebook do this is

955
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,840
the image that comes to mind so this is a visualization showing all the people on Facebook

956
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,920
and all their connections to all the other people on Facebook our job is to make sure

957
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,280
that no matter where you are in the world when you open up Facebook app on your phone

958
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:47,440
or you type Facebook.com into a web browser that you connect to our servers as fast and

959
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:53,000
secure as possible so our job is to make sure that you know we were able to connect the

960
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:58,320
world you know that is the mission of Facebook is to make the world more open wow so just

961
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:02,140
to kind of quickly go over the agenda for today we'll talk about the different types

962
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:06,220
of requests that kind of make up Facebook it's kind of hyperbole but I suppose in a

963
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:14,260
way it is sort of true like I think most of my family that's not technical uses Facebook

964
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:20,640
to stay in touch absolutely it's like they sometimes use email for like planning big

965
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:25,800
family events but mostly everything and since I'm not on Facebook when I show up at family

966
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:29,000
events I'm like out of the lube on half the stuff and I get the feeling too in that way

967
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,560
where it's like well we used email because grandma isn't on Facebook and but she does

968
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:36,240
check her email once in a while you know and then you're like so suddenly you're lumped

969
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,980
in a very different technical group I still get the question what is Linux what is what

970
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:43,760
is Linux and I you can say you know to something that really connects with people it's what

971
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,880
powers huge websites like Facebook yeah lastly I'll open it up for Q&A and you guys you know

972
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,600
can ask any questions about load balancing Facebook production engineering anything at

973
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:57,360
all all right now here's the numbers I believe so let's dive quickly and talk about some

974
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:02,760
numbers real fast these are company-wide numbers every month and the month of the month of

975
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:10,120
September 1.7 9 billion people use Facebook and on average over that month 1.1 out 1 8

976
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:16,200
billion people use Facebook so these numbers are really cool and you know these are Facebook

977
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,720
numbers but I think about these in terms of a traffic engineers perspective so that means

978
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:25,240
every day assuming there's only one TCP connection per device and this is you know I think you

979
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:30,440
guys all know this is probably very improbable you know that means we at least have to terminate

980
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:36,520
1.1 8 billion TCP connections every single day and serve us from those and also the really

981
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:41,660
important interesting thing is 1.09 billion are on mobile devices so we have to think

982
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:48,120
about people who are using high-speed you know LTE or or you know landline cable modems

983
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:53,360
we also have to think about people using networks like 2g and 3g wow you know all these different

984
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:57,320
networking environments and we need to make sure when you hear numbers like that it gives

985
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:03,600
you an idea of how entrenched Android and iOS are when the numbers of mobile active

986
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:11,800
I want to just make sure these that this didn't go over you 1.09 billion mobile daily active

987
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:18,280
people they're not even like fudging that it's daily active so it's not like you have

988
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:24,240
an account but you never log in it's daily active people can you imagine building an

989
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:28,640
infrastructure for that and that's just mobile that's just mobile I mean it should be said

990
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,520
they probably engineer their apps so that if you ever installed the app that it wakes

991
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,920
up at least once a day to ping their servers but that's still their service right so they

992
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,920
still have to design for it that's probably true oh I like the way you think Wes that's

993
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,840
probably very true that is probably something there to it but damn even if they were they

994
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:49,840
are responding to those TPC yeah I don't think most people could handle that kind of load

995
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:54,960
unbelievable so it's just cool like whatever you may think of Facebook and obviously we

996
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:01,000
both have our qualms there yeah they do either not very much yeah I have an account I have

997
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,520
an account as well I do use Instagram sometimes but yeah I've experimented with Facebook more

998
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:12,320
as like a means to drive traffic than anything else they do some serious engineering yeah

999
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,080
and that's all laid out in this video well not all of it obviously but a lot of really

1000
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:21,600
good stuff is laid out at least at 16 and you can get access to it usenik.org you can

1001
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,640
find more but I would probably just start with the link in the show notes and then go

1002
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,320
out from there because that's a big site and that's an interesting talk and yeah like Wes

1003
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:33,120
is saying regardless of your opinions of Facebook the technical feeds and you know what's fascinating

1004
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:38,560
yeah bringing it from just one server to what it is now mind-blowing that is a hell of a

1005
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,920
project a hell of a project if you want to get started with your own infrastructure friends

1006
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:49,000
digitalocean.com is the place to do it digitalocean.com use the promo code do1plug it's one word

1007
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,680
it's one word it's the best word do1plug unplug digitalocean but not really because I mean

1008
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:59,040
that'd be cray cray because you know what happens a lot of 40 gigabit connections right

1009
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,160
just like would you take you all day all day all day and they got data centers all over

1010
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,880
the world so you better get prepared to travel and then they'd have one of those talented

1011
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,780
engineers from digital ocean just plugging them right back in right behind you you'd

1012
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:14,120
never win they probably could outnumber you yeah that's the thing and if you use the it's

1013
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,200
just way easier to use the promo code do1plug go create account apply it to your account

1014
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:21,680
and then get started they got a great interface very simple and intuitive to use five dollars

1015
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:26,440
a month for one of their machines or you can go hourly I love the hourly system so great

1016
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:31,380
for trying out open source projects lots of nice stuff that I'll I'll often just burn

1017
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:36,580
a digital ocean droplet for an hour yeah exactly oh some sense I might count fine yeah totally

1018
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:41,200
worth it three cents an hour okay all right well I can do that I get two cores I mean

1019
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:45,720
this one of the best parts is that unlike some other cloud providers you may have used

1020
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,880
they're so upfront about their pricing it's like bam this is what you're going to pay

1021
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,300
here you go you know it mm-hmm and it's all SSD based so even at the five dollar one you're

1022
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:57,540
still getting a 40 gigabit e-connection you're still getting SSDs you can still pick from

1023
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:01,720
a data center all over the world you can choose any district you want or that free BSD which

1024
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:07,720
I hear people like digital ocean calm use the promo code do unplugged and by the way

1025
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:11,000
they are doing early sign up like they were with their block storage not too long ago

1026
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,320
for monitoring for like metrics very curious to see what it looks like yeah I am too I

1027
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:22,220
bet I mean man so far everything they've released I've been super impressed with the UI to manage

1028
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:28,080
it I'm really curious to see what they come up with really curious so they say they're

1029
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:34,840
launching it soon no configuration required hey damn you can get alerts when problem I'm

1030
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:42,320
signing up to right now I'm gonna do it right now that is that's a that's a no brainer all

1031
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:48,480
right there I've signed up digital ocean calm use the promo code do unplugged in a big thank

1032
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:55,960
you to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program so you guys I don't think I need to

1033
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:59,160
build the case that I think the Mac books are a bit of a train wreck or that I think

1034
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:04,120
people are switching from Mac to Linux and Windows to Linux obviously but I'll tell you

1035
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:07,560
something that was super disappointing in my test and you might have heard me mention

1036
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:12,560
earlier that I was I was experimenting with a hackintosh over the weekend I tried it on

1037
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,280
three different computers just to kind of see what the state of hackintoshing was and

1038
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:23,620
that was following a test I did which was massively disappointing we have we frequently

1039
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:28,400
have a conversation on our different shows about media production under Linux and a lot

1040
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,320
of times people say they have a pet project have you tried have you tried Katie and live

1041
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,600
have you tried blender have you tried open shot have you tried you know all of these

1042
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,400
and there was a question posted on the our Linux subreddit about the current state of

1043
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:48,440
Linux video editing in 2017 and I I just happened to go through another round of this I tried

1044
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:54,920
it on my XPS 13 on the entryware Apollo on the Librem 15 and on my custom build hair

1045
01:13:54,920 --> 01:14:03,440
master machine which is a six core i7 with 32 gigs of RAM and all SSD storage that's

1046
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:08,640
with a GTX 9 handsome as you are Chris it's not a GTX thank you well thanks Wes you handsome

1047
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:13,240
devil yourself it's not a GTX 10 series graphics so it could do better there but it is a GTX

1048
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:20,880
9 series graphics so for video editing purposes it's it's pretty capable out of all of the

1049
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:30,380
machines that I used in my testing none of them could even play back my test footage

1050
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:37,320
except for hair master and to do so it took all the six core CPU performance I have which

1051
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:41,360
didn't leave much left over for applying effects and I'm not talking editing I'm not talking

1052
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:46,160
rendering I'm saying just trying to play the footage back that I intend to edit the systems

1053
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:53,360
literally cannot do it so there is now footage that is available in consumer grade equipment

1054
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,260
that the codecs on Linux are just not capable of playing back I'm talking things at 4k resolution

1055
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:04,660
not crazy frame rates not well high bit rates but not unbelievably high bit rates and they

1056
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:09,600
just they just do not play they just chop or like in the case of some players they they

1057
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:17,240
freak out and it goes all green or they flip the image and it's two frames a second in

1058
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:26,240
2017 I honestly believe the state of Linux edit video editing is worse than it's been

1059
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:33,840
in a while we have what we have right now are a half a dozen half baked tools that are

1060
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:40,040
almost good enough but not good enough and we don't have a supporting media pipeline

1061
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:45,120
under those tools to make it all connect and to make playback streamless and to guarantee

1062
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:49,120
that if something works in one editor it'll work in another editor like if you won't even

1063
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,620
get in there that's an entirely different dimension we are in a we are in a really bad

1064
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:59,440
position if you're trying to do anything with that any if you're trying to work with any

1065
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:05,320
camera that was sold in 2016 or 2017 I was gonna say like is it safe to say that like

1066
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:11,280
we're getting there in terms of like video from 2009 but you know like yeah all right

1067
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:16,320
you've got like maybe 1080 video you can edit that you can do it but any 30 frames a second

1068
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,960
you could probably do that but modern video which is not that anymore like the world has

1069
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:25,760
moved on and we are not catching up right and so this guy on reddit kind of had the

1070
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,720
same experience he said some of some 4k wouldn't even play back on my machines there were only

1071
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:37,440
five minute clips I recently went through I tried Katie and live PDV blender Lightworks

1072
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:43,280
open shot as my main ones I spent the most time with Katie and live and Lightworks because

1073
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:48,180
those are the ones I always tend to like the most and of all that I like Katie and live

1074
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:55,880
the best so if you have a straightforward project it's really it's but but it's not even Katie

1075
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:01,620
and lives fault anymore like the fault lies in the underlying yeah in the codecs they're

1076
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:06,640
not hardware accelerated and depending on which ones you get they if they are hardware

1077
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,720
accelerated they don't support the right resolution and frame rate so they have to fall back to

1078
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:16,240
CPU decoding and we are leaving the world where CPU decoding is impossible it just doesn't

1079
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:22,560
work anymore yeah it took a six core system playing from an MV and then from a fast solid

1080
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:29,120
state storage to play it back the enemy yes thank you and I so the when this when this

1081
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:35,480
question came in about the current state of video editing on Linux this is an area where

1082
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:42,760
it's still it's the thing is is a 2013 MacBook Pro that I have can play this back not only

1083
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:47,400
can it play these files back but I can apply real-time color and I can speed them up and

1084
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:53,840
slow them down and I can apply those effects interact with them I can so like yeah that's

1085
01:17:53,840 --> 01:18:01,880
a 2013 MacBook Pro running a system name is a 2015 but hey oh but you get my point exactly

1086
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:06,800
right like and yet you could buy the latest XPS or whatever and not be able to do it on

1087
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:12,640
I mean these are this this is a sky like let alone over here X I mean it's a pretty bad

1088
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,720
situation and I maybe it's just not a market we're ever just gonna be able to capture because

1089
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:25,040
maybe the maybe the technology is moving too fast and maybe it's just not possible maybe

1090
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:29,040
there's just certain things that open source isn't equipped to tackle is that I hate that

1091
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:34,200
I hate that be the conclusion I come to but I just and it's frustrating to be in the position

1092
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:39,040
where like there's so many tools right where Windows has the or Mac has the like power

1093
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:43,540
user light option but then you can go to Linux and get the like oh no you're an expert this

1094
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:47,980
is the real power but video editing is not that way right like you the second you go

1095
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:51,920
to Linux you start making compromises you're like well but yes I want to make manual workflows

1096
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,040
yes I want to do these things like I don't mind spending a few minutes configuring so

1097
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:59,120
that I get optimal things but those settings are not as good as on the proprietary solution

1098
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:03,240
people listening could will often respond well what about transcoding into an intermediate

1099
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:06,920
codec or what about working with proxy media you know you could do Chris you could do this

1100
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:14,000
with proxy media that first thing no suggested that all takes a ton of time and it it doesn't

1101
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:21,400
allow for sort of a flexible creativity that is when you can take a set of mixed resolution

1102
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:26,200
mixed frame rate footage drop it all in your timeline put your piece of music down and

1103
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:31,960
just start cutting and working with the music with the footage it's an entirely different

1104
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:35,920
process then I'm going to import all my camera footage I'm going to load up this program

1105
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,200
that transcodes all my footage into this output directory then I'm going to take this output

1106
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,800
directory I'm going to add it to my project folder then I'm going to add this project

1107
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,200
folder into the editor and I'll only work with this media and then once I render it

1108
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:49,760
out I'll replace this media with the final foot with the final cut with the final you

1109
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,720
know high resolution footage and just hope that all of the color effects and all of the

1110
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:57,020
speed up and all that translates well to the final footage even though it's a different

1111
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:01,800
frame rate it's a totally different codec it just doesn't make any sense and it would

1112
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,960
be one thing like if you worked at the local news station or something with the support

1113
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,840
crew right but especially with like the the vlogging you've been doing etc like I don't

1114
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,160
I don't know if people understand the workflow where like you're on your own you've got like

1115
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:15,840
three different cameras you've got one laptop you've got a truck and you're trying to like

1116
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,600
you're trying out experimental shots you need to be able to review that footage right there

1117
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:24,300
on the scene and figure out what's going to work or not yeah it's it's it's this weird

1118
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:28,960
paradigm because we have all of this flexibility with hardware we have all this flexibility

1119
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:33,400
with software but it's left us sort of incapable of answering certain types of workloads and

1120
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:39,100
it's the most frustrating thing because it would be perfect so I'd say for depending

1121
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:44,000
on your workload and depending on your camera footage and depending on the bit rate of your

1122
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,600
clips what your expectations are yeah if you wanted to jump in with Linux video editing

1123
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,760
and you were working with some pretty straightforward stuff I just went through it again I mean

1124
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,900
I've done this on and off for years but I just went through this I think Katie and live

1125
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:02,240
still my favorite I thought I go Katie and live I go with a dark theme I think it looks

1126
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:09,280
really pro it works well it sometimes is a little sluggish the it's weird some of the

1127
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:13,760
effects the way you change the settings are super arbitrary and weird and and not like

1128
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:20,480
any other editor you'll ever use but you know as far as an editor that just works and is

1129
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:25,600
pleasant to use and allows me to have your audio tracks and your video tracks and intermix

1130
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:30,060
and have multiple tracks and it's really simple works in a way that a person who's edited

1131
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:34,440
video would expect Katie and live org we should throw that in the show notes to put that in

1132
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,040
there too all right mumble room anybody have thoughts on media production under Linux before

1133
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:44,480
we wrap before we go I know and I also should just say that I don't feel like this any of

1134
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:49,480
this applies to audio production on your Linux no ironically I feel very different yeah I

1135
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,920
feel like I feel like if you were gonna only use if you can only have one platform to do

1136
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:57,700
audio podcasts Linux would be it especially with some of the cool stuff wimpy makes some

1137
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:01,560
of the cool open source projects that are out there some of the stuff we've built internally

1138
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:07,520
yeah the script ability and automate ability I think XMN might be right is what Final Cut

1139
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:14,680
is is sort of sort of what you what you get when you control the operating system the

1140
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:21,480
software application that runs on it and the hardware that's the upside the downside is

1141
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:27,560
anemic hardware a company that has an unsure direction that's focused on a different product

1142
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:32,960
and has way too expensive prices I mean that new MacBook is a killer so that's the downside

1143
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,320
of the Apple approach just in a nutshell and the lock-in obviously but the upside is for

1144
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:42,200
one particular application this entire stack integration it's all optimized I mean they

1145
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:47,500
know they know their quirks and how to write for it so yeah all right I'll get off my high

1146
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:52,860
horse but I wanted I think part of the reason why I wanted to talk about this with you guys

1147
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:59,120
is we've spent a few episodes in a row talking about how people are leaving the Mac and about

1148
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:04,640
how the Mac is crap and about Mac OS is junk and about how they're switching to Linux and

1149
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:10,480
I just I just also wanted to give you a little bit of a reality check and say it's not all

1150
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:16,240
roses like the the that platform is still viable for a large portion of the workforce

1151
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:23,400
that right now Linux is in my personal opinion fallen behind moron now because equipment

1152
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:28,920
has pulled ahead and so the situation right now is worse in some ways than it has been

1153
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:32,520
in a while because it you now give me the point where Linux isn't even capable of playing

1154
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:38,520
some of these files so I know I've spent a lot of time harping on the MacBook and people

1155
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:43,840
switching to Linux but I felt like this was sort of a counterbalance to some of that and

1156
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,840
I'll keep testing and I'm not ever done testing oh no certainly not right none of these are

1157
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:52,800
foregone conclusions it's more of a this is what's the feeling right now yeah this is

1158
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,080
sort of like I've gone through around it all up and this is sort of where it lands for

1159
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,880
me personally the other thing about it is everybody's workload is different what the

1160
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:03,680
footage you're working with is different the the aspects and goals of your project is your

1161
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:08,520
turnaround time what's the yeah right there's a huge part of it to affect that huge part

1162
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:14,040
of it if I did one two shows a week I might you could do proxy or like whatever exactly

1163
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:18,640
exactly that would be it but if I'm trying to do something every single night totally

1164
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:23,040
different and and during the day to it's not like it's like I do it all day long and then

1165
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,560
I go home and I do it at night now as a side project so it's like it's really got to be

1166
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:31,760
pretty tight it's and there's really no time for extra bullshit yeah yeah and so that all

1167
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:36,760
is a totally different thing but I feel like that sort of probably more better my my view

1168
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:43,280
probably is more representative of the larger industry and and maybe less and less and less

1169
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:48,320
of the personal hobbyist and but I think it's probably where the money is where people would

1170
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,920
be coming from where the switchers are becoming from and when people are looking for certain

1171
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:56,160
requirements that group I have I think I have a better idea of what that group will be looking

1172
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:59,880
at and I'd say right now we're worse off in some ways right and I guess it comes back

1173
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,040
to that story of like you know are you trying to sell someone you're like yeah you should

1174
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:08,720
pick up this new Linux rig and it'll do all your things but if they're the new hobbyist

1175
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:14,320
vlogger can you honestly say that and not say yeah but here's the here's the capitulation

1176
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:18,720
job to me I'd say it depends on how professional you want your stuff to look that's one thing

1177
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:22,520
and it like if you're doing a screencast and you're cutting up the screencast to make a

1178
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:27,560
little bit shorter or take it out a mistake that's that's Kaden live would be great or

1179
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:31,400
you have a New Year's party video that you shot and you want to make a quick three-minute

1180
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:36,600
video and share it around it's gonna be awesome for that you know you even maybe like a trailer

1181
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:42,400
for a Kickstarter project there's a lot of things you could use it for so it really just

1182
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,520
depends on what you're doing so that's sort of my answer to the state of video editing

1183
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:51,160
in 2017 and I wonder I hope it's a good question I wonder I'll definitely know I mean I try

1184
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:56,880
it it seems to be almost every other month or so I sit down and I go alright let's take

1185
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,440
a project I get all the same footage and I say I'm gonna take the same footage I'm gonna

1186
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:04,400
take I'm gonna try to make the same thing three or four times it's extremely monotonous

1187
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:09,920
but it's the best test I have and I try to create the same exact product as close I can

1188
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,680
and you know what in this test sometimes I feel like I end up with something better than

1189
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:16,700
I did in the other editor like because the way it works and the workflow it's better

1190
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:20,400
with the way my mind works I get a little more creative better with your creative spirit

1191
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,660
yeah right and then other times I'm like I just basically make doldrums yeah grinding

1192
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:32,340
it out it's the awful and it could all change right like maybe we live in the Vulcan Wayland

1193
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:38,280
open source AMD driver Wonderland in two years but we're not there now many you had a question

1194
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:46,520
before we wrap up no oh sorry many oh sorry sorry right I had you I had you muted I'm

1195
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:51,720
sorry I'm a jerk go ahead talking to me yeah I had you muted I'm sorry repeat what you're

1196
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:57,760
saying so did you do your tests on the X server and Wayland or only Wayland only X server

1197
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,760
no way I think that no Wayland do you think that that had that has an influence on it

1198
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:09,440
would it be I mean you know good try are you wondering for video playback yeah yeah I don't

1199
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:13,220
really think this display server was the limiting factor I think the the issue was that all

1200
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:19,640
of the codecs were dumping the decoding job off to the CPU and even on even on like a

1201
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:24,320
Skylake you know system it just wasn't the throughput wasn't there yeah four cores but

1202
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:30,560
not enough to six core system could do it though yeah yeah I thought there's something

1203
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,120
else I thought I saw in the chat room but I think I will wrap it up there I think I've

1204
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:38,120
made I've made my pay a piece about it oh yeah that was mr. go go says that the Linux

1205
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:42,840
gamer is a good example someone who will use Linux for video editing yeah Linux gamer and

1206
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:47,680
Linux gamecast yeah exactly there's projects out there that are being done on this stuff

1207
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:51,960
that you can go check out right now they're producing content and I like I say you know

1208
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:57,200
if I was doing one or two things a week and it might be a great like you don't have money

1209
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:01,960
to shell out on a new Mac system totally the most professional editing software but you

1210
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:05,640
want to start making your vlog or whatever like yeah Linux is still great for that yeah

1211
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:10,480
and you got it really to like one of the nice things about Linux is where the software tool

1212
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:15,200
might not be as quick or you got to make proxy media or the the toolkit might be a little

1213
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:20,640
clunky but you could also get like a 12-core Xeon with 64 gigs of RAM and all that like

1214
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:25,000
you can go nuts on that and it'll all work it all yeah so you there are areas where you

1215
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,160
could where it's one part might be slower but you could go way faster another aspect

1216
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:34,680
of it and you know the other nice thing is with arch and and and Ubuntu and and and all

1217
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:39,640
of these different distributions having these video editors packaged for them you get just

1218
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:43,680
as part of your package updates already there you get the new you get the new improved editor

1219
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:48,040
which is nice actually it is generally with these it's nice to get that new stuff because

1220
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:54,320
all the new OS that wants to re-index your pictures that's exactly what I'm talking

1221
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:58,800
about that you don't get drug along with that strategy tax and so there's there are huge

1222
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,840
benefits to doing media production under Linux I guess my advice is don't ever try Final

1223
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,560
Cut don't ever don't don't do premiere don't use premiere don't use it is always easier

1224
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:14,880
if you haven't tasted the you know yeah sweet sweet grass on the other side yeah yeah yeah

1225
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,200
don't use what was that what's a Sony Vegas don't use Vegas don't use that don't use it

1226
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:24,160
so don't use that never work at Pixar wait no that works on Linux yeah I know wouldn't

1227
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:28,360
be nice if some of their tools yeah they're down although I thought I feel like their

1228
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:32,240
tools be more like using blender and it's so funny there's people a lot of one of the

1229
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:35,940
number one comments actually I get is Chris have you tried blender and I always my response

1230
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:40,440
is have you tried blender for video editing it you have to create 3d views to just do

1231
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:46,720
this simplest and this is again back to that like the like weird Mac Windows professional

1232
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,640
hobbyist type thing right like it's like you're not barking basement you're not beginner you

1233
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:54,300
have some budget for this thing but you're also not like this isn't necessarily your

1234
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:59,840
like $200,000 a year day job thing you fall in the middle where you have serious expectations

1235
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:05,040
you want to get stuff done and it's just not there but you also can't spend 50 grand on

1236
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:10,120
a software license right yeah no and it's it's then and then on the other side of it

1237
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:14,600
you just have a lackluster hardware that cost too much so it's you pay one word yeah that

1238
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:20,960
is Chris's take on the current state of video editing and Linux and thanks to it was glee's

1239
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:25,160
a web for asking that question because it got me it got me chewing on the topic a little

1240
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:29,960
bit discussion it's some it's it's good counterbalance to a lot of the coverage we've been doing

1241
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:34,880
recently all right that brings us to the end of this week's unplugged program would you

1242
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,360
like to contribute you can do it several ways you can spread the word about the show maybe

1243
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:42,320
somebody out there that would like a Linux podcast let them know that's a direct way

1244
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,680
you can help the show you can also join us live in the chat room and chat as we go over

1245
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:52,040
jblive.tv or hang out in our mumble room and get your voice heard in our virtual lug all

1246
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:56,200
of that's possible just get started going to jblive.tv for the chat room where you can

1247
01:30:56,200 --> 01:31:01,280
get mumble information or jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar where you can get calendar

1248
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:06,280
information now don't miss tech snap where you can check out Wes on the new tech snap

1249
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:32,080
that's right that's right and we'll see you right back here next week.

1250
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:53,040
I've never installed GNU slash Linux. Chris I've got a question for you. The other day

1251
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:57,680
you might have been on Laz I think it was in between segments you were talking to Noah

1252
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:03,280
about your laptop and things you like to keep installed on your laptop and you mentioned

1253
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:10,840
sab nzb and couch i think yeah well actually not necessarily on my laptop but yeah on my

1254
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:16,920
on my workstation upstairs uh right now it's uh right well it can be those two right now

1255
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:24,360
my my setup is uh sonar and nzb git but i could also do sab nzb and sick rage couch

1256
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:30,840
potato i care less about yeah i don't care as much about couch potato but uh it's nice

1257
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:38,560
to have because i i made a snap of sab nzbd and couch potato no no really just to make

1258
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,560
it nice and easy to install them and it's stupidly easy so how does it i wonder which

1259
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,540
others you would use what is the okay so but here's the question what is the mechanism

1260
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:49,720
now for that to get updated like that's kind of that's kind of what my docker question

1261
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:53,920
was about is like if i get a docker image am i going to get behind on sab like what

1262
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:59,000
is that mechanism so the the ultimate goal would be for me to contribute this to upstream

1263
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,940
the main project and for them to have their continuous integration system push it into

1264
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:07,040
the store whenever there's a new release and so you would just do you would just do nothing

1265
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:12,820
it would just update automatically in the back end um it's much like like my next cloud

1266
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:18,280
box updated i didn't even realize it upgraded from next cloud 10 to next cloud 11 the snap

1267
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:21,760
just updated in the background and i had no idea and it just carried on working i didn't

1268
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:28,820
do anything so that's the kind of thing but it would need to be update um adopted by upstream

1269
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:32,240
so they would push it to the store that's uh those applications are a good example of

1270
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:36,080
something that's a bit of work it's not impossible but it is a bit of work and if you could have

1271
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:41,960
snaps for it that's really nice it's a great idea that's exact and i signed up for a new

1272
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:47,000
service just so that i could test it because i haven't touched these for a while so yeah

1273
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:54,760
yeah yeah it's it's uh it is a pretty slick um you know it's a pretty slick setup once

1274
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:59,180
you get everything all set up because essentially they're set and once they're once they're

1275
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:03,640
configured and the programs you want to monitor or the movies you want to monitor are specified

1276
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:08,680
you just kind of walk away and everything will find it'll automatically find the content

1277
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:13,360
download the content extract it rename it to a naming convention you want and put it

1278
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:17,360
in the folder you want so that way your media server sees it it's pretty it's it really

1279
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:23,020
is nice i just got the push notification on my phone about chelsea manning's uh sentence

1280
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:30,760
being the book commutes the book the book of the sentence yeah that's amazing that's

1281
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:36,960
great wow well i i might try that out poppy that's that's really cool yeah gimme um i'll

1282
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,980
try the others so now i've looked at sonar and do you say nzb get yeah nzb get which

1283
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:45,400
is i guess you know after i talked about i got a note from a couple people like you should

1284
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:48,940
try nzb get chris it's actually a lot better actually i am using it that's what i am using

1285
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:55,800
now uh sabin zb just seems to be the one that has more traction all right well i'll i'll

1286
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,160
do these and commit them upstream and see what they say but i mean it may well be they

1287
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:03,240
say no because some some projects we've talked to say no no no we're not interested you know

1288
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,560
if you want to put it in the store do it yourself and then you know i could set up a cron job

1289
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,800
that will just grab the latest and push it to the store or something but it's entirely

1290
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:13,680
up to them it's their project yeah they can yeah yeah i hope they i hope they take you

1291
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:19,280
up on it so that would be that would be really great
