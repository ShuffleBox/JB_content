WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
Look at this, we got 37 people in the virtual lug.

00:03.520 --> 00:06.080
Imagine all of us in an actual room together

00:06.080 --> 00:07.600
doing a lug event.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.000
37, 40 people?

00:09.000 --> 00:09.940
That's a little scary.

00:09.940 --> 00:13.520
Don't worry, Wes has homemade hand sanitizer.

00:13.520 --> 00:14.880
You can use it as a lotion.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.840
It's great stuff, we have just buckets of it.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.600
All incented.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.160
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 400.

00:23.160 --> 00:52.920
Music

00:52.920 --> 00:55.860
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

00:55.860 --> 00:56.700
My name is Chris.

00:56.700 --> 00:57.540
My name is Wes.

00:57.540 --> 00:58.500
Hello, Wes.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.680
This special 400th episode of your Unplugged program

01:01.680 --> 01:02.900
is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.300
Learn by doing.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.900
They are the leader in hands-on learning.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.580
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

01:07.580 --> 01:09.980
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs,

01:09.980 --> 01:12.300
Cloud Linux servers, and much more.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.540
Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.580
Welcome in, Mr. Payne.

01:17.580 --> 01:18.420
Congratulations.

01:18.420 --> 01:20.380
400, we're finally here.

01:20.380 --> 01:24.140
It feels nice because not only do we have a lot planned

01:24.140 --> 01:26.500
for this episode, a very special episode,

01:26.500 --> 01:29.940
we have a fantastic showing in the virtual lug.

01:29.940 --> 01:31.900
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:31.900 --> 01:32.800
Hello, hello.

01:32.800 --> 01:33.300
Hello.

01:33.300 --> 01:33.800
Hello.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.300
Hello.

01:34.300 --> 01:34.800
Hello.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.300
Hey.

01:35.300 --> 01:35.800
Hey.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.300
Howdy.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.300
Ha ha.

01:37.300 --> 01:38.580
Whoa.

01:38.580 --> 01:40.380
Man, it is great to see a lot of you.

01:40.380 --> 01:41.860
We have some old friends in there

01:41.860 --> 01:44.660
that have spent a little time away,

01:44.660 --> 01:47.900
but made time special, carved out of their busy schedules

01:47.900 --> 01:50.360
to be here for the 400th episode.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.220
And I don't know about you, Wes, but I

01:53.220 --> 01:54.700
think I smell a little bacon.

01:54.700 --> 01:55.540
What?

01:55.540 --> 01:56.500
A little cheese bacon.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.220
It can't be.

01:57.220 --> 01:57.820
Hey, Cheesy.

01:57.820 --> 01:58.420
Hello.

01:58.420 --> 01:58.920
Hello.

01:58.920 --> 01:59.420
Hello.

01:59.420 --> 01:59.940
Hey, guys.

01:59.940 --> 02:00.580
How's it going?

02:00.580 --> 02:01.900
Welcome back to the show, man.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.700
It's been a little lonely without you.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.180
Well, I miss you guys, too.

02:06.180 --> 02:08.860
It's been a little bit of a hiatus, but yeah, I'm back now.

02:08.860 --> 02:11.900
Well, you have some news to share with the class.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.820
Some exciting news at that.

02:13.820 --> 02:19.300
Yeah, so recently, I guess this will make the third week.

02:19.300 --> 02:22.380
So far, I've recently moved over from ACG

02:22.380 --> 02:26.380
to work with System76 directly as a content producer for them.

02:26.380 --> 02:30.620
So I'll be doing product photography, videography,

02:30.620 --> 02:33.060
of course, content.

02:33.060 --> 02:35.540
Still working through exactly everything I'll be doing there,

02:35.540 --> 02:37.740
but I'm really excited about it.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.420
A great group of people, excited to be working with them.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.460
Man, you know they're in Denver, not Texas, right?

02:42.460 --> 02:45.260
Yes, which means I have to relocate,

02:45.260 --> 02:49.940
which means I have to figure out how to consolidate 15 years

02:49.940 --> 02:53.020
worth of crap and move what I want to Denver

02:53.020 --> 02:54.980
and store what I can't move.

02:54.980 --> 02:56.020
Well, congratulations.

02:56.020 --> 02:56.660
Thanks, man.

02:56.660 --> 02:58.940
I think she's just out Lennox jobbed you.

02:58.940 --> 02:59.500
I know, right?

02:59.500 --> 03:00.000
It's great.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.580
I'm super.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.780
System76 is such, if I were going

03:02.780 --> 03:05.340
to work for a company again, it would probably like,

03:05.340 --> 03:08.540
System76 would be one of the few on a list of three companies

03:08.540 --> 03:10.140
that I'd consider.

03:10.140 --> 03:12.260
They're just a great team over there.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.180
So congratulations.

03:13.180 --> 03:15.940
Also, it's been a little bit since Ironic Badger,

03:15.940 --> 03:18.900
AKA my co-host from the self-hosted podcast, Alex,

03:18.900 --> 03:19.460
has returned.

03:19.460 --> 03:20.980
Alex, welcome back to the show, man.

03:20.980 --> 03:21.580
Hello.

03:21.580 --> 03:24.380
Congratulations to Cheese on his fantastic new job,

03:24.380 --> 03:25.180
by the way.

03:25.180 --> 03:26.020
Good job, mate.

03:26.020 --> 03:26.740
Thanks, man.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.540
Well, also, a congratulations is due for you as well.

03:29.540 --> 03:30.660
You have some news to share.

03:30.660 --> 03:35.780
Yeah, somebody should have stopped me, but I've had a kid.

03:35.780 --> 03:36.540
Congratulations.

03:36.540 --> 03:37.540
Oh, wonderful.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.580
Alex is a daddy.

03:39.580 --> 03:40.340
That's really cool.

03:40.340 --> 03:42.780
He needed another project, and boy, do you have one.

03:42.780 --> 03:44.500
You thought podcasting wasn't enough, huh?

03:44.500 --> 03:45.780
Yeah, I'll tell you what, Wes.

03:45.780 --> 03:49.860
Project velocity has definitely decreased since she arrived.

03:49.860 --> 03:52.420
Well, it's just been reallocated to something well worth it.

03:52.420 --> 03:53.220
Absolutely.

03:53.220 --> 03:55.340
Yeah, it's a lot more long-term project.

03:55.340 --> 03:57.140
Yeah, it's a whole thing.

03:57.140 --> 03:57.940
So thank you.

03:57.940 --> 03:59.540
Thank you for the little nod.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.460
We have a huge turnout.

04:01.460 --> 04:02.540
Of course, Brent's there too.

04:02.540 --> 04:03.060
Hello, Brent.

04:03.060 --> 04:04.260
Good to see you again.

04:04.260 --> 04:05.260
Well, hello.

04:05.260 --> 04:08.180
I have some little news too.

04:08.180 --> 04:09.860
I'm moving near Denver as well.

04:09.860 --> 04:10.460
What?

04:10.460 --> 04:12.260
Congratulations.

04:12.260 --> 04:13.820
I happen to get engaged, actually,

04:13.820 --> 04:15.740
and my fiance is down there.

04:15.740 --> 04:18.620
So I might become half-American.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.340
Look out.

04:19.340 --> 04:24.020
The JB family has grown a lot in the last year and change,

04:24.020 --> 04:25.220
and it's interesting.

04:25.220 --> 04:27.380
It seems like there's some convergence happening

04:27.380 --> 04:30.420
on the Denver area because Drew, who couldn't be here today

04:30.420 --> 04:32.580
because of the day job, will also eventually

04:32.580 --> 04:34.700
be relocating to that area.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.500
JB Central formation.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.660
Yeah, and Wes and I don't mind us a road trip to Denver.

04:39.660 --> 04:40.580
No.

04:40.580 --> 04:41.660
No, we do not.

04:41.660 --> 04:43.140
When are we going to relocate, Chris?

04:43.140 --> 04:44.020
That's the question.

04:44.020 --> 04:45.420
I mean, I'm pretty much good to go.

04:45.420 --> 04:47.460
I think the kids are down too, so we just

04:47.460 --> 04:49.900
got to pick up the jacks and hit the road.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.980
But maybe we'll wait for the passes to clear a little bit.

04:52.980 --> 04:54.500
I think where I'm going to be located

04:54.500 --> 04:58.820
is roughly 45 minutes north of where Brent will be.

04:58.820 --> 05:02.180
So I expect we'll be hanging out a lot more often.

05:02.180 --> 05:06.380
Also, there's a really sweet flight from Payne Field

05:06.380 --> 05:10.540
here in Washington to Denver that is ridiculously cheap when

05:10.540 --> 05:11.820
you think about air travel.

05:11.820 --> 05:14.460
I just like the idea of thinking and conceiving of travel again.

05:14.460 --> 05:19.180
And that was a huge limitation for our 400th episode.

05:19.180 --> 05:22.480
If we could have done anything, no doubt about it,

05:22.480 --> 05:25.140
my preference would have been some big meetup

05:25.140 --> 05:28.700
where we have this experience in person.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.620
But we're not there yet.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.380
That's just not an option.

05:32.380 --> 05:35.100
But we wanted to celebrate our 400th episode somehow.

05:35.100 --> 05:39.020
This show started as the Linux action show Unplugged,

05:39.020 --> 05:42.260
launched in August 12, 2013.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.460
And episode one was Too Much Choice,

05:44.460 --> 05:46.740
classic topic about are there too many distros,

05:46.740 --> 05:49.740
apparently the age-old question that's never been answered.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.980
Fast forward to episode 100, July 7, 2015.

05:52.980 --> 05:56.100
Mr. West Payne joins me after a barbecue, which was a meetup.

05:56.100 --> 05:56.580
Yeah.

05:56.580 --> 05:59.900
Yeah, so celebrating the show's 100 milestones with meetups

05:59.900 --> 06:01.060
is kind of a tradition.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.620
Who would have thought I would still be here

06:02.620 --> 06:04.260
barbecuing at the studio?

06:04.260 --> 06:06.100
We are barbecuing today.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.700
We are absolutely barbecuing today.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.620
We're making a whole day out of it.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.180
But since we didn't have that option,

06:11.180 --> 06:15.220
we still wanted to do something pretty different,

06:15.220 --> 06:17.420
just really kind of have a different experience

06:17.420 --> 06:18.460
altogether.

06:18.460 --> 06:21.580
If you can imagine doing something for nearly eight

06:21.580 --> 06:24.860
years that is entirely digital.

06:24.860 --> 06:27.300
So we work our butts off every week,

06:27.300 --> 06:29.700
and the end product is intangible.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.180
It's like a 30 meg MP3.

06:31.180 --> 06:32.080
Yeah.

06:32.080 --> 06:36.940
And so it's years of collaborating together

06:36.940 --> 06:39.100
on creating something that we've never really

06:39.100 --> 06:40.440
had the tangible result for.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.380
And we thought, wouldn't it be awesome for us

06:43.380 --> 06:47.380
in our 400th episode to do kind of some sort of show prep that

06:47.380 --> 06:50.500
was hands-on, that was physical, that resulted

06:50.500 --> 06:53.580
in a physical object when we were done?

06:53.580 --> 06:59.580
And we've always wanted to do a episode dedicated to the topic

06:59.580 --> 07:03.220
since really the early days of the show of using

07:03.220 --> 07:07.860
Linux to brew beer and make your beer even better.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.580
Yeah, I mean, beer is often a component that

07:10.580 --> 07:12.180
helps make this show better.

07:12.180 --> 07:14.920
So the reverse situation just makes sense, right?

07:14.920 --> 07:16.140
That's very true, right?

07:16.140 --> 07:17.780
I mean, we'll find out.

07:17.780 --> 07:20.340
And so we kind of stated this intention

07:20.340 --> 07:22.500
about over a month ago or something on the air.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.900
And several of you reached out, including

07:25.900 --> 07:27.420
a listener named Corey.

07:27.420 --> 07:30.940
And Corey seemed to really love an app called BeerSmith.

07:30.940 --> 07:31.700
Hey, I'm Corey.

07:31.700 --> 07:32.980
I love BeerSmith.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.500
I've been using it for years.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.420
And his email kind of made us feel

07:37.420 --> 07:40.580
like maybe BeerSmith was the route we should take.

07:40.580 --> 07:43.460
I mean, I even got so into it I contacted the developer of it

07:43.460 --> 07:45.860
and started having a little chat with him.

07:45.860 --> 07:48.620
And so we thought, well, if Corey's

07:48.620 --> 07:50.220
been using this for like a decade,

07:50.220 --> 07:52.380
let's call Corey up and talk to him

07:52.380 --> 07:54.660
about how we could use BeerSmith on Linux

07:54.660 --> 07:56.500
to plan our special beer.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.300
It's a fantastic tool.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.100
There's a lot of calculation that

08:00.100 --> 08:03.380
goes into producing a beer recipe.

08:03.380 --> 08:07.340
And there's a lot of online web pages and calculators

08:07.340 --> 08:07.980
that you can use.

08:07.980 --> 08:11.580
But BeerSmith does a very nice job of integrating all of that

08:11.580 --> 08:16.020
and helping you plan your recipe to hit target alcohol volume,

08:16.020 --> 08:18.620
to hit target bitterness, to even hit target

08:18.620 --> 08:20.620
color of your beer.

08:20.620 --> 08:22.660
And it has a number of calculators

08:22.660 --> 08:24.620
that you can use as you're brewing the beer

08:24.620 --> 08:26.980
and as you're carbonating it.

08:26.980 --> 08:28.500
So it's incredibly useful.

08:28.500 --> 08:32.380
Sounds like, too, that you could use it to recreate a good beer.

08:32.380 --> 08:34.700
So if we really like this unplugged beer,

08:34.700 --> 08:36.900
we could reproduce it.

08:36.900 --> 08:37.700
Absolutely.

08:37.700 --> 08:41.860
It has, you know, you can store your recipes.

08:41.860 --> 08:46.180
You can, you know, save as and fork your recipes, if you will.

08:46.180 --> 08:49.420
I have some recipes that I've been making iterations of

08:49.420 --> 08:50.060
for years.

08:50.060 --> 08:53.780
I do a barley wine, or at least have been after taking a hiatus,

08:53.780 --> 08:55.660
barley wine every year.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.900
And it seems to get stronger every year somehow.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.140
But I started from a basic recipe

09:01.140 --> 09:03.940
and just kind of modified it to make it work for me.

09:03.940 --> 09:07.100
And you can just keep different versions or, you know,

09:07.100 --> 09:08.140
however you want.

09:08.140 --> 09:12.180
You suggested I contact Brad Smith, the author of BeerSmith.

09:12.180 --> 09:15.380
So I emailed him and told him, hey, we're doing a Linux

09:15.380 --> 09:17.700
podcast and we're brewing a beer for our show.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.060
And he wrote back and he told me that he'd

09:20.060 --> 09:23.340
started using Unix back in 85.

09:23.340 --> 09:26.420
He worked alongside people that were working on Arpanet

09:26.420 --> 09:30.420
back in the day, deploying SQL at the Air Force.

09:30.420 --> 09:33.620
He mentioned that he used Minix, that he

09:33.620 --> 09:36.220
has been developing the next version of BeerSmith

09:36.220 --> 09:38.460
and the web version all on Linux.

09:38.460 --> 09:40.340
And he uses BeerSmith on Linux himself.

09:40.340 --> 09:40.820
Yeah.

09:40.820 --> 09:41.860
Isn't that great?

09:41.860 --> 09:42.860
No, it's really awesome.

09:42.860 --> 09:43.700
And he used Minix.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.420
That's, you know, wow.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.420
So, you know, Brad Smith is this really cool guy

09:48.420 --> 09:51.220
who's been doing this software for a long time.

09:51.220 --> 09:55.340
And he has, he's really big in the home brewing community.

09:55.340 --> 09:57.860
He has his podcast, which is, you know,

09:57.860 --> 09:59.580
sponsored by his product, but he's not

09:59.580 --> 10:00.740
pushing his product in it.

10:00.740 --> 10:03.100
He's just talking about general brewing information.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.740
Very active at conferences.

10:04.740 --> 10:06.380
I've never met him or spoke with him,

10:06.380 --> 10:07.980
but he seems like a really great guy.

10:07.980 --> 10:10.660
And for your use case, also on Linux?

10:10.660 --> 10:12.660
BeerSmith been working just fine on Linux?

10:12.660 --> 10:13.300
It works great.

10:13.300 --> 10:16.900
I started using it probably 2012.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.300
I was on Linux Mint at the time.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.660
I googled, what should my first distro be?

10:21.660 --> 10:25.140
And about the same as it is now, Linux Mint came up.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.860
And I used that for a while.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.580
It worked great.

10:27.580 --> 10:30.220
I think it was BeerSmith 2 I was on.

10:30.220 --> 10:33.340
And now I'm using it on Ubuntu Mate.

10:33.340 --> 10:35.060
And it works great.

10:35.060 --> 10:38.220
The only thing that's not awesome is the dark mode.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.460
It's a little jinky.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.220
He doesn't have that fully implemented yet,

10:41.220 --> 10:44.460
but I could just change the theme from dark to light

10:44.460 --> 10:46.020
and boom, works great.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.620
Well, I got BeerSmith installed and have been sort of poking

10:48.620 --> 10:49.260
around.

10:49.260 --> 10:50.620
And you are not kidding.

10:50.620 --> 10:54.660
There is a lot in here, tons of tools, tons of options.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.660
Do you have any tips for actually getting started?

10:56.660 --> 10:59.380
Because we're kind of relearning how to brew beer

10:59.380 --> 11:01.740
and then also maybe learning BeerSmith.

11:01.740 --> 11:04.940
Sometimes it's almost like taking a dump truck

11:04.940 --> 11:05.940
to go grocery shopping.

11:05.940 --> 11:07.900
It has a lot on it.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.180
So what I would recommend for anybody starting out

11:10.180 --> 11:13.340
is start with a kit where they do all the planning for you

11:13.340 --> 11:15.540
and you can kind of see what goes into it.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.460
And you make the kit.

11:17.460 --> 11:21.700
You kind of get your rhythm down, your process down.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.420
And then you start looking at different recipes.

11:24.420 --> 11:25.580
You can get them from books.

11:25.580 --> 11:26.980
There's a ton of them online.

11:26.980 --> 11:29.460
Homebrew Talk is a very good online forum

11:29.460 --> 11:31.220
that's been around forever.

11:31.220 --> 11:32.900
And there's tons of recipes.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.580
And so you can start trying out some of those recipes.

11:35.580 --> 11:39.780
And then you can branch off to make the recipes taste

11:39.780 --> 11:41.140
the way you want.

11:41.140 --> 11:43.100
And part of this, when you start making beers,

11:43.100 --> 11:45.780
you tend to learn a lot about beer.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.580
When I started out brewing beer, I

11:47.580 --> 11:50.660
knew there was Bud Light, there was Guinness,

11:50.660 --> 11:53.260
and there were things that were different than those.

11:53.260 --> 11:54.660
And that was about all I knew.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.820
And you start learning about different beer flavors,

11:56.820 --> 11:59.940
how the malts interact, how the hops play into it,

11:59.940 --> 12:01.540
other than some beers have no hops

12:01.540 --> 12:03.460
and some beers have all the hops.

12:03.460 --> 12:06.060
And you get a bit of foundation of that

12:06.060 --> 12:07.660
when you're using other people's recipes

12:07.660 --> 12:09.260
and when you're using kits.

12:09.260 --> 12:11.460
And then you start kind of figuring out on your own

12:11.460 --> 12:13.580
and making your own recipes.

12:13.580 --> 12:16.220
The beer I have now, I'm calling it Fieldward.

12:16.220 --> 12:20.020
It's a dodgy part of town outside of Waterdeep and D&D.

12:20.020 --> 12:21.380
It's an oatmeal stout.

12:21.380 --> 12:22.700
And I've formulated the recipe.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.620
And I'm quite happy with.

12:24.620 --> 12:25.780
I like that tip.

12:25.780 --> 12:29.380
We basically could learn from others

12:29.380 --> 12:31.740
by following others' recipes and getting these kits.

12:31.740 --> 12:34.140
And it's sort of like training wheels for beer brewing,

12:34.140 --> 12:35.860
because there's just so much to it.

12:35.860 --> 12:36.500
Yeah.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.220
Well, the thing with brewing is this

12:38.220 --> 12:40.860
is one reason why a lot of engineering types

12:40.860 --> 12:44.860
are drawn to it, because there's the creativity part where

12:44.860 --> 12:46.020
you're designing the recipe.

12:46.020 --> 12:47.420
But there's also a process.

12:47.420 --> 12:49.220
And the process is very important,

12:49.220 --> 12:51.300
because you can have an amazing recipe.

12:51.300 --> 12:54.820
But if your process allows for contamination

12:54.820 --> 12:59.220
or if it allows for oxygenation when you don't want it,

12:59.220 --> 13:01.380
there's all these things that could happen

13:01.380 --> 13:03.580
or a bad fermentation temperature that

13:03.580 --> 13:05.100
could give you bad flavors.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.340
So even with the best recipe with the best ingredients

13:07.340 --> 13:09.420
with the highest quality water, if you

13:09.420 --> 13:10.820
don't have your process down, you

13:10.820 --> 13:13.500
could end up with a beer that tastes weird.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.620
So it's great to use some kits or other people's recipes

13:17.620 --> 13:20.400
to start out with and just kind of figure out your process

13:20.400 --> 13:22.060
and how to make that work for you.

13:22.060 --> 13:23.260
Well, Corey, thank you.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.540
Thank you guys very much.

13:24.540 --> 13:26.580
The other great thing about Beersmith, of course,

13:26.580 --> 13:28.460
is that it's a desktop Linux application that

13:28.460 --> 13:29.220
makes a profit.

13:29.220 --> 13:31.420
And it's nice to see some of those as well.

13:31.420 --> 13:33.740
Mr. Bacon, you had a chance to play around with Beersmith,

13:33.740 --> 13:35.100
I know, in your beer past.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.060
Yeah, so previously, I would say maybe this

13:37.060 --> 13:39.460
was four and a half, five years ago.

13:39.460 --> 13:42.460
Another friend of mine, Chris, him and I would brew together.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.260
And he turned me on to Bruce Smith.

13:44.260 --> 13:46.220
And actually, one of the ways we met

13:46.220 --> 13:48.740
is because we were talking about Linux and then brewing,

13:48.740 --> 13:50.620
and then Bruce Smith kind of came up.

13:50.620 --> 13:52.180
One thing that I really love about it

13:52.180 --> 13:55.700
is that you can plan out your brew day easily.

13:55.700 --> 13:59.740
So you basically can have a log of everything

13:59.740 --> 14:03.380
that you need to do, all of the gravity measurements

14:03.380 --> 14:05.300
that you need to take, where they need to be,

14:05.300 --> 14:07.620
what to do to offset that.

14:07.620 --> 14:10.380
But I absolutely agree with the guest

14:10.380 --> 14:13.700
in that you should start with a kit

14:13.700 --> 14:16.780
or start with some recipes that are already available out

14:16.780 --> 14:17.420
there.

14:17.420 --> 14:22.100
There's a great one, it's a left-hand brewing milk stout

14:22.100 --> 14:24.860
clone that's really easy to make.

14:24.860 --> 14:28.500
I would also recommend maybe making an ale,

14:28.500 --> 14:30.340
and maybe not a lager, because generally, you

14:30.340 --> 14:32.660
have to ferment those a little bit cooler.

14:32.660 --> 14:35.820
And so you have to watch out with your fermentation there.

14:35.820 --> 14:37.660
That's what I took away from our conversation,

14:37.660 --> 14:39.420
is we needed a little bit of guidance.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.980
Because Wes and I had both done this at different points,

14:41.980 --> 14:44.980
but we were part of a team, and some others

14:44.980 --> 14:46.700
had done some key components.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.140
So we knew we needed some guidance.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.300
I'd never done it entirely all myself.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.940
And then I opened up Beersmith, which is impressive.

14:52.940 --> 14:55.020
But I mean, there's just so many options,

14:55.020 --> 14:56.060
so many different recipes.

14:56.060 --> 14:59.420
It was like, OK, I need a few fewer variables.

14:59.420 --> 15:01.140
Yeah, and we were thinking about building

15:01.140 --> 15:03.660
a pretty sophisticated brewing setup

15:03.660 --> 15:07.220
with a few different components that would be running Linux,

15:07.220 --> 15:09.540
which we will get to in a bit.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.060
But you were right.

15:11.060 --> 15:12.300
You're right, Jesus.

15:12.300 --> 15:14.020
And it was a point that Cory made, too.

15:14.020 --> 15:17.100
We had to start somewhere that was defined,

15:17.100 --> 15:20.300
because otherwise, it just felt like just so many options.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.740
And we wanted to walk away with a beer that

15:22.740 --> 15:25.220
was better than what you could get in the store on average.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.980
Because I think that's something that you can really

15:26.980 --> 15:29.300
appreciate, is that home brewing can often taste a lot better

15:29.300 --> 15:30.060
than what you buy.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.480
Well, even if it doesn't, it still

15:31.480 --> 15:33.060
tastes better because you made it.

15:33.060 --> 15:33.620
You made it.

15:33.620 --> 15:34.460
It's fresh.

15:34.460 --> 15:35.540
It tastes like pride.

15:35.540 --> 15:37.060
What's really cool about Beersmith

15:37.060 --> 15:39.300
is you can take it all the way to the level you want.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.900
So you can start with a kit where you basically just

15:41.900 --> 15:45.180
have extract, which is all your grains that have been boiled

15:45.180 --> 15:48.260
down into this syrup that you do not want to get on anything

15:48.260 --> 15:49.700
because it is super sticky.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.020
And then you add that to water.

15:51.020 --> 15:52.540
You bring it to a boil.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.020
But then you have all grain brewing,

15:54.020 --> 15:58.020
which is basically where you have all of the grains.

15:58.020 --> 16:01.700
And you boil the grains together to make that same extract

16:01.700 --> 16:03.340
or that same base for your beer.

16:03.340 --> 16:05.420
That delicious, delicious base.

16:05.420 --> 16:09.820
So we put our heads together, thanks to some help from Corey

16:09.820 --> 16:12.260
and a lot of good email that came in.

16:12.260 --> 16:14.580
And some chats that we had with people in Mumble.

16:14.580 --> 16:16.620
We kind of just brought all this information together.

16:16.620 --> 16:19.120
We were leeching off anyone who could give us tips, basically.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.060
I think we came to a game plan.

16:21.060 --> 16:24.220
Because if you think about it, we had only a few weeks

16:24.220 --> 16:24.860
to pull this off.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.620
We needed minimum time to beer here,

16:26.620 --> 16:33.060
both for episode planning reasons and for our own tastes.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.860
Linode.com slash Unplugged.

16:34.860 --> 16:37.900
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards your new account

16:37.900 --> 16:39.460
and, of course, support the show.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.300
I think one of the things I really appreciate

16:41.300 --> 16:43.460
about Linode and I appreciate about our audience

16:43.460 --> 16:47.820
when we get to some milestone like 400 is everybody gets it.

16:47.820 --> 16:50.260
You guys understand that this is a small business,

16:50.260 --> 16:52.920
that we're working hard to pick good sponsors that we think

16:52.920 --> 16:55.380
are going to be really a hit for you.

16:55.380 --> 16:58.940
And you keep those sponsors happy by visiting our promo

16:58.940 --> 17:00.660
URLs, like linode.com slash Unplugged,

17:00.660 --> 17:03.740
because it's a signal that our audience responds

17:03.740 --> 17:05.820
and that we're a worthwhile investment for Linode.

17:05.820 --> 17:08.140
And that cycle has just sort of continued.

17:08.140 --> 17:10.980
As we're now, you think about Jupyter Broadcasting,

17:10.980 --> 17:13.660
we're nearing like 13 years or something like that.

17:13.660 --> 17:16.180
I think that's like 50 years on the internet, right?

17:16.180 --> 17:17.620
I'm pretty sure it works like that.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.060
Yeah, I mean, remember when you started

17:19.060 --> 17:20.580
and there was Ogg files around?

17:20.580 --> 17:21.900
And that's why I'm not sitting here giving

17:21.900 --> 17:23.100
you a read about underwear.

17:23.100 --> 17:26.060
I'm telling you about Linode, which is our cloud hosting

17:26.060 --> 17:26.580
provider.

17:26.580 --> 17:28.180
They're an independent cloud provider.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.980
And that matters more than ever these days.

17:29.980 --> 17:31.860
They started in 2003.

17:31.860 --> 17:34.800
And they have refined what they do down to excellence.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.740
And they make it easy to give your creations

17:36.740 --> 17:38.500
their own personal space on the internet,

17:38.500 --> 17:40.420
no matter what skill level you're at.

17:40.420 --> 17:44.780
If you're an old server salt or if you're brand new to it,

17:44.780 --> 17:46.860
they have a dashboard that's super easy to use

17:46.860 --> 17:48.900
and a technology stack that works with what

17:48.900 --> 17:50.060
you're comfortable with.

17:50.060 --> 17:52.200
Linode will help your ideas come to life on the web.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.340
If it's a personal website or the entire back-end

17:54.340 --> 17:56.780
infrastructure for your point of sale application.

17:56.780 --> 17:58.800
And they have hundreds of guides and tutorials,

17:58.800 --> 18:00.820
one-click application deployments that

18:00.820 --> 18:02.860
make all this stuff really easy to get up and go.

18:02.860 --> 18:03.580
Just go.

18:03.580 --> 18:04.500
Just go.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.260
Westpac is spinning up machines all the time

18:06.260 --> 18:07.300
for testing here on the show.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.060
Yeah, I just like to make you nervous.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.820
I get these email notifications.

18:10.820 --> 18:13.020
I love the email stuff they have set up, too.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.140
One of the ways I can tell that the PeerTube

18:15.140 --> 18:16.200
has gotten a lot of traffic, because I

18:16.200 --> 18:17.360
have some thresholds set up.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.740
So when it reaches a certain amount of transfer,

18:19.740 --> 18:20.740
I get an email.

18:20.740 --> 18:22.780
And it's like, oh, we hit our milestone.

18:22.780 --> 18:24.420
And that's nice for the lazy admin,

18:24.420 --> 18:25.940
when you can mostly ignore it.

18:25.940 --> 18:27.700
But if something's happening, you know.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.460
And then maybe you can go troubleshoot.

18:29.460 --> 18:32.320
It's a great first sign that something could be up, too.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.600
They also have S3-compatible object storage,

18:34.600 --> 18:37.940
cloud firewalls, super fast networking, 11 data centers

18:37.940 --> 18:40.260
worldwide, and much, much more.

18:40.260 --> 18:41.260
So go get started.

18:41.260 --> 18:42.100
And support the show.

18:42.100 --> 18:45.460
And get a $100 60-day credit, $100.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.340
I mean, you could really try all this stuff out,

18:47.340 --> 18:49.180
the different range of machines, all of it.

18:49.180 --> 18:51.100
You go to linode.com slash unplugged.

18:51.100 --> 18:54.500
That's the URL to go to to get that $100 60-day credit

18:54.500 --> 18:56.380
and to support the show.

18:56.380 --> 19:00.900
linode.com slash unplugged.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.400
I don't know if anyone else has heard

19:02.400 --> 19:06.180
of this application or framework called Cloudron.

19:06.180 --> 19:08.820
But just digging around Linode's one clicks,

19:08.820 --> 19:10.300
I came across Cloudron.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.980
Cloud-o-ron, like?

19:11.980 --> 19:14.860
C-L-O-D-R-O-N, Cloudron.

19:14.860 --> 19:15.660
OK, Cloudron.

19:15.660 --> 19:18.860
It'll allow you to stand up basically one-click installs

19:18.860 --> 19:22.460
for all your favorite things, so WordPress, Rocket Chat,

19:22.460 --> 19:25.620
Next Cloud, GitHub, OpenVPN, basically

19:25.620 --> 19:27.620
anything you could want.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.140
And it's basically containers, right?

19:29.140 --> 19:31.020
They're wrapping these containers in there.

19:31.020 --> 19:33.340
But you manage it all from this one central hub.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.180
Really cool, something I probably

19:35.180 --> 19:37.860
would have never found had I not just been digging around

19:37.860 --> 19:39.260
on Linode's one clicks.

19:39.260 --> 19:39.700
Sweet.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.060
We'll put a link to that in the show notes, Cloudron.io.

19:43.060 --> 19:46.720
So with our brew planned, we were ready to start.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.420
But we realized we probably needed some help.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.300
And we realized we were going to have

19:51.300 --> 19:54.460
to move quick to get this ready for 400,

19:54.460 --> 19:55.980
because what's the point of doing

19:55.980 --> 19:58.500
this if we don't have the physical thing

19:58.500 --> 20:00.060
by the 400th episode?

20:00.060 --> 20:01.860
That was the thing we wanted.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.700
And we thought about it for a little bit.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.400
You know what would be kind of a cheat code

20:05.400 --> 20:07.280
is if we could learn off some experts.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.940
And so our first idea was to go to a local brewery

20:10.940 --> 20:13.820
and just sort of spend some time there.

20:13.820 --> 20:15.900
Then I realized that with COVID and all of that,

20:15.900 --> 20:16.740
they probably weren't going to be

20:16.740 --> 20:18.760
cool about a couple of jerks doing a podcast,

20:18.760 --> 20:21.100
calling up and asking to hang out in their brewery all day.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.540
It was dicey to start with.

20:22.540 --> 20:24.380
And now we have an extra hard sell.

20:24.380 --> 20:26.080
Yeah, exactly.

20:26.080 --> 20:29.300
So we found a local brew-your-own beer shop.

20:29.300 --> 20:32.740
And that was, turns out, an ace's move,

20:32.740 --> 20:34.900
because they had smart people who could help us

20:34.900 --> 20:38.540
when we needed it, but were otherwise very hands-off.

20:38.540 --> 20:41.360
And of course, they had top-of-the-line gear,

20:41.360 --> 20:44.780
which would have been quite the initial investment for us.

20:44.780 --> 20:47.140
So Wes and I are out here outside of Gallagher's

20:47.140 --> 20:50.340
Where You Brew in Edmonds, Washington.

20:50.340 --> 20:52.380
Are you ready to learn how to make beer, Wes?

20:52.380 --> 20:53.220
Oh, yeah.

20:53.220 --> 20:55.100
We figured we'd learn from the pros directly.

20:55.100 --> 20:57.380
And also drink beer while we make beer,

20:57.380 --> 20:59.780
because they serve beer, too, let's be honest.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.700
This sounds like a recipe for success.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.660
And the nice thing was is they were totally chill.

21:04.660 --> 21:08.180
They let us get in, kind of get acquainted with the space.

21:08.180 --> 21:12.020
And they also were really great about just giving us

21:12.020 --> 21:15.620
a crash course on some beer basics.

21:15.620 --> 21:19.020
But the yeast, the yeast will get up all the sugar,

21:19.020 --> 21:21.180
turn it on to CO2 and alcohol.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.100
After about a week, there'll be no sugar,

21:23.100 --> 21:25.260
so the yeast will fall out of suspension, right?

21:25.260 --> 21:28.620
After that happens, we'll take it back here to the cold room.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.840
This is a beer nursery.

21:32.900 --> 21:33.740
Go ahead.

21:33.740 --> 21:35.500
The athlete and cold room.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.620
Yeah, really.

21:36.620 --> 21:38.740
They had this perfect setup that we were gonna be

21:38.740 --> 21:40.840
totally taking advantage of.

21:40.840 --> 21:44.620
So we were pretty set, but we knew since we were drinking

21:44.620 --> 21:48.340
beer as we went, we'd probably need some brain backup,

21:48.340 --> 21:50.740
not to mention a designated driver.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.900
Sloppy idiots that we are.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.940
I think it's best that Adia do all the precise measuring out.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.540
What do you think, Chris?

21:57.540 --> 21:58.100
Definitely.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.100
Gotta bring the wife in.

22:00.100 --> 22:03.340
Well, it did take precision, but at least it was fun.

22:03.340 --> 22:05.420
Yeah, she's always bringing in the puns, too.

22:05.420 --> 22:07.500
She insisted.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.300
Then we get to work, and we have a recipe

22:10.300 --> 22:11.500
that we've planned out.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.780
We've kind of run it past these guys.

22:13.780 --> 22:15.980
It's essentially a Belgium triple,

22:15.980 --> 22:19.060
but we wanted to make some modifications.

22:19.060 --> 22:22.980
And like all professional brewers,

22:22.980 --> 22:26.620
we made those modifications at the absolute last minute.

22:26.620 --> 22:28.460
In what may prove to be our undoing,

22:28.460 --> 22:31.820
we've made a last minute recipe adjustment.

22:31.820 --> 22:35.340
After all of our planning, all of our considering,

22:35.340 --> 22:38.460
literally here at the last minute, we decided, well,

22:38.460 --> 22:39.300
let's change it up.

22:39.300 --> 22:41.020
So what do we do?

22:41.020 --> 22:44.060
It's a last minute malt swap.

22:44.060 --> 22:46.860
Turns out we had a lot of lager going into this already.

22:46.860 --> 22:48.580
Nine liters.

22:48.580 --> 22:50.320
We decided eight was probably enough.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.580
And instead, we're sticking with originally,

22:52.580 --> 22:54.780
we were called for one liter of wheat.

22:54.780 --> 22:56.060
That's up to two.

22:56.060 --> 22:56.940
That's right.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.380
Two fancy liters.

22:58.380 --> 23:01.660
After all that special planning, it was just sort of a whim.

23:01.660 --> 23:02.620
And I think it paid off.

23:02.620 --> 23:03.780
I think so.

23:03.780 --> 23:06.460
But the moment really came to West.

23:06.460 --> 23:10.060
Like, if I were to think back of that day,

23:10.060 --> 23:13.540
there was one moment where you saved the day.

23:13.540 --> 23:16.180
Touch and go Westpain just saved this thing from boiling over.

23:16.180 --> 23:19.620
He jumped up like an agile lion out of his seat

23:19.620 --> 23:23.500
and pulled the, what do you call this, massive wizard staff

23:23.500 --> 23:24.700
that he's stirring with.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.820
It's the beer wand.

23:25.820 --> 23:27.100
He saved it with the beer wand.

23:27.100 --> 23:30.580
So now it's time to add the bittering agents.

23:30.580 --> 23:32.340
I mean, you got the boil just right.

23:32.340 --> 23:34.500
You added the bittering agents just right.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.860
I was getting a little too beer happy by that point.

23:36.860 --> 23:39.180
Well, it's hard when they sell delicious beer at the spot

23:39.180 --> 23:40.300
that you're making beer.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.260
But I mean, they had such incredible equipment

23:42.260 --> 23:43.780
and like steam power in this.

23:43.780 --> 23:45.620
So it really got up to a boil pretty quick.

23:45.620 --> 23:47.980
And it did almost boil over.

23:47.980 --> 23:50.180
So really, once I think you had the confidence

23:50.180 --> 23:52.380
of saving the brew, like the gazelle that you are,

23:52.380 --> 23:55.240
I kind of felt like it empowered you.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.380
And you sort of went into full artisan mode.

23:57.380 --> 23:59.380
We've officially entered late stage brewing.

23:59.380 --> 24:02.700
And the craftsman in Westpain is really emerging.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.500
Tell us about the special care you're taking.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.140
Well, it's really important that we infuse

24:06.140 --> 24:09.140
as much cracked coriander and orange peel in here

24:09.140 --> 24:10.660
as we can.

24:10.660 --> 24:11.860
That's what makes it so tasty.

24:11.860 --> 24:13.860
I mean, you really, you know, you took charge.

24:13.860 --> 24:15.660
You really made it special.

24:15.660 --> 24:20.900
And so I think you earned the final honor of releasing it

24:20.900 --> 24:22.580
and storing it.

24:22.580 --> 24:23.820
Our time has arrived.

24:23.820 --> 24:26.700
It is time to transfer it to the primary fermenter.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.780
Westpain will be in charge of the transfer valve.

24:29.780 --> 24:32.700
It is a responsibility like no other.

24:32.700 --> 24:33.660
Hey, good sir.

24:33.660 --> 24:35.140
Go ahead with that warp.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.620
Perfect.

24:36.620 --> 24:38.580
Warp's coming your way.

24:38.580 --> 24:40.140
Wes has flipped the warp valve.

24:40.140 --> 24:42.780
And now our beer is going down a series of tubes

24:42.780 --> 24:45.420
and into what can only be described

24:45.420 --> 24:50.620
as a vessel, a sacred vessel, that will hold our beer.

24:50.620 --> 24:51.940
Here it goes, Wes.

24:51.940 --> 24:52.740
Here goes our beer.

24:52.740 --> 24:53.940
Cool.

24:53.940 --> 24:54.700
Look at it flow.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.020
That is pretty great.

24:56.020 --> 24:56.520
All right.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.180
Want to go down the hole?

24:58.180 --> 25:00.380
You can watch it drain right out of the kettle.

25:00.380 --> 25:02.020
From the kettle into the storage.

25:02.020 --> 25:06.220
And then we come back in two weeks and we bottle.

25:06.220 --> 25:10.300
It felt kind of like somewhat anticlimactic to walk away

25:10.300 --> 25:12.420
because then you don't know what's going to happen.

25:12.420 --> 25:13.860
Like, did we mess something up?

25:13.860 --> 25:15.380
That last minute tweaking?

25:15.380 --> 25:16.540
Did we drink too many beers?

25:16.540 --> 25:17.780
Only time would tell.

25:17.780 --> 25:19.180
We had to wait.

25:19.180 --> 25:22.860
Yeah, and so it was indeed a bit of a wait.

25:22.860 --> 25:25.260
But we will get back to that.

25:25.260 --> 25:27.060
We had lessons to learn in the meantime.

25:27.060 --> 25:28.420
But before I get to those, I want

25:28.420 --> 25:30.780
to say hello to Drew, who's making a last minute

25:30.780 --> 25:31.280
appearance.

25:31.280 --> 25:31.780
Hey, Drew.

25:31.780 --> 25:32.580
Hey, guys.

25:32.580 --> 25:34.340
I leave for, what, like six months

25:34.340 --> 25:36.100
and you're out here brewing beer?

25:36.100 --> 25:38.100
Good Lord.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.100
Hello, hello, sir.

25:39.100 --> 25:39.740
How are you?

25:39.740 --> 25:41.140
It's good to hear from you.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.900
Doing well, doing well.

25:42.900 --> 25:45.540
I didn't want to miss episode 400.

25:45.540 --> 25:47.380
Well, we appreciate you being here.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.960
I was just telling everybody earlier

25:48.960 --> 25:51.660
that we felt like for 400 we wanted something tangible.

25:51.660 --> 25:54.100
You work on something for like almost eight years

25:54.100 --> 25:56.200
and it's always a virtual product.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.300
It was nice to do something that we could sit here

25:58.300 --> 25:59.860
and actually hold in our hands.

25:59.860 --> 26:01.140
So empowering.

26:01.140 --> 26:02.340
I think you know what I mean.

26:02.340 --> 26:03.020
I sure do.

26:03.020 --> 26:03.640
I sure do.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.260
And I hope you save me a bottle for the next time

26:05.260 --> 26:06.180
I'm out there.

26:06.180 --> 26:06.900
Oh, you know it.

26:06.900 --> 26:07.720
You know it.

26:07.720 --> 26:09.260
Yeah, that's absolutely happening.

26:09.260 --> 26:11.060
Yeah, so don't you worry about that.

26:11.060 --> 26:13.100
In fact, I have more on that in a little bit.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.900
But we figured we'd spend the time while we waited

26:15.900 --> 26:19.000
for our beer, anticipating what would happen next,

26:19.000 --> 26:20.860
learning how to take this to the next level.

26:20.860 --> 26:23.540
Because I think even before we were done,

26:23.540 --> 26:25.380
you and I agreed we were enjoying this.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.740
Yeah, we were having a good time.

26:26.740 --> 26:29.500
And sure, yeah, we pressed the easy button to start out with.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.740
But we liked learning about this.

26:31.740 --> 26:33.500
There was more to learn and we were interested.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.980
And the entire time when we were using their equipment,

26:35.980 --> 26:38.300
we were like, OK, if we were doing this at the studio

26:38.300 --> 26:40.600
or something, how would we do this?

26:40.600 --> 26:43.460
And we would look up gear on YouTube or online

26:43.460 --> 26:45.700
and look at equivalents that we could use.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.660
And the guys at Gallagher's were really cool about saying,

26:48.660 --> 26:51.760
OK, if you're doing this at home, you would do it this way.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.940
And so that was really handy to help us picture

26:53.940 --> 26:56.820
what it might be like if we wanted to keep doing this

26:56.820 --> 27:00.620
and maybe brew some beer on a more regular cadence.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.320
So we put our heads together and thought,

27:02.320 --> 27:04.820
if we're going to do this long term,

27:04.820 --> 27:06.500
we need some tips from a pro.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.640
And so we caught up with Late Night Linux's Graham Morrison,

27:09.640 --> 27:13.940
who has a full Linux-powered, full-timers brewing setup.

27:13.940 --> 27:16.900
So Graham, before we go too far, could you describe to us

27:16.900 --> 27:18.660
your current brew setup?

27:18.660 --> 27:23.440
So my current brew setup is that I use a closed fermentation

27:23.440 --> 27:29.220
system to basically turn the wort into alcohol beer.

27:29.220 --> 27:33.700
And then I transfer that under pressure to a corny keg

27:33.700 --> 27:36.440
when it's ready to basically drink.

27:36.440 --> 27:37.980
It's almost ready to drink after that.

27:37.980 --> 27:39.980
So it can take 10 days, two weeks,

27:39.980 --> 27:41.740
which is a lot quicker than bottling.

27:41.740 --> 27:43.460
I was surprised by that.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.900
I guess I thought part of the brewing process

27:45.900 --> 27:47.500
involved putting it in the bottle

27:47.500 --> 27:50.180
and then having it sit in the bottle for a couple of weeks.

27:50.180 --> 27:51.940
That actually improves the beer.

27:51.940 --> 27:56.300
Certain beers, kind of Belgian beers, are very strong beers.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.060
Or beers that take some time to mature

27:58.060 --> 28:00.340
or their flavors to mellow can really

28:00.340 --> 28:02.420
benefit from being in a bottle.

28:02.420 --> 28:03.380
That's interesting, Wes.

28:03.380 --> 28:04.620
We should take note of that.

28:04.620 --> 28:05.380
Indeed.

28:05.380 --> 28:07.420
But it's a lot more hassle.

28:07.420 --> 28:09.220
You have to clean the bottles.

28:09.220 --> 28:13.240
You have to individually prime them for carbonation.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.660
And you have to then transfer the beer to each bottle, which

28:15.660 --> 28:19.140
almost you may even have to transfer from the fermentation

28:19.140 --> 28:24.020
bin to a secondary fermentation bin to let all the trube leave

28:24.020 --> 28:26.300
at the bottom of the first bin.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.420
Whereas transferring under pressure

28:28.420 --> 28:31.380
from the fermentation vessel to a corny keg

28:31.380 --> 28:32.740
is a single step process.

28:32.740 --> 28:34.540
And you only have to clean the corny keg.

28:34.540 --> 28:35.520
And it carbonates.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.060
And you can adjust how much carbonation you want,

28:38.060 --> 28:39.580
which for me is important.

28:39.580 --> 28:41.100
That is a good tip.

28:41.100 --> 28:43.860
So what I like about your setup is it

28:43.860 --> 28:46.740
feels to me kind of getting into this again for the first time.

28:46.740 --> 28:48.340
I feel like I'm totally starting over.

28:48.340 --> 28:52.580
And your setup feels to me like it's, I don't know,

28:52.580 --> 28:53.820
about a long-term setup.

28:53.820 --> 28:57.100
But it's sort of like lessons learned

28:57.100 --> 28:59.340
have gone into creating something that lets you just

28:59.340 --> 29:02.320
brew beer whenever the fancy strikes you.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.140
How does Linux play a role in that?

29:04.140 --> 29:06.540
I used to brew beer with just a fermentation bin

29:06.540 --> 29:09.820
under the stairs at house temperature, basically.

29:09.820 --> 29:11.440
Yeah, that's what I'm familiar with.

29:11.440 --> 29:11.940
Yeah.

29:11.940 --> 29:14.940
And the quality is like, I don't know,

29:14.940 --> 29:18.900
can I say it's like a 1970s porn film of beer?

29:18.900 --> 29:21.100
I mean, some people have a thing for that.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.740
Yeah, and it's fine.

29:22.740 --> 29:25.940
But it just makes me think of rainy caravan holidays.

29:25.940 --> 29:29.420
Whereas what really made the difference,

29:29.420 --> 29:32.500
the quality increased like 1,000%

29:32.500 --> 29:35.980
was when I controlled the temperature of the fermentation

29:35.980 --> 29:39.320
process exactly, which is where the yeast is doing all its work.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.420
And the yeast has to work at this optimum temperature.

29:42.420 --> 29:44.860
And to control the temperature, I basically

29:44.860 --> 29:47.340
used, in the beginning, it was this open source project

29:47.340 --> 29:50.260
called BrewPi, which actually ran

29:50.260 --> 29:52.940
on a little bit of firmware running on an Arduino Uno

29:52.940 --> 29:56.180
that actually did, if you're familiar with PID,

29:56.180 --> 29:57.820
like PID controlling, I think it's

29:57.820 --> 30:00.900
like proportional integral derivatives.

30:00.900 --> 30:05.260
And they basically, one sensor measures the temperature.

30:05.260 --> 30:08.500
And then a couple of relays either turn on heating

30:08.500 --> 30:10.040
or they turn on cooling.

30:10.040 --> 30:13.260
And the PID part is the fact that because this big volume

30:13.260 --> 30:16.740
of liquid, it can anticipate temperature changes

30:16.740 --> 30:18.860
according to environmental conditions.

30:18.860 --> 30:22.980
So you get within a tenth of a degree accuracy

30:22.980 --> 30:24.360
of temperature controlling.

30:24.360 --> 30:27.380
So you can basically, with the BrewPi, with the RaspberryPi,

30:27.380 --> 30:29.980
and an Arduino, control exactly the temperature

30:29.980 --> 30:32.340
of the fermentation process and monitor it.

30:32.340 --> 30:36.580
So it's pulling in a weather API feed to monitor that?

30:36.580 --> 30:38.980
The original BrewPi did it all on its own.

30:38.980 --> 30:41.540
It was this self-contained unit.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.380
BrewPi actually was so successful

30:43.380 --> 30:45.900
as this individual project, they spun it into a business.

30:45.900 --> 30:48.300
And they sell their kind of bespoke hardware

30:48.300 --> 30:50.500
and closed source firmware now.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.100
But the platform was popular enough

30:53.100 --> 30:55.860
to be integrated into something called Firmantrack, which

30:55.860 --> 30:59.300
is an open source project that integrates

30:59.300 --> 31:03.100
a lot of that old open source BrewPi software

31:03.100 --> 31:04.460
to work with the same hardware.

31:04.460 --> 31:10.300
And more importantly, actually work with the ESP8266 devices,

31:10.300 --> 31:13.220
low cost microcontrollers, and expands it.

31:13.220 --> 31:16.100
It dumps PHP and makes it all modern REST frameworks.

31:16.100 --> 31:19.020
So that all operates over a REST API,

31:19.020 --> 31:20.900
which you can integrate with Home Assistant,

31:20.900 --> 31:23.380
or you can push to the cloud, do whatever you want.

31:23.380 --> 31:25.620
But it's basically the same PID algorithm

31:25.620 --> 31:27.820
that's controlling the temperature of the fermentation.

31:27.820 --> 31:28.300
Wow.

31:28.300 --> 31:29.940
I got to just sit with that for a moment.

31:29.940 --> 31:33.100
A REST API for brewing beer.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.140
Yeah.

31:34.140 --> 31:35.460
So it really sounds like what I'm

31:35.460 --> 31:37.620
getting from what you've kind of described

31:37.620 --> 31:40.740
is that controlling that temperature

31:40.740 --> 31:45.180
is the secret to unlocking delicious great home

31:45.180 --> 31:47.660
beer versus beer that's OK.

31:47.660 --> 31:49.060
Yeah, it really is.

31:49.060 --> 31:52.140
There are some yeasts that a yeast will

31:52.140 --> 31:53.420
have an ideal temperature.

31:53.420 --> 31:55.940
In centigrade, it could be like 21 degrees.

31:55.940 --> 31:58.060
And you might even start low.

31:58.060 --> 32:01.540
Like with a good pilsner, you might start at 18 degrees C.

32:01.540 --> 32:03.820
And then after a couple of days, ramp it up to 22

32:03.820 --> 32:04.660
and then drop it.

32:04.660 --> 32:08.020
You might cold crash when there's no sign of any further

32:08.020 --> 32:09.540
fermentation.

32:09.540 --> 32:12.740
And you can check the amount of fermentation

32:12.740 --> 32:15.900
that's going on with something called like an iSpindle, which

32:15.900 --> 32:18.260
is it's not quite open source, but it's

32:18.260 --> 32:21.180
a DIY project where the firmware can be downloaded and installed.

32:21.180 --> 32:22.700
The code is accessible, but it has

32:22.700 --> 32:25.220
one of those weird licenses attached to it

32:25.220 --> 32:26.740
so they can try and make money off it.

32:26.740 --> 32:27.980
Sure, you got it.

32:27.980 --> 32:31.860
Have you experimented or done any kind of visualization

32:31.860 --> 32:34.140
or graphing of the temperatures over time

32:34.140 --> 32:36.660
just so you have something to look at data-wise?

32:36.660 --> 32:39.580
Yeah, so Fermentrack does exactly this.

32:39.580 --> 32:42.260
So there's usually two or three sensors involved.

32:42.260 --> 32:46.540
And these are really simple $0.50 sensors.

32:46.540 --> 32:48.140
They use like the one-wire protocol.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.500
They do nothing extraordinary other than report

32:50.500 --> 32:51.140
the temperature.

32:51.140 --> 32:53.380
There's one for the inside the beer.

32:53.380 --> 32:56.060
So you normally use a fermentation bin

32:56.060 --> 32:58.980
with what's called a Thermowell, which is like a cylinder you

32:58.980 --> 33:00.260
put straight into the beer.

33:00.260 --> 33:02.380
And then the sensor goes right into the middle of the beer.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.700
So you get the exact temperature inside the beer.

33:04.700 --> 33:07.020
But you can also use the temperature on the ice spindle,

33:07.020 --> 33:08.380
which can sit inside the beer.

33:08.380 --> 33:09.780
That's the temperature of the beer.

33:09.780 --> 33:12.180
Then there's a temperature inside.

33:12.180 --> 33:14.540
Usually, you use an old refrigerator.

33:14.540 --> 33:17.460
So you put the fermentation bin inside the refrigerator.

33:17.460 --> 33:19.860
And so you get the temperature inside that and then

33:19.860 --> 33:22.220
a temperature of the room, the environment outside that.

33:22.220 --> 33:24.660
Those three temperatures together

33:24.660 --> 33:27.540
are mulched in the algorithm to control

33:27.540 --> 33:28.900
the temperature of the brew.

33:28.900 --> 33:29.820
That is fancy.

33:29.820 --> 33:31.700
Mulched.

33:31.700 --> 33:32.860
That is so great.

33:32.860 --> 33:33.420
Yeah.

33:33.420 --> 33:36.740
And it turns that I put a little heater in the fridge.

33:36.740 --> 33:39.060
This is all that I've done is there's two relays.

33:39.060 --> 33:42.460
So a relay with a simple 5-volt signal from the Arduino

33:42.460 --> 33:45.380
will turn on something or turn off something.

33:45.380 --> 33:46.020
Two relays.

33:46.020 --> 33:47.660
So one turns on the refrigeration.

33:47.660 --> 33:49.460
The other one turns on the heating element,

33:49.460 --> 33:51.460
which is just what in the UK you get them

33:51.460 --> 33:53.260
for like summer houses or greenhouses.

33:53.260 --> 33:54.980
It's a small, low-cost thing you can bolt

33:54.980 --> 33:56.460
to the bottom of the fridge.

33:56.460 --> 33:59.020
And so all of that, sorry to answer your question,

33:59.020 --> 34:02.260
in Fermentrac and in Brusella before it, you can see all

34:02.260 --> 34:05.380
of that in a chart to monitor exactly all the temperatures,

34:05.380 --> 34:08.460
how things are going, and also put on top of that

34:08.460 --> 34:12.380
the gravity of the beer, so how well it's actually fermenting,

34:12.380 --> 34:15.180
how strong it's fermenting, and the alcohol content of the beer

34:15.180 --> 34:16.100
as you go through it.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.020
And then when that starts to flatline,

34:18.020 --> 34:20.420
you know then you can dry hops the beer

34:20.420 --> 34:22.500
if you're going to do that, or you can transfer it

34:22.500 --> 34:24.140
to bottles or a keg.

34:24.140 --> 34:27.060
All right, so then I have really kind of one really ultimate

34:27.060 --> 34:27.580
question.

34:27.580 --> 34:30.980
Looking back at the last decade or so of homebrewing,

34:30.980 --> 34:33.700
all of these different things that you can do,

34:33.700 --> 34:36.420
features you could do, what has helped the most?

34:36.420 --> 34:40.900
And what would you tell past Graham if you could?

34:40.900 --> 34:42.780
What advice can you pass along to us?

34:42.780 --> 34:44.940
The thing that's really made a difference, I think,

34:44.940 --> 34:48.420
with lots of things is the quality of the ingredients.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.740
So the wort kits that you can get,

34:51.740 --> 34:55.100
you can buy them separate with the malt extract

34:55.100 --> 34:58.220
and with the kind of boiled down wort.

34:58.220 --> 35:00.020
Don't kind of skimp money on those kits

35:00.020 --> 35:01.020
if you're going to do it.

35:01.020 --> 35:03.620
And of course, if you're going to brew and mash your own beer

35:03.620 --> 35:06.100
even better, that's like the first step.

35:06.100 --> 35:07.180
Get that right.

35:07.180 --> 35:08.900
Follow the instructions for the yeast

35:08.900 --> 35:10.820
because that's really important.

35:10.820 --> 35:13.020
And then really bottle the stuff that's

35:13.020 --> 35:15.500
really important, that's going to keep, that you want to come

35:15.500 --> 35:16.700
back to.

35:16.700 --> 35:19.340
But otherwise, the keg was the big innovation for me

35:19.340 --> 35:21.260
because it speeds up.

35:21.260 --> 35:25.180
You can set carbonation exactly as you want it.

35:25.180 --> 35:28.660
You can speed up the fermentation under pressure.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.460
So I brew everything under pressure.

35:30.460 --> 35:31.300
I like that tip.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.580
That does seem like a good one.

35:32.580 --> 35:36.220
I actually wrote that one down on an actual piece of paper.

35:36.220 --> 35:38.820
I'm like, I got to make a note and talk to Wes about that.

35:38.820 --> 35:41.860
So looking back at it, do you have a favorite go-to beer

35:41.860 --> 35:42.580
that you brew?

35:42.580 --> 35:44.940
Well, I actually got into this after going

35:44.940 --> 35:49.180
to Portland in the US and really getting hooked.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.660
You know, there's got an amazing beer scene.

35:51.660 --> 35:54.980
I've really got to taste that hoppy kind of West Coast

35:54.980 --> 35:57.300
Portland IPA.

35:57.300 --> 35:59.340
And in the UK, you just couldn't get it.

35:59.340 --> 36:02.180
But I could buy the work kits.

36:02.180 --> 36:05.220
I could ferment them here, and I could bottle them here.

36:05.220 --> 36:08.140
And it was as close as I could get

36:08.140 --> 36:11.580
to getting a pint of those West Coast IPAs on tap

36:11.580 --> 36:13.060
here in the UK.

36:13.060 --> 36:15.020
And that's what really got me into it.

36:15.020 --> 36:16.900
And so I still really love going back to them.

36:16.900 --> 36:19.820
But right at the moment, I've got a New Zealand Pilsner,

36:19.820 --> 36:21.140
which is perfect as well.

36:21.140 --> 36:22.060
I'm really enjoying it.

36:22.060 --> 36:23.700
And the nice thing is you can change,

36:23.700 --> 36:26.940
and it's a bit like being at the pub while the pubs are closed.

36:26.940 --> 36:27.260
Indeed.

36:27.260 --> 36:29.900
You're exploring the world while you can't travel through beer.

36:29.900 --> 36:30.460
Yeah.

36:30.460 --> 36:30.940
I love it.

36:30.940 --> 36:31.940
Graham, thank you.

36:31.940 --> 36:34.820
No problem.

36:34.820 --> 36:36.580
I want to tell you about a special course

36:36.580 --> 36:38.060
from our friends at a Cloud Guru.

36:38.060 --> 36:39.700
We will have a link in the show notes.

36:39.700 --> 36:44.340
It is the SUSE Linux Enterprise Admin Review and Exam Prep.

36:44.340 --> 36:46.780
Is it time to become a SUSE Certified Administrator?

36:46.780 --> 36:49.620
Well, they have the prep course for you.

36:49.620 --> 36:53.100
It'll get you ready for the exam and final exam courses.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.500
And they have all the information

36:54.500 --> 36:57.940
you need to become prepared to get certified.

36:57.940 --> 37:00.940
Exam prep courses are designed to be a review of the content

37:00.940 --> 37:02.660
from each of the courses proceeding

37:02.660 --> 37:06.280
to get you really kind of just set on the important points,

37:06.280 --> 37:10.100
tips, and areas that will be an issue for an exam

37:10.100 --> 37:11.120
in particular.

37:11.120 --> 37:13.820
That's what these are kind of tooled for, including even

37:13.820 --> 37:16.660
how to register and go get the final exam and all of that.

37:16.660 --> 37:17.460
It's all covered.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.340
We'll have a link in the show notes

37:19.340 --> 37:20.780
to the course for our Cloud Gurus,

37:20.780 --> 37:24.020
SUSE Linux Enterprise Admin Review and Exam Prep.

37:27.060 --> 37:29.300
Graham has such an awesome setup.

37:29.300 --> 37:32.180
After listening to that, I was like, yeah, we're definitely

37:32.180 --> 37:34.140
going to be following some of this advice.

37:34.140 --> 37:37.180
It was really nice to get his decade's perspective

37:37.180 --> 37:38.420
on how to do this right.

37:38.420 --> 37:38.820
Yes.

37:38.820 --> 37:41.380
And I think he's hit a nice kind of sweet spot where it's,

37:41.380 --> 37:43.260
you know, much like with audio, you

37:43.260 --> 37:45.700
can kind of invest as much as you want in beer brewing

37:45.700 --> 37:49.500
equipment, it seems, but we don't really need to do that

37:49.500 --> 37:51.020
or have the space at the studio.

37:51.020 --> 37:53.700
So finding the, like, dialed-in setup that just works,

37:53.700 --> 37:56.260
gets good quality beer, but doesn't have to go crazy all

37:56.260 --> 37:58.740
out with, like, six different containers and systems

37:58.740 --> 38:01.260
and setups and transfers, that's what we were looking for.

38:01.260 --> 38:02.200
Yeah.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.940
So, you know, time passed.

38:03.940 --> 38:06.620
We let about three weeks go because we were planning ahead

38:06.620 --> 38:09.480
for LUP 400, but we didn't have a lot of time.

38:09.480 --> 38:12.020
And so we really didn't know how things were going to be.

38:12.020 --> 38:15.340
So Saturday came rolling along, and we showed back up

38:15.340 --> 38:19.900
at Gallagher's in Edmonds, Washington.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.180
Hello, Wes.

38:21.180 --> 38:22.620
It's been three weeks.

38:22.620 --> 38:23.540
It's been three weeks.

38:23.540 --> 38:23.960
Here you go.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.120
We got you a beverage, I guess.

38:25.120 --> 38:25.700
Look at that.

38:25.700 --> 38:26.200
Yeah.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.100
A beverage.

38:27.100 --> 38:28.060
That's colorful.

38:28.060 --> 38:28.980
Looks tasty.

38:28.980 --> 38:29.660
Clementine.

38:29.660 --> 38:31.180
Probably should have something besides beer today.

38:31.180 --> 38:32.140
I suppose that's true.

38:32.140 --> 38:35.580
And once we got in there, we knew, like, some things we were

38:35.580 --> 38:37.300
just so grateful were already set up,

38:37.300 --> 38:39.020
like their whole bottle washing system.

38:39.020 --> 38:39.620
Wow.

38:39.620 --> 38:40.380
Very nice.

38:40.380 --> 38:43.260
Made it way simpler to get up and get going.

38:43.260 --> 38:44.940
I'm going to get these started washing.

38:44.940 --> 38:46.180
You guys get those going.

38:46.180 --> 38:48.860
And over here, I'll bring you some more bottles out as well.

38:48.860 --> 38:49.340
All right.

38:49.340 --> 38:49.980
Thank you.

38:49.980 --> 38:51.020
I was doing the math last night.

38:51.020 --> 38:52.240
It seemed like we were clips, but I wasn't sure

38:52.240 --> 38:53.820
how many bottles we had.

38:53.820 --> 38:55.900
All I can think about is we got kegs.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.100
I'm so glad we got kegs.

38:57.100 --> 38:57.600
Me too.

38:57.600 --> 38:58.100
Why?

38:58.100 --> 38:59.640
Because it'll make this so much easier?

38:59.640 --> 39:00.140
Well, yeah.

39:00.140 --> 39:03.140
And then, like, we have kegs.

39:03.140 --> 39:04.860
Boy, did it make it easier.

39:04.860 --> 39:07.140
I mean, we didn't even have to fill the kegs ourselves.

39:07.140 --> 39:08.500
They just did it for us.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.020
I don't know if we would have thought of that if Graham hadn't

39:10.020 --> 39:11.060
said something.

39:11.060 --> 39:14.140
But one of the advantages of using Gallagher's really rad

39:14.140 --> 39:17.580
setup is we could dial in the carbonation in a way

39:17.580 --> 39:20.180
that we wouldn't have been able to do with a newbie setup.

39:20.180 --> 39:21.760
We're trying it out for the first time

39:21.760 --> 39:22.900
before we bottle and keg it.

39:22.900 --> 39:25.380
And I want to get Wes' first impressions.

39:25.380 --> 39:26.060
Smooth.

39:26.060 --> 39:28.860
There's definitely booze in there.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.060
And it's tasty.

39:30.060 --> 39:33.260
I think we decided it needs a little more carbonation, maybe.

39:33.260 --> 39:35.220
But other than that.

39:35.220 --> 39:35.720
I like it.

39:35.720 --> 39:36.380
I like it a lot.

39:36.380 --> 39:38.380
I think once we get a little more carbonation,

39:38.380 --> 39:39.100
it'll be perfect.

39:39.100 --> 39:43.260
But the flavor, the color, it's a beautiful beer.

39:43.260 --> 39:44.460
Look at that.

39:44.460 --> 39:48.020
Golden, it takes the light well, lights up the glass.

39:48.020 --> 39:51.180
I got to snap a picture of the first look at this beer.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.900
And with the help of their brewmaster,

39:52.900 --> 39:55.260
who kind of encouraged us to dial it up just a little bit

39:55.260 --> 39:55.820
more.

39:55.820 --> 39:57.860
Happened to be a Belgian fan himself.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.260
Yeah, we did it.

39:59.260 --> 40:00.780
We took the plunge.

40:00.780 --> 40:02.820
It doesn't look any more bubbly.

40:02.820 --> 40:04.200
So we're not going by appearance.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.020
We're going for that bite on the tongue.

40:06.020 --> 40:09.260
This thing minimizes the amount of turbulence that it gets.

40:09.260 --> 40:13.100
So you won't be able to see much of the foam there.

40:13.100 --> 40:13.580
All right.

40:13.580 --> 40:14.380
There you go.

40:14.380 --> 40:16.300
Let's give the updated version a try.

40:16.300 --> 40:17.100
Cheers, Wes.

40:17.100 --> 40:19.540
Cheers.

40:19.540 --> 40:22.340
And they had such a nice system, because what?

40:22.340 --> 40:24.020
It was like a carbonation stone they use?

40:24.020 --> 40:26.180
Yeah, they had a way to just force carbonate it.

40:26.180 --> 40:28.380
So you could dial it up as you want, right?

40:28.380 --> 40:30.140
Like, oh, you need a little more carbonation?

40:30.140 --> 40:30.780
Add a little bit more.

40:30.780 --> 40:32.700
They just run it right back through the system.

40:32.700 --> 40:34.940
And in, I don't know, five minutes, we could test it

40:34.940 --> 40:35.540
again.

40:35.540 --> 40:36.100
Yeah.

40:36.100 --> 40:36.620
And we did.

40:36.620 --> 40:38.220
Once we had it dialed in, first thing

40:38.220 --> 40:39.980
was to get the kegs filled up.

40:39.980 --> 40:43.180
And then we got to play with their super cool, like, beer

40:43.180 --> 40:44.660
wand to fill our bottles.

40:44.660 --> 40:47.220
So we're about to bottle, and we're benefiting from this cool,

40:47.220 --> 40:49.380
like, beer gun that they have.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.220
Yeah, it's hooked up to the CO2.

40:51.220 --> 40:51.940
It's carbonated.

40:51.940 --> 40:53.700
You can purge the oxygen from the bottle

40:53.700 --> 40:57.660
before you put any beer there to protect our precious brew.

40:57.660 --> 40:59.780
But surely one of us is going to make a mistake.

40:59.780 --> 41:00.260
Yep.

41:00.260 --> 41:02.340
Now it's just a matter of putting beer in bottles.

41:02.340 --> 41:04.260
So let's get to work.

41:04.260 --> 41:05.340
And we did.

41:05.340 --> 41:07.140
Nice that we kind of came up with a system.

41:07.140 --> 41:08.660
We traded off, on and off.

41:08.660 --> 41:11.020
You know, you filled it for a little while.

41:11.020 --> 41:12.460
Then I filled it for a little while.

41:12.460 --> 41:14.180
We would trade off from the box.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.380
It worked really well because they have everything plumbed.

41:17.380 --> 41:19.700
And so they had a sink there and towels there.

41:19.700 --> 41:22.340
That, I think, was the biggest experience difference for me.

41:22.340 --> 41:24.420
It's like, it's no longer me having

41:24.420 --> 41:27.300
to make a siphon and spilling beer all over the kitchen.

41:27.300 --> 41:29.340
It was just beer into bottles.

41:29.340 --> 41:30.860
I don't think we spilled at all.

41:30.860 --> 41:31.340
A drop.

41:31.340 --> 41:32.460
No, I was really proud of us.

41:32.460 --> 41:35.780
It saved all of that beer for us to drink later.

41:35.780 --> 41:38.940
And after slowly filling our bottles, which

41:38.940 --> 41:41.140
we had we got these swing top style bottles,

41:41.140 --> 41:43.460
we heard the most rewarding sound.

41:43.460 --> 41:51.020
That right there is the end of our batch.

41:51.020 --> 41:53.180
We nailed it perfectly.

41:53.180 --> 41:56.700
Two kegs, we got 27 bottles, and we ended up

41:56.700 --> 42:00.140
filling 26 because we drank a little bit of it.

42:00.140 --> 42:01.100
More than a little.

42:01.100 --> 42:03.900
Can you believe, though, we nailed it just right?

42:03.900 --> 42:05.940
And we did not plan this at all.

42:05.940 --> 42:06.820
That's pretty great.

42:06.820 --> 42:08.820
I mean, you did the math, but let's be honest,

42:08.820 --> 42:10.180
you're more like Python hacking.

42:10.180 --> 42:12.500
So this is perfect.

42:12.500 --> 42:14.440
We brought exactly what we can carry out,

42:14.440 --> 42:16.060
and it's just the right amount.

42:16.060 --> 42:19.820
Two kegs, 27 bottles later, or I guess 25 bottles.

42:19.820 --> 42:23.260
So we had a margin for safety.

42:23.260 --> 42:25.080
Now what we thought is we need to come up

42:25.080 --> 42:27.140
with a label and stuff for it.

42:27.140 --> 42:31.360
But now we've had a couple of days to try it out,

42:31.360 --> 42:32.020
or let it sit.

42:32.020 --> 42:32.940
It's been sitting in the bottles.

42:32.940 --> 42:34.380
And I think Belgium does kind of,

42:34.380 --> 42:35.380
you know, it benefits from sitting

42:35.380 --> 42:36.580
in the bottles a little bit.

42:36.580 --> 42:38.100
So you want to do your first honors?

42:38.100 --> 42:39.500
Oh, yeah, let's try this.

42:39.500 --> 42:42.620
So here, Wes, here, cheers to 400 more episodes.

42:42.620 --> 42:44.300
And let's give it a try.

42:49.140 --> 42:51.260
That tastes like delicious pride.

42:51.260 --> 42:53.700
I mean, it's legitimately a very delicious beer.

42:53.700 --> 42:56.580
It's something like 8.5% alcohol by volume,

42:56.580 --> 42:59.180
but because of, I think, dialing up the carbonation,

42:59.180 --> 43:00.220
you don't taste it that much.

43:00.220 --> 43:01.860
No, but it's not too carbonated.

43:01.860 --> 43:03.420
It's just easy to drink.

43:03.420 --> 43:05.820
Not too carbonated at all, which was so great about it.

43:05.820 --> 43:07.380
Because I was a little worried we might have overdone it,

43:07.380 --> 43:08.300
but absolutely not.

43:08.300 --> 43:09.780
I've done that in past beers.

43:09.780 --> 43:11.420
So yeah, I was a little worried, too.

43:11.420 --> 43:12.380
And it's not too strong.

43:12.380 --> 43:13.640
It's not crazy malty.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.900
It's just a nice, tasty, balanced beer.

43:15.900 --> 43:17.140
I really, really like it.

43:17.140 --> 43:19.060
Now we each have a keg, so that's great,

43:19.060 --> 43:20.060
because we had two kegs.

43:20.060 --> 43:21.740
And we have some bottles that we're

43:21.740 --> 43:23.900
going to be sending out to friends of the show

43:23.900 --> 43:24.740
and whatnot.

43:24.740 --> 43:26.980
But I want to name this thing.

43:26.980 --> 43:28.740
You know, for our 400th beer, because I

43:28.740 --> 43:30.160
think we're going to do this again.

43:30.160 --> 43:33.220
I thought we'd like to, each batch,

43:33.220 --> 43:35.500
have its own unique name and addition.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.660
So this is the 400th edition.

43:37.660 --> 43:39.420
And the 400th edition needs a name.

43:39.420 --> 43:41.300
So I've just opened up a straw poll.

43:41.300 --> 43:43.980
If you're watching live, it's strawpoll.me

43:43.980 --> 43:47.620
slash 42-89-57-61.

43:47.620 --> 43:52.780
Strawpoll.me slash 42-89-57-61.

43:52.780 --> 43:57.460
Go there and vote on what we should name the LUP 400 beer.

43:57.460 --> 44:00.140
We have a couple of contenders already we've selected for you.

44:00.140 --> 44:04.740
So you only have to pick from what we've already put there.

44:04.740 --> 44:06.820
Number one, and these are kind of randomized, I think,

44:06.820 --> 44:09.340
but on this list, the Unplugged Lugger.

44:09.340 --> 44:10.900
Now it is not a lager.

44:10.900 --> 44:12.420
That's why it's a lager.

44:12.420 --> 44:13.180
Yep.

44:13.180 --> 44:17.020
The Chug-a-Lug, the 400.

44:17.020 --> 44:17.780
Oh, classy.

44:17.780 --> 44:18.500
Yeah, sophisticated.

44:18.500 --> 44:19.620
Or maybe it's a Cadillac.

44:19.620 --> 44:20.260
I don't know.

44:20.260 --> 44:24.820
And then the See Ya Next Tuesday, because of the 8.5%

44:24.820 --> 44:26.120
alcohol by volume.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.860
So if you would, go over there and vote.

44:27.860 --> 44:31.340
And whatever the results are at the end of the recording,

44:31.340 --> 44:33.940
we will officially name our beer and then try

44:33.940 --> 44:35.340
to get some labels printed up.

44:35.340 --> 44:36.500
We need your help.

44:36.500 --> 44:40.140
So right now, the votes are open,

44:40.140 --> 44:43.780
and we will come back and see where things lie.

44:43.780 --> 44:46.500
Wes, this right here, what we're holding in our hand,

44:46.500 --> 44:47.880
you know what this is?

44:47.880 --> 44:51.060
This is a real physical product that we created.

44:51.060 --> 44:51.820
We did it, buddy.

44:51.820 --> 44:53.140
There's a lot of it, too.

44:53.140 --> 44:54.420
Yeah, cheers again.

44:54.420 --> 45:01.280
Yeah, we wanted to get enough that we

45:01.280 --> 45:03.860
could send some to friends and stuff and do fancy bottles.

45:03.860 --> 45:06.300
And then the kegs, of course, which we can refill.

45:06.300 --> 45:09.660
And I could totally see us do this for the next Linux Fest.

45:09.660 --> 45:10.600
Oh, absolutely.

45:10.600 --> 45:12.220
Just a good supply of beer on hand.

45:12.220 --> 45:14.900
So we'd have a Linux Fest Northwest batch

45:14.900 --> 45:18.380
that would be kind of more of a Pacific Northwest early spring

45:18.380 --> 45:19.540
beer.

45:19.540 --> 45:20.360
Yeah.

45:20.360 --> 45:22.560
So I thought what would be great is

45:22.560 --> 45:24.620
if you want to have a virtual beer with us,

45:24.620 --> 45:28.900
we should have something special to celebrate LUP 400.

45:28.900 --> 45:30.220
It's a special occasion.

45:30.220 --> 45:32.180
It's a beer-themed episode.

45:32.180 --> 45:35.940
So go grab a special 400th edition beer stein

45:35.940 --> 45:38.140
at luplug.beer.

45:38.140 --> 45:40.300
Luplug.beer.

45:40.300 --> 45:43.320
Go have a virtual beer with our lug and Wes and I,

45:43.320 --> 45:45.540
and enjoy.

45:45.540 --> 45:48.220
It's just something to celebrate 400.

45:48.220 --> 45:49.780
It's not a challenge coin, not yet.

45:49.780 --> 45:52.780
But it is a nice-looking beer stein.

45:52.780 --> 45:56.420
Yeah, something that can join us all together as we share a glass.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.980
Also, how great is that, luplug.beer?

45:58.980 --> 45:59.700
I mean,.beer.

45:59.700 --> 46:00.980
Can you believe that's a thing?

46:00.980 --> 46:02.700
It's like the one good thing to come out

46:02.700 --> 46:06.860
out of all these nonsense top-level domains.

46:06.860 --> 46:08.260
It is definitely a great one.

46:08.260 --> 46:08.740
Look at that.

46:08.740 --> 46:09.540
Isn't that great?

46:09.540 --> 46:11.780
So when is beer is tasty coming back, huh?

46:11.780 --> 46:12.400
This was it.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.780
This was it in spirit right here.

46:13.780 --> 46:16.380
This was beer is tasty in spirit for sure.

46:16.380 --> 46:18.160
So yeah, we did it.

46:18.160 --> 46:19.820
And it turned out fantastic.

46:19.820 --> 46:21.380
We're very happy with the results.

46:21.380 --> 46:22.460
And I think we're going to keep doing it.

46:22.460 --> 46:26.220
So we've been kind of collecting various used pieces of equipment

46:26.220 --> 46:27.420
to help us do this.

46:27.420 --> 46:29.300
Right, piecing together what we need.

46:29.300 --> 46:32.780
And then we're going to have to try to mix in as much Linux as possible.

46:32.780 --> 46:35.100
Yeah, I mean, Graham gave us some great tips for that.

46:35.100 --> 46:37.820
And then I think, too, like the sensors and some

46:37.820 --> 46:40.020
of the automating of the heat on and off and all of that

46:40.020 --> 46:41.620
can probably be tied into Home Assistant.

46:41.620 --> 46:42.300
Right.

46:42.300 --> 46:44.460
So there'll be some fun Home Assistant action there, too.

46:44.460 --> 46:45.300
Absolutely.

46:45.300 --> 46:46.840
There's all kinds of things we can do.

46:46.840 --> 46:49.180
And we probably will continue to play around with it.

46:49.180 --> 46:51.340
I also want to thank our members.

46:51.340 --> 46:53.260
Those of you who are part of our Unplugged Core,

46:53.260 --> 46:55.780
you make this possible as well.

46:55.780 --> 46:58.540
Thank you very much to our members at episode 400.

46:58.540 --> 47:01.540
I'm going to have something special for you in the near term future.

47:01.540 --> 47:05.100
So if you're not a member yet, you could always go to unpluggedcore.com

47:05.100 --> 47:08.500
and become one, because there's going to be some special benefits for our members

47:08.500 --> 47:09.740
in the near future.

47:09.740 --> 47:13.240
And we appreciate all of you out there for joining us.

47:13.240 --> 47:14.060
Wow, look at that.

47:14.060 --> 47:17.900
41 people in the Unplugged is incredible.

47:17.900 --> 47:22.140
Unplugged, you guys, thank you so much for showing up and being part of this.

47:22.140 --> 47:25.340
When we started this 400 episodes ago, it seemed a little crazy

47:25.340 --> 47:27.820
to just open up our virtual lug and let anybody chat.

47:27.820 --> 47:32.040
And then over time, a community developed to help moderate it and do mic checks.

47:32.040 --> 47:35.300
And then now, even we have the weekly Unplugged meeting

47:35.300 --> 47:36.380
that happens every Sunday.

47:36.380 --> 47:39.020
I mean, it's taken over.

47:39.020 --> 47:41.660
It's the show that isn't the show, and it happens every Sunday

47:41.660 --> 47:43.900
at noon Pacific in our Mumble Room.

47:43.900 --> 47:45.700
You can find it on our calendar, though, to get it converted

47:45.700 --> 47:48.980
in your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

47:48.980 --> 47:54.020
And the info for our Mumble Room is at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble.

47:54.020 --> 47:55.860
Mr. Payne, I think that's 400 right there.

47:55.860 --> 47:56.380
We did it.

47:56.380 --> 47:57.540
Can you believe it?

47:57.540 --> 48:00.460
Dang it, I think that means we have to start planning episode 500.

48:00.460 --> 48:02.300
Well, here we go.

48:02.300 --> 48:05.660
Here's the episode of 500, and here's maybe even 400 more.

48:05.660 --> 48:09.220
Thank you, everyone, who's been listening for even more than a couple of episodes.

48:09.220 --> 48:13.260
I don't know how you put up with us, but man, are we more grateful than ever for it.

48:13.260 --> 48:14.340
Thank you for listening.

48:14.340 --> 48:18.180
It really is humbling, but the community is the best part of the show.

48:18.180 --> 48:18.900
For reals.

48:18.900 --> 48:21.300
All right, everyone, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

48:21.300 --> 48:26.860
of the Unplugged program, and we will see you next Tuesday.

48:26.860 --> 48:29.300
Al Roker, see you next Tuesday.

48:29.300 --> 48:31.620
Bart Kopper, see you next Tuesday.

48:31.620 --> 48:33.460
Ben, see you next Tuesday.

48:33.460 --> 48:36.100
I'm Bennett Mears, and I'll see you next Tuesday.

48:36.100 --> 48:37.740
I'm Brent, see you next Tuesday.

48:37.740 --> 48:39.660
I'm Mike Bitten, see you next Tuesday.

48:39.660 --> 48:41.580
This is Carl, see you all next Tuesday.

48:41.580 --> 48:43.580
Hey, it's Casey, see you next Tuesday.

48:43.580 --> 48:45.300
Computer kids, see you next Tuesday.

48:45.300 --> 48:47.580
This is Neil, see you next Tuesday.

48:47.580 --> 48:50.020
This is Ben Two Hands, see you next Tuesday.

48:50.020 --> 48:52.980
My name's G severo, and I will see you next Tuesday.

48:52.980 --> 48:55.540
This is Ironic Badger, see you next Tuesday.

48:55.540 --> 48:58.140
I'm Jero and see you next Tuesday.

48:58.140 --> 49:00.780
I'm Limbo, and I'll see you next Tuesday.

49:00.780 --> 49:02.940
Hey Minimac here, see you next Tuesday.

49:02.940 --> 49:07.140
I'm Cheese Bacon, and I will see you next Tuesday.

49:07.140 --> 49:09.580
I'm Parker G, see you next Tuesday.

49:09.580 --> 49:12.380
I'm PhoenixLandPyro, see you next Tuesday.

49:12.380 --> 49:15.180
I'm PyGresh, and I will see you next Tuesday.

49:15.180 --> 49:17.820
I'm Eric Nance, and we'll see you next Tuesday.

49:17.820 --> 49:20.540
I'm Simon, and I'll see you next Tuesday.

49:20.540 --> 49:22.940
I'm not Orange, but I will be here on Tuesday.

49:22.940 --> 49:25.940
I'm Thor, and I will see you next Tuesday.

49:25.940 --> 49:28.700
I'm Three Boots, and I'll see you next Tuesday.

49:28.700 --> 49:32.500
And I'm Bert Nuda, and I'll see you next Tuesday.

49:32.500 --> 49:34.220
Thank you, everyone, thank you.

49:34.220 --> 49:38.020
Let's go to JB Titles and let's name our 400th episode.

49:38.020 --> 49:40.180
I thought before we wrapped up officially, though,

49:40.180 --> 49:42.300
at the end of the show, I wanted to kind of capture

49:42.300 --> 49:45.640
what we'd love to see by episode 500.

49:45.640 --> 49:48.860
We'll create a 400 time capsule right here.

49:48.860 --> 49:52.140
So Mumble Room, go ahead and tag me in the chat room

49:52.140 --> 49:54.560
if you have anything to add to our time capsule,

49:54.560 --> 49:56.620
starting with category number one,

49:56.620 --> 49:58.660
our aspirations for Linux.

49:58.660 --> 50:00.080
Now, it's off the top of your head,

50:00.080 --> 50:03.220
but our aspirations for Linux by episode 500.

50:03.220 --> 50:06.000
While you think, because I know I'm just throwing this at you,

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
I'll say a richer, thicker, more vital

50:11.460 --> 50:13.860
third-party desktop app ecosystem.

50:13.860 --> 50:15.780
Well, it's a nice thing to hope for.

50:15.780 --> 50:16.620
What do you got?

50:16.620 --> 50:17.560
You got anything?

50:17.560 --> 50:19.060
Maybe hardware or something?

50:19.060 --> 50:22.440
I would hope that Linux has continued to develop

50:22.440 --> 50:25.220
on mobile devices independent of Android,

50:25.220 --> 50:27.060
that whatever happens with Fuchsia,

50:27.060 --> 50:28.420
there's still Linux on phones,

50:28.420 --> 50:31.140
and that whatever we've got sort of nascent now,

50:31.140 --> 50:33.140
it's just a lot better by episode 500.

50:33.140 --> 50:35.900
Maybe, maybe I've got one in my pocket.

50:35.900 --> 50:36.980
Casey, you have one?

50:36.980 --> 50:39.220
Yeah, I think that we should be striving

50:39.220 --> 50:40.820
to completely deprecate X11.

50:40.820 --> 50:41.820
Ooh, yeah.

50:41.820 --> 50:43.740
That is definitely one.

50:43.740 --> 50:44.780
I was gonna mention it,

50:44.780 --> 50:47.980
but I'm thinking 500 weeks from now, we better.

50:47.980 --> 50:49.260
We really better.

50:49.260 --> 50:50.140
One would hope.

50:50.140 --> 50:52.840
Barker says better gaming, I agree.

50:52.840 --> 50:55.120
Number two, number two for the time capsule.

50:55.120 --> 50:57.440
Wes Payne, I'm gonna go with you first on this one.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.020
Where is Flutter?

50:59.020 --> 51:00.860
It's everywhere, it's everything.

51:00.860 --> 51:02.840
I mean, we're gonna be doing the show

51:02.840 --> 51:05.020
in an entirely Flutter-based environment.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.580
Okay, I'll go the other way and say

51:07.580 --> 51:09.700
that it really hasn't gone anywhere, I guess,

51:09.700 --> 51:11.580
because that's the only other angle I can play on that.

51:11.580 --> 51:13.580
Okay, but it's canonical, still using it.

51:14.580 --> 51:17.260
I mean, how long is five, give me an idea.

51:17.260 --> 51:21.400
500 weeks, that feels like a whole nother 50 years

51:21.400 --> 51:23.500
of internet time, to be honest with you.

51:23.500 --> 51:26.740
So I gotta say, no.

51:26.740 --> 51:27.980
I mean, that's 10 years.

51:27.980 --> 51:31.380
Yeah, I'm gonna say if they are, they're winding it down.

51:31.380 --> 51:32.780
That's what I'm gonna say.

51:32.780 --> 51:34.580
That's what I think.

51:34.580 --> 51:36.700
We'll see, though, we will see.

51:36.700 --> 51:37.940
What do you think, our podcast?

51:37.940 --> 51:39.580
What would you put in the time capsule?

51:39.580 --> 51:43.020
So I'm hoping that by the time we get further along

51:43.020 --> 51:45.820
that we have great tools for media production already,

51:45.820 --> 51:48.500
obviously OBS and all the podcasting tools

51:48.500 --> 51:51.300
and PipeWire coming on, but just making it easier

51:51.300 --> 51:53.760
for new users to get on board more quickly

51:53.760 --> 51:56.240
and making Linux a first-class citizen

51:56.240 --> 51:58.420
for streaming and media production.

51:58.420 --> 52:00.660
Hear, hear, what can we develop on PipeWire now

52:00.660 --> 52:03.640
that if PipeWire really does unify things, right?

52:03.640 --> 52:05.340
I want easier audio routing.

52:05.340 --> 52:06.820
Yeah, I mean, you're starting to see it, right?

52:06.820 --> 52:08.660
Carla is annoying.

52:08.660 --> 52:10.340
Well, you don't need Carla.

52:10.340 --> 52:11.860
You don't need P-A-C-T-L.

52:11.860 --> 52:14.740
You don't need QJack Cuddle or any of those things

52:14.740 --> 52:17.740
because you now have this unified interface

52:17.740 --> 52:19.480
in the form of PipeWire.

52:19.480 --> 52:22.540
The standard stuff that desktops have now have

52:22.540 --> 52:25.160
the opportunity to integrate those workflows.

52:25.160 --> 52:29.100
Neil, let's say you, by episode 500,

52:29.100 --> 52:31.660
will Proton be merged with Wine

52:31.660 --> 52:34.180
or will they still be kind of these two separate projects?

52:34.180 --> 52:36.820
There will not be a Proton project in 10 years

52:36.820 --> 52:39.540
because everything will be integrated into Wine.

52:39.540 --> 52:42.500
It may even, like, if I'm being super hopeful,

52:42.500 --> 52:44.220
we will need it a lot less.

52:44.220 --> 52:45.300
Yeah.

52:45.300 --> 52:47.780
Pycrash, you want machines loaded with Linux.

52:47.780 --> 52:50.140
Yes, I want to buy my next machine

52:50.140 --> 52:53.600
and to be loaded with Linux from the factory.

52:54.460 --> 52:55.620
Yeah, I know a place.

52:55.620 --> 52:56.440
You're here.

52:56.440 --> 52:59.520
I know a few.

52:59.520 --> 53:02.520
Smooth cheese.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.760
Smooth as Velveeta.

53:04.760 --> 53:06.280
Okay, what do you guys think, Mumble Room?

53:06.280 --> 53:07.720
You can kind of just jump in on this one.

53:07.720 --> 53:10.360
Will JB have switched to Matrix

53:10.360 --> 53:14.000
as their primary chat platform by episode 500?

53:14.000 --> 53:14.840
Yeah.

53:14.840 --> 53:15.680
Yes.

53:15.680 --> 53:16.500
Yes.

53:16.500 --> 53:17.340
I hope so.

53:17.340 --> 53:18.660
I just need JBot and it's done.

53:18.660 --> 53:19.920
We're an IRC bridge, of course.

53:19.920 --> 53:22.040
Everyone just says yes at the same time.

53:22.040 --> 53:23.200
Yeah, IRC bridge.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.480
We need a JBot rewrite.

53:24.480 --> 53:26.480
These are the things that I think are holding us up.

53:26.480 --> 53:29.880
I mean, we could probably bridge JBot to Matrix

53:29.880 --> 53:33.360
using IRC and just keep the IRC around as legacy.

53:33.360 --> 53:34.200
Yeah.

53:34.200 --> 53:35.040
Yeah, the IRC bridge is fine.

53:35.040 --> 53:37.040
It's just the thing is you'll have to get GeekShed

53:37.040 --> 53:37.880
to agree to it.

53:37.880 --> 53:40.180
Or move to FreeNode or something.

53:40.180 --> 53:42.500
So what do you think the desktop pain points

53:42.500 --> 53:44.240
are gonna be by episode 500?

53:44.240 --> 53:45.600
So this is a while out.

53:45.600 --> 53:48.120
What's still gonna be something that is a pain in the butt

53:48.120 --> 53:49.320
to get working on Linux?

53:49.320 --> 53:51.200
Okay, so there's some confusion going on here,

53:51.200 --> 53:52.040
at least in the chat room.

53:52.040 --> 53:52.860
Okay.

53:52.860 --> 53:54.280
Are we talking about in 500 episodes?

53:54.280 --> 53:55.120
No.

53:55.120 --> 53:55.940
Or are we talking about at?

53:55.940 --> 53:57.760
500. Okay, so that's only two years away.

53:57.760 --> 53:59.200
Okay, oh yeah, right, right.

53:59.200 --> 54:00.040
You're right.

54:00.040 --> 54:00.880
Yeah, that's only two years.

54:00.880 --> 54:02.240
You've been saying 500 weeks,

54:02.240 --> 54:03.080
and I'm like, that's 10 years from now.

54:03.080 --> 54:03.920
Well, you did that.

54:03.920 --> 54:04.740
You gave me that.

54:04.740 --> 54:05.580
I was so confused.

54:05.580 --> 54:06.420
Dang it.

54:06.420 --> 54:08.520
You said 500 weeks, and I'm like, that's 10 years.

54:08.520 --> 54:09.360
Yeah, you're right.

54:09.360 --> 54:11.760
Well, yeah, in total, it'll be 10 year run for the show

54:11.760 --> 54:13.080
at our 10 year run.

54:13.080 --> 54:14.280
So two years from now.

54:15.480 --> 54:17.560
Desktop Linux, main pain points.

54:17.560 --> 54:19.120
Adobe products on Linux.

54:19.120 --> 54:20.640
Yeah, Adobe products on Linux

54:20.640 --> 54:22.080
is gonna be the big pain point.

54:22.080 --> 54:24.520
I think it's gonna be more likely

54:24.520 --> 54:26.040
that Office comes to Linux

54:26.040 --> 54:27.880
rather than Adobe coming to Linux.

54:27.880 --> 54:31.680
By episode 500, I think there's gonna be Outlook for Linux.

54:31.680 --> 54:32.520
That's what I think.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.240
I think in two years, we'll have Outlook for Linux.

54:34.240 --> 54:35.560
They're just gonna rebase everything

54:35.560 --> 54:37.080
on like an Electron type thing.

54:37.080 --> 54:38.200
Yeah, it's gonna be Electron.

54:38.200 --> 54:39.640
It's already gonna move to Electron

54:39.640 --> 54:41.280
irrespective of anything else.

54:41.280 --> 54:43.280
So then they'll bring it to Linux too.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.920
That's exactly the fear I have.

54:44.920 --> 54:46.580
There'll be more and more Electron apps

54:46.580 --> 54:49.920
that will be really CPU hungry and resource hungry,

54:49.920 --> 54:53.160
so if you, it's flattened out, then we'll see.

54:53.160 --> 54:56.800
I think Flutter will only be on Android.

54:56.800 --> 55:01.360
I just want Python GTK for documentation

55:01.360 --> 55:04.200
because I can already see how much better it is.

55:04.200 --> 55:05.720
There's just no docs for it.

55:05.720 --> 55:06.560
Right.

55:06.560 --> 55:07.380
Cute though.

55:07.380 --> 55:08.220
Look at that.

55:08.220 --> 55:10.040
I'm like figuring it out on my own

55:10.040 --> 55:11.360
and I can't really get anywhere.

55:11.360 --> 55:12.960
I think it's fun to think about these things

55:12.960 --> 55:15.360
in a two year time span and then a 10 year time span.

55:15.360 --> 55:17.340
Like if you took, so that's also like,

55:17.340 --> 55:19.300
what if you doubled the run of the show?

55:19.300 --> 55:22.520
Then we're like, we can do a whole episode on this,

55:22.520 --> 55:24.960
but we have a couple of good, we have our aspirations,

55:24.960 --> 55:28.480
a guess where Flutter is, Proton gets merged into Wine,

55:28.480 --> 55:29.840
JB is switched to Matrix,

55:29.840 --> 55:31.520
which I think we could do in two years,

55:31.520 --> 55:33.840
desktop pain points still include Adobe products

55:33.840 --> 55:35.240
and multi-monitor.

55:35.240 --> 55:37.800
Last but not least, is the LUP LUG

55:37.800 --> 55:40.440
still self-organizing in two years?

55:40.440 --> 55:41.320
Oh, it will.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.160
And we've been still using Mumble.

55:43.160 --> 55:45.440
The Mumble developer should somehow, some way,

55:45.440 --> 55:47.520
be capitalizing all this clubhouse nonsense

55:47.520 --> 55:49.800
because it totally validates Mumble.

55:49.800 --> 55:52.000
And Mumble's a better way of doing it too.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.520
We just need like a web interface

55:53.520 --> 55:55.320
to drop into a Mumble room.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.380
There is a Mumble web interface.

55:57.380 --> 55:59.160
It's beta, but it is a thing.

55:59.160 --> 56:01.240
You need a nice trendy iPhone app too, right?

56:01.240 --> 56:03.360
And that Mumble doesn't have the same apps.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.800
Ideally, some VC money, I think, right?

56:05.800 --> 56:08.060
Yeah, and some of that VC cash.

56:08.060 --> 56:09.760
All right, thank you Mumble room.

56:09.760 --> 56:10.920
You're the best virtual lug.

56:10.920 --> 56:12.680
Thanks for joining us for episode 400.

56:12.680 --> 56:22.480
Wouldn't be 400 without you.
