00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 5, for September 10th, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,080
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, Episode 5. This is the show, probably the only show, airing

3
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,840
on a Tuesday that won't be talking about the new internet phone 5S, because we're Linux

4
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,080
users. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey there, Matt. Welcome back, man. Episode

5
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,440
number 5. We've crossed the month mark. And we've got an interesting show coming up because

6
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,680
we're going to try something new. Later on in the show, we're going to do a recap of

7
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,120
DS9. Just because I've been re-embracing DS9, I thought this would be a good spot since

8
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,000
we have a no-format show to just talk about it. And I grabbed some Clippy Clips. So we'll

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,240
be talking about that later on. But up first, we've got some follow-up to last week's show.

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,160
And also today, Linus was causing a ruckus on the internet. We're going to talk about

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,280
that. And then maybe we'll kind of tuck and roll into a little chat about the NSA. It's

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,160
been, these NSA topics have been blowing up on our subreddit and the Linux subreddit and

13
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,080
on discussion forums. I think it's really particularly affecting Linux users because

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,120
we're a little more savvy. And then one of our favorite companies, GOG, or Good Old Games,

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,480
made a proclamation about their future Linux support. And it's not very good. So we'll

16
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,520
talk about that. Not too much. No, no. Not too happy about that. But Matt, I thought

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,280
maybe just, kind of just going to spring this one on you, okay? Okay. You and I have been

18
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,880
debating. We're doing a Friday Linux action show this week. We're going to, because we're

19
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,420
going to give you a little time off for the up-and-coming birthday. And I'm going to enjoy

20
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,280
myself a Sunday off. So it's kind of, you know, just nice to just change it up from

21
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,440
time to time. And we've been kind of debating like, well, what should we do as a topic?

22
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,000
Because really Friday and Saturday are kind of the days that are used to put an episode

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,080
of Linux action show together. Because there's a lot of work that goes into it. And so yeah,

24
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,080
we're trying to find something that's going to basically be of interest, but at the same

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,760
time, not create a problem. Right. Yeah. Cause there's other shows that have to be in production.

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,420
So there's not like, there's a ton of time. And so we come up with two topics, this possible

27
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:26,160
topics this week. And I like them both a lot. And obviously I'm particular to one, but I

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,960
got to, I got to acknowledge maybe the rest of the audience wouldn't. So I thought maybe

29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,480
what we could do is put it to a straw poll. Like we put it to the audience right now listening

30
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,760
live on the show and they vote on what the topic is on Friday, on the Friday edition

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,040
of the Linux action show. What do you think? Are you down for that? I like that. I think

32
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,520
that's a great democratic way to do it. All right. So not only can people bang suggest

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,420
to help vote for a title in this week's episode, but now you're going to pick the big shows

34
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,240
topic on Friday. I just put the straw poll in the show notes. Okay. Here are your topics.

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,960
So you're ready to chat room. Your choices are on a Friday edition of the Linux action

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,720
show. Should it be Trek meets Linux or taking great notes on Linux? So we have two topic

37
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,320
ideas with that. Star Trek one is sort of like Star Trek meets Linux. Here's a bunch

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,040
of great Star Trek themes, Star Trek apps, Star Trek oriented things around Linux sort

39
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,920
of in just having fun with the fact that unplugged just kind of started the Star Trek segment.

40
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,720
So in the big show we do a bunch of Star Trek related stuff in Linux, tons of fun there

41
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,800
or should we focus in on taking great notes on Linux? There's a couple of different options

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,000
out there. Some, some really, really good open source projects that are trying to tackle

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,960
this and there, you know, to be fair, there's a lot of closed source competition like Evernote

44
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,160
and uh, and you know, even things like Google drive can be kind of used for notes. So this

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,200
is one of those things where, um, I think with school kind of starting back up, that

46
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,960
could also be a popular topic. And also for people who are using Linux in the professional

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,320
space or for people who just want to get a little more organized. Um, so kind of, you

48
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,300
know, not that we wouldn't necessarily do one or the other down the road, but this Friday,

49
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,040
just this Friday, you guys get to pick in the chat room and then we'll check back on

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,560
this as we go right now, we've got only 12 votes, so we're going to let it, we'll let

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,480
it flesh out for a while and then we'll check back in towards the end of the show. Although

52
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,160
I got to tell you that sometimes early votes are an indicator. Yeah. Yeah. The warp speed

53
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,240
heads pulling ahead right now is 69%. I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't, uh, if it doesn't

54
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,720
really, if the overall percentages don't change much. It could. Yeah. It's really going to

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,640
be interesting to see where that plays out and I could be totally wrong and it could

56
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,840
go the other way. If you're listening to the audio feed or something like that and you're

57
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,240
not in the chat room, go to straw poll dot me and it's 42 1477 and then you can vote.

58
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,240
And a part of the notes thing too, it's kind of in that getting off the other cloud services.

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,160
So that might not, that could always be a topic we touch on in the future in the future.

60
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,840
All right, Matt. Well, uh, this week, uh, I thought we'd kind of start with a Linus sort

61
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,960
of lighting up the internet again, like he often does. He's got a sort of a way of word

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,240
with words. You might say he's like a digital fart with a lighter. Sometimes he just lets

63
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,240
one go and he just ignites it and it just happens. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm not

64
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,320
sure which part is the fart and which part is the lighter, but I think you might've gotten

65
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,560
it. And some people just like the fart and lighter joke. Some people love a good fart

66
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,120
and lighter joke. I personally do. I think I can watch that several times a day on YouTube.

67
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,160
But, uh, before we get to that, and this is even better, this also is lighting the world

68
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,540
on fire because friends, Ting is mobile that makes sense. Ting is my mobile service provider

69
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,360
and Matt's are both rocking some pretty nice Android devices on Ting. And one of the great

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,600
things about Ting is you only actually end up paying for what you use. And this is pretty

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,240
powerful because often a lot of us geeks have multiple devices. Well, guess what? Unlimited

72
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,840
devices on your account with a, with all with a pooled plan. So if you've got a family plan,

73
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,480
a business plan, if you need to test multiple devices, if you're a developer or a support

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,320
specialist, you need to have several types of devices. I used to have three Blackberries

75
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,360
back when Blackberries rang during the reign of Blackberry. I still have a Blackberry.

76
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,360
I still have my AT&T Blackberry. Now, thankfully back then, uh, I was an employee, so my work

77
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,040
paid for it. Uh, but they were, they were, they were probably, um, they would have been

78
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,280
a perfect company to take advantage of this plan for a small business that Ting has is

79
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,600
first of all, they just break out your minutes, your text message and your megabytes and they

80
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,160
bill you at the end of the month, whatever bucket you fall into. Okay. Well, so you know,

81
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,440
if I don't use a device, I'm six flat dollars for that line. There's no guilt there. That's

82
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,080
less than me buying two apps in the Android marketplace this week. I don't, I mean, I

83
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,480
don't really have a big issue with that and I think it's a really fantastic way. We could

84
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,560
have phones on standby. If you've got somebody going out in the field, you send a phone with

85
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,040
them. If you need to test for the application you're developing on, you know, one of the

86
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,240
things that we do here at Jupiter broadcasting is a ton of video streaming. Well, guess what?

87
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,680
Video streaming behaves extremely differently on different mobile devices. You wouldn't

88
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,240
think so, but it does. HLS support is a little spotty, so it's been, it's been nice from

89
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,480
time to time to have multiple Android devices to test on. If we were going to go onto a

90
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,160
big mobile push, this would be a must do and Ting really makes this possible. And if you

91
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,320
go to linux.ting.com, you're going to save $25 off your first device or $25 off your

92
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,560
first month. If you bring your own device, they've got a spot on their website that tells

93
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,620
you all the different devices you can bring. If you've got a sprint phone, there's a good

94
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,520
chance you can get it ported over and they'll tell you how that works. Now also, this is

95
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,080
really interesting, they'll also sell you some used devices. They've got the LG Optimus

96
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,520
Black for $68, that's not a bad entry Android phone. They've got a Ting personal shopper

97
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,440
that will find you a device that meets your requirements. They've also got the LG Marquee

98
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,720
Refurbished which is a great little like kid's phone for $87. It still plays all the modern

99
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,860
Android games. You know, there's a lot of options they've got, new and used. And of

100
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,960
course new, they've got the new, they've got the LG Optimus Purple which is a great deal

101
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,280
after your discount supplies like $230, contract free with no early termination fee, no ride

102
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,320
along services, nothing you wouldn't expect, just your rate that you pay and any taxes

103
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,240
they legally have to charge. Ting is a really great and very transparent company. You should

104
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,440
check out their blog too. They talk about a lot of the stuff and sort of the thought

105
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,960
behind a lot of what they do. It's pretty cool. So go to linux.ting.com to save $25

106
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,840
off your first device and thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Remember, people

107
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,960
love Ting and I'm pretty sure you're people too. So it's a good fit. That's right. It's

108
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:14,360
a good fit. All right, so Linus. Are you following like the NSA revelations that have come out

109
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,840
regarding potential back doors into crypto standards? Have you caught any of this? It's

110
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,740
kind of one of the more later revelations. Yeah, I've been following some of it. After

111
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,140
a while it just almost becomes depressing. It does, right? But I've been passively following

112
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,200
just so I'm at least. Yeah, and I've been interested too to see this stuff continue

113
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,960
to roll out even though Syria has been dominating the headlines. This NSA stuff is still getting

114
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:40,680
some coverage. Well, so about four days ago with 42 upvotes in our subreddit, this one

115
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,120
hit the subreddit. NSA foils much internet encryption and this one's actually from the

116
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,720
New York Times too which kind of gives it an extra little stamp of credibility because

117
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:57,280
a lot of times the New York Times is almost an authorized leak in some senses. So this

118
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,920
stirred up this big concern about the NSA working with standards bodies to sort of weaken

119
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,960
the standards so that the NSA knew how to actively attack it and then foil that encryption.

120
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,360
So it's sort of a, it's sort of a combination approach where the NSA is getting keys from

121
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,640
some service providers so they just have the SSL key. So that's one way they can decrypt

122
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,920
it. And it's also a combination of weak encryption, improperly implemented encryption and then

123
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,720
encryption where they have influenced the standard in such of how it's performed. Now

124
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,240
there's a device in Linux which will generate random numbers that you can use to seed like

125
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,560
something new like a generation of a new key or something like that, right? And so the

126
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,000
concern that the community came up with was that the standard that influenced how these

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,420
random number generators was affected has been implemented in Linux. And so people were

128
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,720
kind of like banging on Linus' door, Mr. Torvalds, could you please wake up and smell

129
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,520
the coffee, Mr. Torvalds? Please. In fact, and I kind of agree with him, Vermunda in

130
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,920
the subreddit said, it's time to start taking RMS seriously. For decades he's been warning

131
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:09,960
us that this is what will happen if we court proprietary software and services to the detriment

132
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,060
of privacy and freedom to express ourselves in an unfettered fashion, i.e. people buying

133
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:21,480
these fancy smartphones that are essentially listening devices. In fact, in a separate

134
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:28,780
report that ran, some new NSA slides came out about their ability to track smartphones.

135
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,420
And they had three slides up where they were making references to how smartphone users

136
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,800
are zombies, particularly they're making fun of the location bug that was in iOS that was

137
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,760
keeping your location indefinitely. And the NSA was actively exploiting that. They knew

138
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,640
about that and they were using that. And they had on a slide, they had 1984, who knew he

139
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,680
would be big brother. And then a picture of Steve Jobs implying that the implementation

140
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,360
of the iPhone has ushered in big brother. However, I believe that's a bit of a misdirection

141
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,560
because really it's the NSA who's big brother. They're just exploiting that technology to

142
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,320
do it. And they're exploiting Android and they also have an active group that exploits

143
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:13,720
Blackberry. And so all of this has just made everybody explode. Has cryptology been sabotaged?

144
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,360
Well and here's my view of it. There's two real important things to consider. For one

145
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,320
thing, if someone wants in to a home or into a file or into whatever it may be, badly enough,

146
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,800
they're going to get in. I don't care what you're using, how you're doing, it does not

147
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,240
matter and we're seeing that now. At some level, the right people will be influenced,

148
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,600
the right set of circumstances will be laid out and things will be overcome. So that's

149
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,200
the problem I've always had with really getting heavy into the encryption and stuff like that

150
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,920
is that it's great if you want to keep ISPs out of your back door, if you get my drift,

151
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,420
but as far as the government, they're always going to find a way. It's just I don't see

152
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,400
any way around that. I mean it's a novel idea that I would love to think happens, but we're

153
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,760
a nation here in the States that has been very vocal in that, oh please, we're more

154
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,560
than happy to trade our security and give you our freedom. We don't need that freedom.

155
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,080
We want our security. We want ease of use. We want sexy phones. We want a fun experience.

156
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,360
Security, we'll talk big about it, but we won't actually take it seriously. That's

157
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,100
my opinion and that's why RMS has never really been taken seriously by the mainstream because

158
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,400
it's not a sexy argument. It's not attractive.

159
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,000
Right. They almost just don't really care.

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,340
Yeah. I mean they do passively, but not enough to act on it. It's like you got to stop eating

161
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,800
junk food. Well, I can do that. Wait a minute. You mean I can't have a Big Mac? It's that

162
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,800
kind of mindset of you don't get to do those things that were enjoyable. It's a tough call.

163
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,160
Right. You're right. Yeah. In some ways, it is all these warnings about sugar, about unhealthy

164
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:48,520
lifestyles and yet here I am sitting 10 hours a day minimum, maybe more in my seat and not

165
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:55,560
getting the right exercise and often cheating on a diet because I want to. Yeah, it is sort

166
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,920
of the same. It is hard to have that same... It's almost the same kind of weakness

167
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,680
in a sense.

168
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,200
My solution honestly is a very simple one in that RMS is pretty much a hard line, hard

169
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,120
direction. It's really a tough act to follow and it's tough to follow up on, but I think

170
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,200
we can make personal choices and personal decisions in our life to minimize our participation

171
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,200
in that kind of police state. We're not going to eliminate it. That's not going to happen.

172
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
You can minimize that.

173
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,040
Yeah. I don't think there's any going back really.

174
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,080
No, but you can be aware of who you're voting for. Be aware of what you're participating

175
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,960
in. Really be aware of it.

176
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,300
My new campaign is unplug from the surveillance grid. Go local first. Whenever you can go

177
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,160
local first, go local, unless it's not private. But there are enough people who started banging

178
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,040
on Linus' door and there was a petition for him to remove the RD rand from dev random,

179
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,920
which is where this implementation was that people are concerned about. It gets on Hacker

180
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,100
News and Linus, which I believe this comment's now been deleted by him or by somebody, responded

181
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,340
to this petition with, where do I start a petition to raise the IQ of kernel knowledge

182
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,860
of people? Guys, go read the drivers of charrandom.c. Then learn about cryptography. Finally, come

183
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,960
back here and admit to the world that you were wrong. Short answer, we actually know

184
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,120
what we are doing. You don't. Long answer, we use RD rand and one of many inputs into

185
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,920
the random pool and we use it as a way to improve that random pool. So even if RD rand

186
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,160
were to be backdoored by the NSA, our use of RD rand actually improves the quality of

187
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,320
the random numbers you get from dev slash random. And the really short answer, you're

188
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
ignorant.

189
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
God, I love Linus.

190
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,520
And the great thing is, it's open. It's open code. So of course, shortly after that, people

191
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,680
went and posted what they found right where Linus told them to look. And from the couple

192
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,520
handful that I have read of people's take on it, they're all extremely impressed. They're

193
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,320
like, oh yeah, these guys really knew what they were doing. And what it is, is what Linus'

194
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,240
essential argument is, is even if they have one part of an implementation that has an

195
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:08,760
NSA backdoor, it's one component in a chorus of data points that are used to generate something

196
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,320
random. So it's not really a big deal.

197
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,380
But people are still concerned about it. And I'm curious, I thought maybe we'd go over

198
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,840
to our mumble room where we have a fine group of paranoids and ask anybody in here, you

199
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,520
guys, are you concerned about NSA backdoors and Linux? And now that we know that maybe

200
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,960
it doesn't have to be a code that's been compromised, but it's could just be a standard that a good

201
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,360
programmer is following that's been compromised. What do you think of Linus' response? And

202
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,880
are you concerned? I open it to the room. Floor is yours.

203
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,400
No, nobody has anything.

204
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,560
Well, to be honest, it's kind of hard to keep track of the live stream versus the...

205
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,040
Oh, you guys are on delay.

206
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,080
It is, it is. There's a bit of lag.

207
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,640
You don't hear us in here?

208
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,640
No, you mute yourself. I don't hear anything.

209
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,760
All right. Well, I won't do that again. I'm sorry.

210
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
I hear you now.

211
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,720
Okay. So the question is, are you concerned about NSA backdoors because these standards

212
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,160
have been influenced in Linux? And are you current on what Linus' response to all this

213
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,720
was and what do you think of it? Was he over the top? Was he being too hard? A lot of people

214
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,600
have said that this is redirecting the conversation from the actual concern about the NSA having

215
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,920
a backdoor into a standard and the conversation is now about Linus' behavior.

216
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,800
Typically, Linus has always been very direct, hasn't he? And very open with his comments

217
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,200
that he's made in the past. But like, I have to touch on what Matt said. If anybody needs

218
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,080
to get your information bad enough, they will get it regardless of what your cryptography

219
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:47,200
is or security measures that you're using. So in a way, I kind of agree with Linus as

220
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
well.

221
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,920
Yeah, so do I. I mean, there's a lot of fud going on about this NSA thing as far as I

222
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:00,560
understand it. And Linux users, despite their expertise, are not immune to fud. So that's

223
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,840
the thing. I mean, Linus Torvalds built the kernel literally from scratch. He knows what

224
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,040
he's doing. I think people should trust him more rather than just say that, oh no, he's

225
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,120
sold out to the NSA and he's this and he's that. I think we need to trust the man who

226
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
built this.

227
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,680
Yeah, it is interesting that some people have said that Linus sold out to the NSA. People

228
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,260
even said that Linus stepped in and pushed this NSA standard in when people were pushing

229
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:31,600
against it. So there has been a bit of name calling in this whole thing and accusations.

230
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,600
But I really don't think that Linus would sell out to anybody because he's very protective

231
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:45,360
of the Linux kernel itself. And like Davos said, he built it from the ground up himself,

232
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,840
more or less. And so I really don't think he would sell it out to anybody.

233
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,000
Yeah. Okay, I'm kind of along the same lines. Any thoughts on that? Any more thoughts on

234
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
that one, Matt?

235
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,360
No, I think everybody about covered it. I mean, at the end of the day, unless his family

236
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,320
is being held in a bunker somewhere, I don't see him budging. And if that happens, we will

237
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,000
on that moment send in a SWAT team of Linux ninjas to rescue his family so he can get

238
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
back to the kernel development.

239
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,320
We could assemble it right here on Mumble.

240
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
That's right.

241
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
The rescue operation right here.

242
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
You bet.

243
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,600
Even if we have to wear monkey suits to do it.

244
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Absolutely.

245
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,640
That could be our call sign. That could be our uniform. I like it.

246
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,080
Monkey suit one, monkey suit two.

247
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,720
All right, Mumble Room, thanks for the thoughts. Stand by. We'll have more here in a minute.

248
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,160
So one story I want to touch on that just sort of hurts my heart deeply. It came up,

249
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,600
but I didn't get a chance to talk about it in the Linux Action Show. I think it did come

250
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,420
out before, let's see, it came out on the 7th. And today is the 9th, and last was...

251
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,800
So yeah, it came out on Saturday. So Good Old Games made a public statement about their

252
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,380
plans to support Linux. And Good Old Games is actually a former sponsor of the Linux

253
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,240
Action Show, so that might have influenced some of this a little bit. The fact that they

254
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,040
sponsored a Linux show might have maybe set the wrong expectation. But at the time, the

255
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,080
point we were trying to make was that there's a lot of great DOSBox games that work too.

256
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,920
So people continue to push GOG, and they say, quote unquote, for the foreseeable future,

257
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,400
they don't plan to support Linux due to fragmentation. Here's the quote. And this is the head of

258
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,560
PR speaking from Good Old Games. He says, for every game we release, we provide a money

259
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,200
back guarantee. If we can't get the game working on the customer's computer with the

260
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,520
help of our support team, we return the money. He goes on to say, the architecture of Linux

261
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,040
with many common distros, each of them updating fairly often, makes this incredibly challenging

262
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,400
for any digital distribution company to be able to properly test the game in question,

263
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,600
and then provide support for the release, all of which our users are accustomed to.

264
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,920
So no plans for the foreseeable future, because there's no way the economics of Linux support

265
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,040
makes sense for us. Good Old Games is investigating how to do it in a variety of issues beyond

266
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,240
Linux support, so don't give up hope, but just don't expect it tomorrow either.

267
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,040
So here's my interpretation of it, like comparing them to, and this is a bad comparison, but

268
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,120
it gives you an idea, comparing them to Steam, for example. Steam basically is a catch-all

269
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,720
working with, if I'm understanding correctly, a multitude of different developers each developing

270
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,120
their own games. GOG, if I'm understanding correctly, basically is not only the distributor,

271
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,920
but is also porting these games so that they will run on the operating systems that they

272
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,800
support. So basically, they're in charge of supporting multiple titles, where Steam

273
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,120
is not. Steam is basically the distribution arm. That's really all they're...

274
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Okay. I mean, fair point. You're right. Good Old Games has a lot more hands-on gaming.

275
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,060
They're not really porting so much. They're generally packaging it up maybe into an emulated

276
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,600
environment and making it so it's just like a double-click experience, when in the past

277
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,680
it was like load multiple CD-ROMs. Yeah, but you're right. They're more hands-on than Steam

278
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
is in some ways.

279
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,620
Absolutely. Yeah. So Steam's got off easy in the fact that the really deep development

280
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,880
is the developer's problem, from what I'm understanding. And so for GOG, I can see it

281
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,720
from their perspective of that, they're a completely different business model. I mean,

282
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,460
there's no way that they can possibly go to that level. Now, backtracking a little bit,

283
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,800
I do think that if they felt it was worth it, they could absolutely choose to support

284
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,460
Ubuntu or OpenSUSE or whatever.

285
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,660
Why not Ubuntu and these dozen games? Does it have to be... Because honestly, there's

286
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,200
probably about 30 games I want to buy from GOG.

287
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,660
And see, I think that they would need... If I was GOG, I'd say, look, we're not ready

288
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,440
to make that financial investment, but at the same time, we don't want to drop the ball

289
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,780
on you guys completely. We're willing to put in the man-hours to do maybe a Kickstarter

290
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,440
campaign or something like that, something to kick some cash around.

291
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,220
I think what your argument is, is quite reasonable. The problem is, when I read that, and I think

292
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,740
a lot of people, just based on the reactions I've been seeing online is, when I read that,

293
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,540
it honestly sounds ignorant of the market realities. Because I think... Now, I guess

294
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,780
you can't quite say Steam has proven anything just yet, but what you...

295
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,740
Because it really hasn't. I mean, it's been awesome at the beginning, but the stats are

296
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,660
so messy that they're really hard to interpret. And when you're the numbers guy, the CEO can

297
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,980
be amped all to hell, and he goes to the CFO, and the CFO is going, yeah, are you nuts?

298
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,980
It's not going to happen.

299
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,020
It just seems like to me, a lot of these developers, like we played the clip in last week where

300
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,220
they said they want to move away from DirectX because they need to move away from Windows.

301
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,540
We see Steam and Valve actively trying to push an alternative viable marketplace on

302
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,140
Linux because they're concerned about Windows. Shouldn't good old game be kind of sitting

303
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,180
in their seat right now going, gosh, we're making old DOS games, and we're making some

304
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,800
of these old Windows 95, 98, and now beyond that, too. They also do new games now, too.

305
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,380
But we're making a lot of these games to work on Windows, and that is moving fastly away

306
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,660
from their target market.

307
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,060
I think the problem is that they look at their existing numbers, and they're probably pretty

308
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:58,280
comfortable with it, and they basically say, look, Steam is very much a bleeding edge company.

309
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,420
They're really going for the bleeding edge. They're looking five years down the road.

310
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,700
GOG is probably looking at next month and saying, eh, you know, when it's a problem,

311
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,540
we'll address it, but why do this when we can let other folks pave the way? If it starts

312
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,900
looking like the tide's shifting, we'll jump on board at that point.

313
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,500
I can't necessarily – if I was a non-Linux user, I would totally agree with them. As

314
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,540
a Linux user, I think it sucks, but as a non-Linux user financially, I get it for their business

315
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:30,940
model because they're not like other development companies. They are very much – they have

316
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,500
something they're comfortable with, and they see no reason to change that.

317
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
And they're a smaller shop.

318
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,300
They're a smaller shop, yeah, and they're just a totally different model.

319
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,340
I would love to see like – you know, if they ever listen to this, if they ever hear

320
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,620
this, here's Chris' advice to you. Pick your top five, ten games, focus them on Ubuntu,

321
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,180
but do it in a way, like Steam has, where the community can step in and make it a flawless

322
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,540
experience on their preferred platforms.

323
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:59,420
I am an Arch Linux user, and I have never had a problem with a Steam game that is actually

324
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,220
in full release. I've had games with very early games, and I understand as an Arch user

325
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,420
that I might run into an issue at some point because the supported platform is Ubuntu,

326
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,940
but I'm making that choice, and I'm still willing to throw my money at Valve even if

327
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,660
I have some issues.

328
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,040
So – and then I guess the other upshot to this is a lot of the GOG games work fine under

329
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
VirtualBox.

330
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,980
See, that's – and this is what I'm talking about. So when they're pitching this to their

331
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,540
financial guy, the financial guy is going, but you can do it this way already, right?

332
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,380
Yeah. Why are we having this conversation? It becomes a numbers pitch, and so the idealism

333
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,780
goes right out the window, and it sucks, and I wish it didn't, but financially, that's

334
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,580
probably where they're at. They're a small shop, and they're going, this financially

335
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,900
doesn't make a lick of sense to them.

336
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,580
All right. I could have predicted this outcome. You guys got to get in there and shake this

337
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,620
out. The straw poll is split down the middle. Our audience is split on every single thing

338
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,620
we ever do.

339
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,620
Oh my gosh.

340
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,260
It is always split down the middle on every topic, and here it is in living proof right

341
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:58,020
here. 21 votes for – no, it's 20 votes for Star Trek.

342
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Uh-huh.

343
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,820
Forty-nine – it's like – people got to go in there and vote.

344
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,460
Just case scenario, if for some reason we find ourselves in a position to where it is

345
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,580
literally a split tie, you and I each cast a vote.

346
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:15,180
That's true. Yeah, that's true. Well, I think the chat room can help us here. Go to

347
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:21,700
strawpoll.me, 42-14-77. Get it done, people. Get it done. It is in your hands.

348
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Yes.

349
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,780
All right. Well, I want to spend a little time on email, because that's one of the

350
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,460
main things that the show is kind of –

351
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,180
Oh, yeah. That's what we're going to do for the show, right?

352
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,740
There's been so many interesting things to dig into that we've been spoiled, really.

353
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,780
However, this week, I set aside a bunch of emails ahead of time to make sure we got some.

354
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,260
So I'm going to start with a couple. Are you ready?

355
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,260
I'm ready.

356
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,740
So the first one comes in from John. He says, hi, Chris and Matt. I caught some of your

357
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,660
conversation today on Linux Unplugged. This is last week's episode. I just want to add

358
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,780
my opinion that I agree Linux users can be cheap, but I think that most people who use

359
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,260
software are cheap to an extent. Most people have a real life and real money concerns,

360
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,420
and they don't want to pay for software if they don't have to. The only difference

361
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,700
between Linux users and everyone else is that on Linux, there's a ton of functionality

362
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,420
that's just given. That functionality is purchased on other platforms. I suspect that

363
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,460
the reason why the Ubuntu App Store doesn't sell software is because people don't really

364
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,420
need it. Same for Steam. Games, by nature, are a luxury. When people have money problems,

365
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
games are not purchased.

366
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,260
Now, for my other related topic. Linux needs more proprietary software. I posted this on

367
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,580
Reddit. It may be a badly written post that I'm sick of not having important programs

368
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:34,420
on Linux. I think talking about professional-grade, commercially-supported software that businesses

369
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:39,780
have confidence in deploying. For me, in my field, engineering, this includes CAD software

370
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,220
and simulation software. I think that it's a real reason why Linux is not taking off

371
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,700
big time. I'm sure there are companies that would be willing to switch to Linux if they

372
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,700
had their employees' workflow not broken. And just from a technical standpoint, I think

373
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,820
that most people will agree that Linux is superior. The problem is the workflows are

374
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:00,140
broken using Linux. He mentions he refers to Jupyter Broadcasting as a dependence on

375
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,060
using a Hackintosh for our video editing. Anyways, I wanted to suggest somewhere within

376
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,740
your domain, we could build a list of programs and brand names that your viewers need available

377
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:15,260
on Linux to have completely working workflow. I was thinking that would be an interesting

378
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,940
Wiki thing on the subreddit.

379
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,460
That'd be fantastic, actually.

380
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:24,260
Good thoughts. I do agree that Linux distributions have a lot of built-in functionality. Over

381
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,660
the years of using Linux, I've purchased a good handful of software. I've definitely

382
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,740
purchased more software for the commercial platforms even though I use them a lot less.

383
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,740
Yeah, and see, for me, I found the opposite to be true. It's definitely made me more cost

384
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,980
conscious. I'll go to other operating systems and look at software that I would have readily

385
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,540
available in Linux and think, oh, wow, do people pay for that? It changed my expectations.

386
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,460
But as far as what he was talking about with AutoCAD and things like that, proprietary

387
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,460
applications at that that are available for their existing workstation and then asking

388
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,780
them to drop that and then go to something that may not be as good on a Linux distro,

389
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:04,100
I can understand where they're coming from. I think with Jupyter Broadcasting specifically,

390
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,620
we use the operating system experience that's best for that particular need. We use a lot

391
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:15,540
of Linux. We do use some OS 10, but we mostly, by and large, are using more and more Linux

392
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,580
than we used to. I think that it doesn't have to be an all or nothing kind of situation.

393
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,900
I think that you can, in fact, have your dedicated setups for what works best for that particular

394
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,920
situation, but if someone's just working in an Office document, there's no reason why

395
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,060
they can't, and we've seen this in other countries, to why they can't look at open

396
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
source alternatives.

397
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:40,660
Yeah, and I'll tell you, especially for Unplugged, as I've moved more production onto all of

398
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,500
these audio-based shows, almost the majority, except for just clipping the ends, is done

399
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:51,300
on Linux now. However, for the video shows, it's still not quite there yet, and I'll tell

400
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,340
you though, as I've moved more of the work process over to the Linux box, it's so nice

401
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,820
where like, okay, one of the things that's really kind of nice is there's so many ubiquitous

402
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,300
ways on Linux to mount a file system, so like, if the easiest way for me to get to one box

403
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,080
is NFS and on the other box where maybe I'm grabbing a source file off the Hackintosh,

404
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,340
you know, maybe I'll do it because Samba sucks on Mac OS X so badly, but you know, on Linux,

405
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,020
no bags, not a problem, not affected, I just do an SFTP mount and boom, I pull the files,

406
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,300
like it's nice to have like, all of this extra versatility that is useful in Linux in general

407
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:27,980
also is great in a production workflow, and I feel like I've made more of a custom workflow

408
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,500
now because of the flexibility that gives me, like, it's kind of happened at around

409
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,720
the same time that I'm implementing that storage system in the studio, so like, I've been able

410
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,420
to integrate NFS at a much deeper level now into the production workflow, and it makes

411
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,260
switching between the different systems so awesome, and BitTorrent Sync is now doing

412
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,260
a lot of the lifting behind the scenes, so if I create an asset on the Hackintosh because

413
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,340
I need motion, you know, there's an example of an application, Motion and After Effects,

414
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,340
there's just literally nothing else to do, Blender is not, Blender is great, but Blender

415
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,360
is not the type of, you know, Blender doesn't create what I need it to create to do our

416
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:10,020
motion intros and things like that, but I can create that motion intro on a Hackintosh,

417
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,200
export it out onto the NFS share, Bob's your uncle, I open up on the Linux box, and now

418
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:19,580
I'm slapping it down and I'm good to go, so it's getting easier to move between them,

419
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,060
but it's definitely, there's certain things that are locked up into different operating

420
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:28,020
systems, but with a common backend file system, and a common name working space for everything

421
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,740
where everything can, you know, knows how to connect to each other, it kind of just,

422
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:38,540
it really feels like, well that's not so much a Mac, that's the motion output machine, right?

423
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,540
Exactly.

424
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,540
It's like this, it's almost like if I'm in a shop, like you've got machines that puts

425
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,460
airs in, you've got machines that puts air in tires, and you've got machines that take

426
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,140
oil out, you know, you've got all these different, that's what it feels like to me, and...

427
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,460
Well it's like a POS system, sometimes they run Linux, sometimes they run other stuff,

428
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,700
you don't care, it's a POS system.

429
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,140
It really is, it really is an appliance, like if I look at it right now, you know, this

430
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:04,900
thing is running OS 10 7.4, it's never once been, nothing on it has, except for some of

431
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,620
the applications, but like none of the operating systems, none of the main production software

432
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,060
has been updated since the moment it went into production, because that is generally

433
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,940
how it works in a business, you get a stable functioning system, and because I don't have

434
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,060
to do security updates on Final Cut, it's not a huge issue, you get a stable workflow

435
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,980
where everything's compatible, and all the scripts work with everything, where everything

436
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,500
goes out, all that kind of stuff, you just, it becomes an appliance in a lot of ways.

437
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Exactly.

438
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,220
So, I move on, but thanks John for the email, Zaytech wrote in, he said, I did not see this

439
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,200
addressed in Linux Unplugged, so I'm just going to send it in to you guys.

440
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,140
As for Linux users that are cheap, I would say, yeah, that's why we picked a free OS,

441
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,140
and love it.

442
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,420
Not much Linux users are able to completely give up Windows either, and that's where the

443
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,660
wallet drains go.

444
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,980
I have, however, been running Linux, and only Linux for four years, and now I've decided

445
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,220
that the money that would have gone to some big corporations will go to small shops and

446
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,200
give them something at a good, they give me something at a good price.

447
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,660
These are one way that Linux users spend money, and that may not be properly accounted for.

448
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:11,020
I donated to several products, and bought a new, oh, the LN Sync, which is a great Google

449
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,300
Drive client, and I'm also addicted to purchasing the humble bundles.

450
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,860
Also, my netbook just died, so I'm going to get a System76 machine soon.

451
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,700
He's got to work out some shipping problems.

452
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,900
Well, they can help you with that.

453
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,100
Love the show, hope to chat with you on Mumble someday.

454
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,500
Well, I wonder if he's on Mumble right now.

455
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
I don't know.

456
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

457
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
That'd be a good time for it, you know.

458
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
We'll see him on there.

459
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
All right.

460
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,380
We'll get to our last email, or actually, it's not our last email, our second to last

461
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,380
or so.

462
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,380
Hi, Matt and Chris.

463
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,740
You were talking about a lot about self-hosted cloud storage, e.g. ownCloud and BitTorrent

464
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,780
Sync, but you never talked about the open source tool C-File, which is at C-File, S-E-A-F-I-L-E.com.

465
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,060
It uses a version control model similar to Git.

466
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,740
While ownCloud sucks at syncing a lot of small files, C-File is rock solid in this area.

467
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,740
Maybe you should have a look at it.

468
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,540
Greetings, Marcel, from Germany.

469
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,540
Interesting.

470
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,460
I haven't checked out C-File yet, but that's like the second or third person who sent in

471
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,860
an email kind of recommending it, so you might have to check into that.

472
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
Yeah.

473
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,580
I would be curious to hear people's experiences with it.

474
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,540
I'm pretty happy though now with my current implementation.

475
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,020
It's going to be hard to break me away from that.

476
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,540
We also, in the subreddit, somebody sent in a service that looks pretty interesting.

477
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,220
I don't know about the security, so I'm not going to say I vouch for it, but the concept

478
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,560
is pretty cool.

479
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,100
It was a BitTorrent Sync remote storage.

480
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,620
It was submitted by Army One, or Army, I guess.

481
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,620
It's incloudably.com.

482
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:44,740
They do a whole bunch of DDOS protection and storage stuff, but one of the products they

483
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,740
are offering now is like, you can go buy it, is a BitTorrent Sync remote hosted.

484
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,340
They are reselling a sync dump location, and you use that as backup.

485
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,940
And now the transfer is AES-256 encrypted, but I don't know what the storage is, where

486
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,940
Spider Oak is pretty explicit about that.

487
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,940
So I don't know.

488
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,940
You can check it out.

489
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,940
We have a link to that in the subreddit.

490
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,940
It's worth checking out.

491
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,300
I mean, like I said, we can't necessarily recommend it, but it's certainly worth investigating

492
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,300
on your own accord.

493
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,820
Now, the big question, Matt, before we get to the poll, actually, maybe we'll save the

494
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,260
poll for the end of the DS9 stuff.

495
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
I don't know.

496
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,260
We'll see.

497
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
I don't know.

498
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,260
We'll see.

499
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
If people want to go do one more vote, you guys get a chance, if anybody wouldn't mind

500
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
pasting that link in the chat room.

501
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,940
Now, the big question of the day, what is Chris going to wear on Monkey Suit Day?

502
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,700
Oh, my goodness.

503
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,860
So this is a great question.

504
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,740
So for those of you that aren't aware, I have a birthday wish list that's been put out there

505
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,620
on Amazon, and one of the items on there was, in fact-

506
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,620
Which is at matthartley.com.

507
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,620
Oh, yeah.

508
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,620
It was at-

509
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,620
That's right, matthartley.com.

510
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,780
There's still plenty of stuff on there.

511
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,540
I'm desperately trying to get the zone alarm stuff put together, or zone minder stuff put

512
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
together.

513
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
Yeah.

514
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,540
That'd be a great segment.

515
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,540
Oh, and I've got an idea for that.

516
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
I'll get to it later.

517
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,100
Now, getting back to the monkey suit, and I don't want to take away from that.

518
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,180
So the monkey suit was on the list, and that was totally more for you guys than it was

519
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,180
for me, because I'm basically just going to sit and sweat in this thing.

520
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,360
But I put it out there, and sure enough, someone did pick that up, and that's awesome.

521
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,200
And what we're trying to figure out now is, I'm going to be wearing this for both Halloween

522
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,220
as well as later on in 2014.

523
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,820
Well, so is that a good idea, though, or should you save it for the big event?

524
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:16,420
Because it's kind of like seeing the bride before the wedding.

525
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,860
I think they've been patient enough.

526
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
I'm willing to do it.

527
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,220
It's going to be fun for Halloween to do.

528
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
Okay.

529
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,220
You're right.

530
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,220
Is the episode on Halloween?

531
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,220
Or is it?

532
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,420
I don't know where it falls, but I think it'd be kind of fun to do.

533
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
Okay.

534
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
All right.

535
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,420
And I did throw that out there.

536
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Well, I should wear a costume if it's on Halloween.

537
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,420
I mean, that's just-

538
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
Well, a few people suggested banana.

539
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
That seemed a little-

540
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,420
Oh, man.

541
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
That seemed a little phallic and strange.

542
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,300
So I decided to maybe sidetrack off that.

543
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,500
Maybe go for another, I don't know, not sure what a good alternative would be.

544
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
So maybe we should put it to a vote.

545
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Oh, okay.

546
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
All right.

547
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Well, we'll have to come up with options.

548
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,340
We'll have to come up with options and see where everybody falls down.

549
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,500
You know, a Tux penguin would be cool.

550
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,700
I wonder if there's a Tux penguin.

551
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,580
If you guys find good costumes on Amazon, link them to us in the... Okay, so we put

552
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:05,060
the feedback thread in the subreddit for this show in the comments in there.

553
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,340
If you guys find it, put it in there.

554
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,780
Or I guess you could submit it to mattmonkeysuit.

555
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,980
So go to reddit.com slash r slash mattmonkeysuit or mattmonkeysuit.reddit.com.

556
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,820
Yeah.

557
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,820
Someone made a subreddit.

558
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,820
Yeah.

559
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,820
So I appeared in there.

560
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,820
It's like, all right.

561
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,820
That's cool.

562
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
Oh, wow.

563
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,620
Well, I like that big clock they got of you up there, too.

564
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
That's awesome.

565
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,620
Okay.

566
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,140
So I think maybe what we'll do is since we're going to get into a bunch of Star Trek stuff-

567
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,140
Yeah.

568
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,140
Oh, I know where you're going with this.

569
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:36,060
I have a few clips I want to play to kind of warm us up.

571
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,060
But I think maybe we should let the Linux... People who don't want to talk about Star

572
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,540
Trek, maybe we'll just say, okay, this is where you can sign out.

573
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,640
So I'll leave you with a couple, if you're going to leave us and not join us for the

574
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,100
awesome DS9 chat that is about to ensue, I want to let you know that you can contact

575
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,820
us by emailing us at linuxactionshow at jupiterbroadcasting.com or popping the contact link at the top of our

576
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:00,880
site or even better, we got that subreddit over at linuxactionshow.reddit.com and we'd

577
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,020
love to have you join us over there.

578
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:10,500
The unplugged show is live at 2 PM Pacific, which is 9 PM UTC over at jblive.tv and jblive.info.

579
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
That's the audio stream.

580
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,980
We've got the mobile versions of that and don't forget to go to linux.ting.com to save

581
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,940
yourself something.

582
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,980
And yes, I think that's probably all the business to cover before we get into the Star Trek

583
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,980
stuff.

584
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,860
But I just wanted to say officially, we are now getting into the Star Trek stuff.

585
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,720
We will unveil the poll at the end of the Star Trek stuff.

586
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,740
So you guys still have a chance to vote on the poll though, so we're not all Star Trek

587
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,740
stuff.

588
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,740
Okay, Matt.

589
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,740
All right.

590
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,620
So last week I said, hey, you know, I've kind of been getting into DS9 and trying to find

591
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,780
where it fits in my Star Trek lineup.

592
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:45,620
I've been questioning my Voyager-ness and my DS9s lately, and after just recently rewatching

593
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:50,300
a lot of TNG because they went on Blu-ray, I felt like it was perhaps the greatest Star

594
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,300
Trek of all time.

595
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:58,860
And then I thought, well, I really can't make that declaration without digging into DS9.

596
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,660
And so I should have waited until the DS9 Blu-rays came out, but I just decided we had

597
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,660
to go into it.

598
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:09,080
Oh, by the way, just a quick mention, NextUIs is working on a Samsung Smart TV app.

599
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
How cool is that?

600
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Whoa!

601
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,040
Yeah, so people have Samsung Smart TVs, which has got to be a lot of people, I would think.

602
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,420
We'll soon be able to watch the Jupiter broadcasting goodness on the Samsung TVs.

603
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,420
So thanks to NextUIs.

604
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
We'll give you guys a heads up when it gets that.

605
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,900
Okay, so we decided to pick Emissary.

606
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,740
That's DS9 season one, episode one.

607
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,340
This is actually a two-parter, so it's actually episode one and two.

608
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,300
So next week we'll be watching episode three, technically.

609
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,860
I thought maybe I could just give you a little bit of trivia about this episode before we

610
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,860
got rolling, okay?

611
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,860
All righty.

612
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,100
This is in tradition of one of my favorite podcasts, Mission Log, which if you guys are

613
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,280
Star Trek fans, go listen to Mission Log podcast.

614
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,420
So a little trivia.

615
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,420
Did you know?

616
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Bet you didn't.

617
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,180
The sequence of Dax and Sisko within the wormhole where they're flying through the wormhole

618
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:57,660
was actually one of the last sequences filmed, and that was filmed on October 24th, 1992.

619
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,300
This is the 20th anniversary.

620
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,740
This year is the 20th anniversary of Deep Space Nine.

621
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,740
By the way-

622
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,740
Hard to believe, isn't it?

623
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,740
Yeah, it really is.

624
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:10,740
By the way, this is the only episode where in the intro, they don't show the wormhole

625
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,220
because they didn't want to give it away in the opening credits.

626
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,220
Right, right.

627
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:19,640
So in the opening credits, it's all just stars, and then in syndication later on, and in some

628
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,380
foreign language versions, they just went right to wormhole.

629
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,180
But in the intro credits for this episode, there is no wormhole.

630
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,540
So also for the scene depicting Sisko where he's idling in the wormhole with the prophets,

631
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,620
you know that really super crazy white effect they had?

632
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,300
The director of photography used diffusion filters and overexposed the image as to achieve

633
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:45,240
the effect of the white bleeding into Sisko's skin, and the big number here, 250 special

634
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,380
effect shots were created for this episode of Star Trek, Deep Space Nine.

635
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,940
And one of the things that's quite interesting about Deep Space Nine is... Oh, I'm going

636
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,100
to have to... I'll see, can I... Well, I have to mute... Sorry, Mumble Room, I have

637
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:04,020
to mute you guys again because I have to play some clips, but we'll be back soon.

638
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:08,780
One of the things that is pretty interesting about Deep Space Nine is it actually opens

639
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:14,880
... The first lines spoken are by Picard, which means Picard opens TNG and Deep Space

640
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Nine.

641
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Resistance is futile.

642
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:29,340
You will disarm your weapons and escort us to sector 001.

643
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:33,420
If you attempt to intervene, we will destroy you.

644
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,020
So, pretty epic opening just right there.

645
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,660
That's the first line spoken in this episode, and they're Lekutis, which is one of the strongest

646
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,540
moments in Star Trek The Next Generation.

647
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,500
The Borg were huge during this time.

648
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
Oh, yeah, it was big time.

649
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,500
Big time stuff.

650
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
So, DS, that's a strong opening.

651
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,780
You open with the Borg, you open big, right?

652
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,940
And it moves quick.

653
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940
It moves quick.

654
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:58,840
What was important about that entire piece right there is that it not only established

655
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:05,980
the interchange between TNG and this now new show, but it also helped in critical important

656
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,860
character building for Cisco, his history and so on and so forth.

657
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,860
It was a big deal.

658
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,820
It's really, and it's an interesting way to intertwine into Trek lore a really pivotal

659
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,380
moment with the new character to really make those universes come together.

660
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,220
And of course, these first few moments are pivotal throughout the entire episode.

661
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,180
They come back to it over and over again.

662
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:31,780
And one of the things that honestly, at this time, I remember, and I was curious to see

663
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,460
if it would have the same effect now.

664
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,820
After watching this, I really didn't like the character of Cisco.

665
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,380
And one of the things that put me off about Cisco is he seemed a lot more concerned about

666
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,180
his wife than his whole crew.

667
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,260
I mean, he's supposed to be the commander of this ship, of his crew, or even of his

668
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,260
son.

669
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,260
Jennifer?

670
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,260

671
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260

Containment failure in three minutes.

674
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:58,260
I'm going to get your mom.

675
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:04,260

677

Okay, Jake.

678

We'll get your mom out, and we'll get out of here.

679
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,260

692
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,260

693
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,260

She's gone!

696
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,260
There's nothing we can do.

697
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:34,260
We have to leave!

698
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,260
Warning.

699
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:44,260
Damage to warp core.

700
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,260
Containment failure in two minutes.

701
00:42:49,260 --> 00:43:05,500
And then they abandon ship and he's this whole time as the commander of a starship he's completely

702
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,260
worthless like they're dragging him to the ship he's he's not helping he's not giving

703
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:14,360
any orders he's completely incapacitated well so here's the thing that and I and I heard

704
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,840
other people mention similar things but they don't take into account remind me again how

705
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,340
many other captains in the Star Trek series various series were married and had their

706
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,500
spouses on the ship yeah yeah and I didn't Kirk didn't and so we never got to see that

707
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,860
side of them well and actually yeah it was until this episode it had only been established

708
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,700
the galaxy class vessels had children on them that's right and this this was the first time

709
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:40,360
we'd seen a non-galaxy class now you know and also look back at Picard with TNG remember

710
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,700
when he thought he had a son right right yeah yeah what how quickly he his whole mindset

711
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,660
of everything just did a 180 completely changed so I mean realistically yeah my wife and I

712
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,700
have days where we want to kill each other but you put us on a ship and if it's between

713
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:00,300
my crew my and my wife it's been fun crew but you know what you know I think I see that

714
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:04,180
now see at the time when I was watching this I still feel like he's a little dismissive

715
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:09,000
with the kid like the kids oh yeah here you go again he just hands the kid yeah the kids

716
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,580
alive the wife's dead he's like freaking out about the wife but I agree with you now like

717
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,740
with the perspective on that is yeah that you could see but back then I was a kid I

718
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:21,380
wasn't really married so but the other part that really kind of put me off about Cisco

719
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,640
is he was mean to my buddy Jean-Luc I have a son that I'm raising alone captain this

720
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,300
is not the ideal environment unfortunately as Starfleet officers we do not always have

721
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:37,780
the luxury to serve in an ideal environment I realize that sir and I'm investigating the

722
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:45,780
possibility of returning to earth for civilian service perhaps Starfleet command should be

723
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:53,940
considering a replacement for you that's probably a good idea I look into it in the meantime

724
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,940
however in the meantime I will do the job I've been ordered to do to the best of my

725
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:09,220
ability sir oh snaps dismissed so I was like dude he's being harsh on Picard but I didn't

726
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:14,620
really appreciate that from Cisco's perspective at this time he's got a boy and he's got a

727
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,900
nice desk job the boy's got a good safe life and now he's been put out in the frontier

728
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,340
he's been put on the front lines he's not too happy about it well he's essentially put

729
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,700
out into the you know Siberia tundra Siberian tundra it's essentially what's happened here

730
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:31,580
and you you're basically again that's what I like about DS9 is that they look at things

731
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:37,020
from it's it's less I don't want to say froufrou but it's more it's deeper character stuff

732
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,260
not as much about the the next horizon the next challenge the next exploration the next

733
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:45,620
conflict the in the first in the first season especially especially the first episode it's

734
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:50,740
very much about the people and the interaction and and how different events change how we

735
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:55,220
look at stuff and someone who might have otherwise been a dedicated first off you know I guess

736
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,500
he would have been what commander you know how quickly that can change when they're confronted

737
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,640
with someone that potentially not only killed the life of the crew but also basically got

738
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,300
off I mean really what kind of slap on the wrist of the man get yeah yeah yeah I mean

739
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:13,020
I totally see it now yeah back then I was like why doesn't he like Picard I get it now

740
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,140
and it things that kind of pick up and move real quick right you have he makes a trip

741
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:21,540
down to the Bajorans in this really odd like commander it's time to go and he just all

742
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,460
of a sudden he goes down to see this the most holiest Bajoran of all Bajorans and he goes

743
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,860
down there and she touches his ear a little bit and then gives them a little a little

744
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:34,700
bit of acid aka one of the prophet orbs and gets him kind of motivated so he takes this

745
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,820
or back to the station this is where we meet Dax we find out that Dax is a trill all this

746
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:42,700
characters are getting some pretty good setups you know you get lots of flashbacks are used

747
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:48,340
to like show Dax getting surgery and so they go off to find a location of where these orbs

748
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:52,660
came from and they discover a wormhole the first known stable wormhole now this is going

749
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:56,340
to be the show's hook because this adds a little spice because now they've got they're

750
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,580
on the very border of this brand new frontier and that's why they're supposed to be that's

751
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:05,540
why supposedly the concept works it's a stationary station because people are coming to them

752
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:09,740
and more importantly this is the you know to borrow from Star Wars this is like the

753
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:17,020
cat cantina on Tatooine this is a non federated area it's like you know no Federation presence

754
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:22,820
really western and it's a frontier town Odo's the sheriff right yeah and so it's and they're

755
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,300
on the they're on the frontier so of course Cisco's got to go into this wormhole and he

756
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:32,860
ends up getting trapped Dax Dax gets taken out but Cisco gets left behind for some reason

757
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:36,260
and what's the crew decided to do they're strapped on the station the station's currently

758
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:42,180
orbiting Bajor I love the logic so they immediately say well Cisco's not here let's move the whole

759
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,060
station to go rescue him but the problem is and I don't understand how this works maybe

760
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:51,500
the chat room does the problem was that darn station is too heavy what would it take to

761
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:56,520
move this station to the mouth of the wormhole this isn't a starship major we've got six

762
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,460
working thrusters to power us and that's it 160 million kilometer trip would take two

763
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:06,620
months it has to be there tomorrow that's not possible sir that wormhole might just

764
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:12,620
reshape the future of this entire quadrant the Bajorans have to stake a claim to it and

765
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,900
I have to admit that claim would be a lot stronger if there's a Federation presence

766
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:21,660
to back it up couldn't you modify the subspace field output of the deflector generators just

767
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:26,060
enough to create a low-level field around the station oh Dax so we could lower the

768
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:30,540
inertial mass if you can make the station lighter those six thrusters will be all the

769
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:35,340
power we need this whole station could break apart like an egg if it doesn't work I love

770
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:38,580
that line there this whole station could break apart like an egg it's kind of seems feels

771
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,580
like an homage to Scotty a little bit it totally does it totally does but now if you listen

772
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,880
carefully now you can under you they actually tell you why they're bothering to do this

773
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,500
to rescue him yeah yeah it does actually because he's the face of the yeah he's face of the

774
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:57,540
Federation they they have a report the start of a rapport basically he doesn't Kira's not

775
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:01,960
liking anybody but she's liking him a little more than she was before and you know she's

776
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,420
kind of warming up to him a little bit and then he doesn't really want it to break in

777
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,860
a whole new guy one of the things that happens is there's kind of interaction between Cisco

778
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,660
and Quark to get Quark to remain behind which kind of impresses Kira like oh he actually

779
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,460
handled that pretty well oh yeah yeah totally totally only because you know this is our

780
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:23,100
first real in-depth uh you know experience with Ferengi that isn't based on TNG logic

781
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:26,580
where they run around grunting with whips yeah you know in TNG they wrote them in there

782
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,800
because they wanted them to be the new Klingons before they came up with the board concept

783
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,420
they wanted them to be the new Klingons and they realized very quickly oh these guys are

784
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:38,460
laughable so but I think Quark single-handedly turns that image around and makes them into

785
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:43,980
cunning conniving capitalists oh Quark is my hero yeah I mean the dude's awesome yeah

786
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:48,940
and Cisco kind of has like a real slow period during the show where he ends up in the wormhole

787
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:54,620
just like explaining time to aliens my species lives in one point in time and once we move

788
00:49:54,620 --> 00:50:00,780
beyond that point it becomes the past the future all that is still to come does not

789
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:07,900
exist yet for us does not exist yet that is the nature of linear existence and if you

790
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:13,780
examine it more closely you will see that you do not need to fear me it's it's it's

791
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,780
a it's a high level strong concept but it's just a little slow it felt like it dragged

792
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:23,460
things down a little bit for me I was okay with it in that it was I considered it part

793
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:26,980
of that character building process you know you're calling the prophets characters and

794
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,820
it allowed them to kind of you know it kind of intermingled a little bit so I was okay

795
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:33,820
with it yeah it was a little boring and it's actually a pretty good description of what

796
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:37,980
time is like like because they you know the one of the concepts is what is time in this

797
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:42,060
movie and these aliens have they live in a reality where there just is no time it's everything

798
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:46,660
is what it is it exists and so having to like explain you know because sometimes with my

799
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,860
son I've he's asked me can I explain something and I have to explain it without using another

800
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,860
word that needs to be explained and they did a pretty good job there but meanwhile the

801
00:50:55,860 --> 00:51:00,220
real fun is actually still back on the station there's a great O'Brien character creating

802
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:04,300
scene where he fights with the station computer to get the station to actually move and this

803
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,620
is like a thread that continues throughout the first or even second season and I love

804
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,620
it.

805
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:13,380
Partial field established instability at 12 percent.

806
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,380
Partial field.

807
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:20,060
Is station's inertial mass low enough to break orbit?

808
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,060
Procedure is not recommended.

809
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,980
Dammit I didn't ask for an opinion.

810
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:28,140
Just tell me whether or not we can get enough thrust with only a partial field established.

811
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,140
Affirmative.

812
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:33,260
All right thank you.

813
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,260
Initiate transit mode.

814
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,260
Three axis stabilization.

815
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,260
Aye sir.

816
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,260
Engage thrusters.

817
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,260
Warning.

818
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,260
Field integrity declining.

819
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,260
Instability at 21 percent.

820
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:57,780
We've got to close that gap in the field or we'll tear ourselves into a million pieces.

821
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,780
Warning.

822
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,460
Subspace field collapse in 60 seconds.

823
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:06,660
Computer transfer energy from the inertial dampers to reinforce the subspace field.

824
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,660
Procedure is not recommended.

825
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,660
Dammit.

826
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,660
Transfer the energy.

827
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,660
Unable to comply.

828
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,660
Level one safety protocols have canceled request.

829
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,660
Canceled?

830
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,660
Warning.

831
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:16,660
Subspace field collapse in 30 seconds.

832
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,660
I'm going to transfer it manually.

833
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:25,660
On my mark redirect the flow to the deflectors and keep the power balanced.

834
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,660
Aye sir.

835
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:27,660
Field collapse in 15 seconds.

836
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,660
Now.

837
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:29,660
Field energy now within flight tolerances.

838
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:34,660
I love it.

839
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:49,300
Yeah and there's also a great scene where he's trying to get the transporter to work

840
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,780
and he ends up just kicking it.

841
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:55,060
Well and that's what's awesome is that this is the series, even it's through season one

842
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,060
that really established his character.

843
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,060
Yeah, yeah.

844
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:03,820
And there's an awkward yet appropriate goodbye between him and Picard where, and I couldn't

845
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,940
quite understand what they were trying to tell me, O'Brien visits the bridge, spends

846
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:14,740
time looking at the ready room but doesn't go in to say goodbye, then goes to the transporter

847
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:19,100
but Picard stops him before he beams out to say goodbye and like Picard is being more

848
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,240
emotional than O'Brien.

849
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,700
Like he's trying to say like, you know, this was your favorite transporter room, blah,

850
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,700
blah, blah.

851
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,740
And O'Brien's like, yeah, whatever, sir.

852
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,780
And then he gets up on the pad and gets and tells him to beam them out and meanwhile Picard's

853
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,780
like sitting there heartbroken.

854
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:35,020
I like, but I guess, you know, they were just trying to do a handoff and that is how two

855
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,020
guys would do it.

856
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,660
Like it would be awkward because it would be two guys, right?

857
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,420
Well Picard's acting like a girl.

858
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,060
I mean, no offense, but I mean, he's acting much more, you know, in that mindset of he

859
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,460
has things he wants to express, guys of course don't want to express anything and that's

860
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,820
kind of how we're wired.

861
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:54,500
And it's interesting because they kind of come back on it later on in DS9 where every

862
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,100
now and then you wonder if maybe O'Brien wasn't always totally happy on the Enterprise.

863
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:04,060
Now there is another really strong character moment and this time it's with Kira.

864
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,940
Their lead ship is hailing us.

865
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,940
Gul Jassad wants an answer.

866
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,100
Are you ready, Mr. O'Brien?

867
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,100
Yes, sir.

868
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,380
When they penetrate our Thorogh field, it should raise a few eyebrows over there.

869
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:22,220
All right, then let's give them our answer.

870
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,700
There are six photon torpedoes across Jassad's bow.

871
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,500
We only have six photons, Major.

872
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,500
I love that.

873
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,500
We're not going to win this battle with torpedoes, Chief.

874
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,500
Aye, sir.

875
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:40,060
An urgent hail from Jassad.

876
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:44,100
Looks like we got his attention.

877
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,100
On screen.

878
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,580
This is your answer?

879
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:51,860
You don't think Starfleet took command of the space station without the ability to defend

880
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,860
it, do you?

881
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,060
Defend it?

882
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:00,660
Your space station could not defend itself against one Cardassian warship.

883
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,060
You're probably right, Jassad.

884
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:10,620
And if you were dealing with the Starfleet officer, they'd probably admit, we have a

885
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,860
hopeless cause here.

886
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:21,140
But I am just a Bajoran who's been fighting a hopeless cause against the Cardassians all

887
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,900
her life.

888
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:29,060
So if you want a war, I'll give you one.

889
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,060
Love that.

890
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,060
It's so perfect.

891
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,060
She plays it so well.

892
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,060
The chat room picked up on something.

893
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,220
Everybody calls her sir, and DS9 followed that a lot more closely.

894
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,820
Like when Dax took over the Defiant later on in the series, everyone called her Captain,

895
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,940
even though her rank was like Lieutenant Commander.

896
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,940
They followed a lot of more naval traditions.

897
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,700
In fact, another example of DS9 having some really smart dialogue that kind of keeps you

898
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,620
in that world, keeps you in that reality, like they're creating a universe, is right

899
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:56,200
after that line from Kira.

900
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,480
The camera pans over to O'Brien, and he starts to talk, and before he even finishes the sentence,

901
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,420
you know what joke he's going to make.

902
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:05,940
And these types of jokes, they often bug me on Star Trek because they're essentially a

903
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,820
joke that we make using current 20th century references.

904
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:14,140
But instead, DS9 takes it as an opportunity to enrich the reality.

905
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:21,900
So, you know, you know he means poker.

906
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,520
I'm never going to play poker because you've got a good bluff face, but they don't say

907
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,780
poker because that's a human reference for the, you know, 20, 21st century.

908
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,780
But I think it's a truism that, you know, while the verbiage may be different, I think

909
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:38,300
it dates back further, just it probably, you know, uses different language, I'm sure.

910
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:44,060
It's like exactly like that turn of phrase is still used, but they use different things,

911
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:48,820
like in DS9, instead of using coffee, they get Ractaginos, right, a lot of things like

912
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,820
that.

913
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:50,820
I just appreciated that.

914
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:55,620
And then, of course, after the tension has been mounted and built properly, there's only

915
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,900
one person who can come back and save the day at this point.

916
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:02,320
Of course, it's the last few minutes of this episode, and that would be Captain Sisko coming

917
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,620
back from the wormhole.

918
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,580
And remember, at this point in the show, the Cardassians believe that it wasn't a wormhole

919
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:11,840
that took away Dukat's ship, it was perhaps the station.

920
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,700
And so that's why they're threatening to attack the station and they want to take it over

921
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,700
again.

922
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,620
And just as their attack on the station is reaching a climax.

923
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:23,540
Signal the lead Cardassian ship that we will proceed with major.

924
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:28,660
I'm picking up a huge neutrino disturbance 15 kilometers off the forward docking ring.

925
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,660
It's the wormhole.

926
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:30,660
On screen.

927
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,660
Hail the lead ship.

928
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,660
What did I tell you, Jasad?

929
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,660
There's your wormhole.

930
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:55,860
And he's got Dukat shipping a tractor beam, which for Cardassians is a big statement because

931
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,860
that's a show of weakness.

932
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:59,660
That's a lot like a dog being on a leash seen to other dogs.

933
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,660
Exactly.

934
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,660
And it diffuses the situation.

935
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,660
He's like, Hey, I've noticed you have a few problems.

936
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,980
Of course, he doesn't say why the hell have you moved my station, but right, which I had

937
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:07,980
a problem with that.

938
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:08,980
Yeah.

939
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,980
Yeah.

940
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,540
But then at the end of the episode, Cisco talks to Picard and makes good.

941
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,460
Well, you've put Bajor on the map, commander.

942
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:20,220
This will shortly become a leading center of commerce and of scientific exploration

943
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:27,860
and for Starfleet, one of our most important posts captain regarding our conversation about

944
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:32,940
someone to replace now it's yes, I am sorry I haven't had time yet to communicate that

945
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,940
to command.

946
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,940
I would prefer you ignore it, sir.

947
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:41,580
I'm not sure that I can, are you certain that's what you want?

948
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:46,540
Because we cannot afford to have a commanding officer who was, I'm certain, sir.

949
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,540
There you go.

950
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,540
He's certain.

951
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,340
He was, he was energized by the experience and now he's ready for the, uh, for the challenge.

952
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:55,860
And I was kind of surprised at how often Picard actually popped up through this episode.

953
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:59,780
You know, I just expected a quick cameo and that would be it, but he actually had a recurring

954
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,020
role throughout this two hour episode.

955
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:03,020
True.

956
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,020
This is true.

957
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:08,300
And I think it definitely sets sets because I think all these events needed to happen

958
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,740
for that first season to make any sense.

959
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,460
We needed to understand his psychology.

960
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,460
Exactly.

961
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,260
And that's kind of why we spent a little extra time on this episode because it really is

962
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,340
the foundation for the rest of the series.

963
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,980
That's one of the things that's kind of interesting about DS nine, although in TNG they managed

964
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,020
to bring it back home too.

965
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:27,060
But, uh, so before we go to the mumble room and get their thoughts on all of this, give

966
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:32,060
them a time to catch up on the stream, Matt, after watching this again, how did it land

967
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,060
on you?

968
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:37,580
Does it a does it hold up and B does it, where, where does it leave you?

969
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,580
It was like your overall review.

970
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:44,620
I maintain that, you know, I, of course we haven't gotten to where we really got to enjoy

971
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,860
Quark and it's in his fullness yet.

972
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:50,700
We haven't even touched on Nog or any of these other things, but I think as far as the characters

973
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:56,020
that really made their, their, uh, shiny moment in this first episode, it really drives home

974
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:01,260
for me that this was a piece of Star Trek that needed to happen without the utopian

975
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:07,080
stuff, without the, you know, just explore, explore, explore more stuff that we as humans

976
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,180
in the 21st century can relate to.

977
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:14,980
I think that we, it's more relatable in our day to day struggles, in our, uh, war conflicts,

978
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:15,980
all these things.

979
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,380
I think it, it lets us know that it, Star Trek isn't just utopian.

980
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,380
Yeah.

981
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,580
And that, and that, um, it actually caused some internal strafe because you still had

982
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,860
the T and G crew around a lot of the people who were there in the original Roddenberry

983
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:28,860
days.

984
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:29,860
Oh yeah.

985
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,940
There was some internal strife about that if, if Gene would approve of it or not.

986
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:35,620
But you know, you touched on something kind of, you know, one of the things that DS9 was

987
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:39,900
really good at was taking current events and reflecting them into the future, abstracting

988
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,580
them away so that way we could have a rational conversation without special interest getting

989
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:44,900
their feelings hurt.

990
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:45,900
Right.

991
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,780
And one of the things that struck me through this, and it's not a direct parallel at all,

992
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:54,860
but there is a lot of similarities between what the potential outcome could be in Syria

993
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:59,220
and the state of the Bajoran people, like, and there's an oppressive regime.

994
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,900
Um, there is a falling of that regime.

995
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:06,060
There is a civil government that is established and then that civil government requests that

996
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:12,020
this larger empire, AKA the federation comes in and brings in military to help them.

997
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:17,620
And then a local aggressor in their backyard, AKA, you know, another Eastern, Middle Eastern

998
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,620
country.

999
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:24,260
Something like that is an aggressor in their backyard who the, the, uh, the new hired guns

1000
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,700
have to constantly keep an eye on.

1001
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,820
I mean, there's a lot of reflections in modern day politics intertwined into this first episode

1002
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,300
of DS9 too.

1003
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,180
And in my mind, that makes it hold up even stronger.

1004
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,660
Oh, I would, I would say so.

1005
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:39,300
And I think that entire set of circumstances, both in the past now and even in the future

1006
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,940
is a timeless thing.

1007
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:46,020
Um, I've seen it time and time again, you know, it seems like it's a constant cycle.

1008
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:49,220
And so it's interesting that even in a whole nother part of the universe or another part

1009
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:55,060
of the galaxy in this particular case, that something so familiar can still unravel despite

1010
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:58,100
the fact that they're not, you know, it doesn't involve humans.

1011
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,100
History continues to repeat itself.

1012
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,100
All right.

1013
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,100
Until humans insert themselves.

1014
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,660
I'll ask the mumble room, uh, guys in the room, I'll open the floor to you.

1015
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,460
Did anybody get a chance to watch along with us?

1016
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,860
And what were your impressions of the first episode of Deep Space Nine?

1017
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,660
How does it hold up as a Star Trek premiere?

1018
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:15,380
You got, think of it now at this point in time, we've seen every Star Trek premiere

1019
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,380
has been.

1020
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:20,420
We've seen Enterprise, TNG, Voyager, even TOS, if you've got the gray hairs to prove

1021
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:21,420
it.

1022
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:25,660
And where does DS9 fit into those other Star Trek premiers?

1023
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,820
Mumble room, I bring it to you.

1024
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:38,140
Well, I watched it, uh, well, I never really got into DS9 when I was on TV, uh, it never

1025
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:43,100
really grabbed me, but I watched the first episode this time and I really watched it

1026
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,340
and uh, yeah, I do enjoy it.

1027
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:51,860
It has some weaknesses, um, for instance, the, the, the, the, the moment in that Cisco

1028
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:57,340
was in the wormhole and was stuck there, I felt that it was going on, it was dragging

1029
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,340
along a little bit.

1030
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:04,020
That's at least, that's my opinion, but, uh, I did like the episode.

1031
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,380
It was a strong start.

1032
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:06,380
Yeah.

1033
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,700
I think it was a pretty strong start.

1034
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,780
Anybody else want to chime in before we wrap up?

1035
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:10,780
Yeah.

1036
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:11,780
Yeah.

1037
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,780
Go on.

1038
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:18,500
Yeah, I have to admit that the beginning of the episode, you know, it kind of showed what

1039
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:23,180
was going to happen, especially later on, um, in some of the later episodes with a fast

1040
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:28,220
pace of action, which you didn't normally see in the previous, uh, seasons and series

1041
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,220
of Star Trek.

1042
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:34,340
But the good thing about, um, this was a bit grittier, um, you could, you could definitely

1043
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,820
see what was going to be happening in the future.

1044
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:38,820
Excellent point.

1045
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,820
Excellent point.

1046
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,820
All right, guys, any last thoughts?

1047
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,820
Anybody else?

1048
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:46,180
Yeah, all I'd like to say about BS9 is that it has diversity to Star Trek.

1049
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:51,540
It says that it's not just about flying about in space and exploring new worlds or whatever.

1050
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:55,700
There is a universe there, there is a people there, there is a culture, there is everything.

1051
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,700
There's depth here.

1052
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,700
There's diversity here.

1053
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,700
Right.

1054
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,700
Exactly.

1055
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:00,700
Which you cannot ignore.

1056
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:01,700
Yeah.

1057
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:05,580
I think I would maybe argue that it is the, uh, that it is the absolute, uh, and I'm

1058
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,340
going to, I'll wrap it there cause we're running a little long, uh, but thank you, Mumble Room.

1059
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,580
I would argue that I think it is maybe the strongest premiere of any Star Trek.

1060
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:17,580
Uh, and it does, you know, the show like all Star Treks gets better, um, as, as it goes

1061
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:18,580
on.

1062
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:21,700
But I think, you know, if you look at TNG, there's, there's a lot, you know, you've got,

1063
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,020
you've got Deanna in a cheerleader uniform.

1064
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:27,780
You've got Wesley who's just derping up all over the place, right?

1065
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,860
And by the way, I got a lot of respect for how they handle Jake throughout this whole

1066
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:33,300
series, but specifically here, there's a strong connection.

1067
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,700
Like when Cisco gets back on the station and, you know, Jake sees him for the first time.

1068
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,700
I mean, I, that was touching to me as a dad.

1069
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,860
I thought they'd handled that really well.

1070
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:44,660
And instead of making Jake Wesley 2.0 or Echeb from Voyager, they handled them really well.

1071
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:47,380
And it's typically Star Trek really screws up kids really bad.

1072
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,380
They get it wrong a lot.

1073
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:49,380
And I don't feel like they did.

1074
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:52,380
Echeb's a great example there cause that was just, that was terrible.

1075
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:53,380
So, yeah.

1076
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:56,620
Uh, so I felt like as far as strong openings go, yeah, some of the acting was a little

1077
01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:00,660
rough because it's their first episode, but the effects were solid, the concepts were

1078
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,660
great.

1079
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:05,420
Um, and the execution was powerful and it, except for it moved, moved, moved, and then

1080
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:06,420
wormhole.

1081
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:10,220
All the scenes outside the wormhole, I really liked it.

1082
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:13,700
As soon as we get into the wormhole, I don't know, maybe I just need to get really stoned

1083
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,180
and maybe have a few beers or something.

1084
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:19,260
But as I'm sitting there watching this, I'm like, come on, this is two hours.

1085
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,940
You really got to spend this much time on here, but overall, I enjoyed it.

1086
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:22,940
All right, Matt.

1087
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:26,420
So I know this hasn't been popular with everyone, so we will do another straw poll.

1088
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,860
I have linked it in the show notes right now.

1089
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:29,660
So we will have two straw polls this week.

1090
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:33,300
The one that the people in the download and stream versions can watch later, we'll have

1091
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,860
the voting poll to see if we should do this again.

1092
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:39,420
So in the Deep Space Nine challenge, there will be a link at the top of that for the

1093
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:42,860
straw poll and you go there and you vote if you want us to do this again next week.

1094
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:46,640
And if we get, uh, if the yeses have it, then we will do episode three of DS9.

1095
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:51,220
If the nopes have it, we'll drop it there and we'll just stick to other stuff.

1096
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:54,780
But I thought it was kind of fun and it's, I think there's benefits from time to time

1097
01:05:54,780 --> 01:06:00,380
to taking our same community and all the, all of the people who hold similar interests

1098
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:05,300
and exploring other topics and, and, and going into other things that we all enjoy because

1099
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:09,900
it is good to get out of that bubble and it is still good to have the chat and the discussion

1100
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:10,900
and get people thinking.

1101
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,980
And it's, it's also just kind of a fun way to get people to get into DS9 if they haven't

1102
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:15,980
been there before.

1103
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,300
So it's, it's, I, but I understand it might not be popular.

1104
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,780
So if people don't like it, we don't have to do it next time.

1105
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:22,500
Super quick piece of advice before I let it go.

1106
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:26,980
If you watched it back when it aired, forget everything you ever watched, watch it commercial

1107
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:27,980
free on Netflix.

1108
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,980
It's a completely different experience.

1109
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:33,620
I really felt like I, I really felt like I watched a different show in some ways.

1110
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,620
Yeah.

1111
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:35,620
All right.

1112
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,620
So here we go.

1113
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:41,020
But before we run our final, our final tally for a Sunday's topic, Friday edition, or I'm

1114
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:45,980
sorry, Friday's topic, Friday edition of the Linux action show Trek meets Linux or taking

1115
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:48,340
great notes on Linux.

1116
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:51,940
And the notes have it with, I did not expect that with 43 votes, 56%.

1117
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:56,400
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if there's a few Star Trek app picks that work their way

1118
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,620
into the episode anyways.

1119
01:06:58,620 --> 01:06:59,620
You know what I'm saying, Matt?

1120
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,620
I know what you're saying.

1121
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:01,620
Okay.

1122
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:02,620
All right.

1123
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:03,620
I can do the note thing.

1124
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,620
I got a couple of good note apps.

1125
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,340
You and I will share notes after the show.

1126
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,340
All right.

1127
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:08,340
Yeah.

1128
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,340
You get what I'm saying, Matt?

1129
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,340
I get what you're saying.

1130
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:13,340
Um, so yeah, just a little reminder, we'll be doing Friday, uh, edition of Linux action

1131
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:16,220
show at 10 a.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv.

1132
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:19,900
No show on Sunday, but it actually should be available for download hopefully around

1133
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:20,900
the regular lifetime.

1134
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,500
So you've got to just watch it on demand and, uh, enjoy it that way.

1135
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,500
All right.

1136
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,500
Well, uh, thanks to the mumble room.

1137
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,560
Hey guys, thanks for joining us today.

1138
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,560
You guys were awesome.

1139
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,300
I'm going to mute you here in a bit, but, uh, we'll chat some more after the show.

1140
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:34,980
We keep going a little bit after the show and, uh, we'll, uh, share some more thoughts

1141
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:40,100
and don't forget, we'd love to get more con more, uh, more topics, more, uh, concepts

1142
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,100
to kick around.

1143
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,980
You can submit a lot of those, any of those really to linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1144
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:47,720
It's a great place to get things into the show because now the things, now that we've

1145
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:51,920
got two places to cover some of this stuff, stuff that doesn't make it into the big show

1146
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,920
might still make it into here.

1147
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,420
So stuff's got double the shot to make it into the show.

1148
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,300
Matt, you have a great week.

1149
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,140
Enjoy your ramp up to the big day.

1150
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,140
I will.

1151
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,140
I will.

1152
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:03,020
Thank you for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1153
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,380
I hope we see you back here.

1154
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,820
Don't forget to go vote in that straw poll if you liked it or didn't like it because

1155
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,640
it's going to depend on your vote.

1156
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,640
So you got to show up and vote.

1157
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,500
We'll have a link to that in the show notes, right under the deep space nine challenge,

1158
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,780
as well as links to where you can stream deep space nine online.

1159
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:22,340
If you have access to us servers, if you get what I'm saying with that, all right, everyone,

1160
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,580
thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of unplugged.

1161
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:32,060
We'll see you right back here next week.
