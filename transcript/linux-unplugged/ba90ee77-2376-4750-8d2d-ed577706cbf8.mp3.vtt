WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
Matt maybe I'm just losing touch I don't I don't think I have a good sense of

00:04.200 --> 00:08.080
what's gonna be a hit product anymore like I thought Chromebooks would be a

00:08.080 --> 00:11.000
total flop and now they're doing better than ever they're doing so good now we

00:11.000 --> 00:19.640
have these these HDMI sticks are going crazy and yeah yeah you know I mean if

00:19.640 --> 00:23.840
you want to touch on that now I can kind of share okay I mean I think there's

00:23.840 --> 00:29.040
without getting too deep into it I think it really comes down to remember Zombo

00:29.040 --> 00:32.640
remember the promise of Zombo you know I mean garbage hardware with a really

00:32.640 --> 00:37.400
cool idea basically you know it's like gen 2 with a twist you know people

00:37.400 --> 00:40.640
really liked that idea and having experienced it when I saw Chromebooks

00:40.640 --> 00:45.280
come about the idea of that if most of their stuff is stored in something that

00:45.280 --> 00:49.680
they can basically set their you know it's it's idiots proof it's essentially

00:49.680 --> 00:55.120
and I use air quotes for this virus malware free it's it's basically it's

00:55.120 --> 00:57.960
it's what should have been happening all the friggin long I mean it's like I

00:57.960 --> 01:01.440
watch Apple and Microsoft do this for years it's like it's 2015 and their

01:01.440 --> 01:06.080
products are still stupid easy to break we're really easy so that's true this is

01:06.080 --> 01:11.400
dumb this is like dumb like easy easy but aren't we like easy how are we how

01:11.400 --> 01:16.080
do we avoid like so here's what I'm looking at Matt is that so you use this

01:16.080 --> 01:24.080
little hindsight here I'm seeing I'm seeing one two three four if you five so

01:24.080 --> 01:28.080
now the Chrome bits five different manufacturers of these that are six

01:28.080 --> 01:31.480
sorry seven manufacturers that have products that are coming out to the

01:31.480 --> 01:34.720
market right now one of them is Google one of them is Intel obviously those

01:34.720 --> 01:39.200
ones probably have the biggest chance of succeeding but this is getting awfully

01:39.200 --> 01:44.280
complicated this is looking like a mess and another race to the bottom it is a

01:44.280 --> 01:47.360
race to the bottom in a sense but it's also catering to the market of people

01:47.360 --> 01:52.080
that people though we haven't seen anybody wants to do this yet you know I

01:52.080 --> 01:55.840
really think people want to burn an HDMI port on their TV because first of all

01:55.840 --> 01:59.640
who's aged who has enough HDMI ports on their TV I don't well I think I think

01:59.640 --> 02:03.040
the sticks an idiot idea now that to be clear on that I think that's I mean well

02:03.040 --> 02:06.760
that's not a so true if it would work on a monitor yeah not intelligent lots of

02:06.760 --> 02:09.840
monsters have HDMI yeah yeah then that would make sense but if you're plugging

02:09.840 --> 02:13.140
into a TV is just stupid beyond imagination I mean there's it's not an

02:13.140 --> 02:17.120
Android device that would actually allow you to participate in media I mean you

02:17.120 --> 02:20.240
got a plexi put plex on there and up in that business yeah if it works on the

02:20.240 --> 02:25.240
fire stick so you know but if there's the divide between geek and casual users

02:25.240 --> 02:28.540
is wider than ever and it's and it's getting to a point where it's making me

02:28.540 --> 02:31.760
scream because it's like the reason why the Linux on the desktop it continues to

02:31.760 --> 02:35.640
drag its knuckles in my opinion is because people dig in harder and harder

02:35.640 --> 02:39.840
and they you know become archier and archier and it's well you it just isn't

02:39.840 --> 02:42.880
that hard and herpa herpa herpa and it's like yeah it's not that hard for me to

02:42.880 --> 02:46.360
change my oil how to do it not going to you know I mean lots of people know how

02:46.360 --> 02:49.320
to do lots of things but doesn't mean everyone wants to do that all right

02:49.320 --> 02:52.920
everyone wants to learn you know what do you think rotten yeah I was just gonna

02:52.920 --> 02:57.000
say that the HDMI sticks are fantastic if it's like an embedded device like a

02:57.000 --> 03:01.720
media device or something sure yeah yeah that's gonna swear it falls short

03:01.720 --> 03:07.120
there doesn't you're gonna add some I think canonical because they already are

03:07.120 --> 03:12.240
dealing with conversions are going to be the most to benefit from this because

03:12.240 --> 03:18.560
think about it device is people are already like there was yes it was

03:18.560 --> 03:24.720
meaning Linux focus the do the will to get an Ubuntu device that you can maybe

03:24.720 --> 03:30.360
dock it and have your desktop Matt Google's gonna roll this isn't it well

03:30.360 --> 03:34.640
let's say here's the problem it's like I mean I would say for post Google like

03:34.640 --> 03:38.120
people that are not gonna participate in the Google atmosphere yes yeah you know

03:38.120 --> 03:41.680
the Ubuntu stuff will absolutely rock and roll for the rep the other ninety

03:41.680 --> 03:47.040
nine point nine percent of society no it just no one you know especially here in

03:47.040 --> 03:52.640
the state I will say that in Canada or overseas yes what can I do to you what

03:52.640 --> 03:56.040
is Google giving to you Google wants you to keep doing things online

03:56.040 --> 04:01.920
sure do wants you to have the decision right they get marketing yeah yeah yeah

04:01.920 --> 04:04.520
but that hasn't prevented everybody from buying every Chromebook under the Sun

04:04.520 --> 04:07.520
yeah I mean cuz at the end of the day I would get more value from an Ubuntu

04:07.520 --> 04:12.120
device so as as would you sure sure all this would but but unfortunately when I

04:12.120 --> 04:15.020
turn on my television set and or I don't have cable but if I go to someone's

04:15.020 --> 04:18.840
house okay it's a Google commercial or it's a you know or it's Google stuff

04:18.840 --> 04:24.880
it's all marketing that's where Linux and still easier is it for you as a geek

04:24.880 --> 04:28.760
in the family give one of these little device and say hey plug it on the TV

04:28.760 --> 04:34.440
versus giving them that'll be our mission that will be our call just and

04:34.440 --> 04:36.880
that's it that's a good graph I think that's a good grassroots approach

04:36.880 --> 04:41.080
that's the only way you could combat this stuff really is think about the

04:41.080 --> 04:44.840
opportunity here as more and more monitors get HDMI ports that old family

04:44.840 --> 04:47.920
call when you go over there for the holidays and fix up their Windows PC and

04:47.920 --> 04:51.160
then later it was convinced them to install Linux now you just go over to

04:51.160 --> 04:53.720
there you'll go to their you'll go to their house you'll bring one of these

04:53.720 --> 04:57.840
HDMI things it's costing you 60 bucks or whatever they're gonna cost totally

04:57.840 --> 05:01.200
ready to go all set up you sit down you plug into their old monitor and when you

05:01.200 --> 05:04.560
leave you take their old PC with you and they're gonna have a quad-core arm thing

05:04.560 --> 05:09.360
with you know 2 to 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage and you're

05:09.360 --> 05:12.720
gonna have them store everything up on some cloud storage that you like and

05:12.720 --> 05:16.360
everybody's gonna be happy well and the sad part of it is is that Google could

05:16.360 --> 05:20.000
be beaten tomorrow if boots on the ground would pull their heads out of

05:20.000 --> 05:22.880
their butts and actually get these devices in the pants people that's all

05:22.880 --> 05:26.200
it takes it's on the ground it's on but you know we're not there yet that's the

05:26.200 --> 05:30.680
problem Ryan you wanted to add something maybe you say is a bit controversial

05:30.680 --> 05:36.360
well actually I was just wanted to bring up a topic that maybe we could cover

05:36.360 --> 05:44.360
today and that is whether or not Microsoft will buy a Linux company whoa

05:44.360 --> 05:49.080
I well yeah all right well we can we why don't we get to that in a little bit I

05:49.080 --> 05:55.600
think the answer is no I think it's easier for them to just open a Linux

05:55.600 --> 06:00.080
division as they probably already have to contribute to the hypervisor then

06:00.080 --> 06:05.960
buying a company I think I think I think Microsoft would rather only ship

06:05.960 --> 06:10.440
software for iOS than touch the GPL that that much but I mean they'll dabble with

06:10.440 --> 06:13.440
it for for drivers and things like that but I don't think they'd ever ship a

06:13.440 --> 06:18.400
product based on GPL they would as a sock puppet as a sock puppet scenario yes

06:18.400 --> 06:22.280
they would not not publicly they would they have so many legal cases that they

06:22.280 --> 06:25.920
have they have brought against so many companies for their use of Linux and

06:25.920 --> 06:29.280
intellectual properties maybe actually maybe because they technically own that

06:29.280 --> 06:31.840
stuff they would actually be just fine to use it so maybe I know it just seems

06:31.840 --> 06:35.400
like it would bring a lot of things into question in Washington they're one of

06:35.400 --> 06:40.000
the big Linux hiring people right now this comes up because I was watching how

06:40.000 --> 06:44.760
much they're cuddling up close I'm sorry to derail the topic I think that the

06:44.760 --> 06:51.360
crumbits are non-starter but the they're cuddling up real close to Ubuntu with

06:51.360 --> 06:55.240
their cloud offerings and maybe they just have to do that because Ubuntu is

06:55.240 --> 07:00.880
a big player and you know those deployment and those situations but but

07:00.880 --> 07:07.000
it just got me thinking if they were gonna buy up a a Linux vendor it would

07:07.000 --> 07:12.120
be open Sousa first of all open Sousa's you know I mean open Sousa has a lot of

07:12.120 --> 07:18.040
government incentive right now not to be sold open Sousa though has a very strong

07:18.040 --> 07:21.640
relationship with Microsoft they have those they have existing collaboration

07:21.640 --> 07:25.480
research labs or at least they used to and additionally they have a lot of

07:25.480 --> 07:28.440
great contracts like Walmart that Microsoft would love to be involved in a

07:28.440 --> 07:31.840
lot of those contracts were sold in conjunction with the Microsoft

07:31.840 --> 07:35.800
virtualization platform so they really go hand-in-hand Sousa is often sold as

07:35.800 --> 07:39.280
like if you want to use a Microsoft platform but have Linux virtual machines

07:39.280 --> 07:44.160
use hyper use a hyper V and opens and Sousa Enterprise inside the virtual

07:44.160 --> 07:46.520
machine and it's really been like the package so it'd be a great fit for

07:46.520 --> 07:51.600
Microsoft plus to be honest with you if you followed all at all what's happening

07:51.600 --> 07:57.600
with the parent companies of open Sousa and Sousa Enterprise I mean aren't they

07:57.600 --> 08:00.760
owned now by a company that does mainframe interface softwares I can't

08:00.760 --> 08:06.600
remember now yeah let's talk about cloud cloud services and what what's been

08:06.600 --> 08:12.320
deployed Ubuntu has been deployed all over the place I think I think Amazon

08:12.320 --> 08:15.920
would never own that I don't think Amazon would ever let Microsoft take

08:15.920 --> 08:19.880
Ubuntu away there's too much ec2 running on top of Ubuntu there's too many other

08:19.880 --> 08:26.560
services running on that point they will just point I don't I think if

08:26.560 --> 08:28.960
Microsoft was gonna ever buy a Linux distribution I think it's got to be

08:28.960 --> 08:32.800
Novell because they've got all right I mean it's got to be it's got to be open

08:32.800 --> 08:36.400
it's got to be Sousa because they have all those deals from the Novell era yeah

08:36.400 --> 08:38.920
it seems like that would be the natural fit you know and I don't think they'd

08:38.920 --> 08:42.320
ever buy a Linux distribution I don't think they'd ever buy it I think it's

08:42.320 --> 08:45.480
they would basically do what they do with a lot of things and it's a kind of

08:45.480 --> 08:49.400
a Disney Star Wars kind of scenario to where you start off by infusing capital

08:49.400 --> 08:52.360
into something I could see that being maybe you know what I would see it as is

08:52.360 --> 08:56.040
I would see it as a custom distro built to run on Azure it'd be like the Azure

08:56.040 --> 09:00.040
Linux it'd be like the Azure Linux reference platform or something and it

09:00.040 --> 09:04.800
would be like Linux as an API on to Azure like abstract yourself away from

09:04.800 --> 09:08.920
all of the challenges of Linux and we'll have a managed Linux system for you on

09:08.920 --> 09:11.560
Azure and that and then eventually you'll be able to spin that up on a

09:11.560 --> 09:15.240
Hyper-V server on your own local LAN when they when they make the on-premises

09:15.240 --> 09:19.920
version Chris you're kind of we're doing it in your jokey voice I don't think it's

09:19.920 --> 09:25.200
I don't like after kind of following them recently and thinking about it from

09:25.200 --> 09:30.000
this point of view I don't think it'd be all that crazy if they did play somehow

09:30.000 --> 09:34.800
with Azure in the Linux game and if that's a purchase or if that's just a

09:34.800 --> 09:39.840
really close partnership with somebody I wouldn't well I mean they're gonna they

09:39.840 --> 09:42.960
have the Azure stats they were gonna I mean maybe if anybody in the chat room

09:42.960 --> 09:45.680
has a link maybe Microsoft publishes it but I think they have a pretty

09:45.680 --> 09:49.840
respectable amount of Linux instances running on Azure right now so they're

09:49.840 --> 09:52.160
gonna watch that you know and they're gonna know how many of those are Ubuntu

09:52.160 --> 09:55.440
kernels how many of those are Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernels are sent to us

09:55.440 --> 09:58.080
or whatever the hell Microsoft offers and they're gonna be watching those

09:58.080 --> 10:01.200
numbers and you know they've got to be thinking well geez I don't really want

10:01.200 --> 10:06.000
to make Azure a platform to make Ubuntu a more dominant cloud platform I mean

10:06.000 --> 10:09.560
that's got to be on their mind right that's exactly where I was coming from I

10:09.560 --> 10:13.680
saw some stats I'm not sure they were the final stats or anything but they had

10:13.680 --> 10:20.400
a ton of Linux you know installations and I have to think that the decision

10:20.400 --> 10:24.600
makers see that and they're like well I don't know that we're gonna unseat this

10:24.600 --> 10:29.880
with Windows so that's where my speculation comes from and so I thought I

10:29.880 --> 10:32.880
would just have that conversation with you because I think it's an interesting

10:32.880 --> 10:39.640
one to have yeah good point and you know if it ever happens somebody will find

10:39.640 --> 10:55.200
this clip up from episode 87 and to be like wow Ryan totally called it welcome

10:55.200 --> 10:59.120
to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's speed testing all of the

10:59.120 --> 11:03.720
mirrors like a maniac my name is Chris and my name is Matt hey there Matt you

11:03.720 --> 11:06.920
know it's the first thing I got to do after I get a new installation is I get

11:06.920 --> 11:11.040
the reflector package installed and then I go test all of the mirrors and I got

11:11.040 --> 11:14.600
to make sure that I gotta be sure I'm getting the best speed possible right

11:14.600 --> 11:17.920
and of course all I for all I know it's like random look at the draw that night

11:17.920 --> 11:20.400
that's what the routes happen to work out and I got a good connection I could

11:20.400 --> 11:23.880
be getting like a horrible server for all I know but I feel like I feel like

11:23.880 --> 11:27.920
if I if I do if I make that as my first maneuver after a fresh install then I'm

11:27.920 --> 11:31.320
setting myself up for the best speed for all the rest of the packages I have to

11:31.320 --> 11:35.240
pull down well I think it also sets a tone for how the rest of your

11:35.240 --> 11:38.360
experience is gonna end up I am optimizing for performance man

11:38.360 --> 11:42.280
absolutely so yeah this week on the Linux Unplugged show after we get

11:42.280 --> 11:44.740
through some follow-up for some very interesting stories that actually

11:44.740 --> 11:48.360
managed to break between Sunday and Tuesday that are relevant to things and

11:48.360 --> 11:51.000
topics we have followed up on and covered on this show for a long time

11:51.000 --> 11:54.980
we'll cover those are real quick plus a real quick Linux fest Northwest update

11:54.980 --> 11:59.600
coming up and then the new Dell XPS 13 developer edition the version that of a

11:59.600 --> 12:03.560
laptop that I bought but is actually targeted for Linux users we'll tell you

12:03.560 --> 12:06.400
about that and maybe what's the difference and sort of something they've

12:06.400 --> 12:10.400
done differently and why us US purchasers are going to be a little

12:10.400 --> 12:14.720
jelly so that'll be coming up and then later in the show I'll talk about my

12:14.720 --> 12:19.400
number one boo my baby my bae I think that's actually what the kids say now

12:19.400 --> 12:25.160
it's my Linux rig my number one office workstation died over the weekend and if

12:25.160 --> 12:29.400
I have gotten bit by a bug that a lot of you could get bit by if you are

12:29.400 --> 12:34.160
upgrading to kernel 3.19 and you use you use butter fs so tell you about that

12:34.160 --> 12:37.680
coming up in the show and get everybody's input on what I should do on

12:37.680 --> 12:40.440
a fresh install because I'm kind of curious I'm going totally different file

12:40.440 --> 12:45.040
systems totally different hard drive setup different software stack it's to

12:45.040 --> 12:47.960
some degree so tell you about what I've done so far and what some of the great

12:47.960 --> 12:51.160
advice I've gotten some of the packages that I've loved people have submitted to

12:51.160 --> 12:55.520
our subreddit that I should install so all of that will be coming up including

12:55.520 --> 12:58.400
the case for my new file system which I think you guys may be interested in and

12:58.400 --> 13:02.880
then on the latter half of the show a couple of guys from don't call it the

13:02.880 --> 13:07.960
evolve OS project no no call it soloist solace well I'll get the actual

13:07.960 --> 13:12.440
pronunciation from them coming up in a little bit that's right the very distro

13:12.440 --> 13:16.080
we talked about last week ran into some troubles and it was no April Fool's at

13:16.080 --> 13:19.840
least I don't think and they've had to rename their project and rename their

13:19.840 --> 13:23.440
community and we'll get the straight skinny on them and what happens when a

13:23.440 --> 13:29.400
little distro gets the hard legal hard hand of the law the legal strong arm

13:29.400 --> 13:34.120
whatever the hell that is so it's a big this is an each this is I know you call

13:34.120 --> 13:37.240
this unplugged Matt this feels pretty plugged but that it feels quite plugged

13:37.240 --> 13:44.560
it also feels like they got almost got plugged yeah really that's a good one

13:44.560 --> 13:47.800
Matt I just want to cover a couple of really quick follow-up stories before we

13:47.800 --> 13:53.760
jump into some of the topics on this Sunday's Linux action show we got to see

13:53.760 --> 13:58.880
Noah go behind the scenes on some of his client calls and resolve some wireless

13:58.880 --> 14:02.800
issues and all using Linux and supporting Linux in these businesses and

14:02.800 --> 14:07.600
go figure of course timing had to be the way it is I one of the software's

14:07.600 --> 14:12.440
packages that we featured in there for managing the Wi-Fi ubiquity has come out

14:12.440 --> 14:17.080
and getting in with getting in trouble for GPL violation this is a post over at

14:17.080 --> 14:21.360
Liberty BSD net and there we go get a nice frame for you guys in the video

14:21.360 --> 14:25.160
version and they've they've identified a couple of different ways that they

14:25.160 --> 14:28.720
appear to be maybe even willfully of violating the GPL I haven't totally

14:28.720 --> 14:31.160
looked into this yet but I just want to give you a disclaimer as a piece of

14:31.160 --> 14:35.360
software we did mention in the show yesterday there has been a bit of hoopla

14:35.360 --> 14:39.080
that came up as a result and so I want to make the audience aware for it and

14:39.080 --> 14:41.840
all the links of that in the show notes if if you saw ubiquity which looked

14:41.840 --> 14:46.600
pretty awesome and Matt I don't know if you caught the the piece that Noah did

14:46.600 --> 14:51.560
but in there he's using ubiquity to essentially I believe centrally manage a

14:51.560 --> 14:56.320
bunch of Wi-Fi access points and create one flat Wi-Fi network where access

14:56.320 --> 14:59.160
points are distributed throughout a hotel building but it's all one

14:59.160 --> 15:02.480
continuous network so people can move around and they automatically can

15:02.480 --> 15:07.200
provision each other and and and and increase and decrease signal strength so

15:07.200 --> 15:11.880
there's not too much overlap and wow yeah it's it's a pretty amazing piece of

15:11.880 --> 15:17.840
software but it seems to keep falling into problems so actually it looks like

15:17.840 --> 15:21.840
vertinda has used this before so let's bring in the mumble room hey mumble room

15:21.840 --> 15:28.200
time of probes greetings and welcome to Linux unplugged hey guys so let's start

15:28.200 --> 15:32.480
with vert there so vert you've used this before and no we're not talking about

15:32.480 --> 15:38.120
the Ubuntu installer are we vert that was your cue man you said you had

15:38.120 --> 15:43.440
something to say yeah no I've used before in a private school with a friend

15:43.440 --> 15:47.480
of mine who's the IT manager and the cool thing about ubiquity apart from the

15:47.480 --> 15:52.800
price and reliability of it is it does have this really quite nice

15:52.800 --> 15:56.920
management consoles that's available for Windows and for Linux that gives you

15:56.920 --> 16:02.360
things like you know one-click deployment and automatic configuration

16:02.360 --> 16:05.560
and stuff like that the only thing that I was a little bit concerned about

16:05.560 --> 16:08.920
though is how it does this because the only way can possibly do it out of the

16:08.920 --> 16:12.840
box when you take one of these new devices you put it on the network is it

16:12.840 --> 16:17.920
must have some sort of SSH key that the server uses to log into whichever

16:17.920 --> 16:21.600
device it finds to be able to configure it properly because it seems to

16:21.600 --> 16:24.680
automatically do that Carol without any kind of authentication I wonder if it

16:24.680 --> 16:30.400
just is it is it not just like a boot like a DHCP boot thing where it like

16:30.400 --> 16:34.240
boots up off the network and it gets a firmware from the from the central

16:34.240 --> 16:39.360
control machine and no because it can be what it can be activating the K on a

16:39.360 --> 16:43.480
closed network I once far walled out from the outside oh interesting this is

16:43.480 --> 16:46.880
the way this is the weird thing about it so I suspect okay and I was gonna put a

16:46.880 --> 16:49.960
wire shark monitor on it but we were pressed for time when we installed me

16:49.960 --> 16:53.920
stuff I suspect Carol they uses something like a secure sugar shell key

16:53.920 --> 16:57.600
to log into the device care I'd configure it or to get some sort

16:57.600 --> 17:02.140
configuration information that pulls them from the server well I suppose we

17:02.140 --> 17:05.720
probably would have the answer just out there in the audience so if anybody out

17:05.720 --> 17:09.440
there in the audience knows and wants to follow up with us so we'd be curious how

17:09.440 --> 17:11.920
do they do that how do they do that provision even when it's behind a

17:11.920 --> 17:17.280
firewall that's a good question I got one more follow-up story and this one's

17:17.280 --> 17:21.560
definitely a show me the money we've talked about core OS and I think it's a

17:21.560 --> 17:25.080
pretty cool project and they're getting even more money now core OS has raised

17:25.080 --> 17:30.040
12 million dollars what the core what distribution is probably the dollars

17:30.040 --> 17:34.840
that's pretty respectable yeah they now 12 million dollars around a funding as

17:34.840 --> 17:39.280
well as a new product called tectonic that is based on Google's Cooper notes I

17:39.280 --> 17:41.880
don't know what that is sorry my sorry coop Kubernetes what's Cooper Knights

17:41.880 --> 17:45.240
guys you know what that is Kubernetes what is it guys how come I don't know

17:45.240 --> 17:54.080
about it nobody knows okay it's apparently an open source project for

17:54.080 --> 17:57.200
container orchestration but I have no idea like if it's like I guess must work

17:57.200 --> 18:00.440
with like different work containers I guess I don't know sounds like marketing

18:00.440 --> 18:03.360
speak yeah I'm sure it's like it manages all the different container tech and

18:03.360 --> 18:05.800
everybody's got to make their own container orchestration system and of

18:05.800 --> 18:11.160
course Google's got to make their own core OS is now sitting at a total of 20

18:11.160 --> 18:18.200
million in funding it doesn't surprise me at all actually considering that

18:18.200 --> 18:22.520
Greg is participating in that project he's just you know the stable release

18:22.520 --> 18:26.960
kernel maintainer anyone wants to jump on that yeah yeah they got they got

18:26.960 --> 18:30.520
great people behind it they have a pretty clear idea and they've actually

18:30.520 --> 18:34.120
got a pretty important problem they're trying to solve to Oh Cooper Nets dot IO

18:34.120 --> 18:38.640
thank you uh okay well I'm gonna take a look at that right now you know that's

18:38.640 --> 18:41.560
what I love about having a frickin chairman how cool is this thank you

18:41.560 --> 18:46.480
Micah 89 I will definitely read up on this so manage a cluster of Linux

18:46.480 --> 18:49.800
containers as a single system to accelerate dev and simplify ops oh boy

18:49.800 --> 18:54.280
doesn't that feel good mmm let's do it again manage a cluster of

18:54.280 --> 18:58.360
Linux containers as a single system to accelerate dev and simplify ops oh that's

18:58.360 --> 19:03.760
good good job dude that's really nice so yeah I'll check that out after the show

19:03.760 --> 19:07.920
thanks very much I'll try to put a link to that in the show notes too huh well

19:07.920 --> 19:13.400
you know good for core OS and I wonder if it puts any heat on Docker because

19:13.400 --> 19:17.240
that remember core OS is working on rocket and some things it's kind are a

19:17.240 --> 19:20.960
bit competitive with the Docker group so in a way it's sort of also kind of

19:20.960 --> 19:25.800
helping seed some some competitive competition to the Docker guys oh there's

19:25.800 --> 19:33.280
one thing for unless Docker guys screw it up they have the market first thing

19:33.280 --> 19:38.640
and they already have the this initial work to get it actually working on

19:38.640 --> 19:43.600
Windows and Mac and that is an appealing thing for a lot of people yeah I totally

19:43.600 --> 19:46.280
agree about I totally agree with you on their docker's already got the market

19:46.280 --> 19:48.760
they've already got sort of the industrial support they've ever got red

19:48.760 --> 19:52.180
hat behind them they've got Microsoft behind them they've got the staffing the

19:52.180 --> 19:59.440
funding but that doesn't mean there isn't room for an alternative and and if

19:59.440 --> 20:02.640
you think about it from like from the standpoint of some of these big

20:02.640 --> 20:07.360
infrastructure shops you're definitely gonna want some competition out there

20:07.360 --> 20:13.480
definitely I wouldn't like if the doctor was completely overwhelmingly the choice

20:13.480 --> 20:17.320
because then you know they would kind of corner the market and they would

20:17.320 --> 20:20.680
control it right and you know you're not saying that they would do anything wrong

20:20.680 --> 20:25.880
but you know you know well well Ryan you have Ryan you have concerns about

20:25.880 --> 20:32.440
Docker right yeah the apparently just the way docker's built there there are

20:32.440 --> 20:36.940
quite a few innate security vulnerability which I think in their

20:36.940 --> 20:42.280
defense they're trying to address but rocket thinks it can it can really beat

20:42.280 --> 20:47.720
out docker there and and rocket is the container technology that core OS is

20:47.720 --> 20:51.760
working on and then I think they can make the best case to enterprises saying

20:51.760 --> 20:56.480
we're way more secure than this is way more secure than docker and so if you're

20:56.480 --> 21:01.400
gonna trust somebody trust us and that's really where they where somebody needs

21:01.400 --> 21:05.520
to win is in the enterprise yeah space I wonder if we don't think I'll go ahead

21:05.520 --> 21:10.240
so I'm sorry but I see what I see is that what is the market value

21:10.240 --> 21:15.440
proposition of you know core OS and rocket versus Docker is that includes a

21:15.440 --> 21:19.140
lot of kernel maintainers and so if there is a need to change in the kernel

21:19.140 --> 21:22.880
it's easier done through that project interesting doctor that is a nice

21:22.880 --> 21:27.640
advantage then yes that's I think that's them the market proposition that they

21:27.640 --> 21:29.920
have

21:32.640 --> 21:37.320
ham you have some feedback so go ahead and I want you to mute your mic take it

21:37.320 --> 21:42.440
that's sorted out there thank you honestly doctor already has a market

21:42.440 --> 21:46.760
chair yeah and it already has a product that is working well and I I kind of go

21:46.760 --> 21:52.080
with the chat room is saying though docker has even if even if you know

21:52.080 --> 21:55.000
let's just pick a company like rack space let's say rack space decided we're

21:55.000 --> 21:59.040
gonna standardize on rocket and you can use docker if you want to roll your own

21:59.040 --> 22:01.840
system with you know different rack space options but you know they're gonna

22:01.840 --> 22:05.840
standardize on rocket but I I wouldn't be surprised maybe some big

22:05.840 --> 22:09.840
infrastructure companies go rocket and then when people are discussing

22:09.840 --> 22:14.520
standardizing software development when people are on redhat enterprise 7 but

22:14.520 --> 22:18.160
they need to develop for also redhat enterprise 5 when people need to

22:18.160 --> 22:21.960
distribute software across their network on Linux boxes of different diversions

22:21.960 --> 22:25.200
I think docker could play a pretty significant role there when people want

22:25.200 --> 22:28.720
to roll infrastructure on top of these containers I think rocket might play a

22:28.720 --> 22:32.480
more significant role there potentially maybe that'll happen yeah it shakes out

22:32.480 --> 22:36.640
here's the other thing I'm not a hundred percent sure and I haven't inspected

22:36.640 --> 22:40.640
myself like I did with docker on how actually rocket implement certain

22:40.640 --> 22:45.000
measures but docker does have these thing that the distribution scene still

22:45.000 --> 22:50.320
plays a role right you still have the ubuntu docker and you still have the

22:50.320 --> 22:55.680
fedora docker container what happens to the distribution if rocket decides to go

22:55.680 --> 23:00.120
the other way not sure maybe then the distribution can let matters last and if

23:00.120 --> 23:05.960
your point of sale is you know bringing these experience together you want to

23:05.960 --> 23:14.760
promote that environment let me tell you why why it's important in any respect is

23:14.760 --> 23:23.720
for instance we here where I work run most of the websites and in her

23:23.720 --> 23:28.840
libraries in Kansas so unless they're a really big library they host a website

23:28.840 --> 23:34.720
with us and the problem has become that everybody wants to run something

23:34.720 --> 23:39.960
different some people want WordPress on Drupal some people want to run you know

23:39.960 --> 23:43.920
random stuff over here and they require different versions of PHP or they require

23:43.920 --> 23:47.800
different stacks and Ruby versions of everything and then they want web apps

23:47.800 --> 23:52.480
they're like can't we offer genealogy web apps can't we offer it etc etc and

23:52.480 --> 23:58.080
so what we're having to do is instead of spinning up a new VM every single time

23:58.080 --> 24:03.000
somebody wants you know some new web application spun up at all of these

24:03.000 --> 24:09.000
libraries instead I just use you know some hosts or core OS at the moment and

24:09.000 --> 24:13.560
then I sped up whatever you know container is on that I give that to them

24:13.560 --> 24:20.440
I say yours do what you want with it you know and if if you break it it's yours

24:20.440 --> 24:25.440
you know absolutely but when you look at how many developers are developing

24:25.440 --> 24:30.600
are getting something it's easier to at least at this moment and from what I've

24:30.600 --> 24:36.120
seen for more people are targeting Docker now these may be wrong these may

24:36.120 --> 24:41.000
be just a misinterpretation of no I think it's pretty clear and I think it

24:41.000 --> 24:43.280
will probably remain like that for a while all right well that's probably

24:43.280 --> 24:46.160
enough container discussion for one episode I know half the audience probably

24:46.160 --> 24:49.400
doesn't give a crap about containers the other half does and so hopefully we've

24:49.400 --> 24:54.360
entertained at least one half but I find it to be obvious that the Linux

24:54.360 --> 24:58.720
container space for some reason is on fire even though BSD's and Solaris have

24:58.720 --> 25:05.720
had it for a long time just goes to show you doesn't matter I don't know what it

25:05.720 --> 25:09.320
is like they just like they don't get the traction like the people just don't

25:09.320 --> 25:12.120
care but Linux does it all of a sudden it's a huge deal it's a multi-million

25:12.120 --> 25:15.360
dollar industry and you've got multiple different companies now that are getting

25:15.360 --> 25:21.960
multi-million dollar fundings and inspiring weak as a GP yeah maybe

25:21.960 --> 25:25.840
because maybe because of the GPL I don't know maybe it's been it's very

25:25.840 --> 25:32.760
interesting because I know the BSD guys are going like hello this lairs guys

25:32.760 --> 25:36.720
like yeah well we had zones back in the 90s back when you guys were learning

25:36.720 --> 25:41.560
arithmetic we were putting stuff up in zones so I don't know I think it's just

25:41.560 --> 25:45.660
I think it's just the fact that Linux has the traction it's sort of like

25:45.660 --> 25:50.520
Linux has the market advantage Linux is the cloud OS for the world yeah Docker

25:50.520 --> 25:53.960
hub doesn't hurt either right that makes a big difference you're right and you

25:53.960 --> 25:58.400
know I will add and this I think is I think Docker proves to us how critical

25:58.400 --> 26:03.400
and now rocket to but Docker starts to talk Docker proves to us how critical

26:03.400 --> 26:08.200
closing that 10% gap is taking what can be set up by an admin with comp files

26:08.200 --> 26:14.360
and some kernel features and closing that uncanny valley to where it is

26:14.360 --> 26:19.280
automated and I'm checking things in and out sort of git style and I can I you

26:19.280 --> 26:23.960
know it has an API I can write to and a community around it and a company all of

26:23.960 --> 26:28.560
those things are fundamentally important to market adoption and I believe that is

26:28.560 --> 26:32.800
why the BSD's never closed the gap they never got excitement because there was

26:32.800 --> 26:37.720
just that 10% and that is so often in open source where we get we get almost

26:37.720 --> 26:42.560
all the way there 90% we all of us in the community we see the beauty of it

26:42.560 --> 26:45.800
and we'll put it in production I'll be in production for years look at look at

26:45.800 --> 26:49.120
jails in production for you Jupiter broadcasting comm has been running in a

26:49.120 --> 26:53.040
BSD jail for like three years now right I mean it has been a thing in production

26:53.040 --> 26:57.160
for a long time nobody gives a crap because honestly they didn't close the

26:57.160 --> 27:00.840
10% I think that makes the difference in my that's my suspect and we can

27:00.840 --> 27:04.760
obviously SS GPL yes it's Linux yes it's the market adoption of Linux all of

27:04.760 --> 27:08.760
these are core components but making it something that I could I mean just as an

27:08.760 --> 27:14.100
example I've never demonstrated setting up a jail or a Linux container you know

27:14.100 --> 27:18.520
I've never shown you the power of LXC on the Linux action show before but when

27:18.520 --> 27:22.560
Docker was a brand new spankin thing one of the first things we did is I sat down

27:22.560 --> 27:26.440
with my arch box and I set up an Ubuntu environment in my arch box and I was

27:26.440 --> 27:30.120
like check this out and I do it by doing this and then I issue this command and

27:30.120 --> 27:32.920
it starts the environment and I issue this command and it starts an

27:32.920 --> 27:38.440
application in that environment and it thinks it's on an Ubuntu box box and I

27:38.440 --> 27:42.320
that was that was impressive because you could wrap your brain around it it was

27:42.320 --> 27:46.160
productizable and that made the difference and I think now here we are

27:46.160 --> 27:52.320
a couple of years later and these guys are making millions of dollars so

27:52.320 --> 27:55.240
basically you're saying that it's a matter of being presentable option a

27:55.240 --> 27:59.480
option B which one is presentable to a VC closing that gap right well what

27:59.480 --> 28:05.200
making it usable making it usable by more people but by closing that gap they

28:05.200 --> 28:09.480
they they they broke through several layers of markets right they went

28:09.480 --> 28:12.440
through the hot they've they broke through the very high-end sysadmin to

28:12.440 --> 28:16.400
your average system sysadmin even your own freaking enthusiasts to your

28:16.400 --> 28:19.600
employee who works at Red Hat who's not even really all that he's a sales guy

28:19.600 --> 28:23.640
but he knows he's got to use Red Hat so he used now he's using Docker to your

28:23.640 --> 28:26.920
developer level right and you broke through all of these different markets

28:26.920 --> 28:30.600
when you made it that much easier and that was what it took but that's the

28:30.600 --> 28:36.720
hardest part is that final 10% well and 90% of sales is presentation boom

28:36.720 --> 28:41.560
all right well before we go too far actually this would be a good spot to

28:41.560 --> 28:45.240
mention DigitalOcean you know they'll take they use the hell out of Docker and

28:45.240 --> 28:48.600
also CoreOS in fact they work directly with the CoreOS project they I guess

28:48.600 --> 28:53.640
CoreOS provides these official channels to platform providers like DigitalOcean

28:53.640 --> 28:56.120
I mean I might be getting some of the terminology wrong this is kind of my

28:56.120 --> 29:00.360
rough understanding is they have these different channels and so DigitalOcean

29:00.360 --> 29:04.040
is like they get it straight from the tap they get it right from the tap core

29:04.040 --> 29:07.760
from the CoreOS project and then what's beautiful about the CoreOS design is

29:07.760 --> 29:10.720
obviously you continue to roll the base OS keep the applications in a container

29:10.720 --> 29:13.560
Bob's your uncle you're not even worrying about your application breaking

29:13.560 --> 29:15.920
meanwhile your security updates are getting applied it's a beautiful thing

29:15.920 --> 29:18.640
now let me tell you a little about DigitalOcean sponsor of the Linux

29:18.640 --> 29:21.680
unplugged program because I want you to go over there and try them it's really

29:21.680 --> 29:25.960
awesome they're all based on Linux using KVM for the virtualizer SSDs for the IO

29:25.960 --> 29:29.680
so you have super fast IO tier 1 bandwidth the data centers all over the

29:29.680 --> 29:33.000
world that's DigitalOcean in a snapshot but what's really important is the value

29:33.000 --> 29:37.840
it's it's crazy so keep two things in mind as we go forward all Linux powered

29:37.840 --> 29:42.640
SSD power right boom that's hot and actually here's a third thing we can get

29:42.640 --> 29:45.600
you two months for free with DO unplugged so I guess keep three things

29:45.600 --> 29:48.640
in mind do unplugged too so what is DigitalOcean they're a simple cloud

29:48.640 --> 29:51.680
hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you

29:51.680 --> 29:54.480
to spin up your own cloud server that you're gonna get root access with an

29:54.480 --> 29:59.360
HTML 5 console you're gonna be able to start in less than 55 seconds seriously

29:59.360 --> 30:02.520
and pricing plans are only five dollars a month that's your starting price

30:02.520 --> 30:08.440
they get you 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of

30:08.440 --> 30:11.320
transfer and their pricing plans are really logical they just step up from

30:11.320 --> 30:14.800
there really simple and they have data centers in New York San Francisco

30:14.800 --> 30:17.760
Singapore Amsterdam and London you just get to pick from them they're gorgeous

30:17.760 --> 30:21.680
but it's really the DigitalOcean interface this is this is the this is

30:21.680 --> 30:25.640
the final piece I was just talking about closing that 10% this is did this is the

30:25.640 --> 30:30.000
same exact thing right they recognize that KVM is incredible and that Linux is

30:30.000 --> 30:34.120
a great platform to build a business on top of okay that's not that's not very

30:34.120 --> 30:37.360
much of a surprise to anybody listening to this show that's kind of obvious they

30:37.360 --> 30:41.320
recognize that incredibly fast data center connections are gonna be key to a

30:41.320 --> 30:44.720
finicky audience okay a little bit more insight required there but not too

30:44.720 --> 30:47.560
surprising that's pretty good I'll give them credit though for making sure they

30:47.560 --> 30:50.720
got that part right but the part that they really figured out is you can have

30:50.720 --> 30:54.320
all of those things but if you don't make it insanely easy to do it and also

30:54.320 --> 30:58.120
very accessible so they've made a very straightforward API in fact they just

30:58.120 --> 31:01.800
launched version 2.0 of their API and they give you access to everything you

31:01.800 --> 31:04.000
can do in the control panel the community's already done a ton of stuff

31:04.000 --> 31:06.640
around this API so you can just take advantage of it if you're just like a

31:06.640 --> 31:10.520
lazy schmo like I am I'm not gonna write anything to the API I don't need to but

31:10.520 --> 31:13.320
this is where they closed the gap they took the Linux technology they took

31:13.320 --> 31:16.000
SSDs they took those incredible data centers and they wrapped it all together

31:16.000 --> 31:20.280
in this amazing intuitive control panel and you can replicate this control panel

31:20.280 --> 31:22.880
with that API so you've never even wanted to use it you could just plug it

31:22.880 --> 31:25.300
into your existing management infrastructure or just write bash

31:25.300 --> 31:28.040
scripts all day long I hear from people they just integrated into the

31:28.040 --> 31:32.040
prescripts before they run a system upgrade so that way they have the API

31:32.040 --> 31:36.920
execute a system snapshot and then the system snapshot completes and then it

31:36.920 --> 31:39.520
continues on with the package manager upgrade that's a pretty straightforward

31:39.520 --> 31:42.280
update and this isn't taking like 15 minutes to put together in the scripts

31:42.280 --> 31:45.000
available in the digital ocean community you can go read all about it go over to

31:45.000 --> 31:47.560
digital ocean comm and on top of all of that they've got some of the best

31:47.560 --> 31:50.640
tutorials in the industry they've hired editing staff to make sure they're

31:50.640 --> 31:54.760
top-notch so you can really get a lot of value out of your droplet do unplug go

31:54.760 --> 31:58.640
use that get a $10 credit try out digital ocean two months for free digital

31:58.640 --> 32:02.360
ocean comm big thanks digital ocean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program

32:02.360 --> 32:08.680
you guys mm-hmm oh I know it Matt oh I know it so I have been waiting for a

32:08.680 --> 32:13.600
long time to see the final version of the Dell XPS 13 developer edition as

32:13.600 --> 32:19.480
they call it drop because I had made a I took a big big risk and I ordered the

32:19.480 --> 32:23.200
Windows Edition which I normally would never condone because I hate buying a

32:23.200 --> 32:27.280
Windows license sure but I wanted to get on it early so that way by the time this

32:27.280 --> 32:32.800
laptop had hit for the Linux users I would hopefully have a good amount of

32:32.800 --> 32:37.960
time using this as a you know machine that I spend you know at least half my

32:37.960 --> 32:41.580
day on something you know I can have a pretty substantial opinion on it as a

32:41.580 --> 32:46.320
machine and of course that the first the first flaw the first wall I hit was the

32:46.320 --> 32:49.720
Wi-Fi I just about to say your first thing you do is yank out the broad com

32:49.720 --> 32:53.400
something I don't know I don't know what it was I don't it was like Dell branded

32:53.400 --> 32:57.840
I don't even know what it was really you know it's probably right yeah and I

32:57.840 --> 33:01.960
think there was like a way to make it work if I downloaded some anyways no man

33:01.960 --> 33:06.160
I just exactly I just ordered an Intel cuz it's PCI Express slots you just pop

33:06.160 --> 33:09.880
off the bottom and you know those little mini laptop PCI Express slots and I just

33:09.880 --> 33:13.880
popped off the bottom I put it an Intel 7000 series Wi-Fi in there which is a

33:13.880 --> 33:17.680
great chip and includes Bluetooth and all that kind of stuff so that was the

33:17.680 --> 33:20.800
main thing I ran into but what I really wanted to start to get my head around

33:20.800 --> 33:25.800
was how the hell does Linux do with high DPI displays because I think 2015 is a

33:25.800 --> 33:30.720
year of high DPI you got the a lot of the different high-end laptop lines are

33:30.720 --> 33:34.360
doing high DPI got some desktop lines are doing it Dell's got their 4k monitor

33:34.360 --> 33:38.000
it's gonna happen I guess LG's been talking about an 8k monitor they're

33:38.000 --> 33:43.840
getting into manufacturing now 8k so I really wanted to know how the XPS held

33:43.840 --> 33:47.440
up and the prices are out it's available right now in the UK it'll be

33:47.440 --> 33:55.040
available next week in the US damn it oh enjoy guys so it starts at 949 for the

33:55.040 --> 33:59.240
base price nine hundred forty nine dollars US you get an i5 and then it

33:59.240 --> 34:04.360
works its way all the way up to 1849 then you get a nice seven three

34:04.360 --> 34:09.440
gigahertz 13.3 inch which is edge to edge display it's pretty nice they call

34:09.440 --> 34:13.560
it the infinity display 512 gigabyte solid display Intel graphics it's the

34:13.560 --> 34:18.060
550 so it's pretty good that graphics I can about here I so I can tell you so if

34:18.060 --> 34:23.120
you're interested in getting this laptop this ships with a buntu 1404 I'll tell

34:23.120 --> 34:26.200
you this a couple of things it is definitely the best display I've ever

34:26.200 --> 34:30.960
seen on a laptop it's sort of amazing a few weeks into it now I've I've just

34:30.960 --> 34:35.080
stopped kind of being like holy god this thing's incredible but for the first few

34:35.080 --> 34:40.080
weeks I was like this looks like a picture like a painting is sitting in my

34:40.080 --> 34:46.260
screen yeah it was really wow you know Linux is definitely not ready for high

34:46.260 --> 34:52.440
dpi X seems to struggle with it a lot of applications don't look right in there

34:52.440 --> 34:55.280
or they have some tweaking that needs to be done in my opinion gnome 3 does the

34:55.280 --> 34:59.200
best job right now I haven't tried unity a lot too but the unity seems to be from

34:59.200 --> 35:02.320
from the discussions I have had with had with the audience unity you know you go

35:02.320 --> 35:05.000
in there has a dpi slider and it seems that seems to work pretty well for a lot

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
of people so I bet 1404 will look fine on it your applications will look tiny

35:10.000 --> 35:12.880
though see that was my question it's like it's like you could have the

35:12.880 --> 35:16.160
desktop environments just nailed down to a button and that's great but when you

35:16.160 --> 35:18.400
bring in an application that's incompatible just kind of feels like it

35:18.400 --> 35:21.280
defeats the purpose I don't know yeah you can't put more than eight gigs of

35:21.280 --> 35:26.060
RAM in it either so here's the other thing Matt well so yeah you know cuz

35:26.060 --> 35:31.480
everything's getting scaled up to such a high resolution that your computer ends

35:31.480 --> 35:35.120
up working pretty hard so normally something that wouldn't really tax a

35:35.120 --> 35:39.880
taxing machine of this level of power ends up being a little more work than it

35:39.880 --> 35:44.440
should be so like playing a if you play a video like a YouTube video or something

35:44.440 --> 35:48.240
like that your fans kick on you if you have a lot of text scrolling across the

35:48.240 --> 35:54.200
screen and you know your fans kick on so it definitely is powerful enough for the

35:54.200 --> 35:58.480
whole desktop environment to feel very accelerated and the performance wise the

35:58.480 --> 36:02.440
desktop environment works well I've been able to play some games okay if I hook

36:02.440 --> 36:06.680
up a second monitor I can't play any games no game I'm sure some games like

36:06.680 --> 36:10.400
torchlight to play just fine I've even been able to play Borderlands the

36:10.400 --> 36:14.540
pre-sequel on it actually fairly successfully at full resolution with

36:14.540 --> 36:18.800
things turned down but yeah I think I think it's a very good laptop I think

36:18.800 --> 36:23.240
it's well built I don't I still don't fully know if I would go with Dell I has

36:23.240 --> 36:27.000
unfortunately for me a few drawbacks that I haven't been able to fully

36:27.000 --> 36:31.400
resolve on my model I don't know about the developer edition for me the sound

36:31.400 --> 36:34.960
is not currently working I believe there is a way to fix that I would suspect

36:34.960 --> 36:38.920
it's based on some grub flags and things like that maybe black listen a module I

36:38.920 --> 36:43.240
would bet right there are two addition already has that done so it might be if

36:43.240 --> 36:48.680
you were yeah so if you're gonna wipe this it might undo that you could go

36:48.680 --> 36:51.600
make that modification yourself so like right now my sound doesn't work I don't

36:51.600 --> 36:55.480
really care because I use a USB sound card for anything I do seriously so I

36:55.480 --> 37:00.000
haven't fixed that so that's one thing to consider and also the trackpad you

37:00.000 --> 37:04.200
can make again adjustments but the trackpad is not awesome I don't I just

37:04.200 --> 37:06.400
don't like the way it feels I don't like the way it clicks I don't really like

37:06.400 --> 37:12.160
the size of it it's just a little bit too small and every now and then I just

37:12.160 --> 37:16.280
like it it senses a touch when my hand is maybe it hasn't touched it but it's

37:16.280 --> 37:19.680
hovering too close to the trackpad like when I'm typing and I hate that it

37:19.680 --> 37:23.400
causes me to mess up constantly and all of the extensions I have had tried to

37:23.400 --> 37:27.000
turn off the trackpad don't actually turn off the trackpad I used to have a

37:27.000 --> 37:30.760
touch pad script and it's literally just a bash script you run that actually

37:30.760 --> 37:34.280
might help with that yeah maybe that'd be cool yeah send it to me if you have

37:34.280 --> 37:41.000
that what was that puppy um Barton's put on his blog post that the a01 BIOS makes

37:41.000 --> 37:45.520
the trackpad a lot better ah I should totally do a BIOS update huh thank you

37:45.520 --> 37:49.200
good tip you know what I'll tell you a couple of things the battery life is

37:49.200 --> 37:54.800
pretty good I think I get about seven hours or so they say 15 hours I think

37:54.800 --> 37:58.960
something like that on their website they give you some real bullshit number

37:58.960 --> 38:05.200
it feels lighter than 2.8 pounds is it dual core well it depends on which one

38:05.200 --> 38:11.120
you get right because they has i5 up to i7 I think all of the i7s are still

38:11.120 --> 38:16.720
dual core though oh really oh I didn't know that they do have anyone that's

38:16.720 --> 38:22.640
branded as an HQ in the i7 is going to be a quad anything with the you yeah

38:22.640 --> 38:26.080
designation is going to be dual core there you go so and then it's for with

38:26.080 --> 38:31.720
hyper threading I guess okay yep yeah and and and the other thing I think is a

38:31.720 --> 38:34.840
little late a little weak is your solid you're set at your your hard set at 8

38:34.840 --> 38:39.480
gigabytes of RAM which is oh that's kind of I mean I guess for okay for Joe

38:39.480 --> 38:41.840
average that's fine but it's still limiting because you don't know where

38:41.840 --> 38:45.480
you're gonna be a couple years down the road maybe you need more yeah yeah yeah

38:45.480 --> 38:50.560
and poppy so how does how does the whole sp1 thing work with Ubuntu I I think of

38:50.560 --> 38:54.640
it as I think that's just that's just 1404 point one it's the point release

38:54.640 --> 38:58.760
that we do that has the hardware enablement kernel and updated X or

38:58.760 --> 39:02.840
that's just Dell lingo for it then yeah it's just what they they've called

39:02.840 --> 39:11.520
confusing why confused yeah yeah mm-hmm anything about getting one it's back on

39:11.520 --> 39:15.800
my list of possible laptops now that my think pads gone out of warranty yeah

39:15.800 --> 39:20.160
and you are in like the like the corporate sanctioned purchase window

39:20.160 --> 39:26.720
right yes yeah yeah once you've been economical three years you get a chunk of

39:26.720 --> 39:30.920
change to again spend on whatever laptop you want and so that's on my list along

39:30.920 --> 39:34.760
with the X the think pad x1 carbon and a couple of others I just got an email

39:34.760 --> 39:44.240
over the weekend that I will be getting the libram rev2 soon yes shoe hey Matt

39:44.240 --> 39:49.080
Pope has a very interesting theory that he shared with me today during tech talk

39:49.080 --> 39:54.280
today have you noticed have you been to elementary.io have you seen this not

39:54.280 --> 39:58.440
actually I think it was just the other day I mean elementary.io has a countdown

39:58.440 --> 40:05.120
for three days 18 hours 17 minutes and 33 seconds as we record this show and

40:05.120 --> 40:10.040
people have been sort of guessing what they think it is some people think it

40:10.040 --> 40:15.760
could be a Freya release that would be my theory because I mean really what

40:15.760 --> 40:19.840
else would it be. Wimpy do you have any theories on on oh rotten you were gonna

40:19.840 --> 40:24.560
say something go ahead rotten I'll let you put it out there first. It just could be a new

40:24.560 --> 40:29.320
website okay new website okay Wimpy do you have a theory on what it could be

40:29.320 --> 40:34.480
no okay all right I just don't want cuz I think I'm just gonna guess it's RC1

40:34.480 --> 40:42.600
okay RC1 says Josh okay go ahead Wimpy nothing oh no I don't have a theory I

40:42.600 --> 40:47.000
have no idea. All right okay Popey go ahead you say it

40:47.000 --> 40:51.600
Popey you do it you go ahead Popey say what you think it is. So given that the

40:51.600 --> 40:57.800
Daniel for a recently left system 76 to focus on elementary full-time and

40:57.800 --> 41:01.360
bearing in mind that recently they landed something called captive login

41:01.360 --> 41:08.800
in elementary so that when you're in a cafe or hotel or airport or something

41:08.800 --> 41:11.040
it makes it easier for you to get through captive portal internet

41:11.040 --> 41:16.840
connections that makes me think that they're doing a hardware partnership for

41:16.840 --> 41:23.280
a laptop I think it's going to be a ultrabook style beautiful laptop

41:23.280 --> 41:28.800
pre-installed with elementary. I think that's totally it I think you nailed it

41:28.800 --> 41:33.280
when you mentioned that of course he you know formerly worked at system 76 now

41:33.280 --> 41:37.880
he's working there and you look at the good work that Wimpy's doing for the

41:37.880 --> 41:40.920
Ubuntu Mate project where they're gonna have some hardware hopefully soon

41:40.920 --> 41:44.640
and of course the Mint project has the hardware this is becoming a thing like

41:44.640 --> 41:47.440
Popey Popey you have been observing this for a little while and I think you're

41:47.440 --> 41:51.720
absolutely nailing it this is a thing and they in all of their promo shots

41:51.720 --> 41:54.920
they always have this very nice looking sort of is it a MacBook is it not a

41:54.920 --> 41:58.720
MacBook generic looking laptop I went a step further I thought wouldn't it be

41:58.720 --> 42:03.800
cool if the new Librem 13 was working with the elementary guys and it was

42:03.800 --> 42:07.200
gonna be like the exclusive way to get the Librem 13 like the 13 inch version

42:07.200 --> 42:15.640
of the Librem 15. I'm speculating this based on you know just guesswork and I

42:15.640 --> 42:21.880
think that yeah part of it is if he's left system 76 he's done so so that

42:21.880 --> 42:25.680
he's not you know he's not competing with them with his own company I think

42:25.680 --> 42:30.240
it would make sense for him to leave but I was even aware he worked at system 76

42:30.240 --> 42:35.480
I thought it was a Cassidy that worked there it is they both did yeah yeah and

42:35.480 --> 42:39.680
Cassidy is now working full-time for elementary OS right as of was that no I

42:39.680 --> 42:45.160
don't know that was Daniel yeah that was Daniel Cassidy still at system 7 yeah so

42:45.160 --> 42:49.540
who knows we'll have to wait a few days and see mm-hmm yes three days to be

42:49.540 --> 42:54.560
precise just leave the counter running I know right you know I don't think it's

42:54.560 --> 43:00.360
gonna be a go ahead you don't think it's gonna be

43:00.360 --> 43:05.160
hardware I don't think it's gonna be a Librem exclusive though no no it might

43:05.160 --> 43:10.320
be hardware but I don't think it will be Librem because they they've announced

43:10.320 --> 43:17.640
that they're going to ship with school yeah yeah I was just having fun cuz they

43:17.640 --> 43:23.280
have a whole new website on their beta dot elementary dot IO which could be it

43:23.280 --> 43:27.680
has a store page it's only for t-shirts and stickers at the moment it would be

43:27.680 --> 43:33.480
ideal to stick a laptop there or it could just be crowdfunded campaign for a

43:33.480 --> 43:37.080
laptop maybe maybe that would yeah or maybe they're just gonna update their

43:37.080 --> 43:48.600
website integrate their patreon you have to be careful because you burn some

43:48.600 --> 43:50.720
serious capital when you do these announcements and if it doesn't go

43:50.720 --> 43:55.480
anywhere yeah no doing it for a website is a mistake it's it's a 101 mistake

43:55.480 --> 43:59.640
it's no you don't know that'd be funny to follow up on that next week though

43:59.640 --> 44:05.760
so I yes the solid and continuous drum beat drum beat drum beat goes on for

44:05.760 --> 44:11.280
Linux fest Northwest 2015 April 25th and 26 Linux fest Northwest 2015 April 25th

44:11.280 --> 44:15.400
and 26 because I want to see that so that's why I keep talking about it I

44:15.400 --> 44:18.200
just have a really quick update I thank you to everybody who went to meetup.com

44:18.200 --> 44:22.160
slash Jupiter broadcasting we now have 77 people there I'm gonna declare the

44:22.160 --> 44:26.320
meetup officially a success and we're gonna keep it around in fact 79 of you

44:26.320 --> 44:30.200
now as I refresh the page have gone to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting and

44:30.200 --> 44:34.720
that's a good thing because guess what Linux unplugged if I'm the hold on I'm

44:34.720 --> 44:39.000
gonna do some quick math so if I'm wrong forgive me but I think as we do episode

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
87 that would technically mean assuming we don't miss a week right episode 100

44:44.000 --> 44:49.120
is a lucky 13 weeks away and if I am doing my math correctly I think that

44:49.120 --> 44:53.720
puts us like early July like July 7th let's see what today is yeah that was

44:53.720 --> 44:58.600
plausible okay so I'm thinking around then we do episode 100 in person and we

44:58.600 --> 45:02.080
organized here on this meetup page meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

45:02.080 --> 45:04.960
will celebrate episode 100 of Linux unplugged in person if everything goes

45:04.960 --> 45:08.520
as planned and we will coordinate on this meetup page right now it's Linux

45:08.520 --> 45:11.120
fest Northwest in the future it'll be events when we travel to your area and

45:11.120 --> 45:16.280
things like episode 100 of Linux fest or I'm sorry 100 of Linux unplugged and of

45:16.280 --> 45:19.640
course the chat room probably double-check my math for me it's a

45:19.640 --> 45:22.960
rough idea though so I'm really glad I'm really happy like with 70 80 people I

45:22.960 --> 45:25.600
think that's totally worth keeping that meetup even though there's a monthly fee

45:25.600 --> 45:29.560
it seems pretty worth it to me so I think so yeah thanks everybody and I

45:29.560 --> 45:31.520
can't wait to see those you're gonna make it to Linux fest and we'll do

45:31.520 --> 45:36.080
updates for Linux fest there boy episode 100 lucky 13 weeks I think that's right

45:36.080 --> 45:39.980
I think that's right it's been an amazing ride and one of the reasons

45:39.980 --> 45:43.560
we're able to get that far is because of our next sponsor and that's Ting go to

45:43.560 --> 45:47.820
linux.ting.com why well because putting Linux in your browser's URL bars awesome

45:47.820 --> 45:51.480
and putting linux.ting.com in there supports this show and gets you a

45:51.480 --> 45:55.320
$25 discount off your first ting device or if you have a ting compatible device

45:55.320 --> 46:00.360
you're gonna get some ting service credits oh I'm sorry did I get ahead of

46:00.360 --> 46:03.800
myself I thought you knew cuz it's so awesome ting is mobile that makes sense

46:03.800 --> 46:08.840
as my mobile service provider I've been using ting for over two years and I love

46:08.840 --> 46:13.680
it I just recently got up on the ting GSM beta and my Nexus 5 my Nexus 5 is

46:13.680 --> 46:16.800
like dual personalities like all of a sudden it's what it's just what all its

46:16.800 --> 46:20.880
whole life is walking around talking CDMA though city made this city made

46:20.880 --> 46:24.240
that's better with the trees Pacific Northwest has trees CDMA is better and

46:24.240 --> 46:31.280
then one day ting releases the GSM sim for $9 well ting's got no contracts no

46:31.280 --> 46:35.560
termination fees and you only pay for what you use so I was like well what's

46:35.560 --> 46:39.560
the cost $9 I could try out the GSM and I'm really out almost nothing so I got

46:39.560 --> 46:44.520
the GSM sim pop it in my Nexus 5 set that bad boy up for GSM and now all of

46:44.520 --> 46:48.680
a sudden my Nexus 5 is a totally new person it's walking and talking GSM

46:48.680 --> 46:53.200
putting CDMA down like a clown it's ridiculous I feel empowered because I've

46:53.200 --> 46:57.360
got everything it's unlocked it's my Nexus 5 I'm paying just for what I use

46:57.360 --> 47:00.120
ting just takes my minutes my messages my megabytes they add them all up at the

47:00.120 --> 47:04.280
end of the month whatever bucket I fall into that's all I got to pay and they

47:04.280 --> 47:07.480
have a great control panel that lets me manage all of that I nickname my devices

47:07.480 --> 47:10.600
so I know when Rekai's been calling the ladies too much or if I've been

47:10.600 --> 47:14.160
downloading too much Spotify while I drive between the studio I can manage

47:14.160 --> 47:17.200
all of that stuff using my ting dashboard and if I ever get stuck I

47:17.200 --> 47:19.680
don't worry because they got don't hold customer service you just call them at

47:19.680 --> 47:24.200
one eight five five ting FTW anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. and a real human

47:24.200 --> 47:26.960
being answers the phone they're empowered to solve your problems they're

47:26.960 --> 47:29.920
not just a bunch of drones that read a script that ain't how ting roll they're

47:29.920 --> 47:33.520
like hey you're a phone geek oh you are passionate about phones here's an idea

47:33.520 --> 47:37.160
why don't you work supporting phones you like Android alright sucker sit here

47:37.160 --> 47:39.880
no I'm kidding I love you guys I just could never do it that's why I love you

47:39.880 --> 47:43.400
guys one eight five five ting FTW try it you can talk to a real human being and

47:43.400 --> 47:48.000
after all of that after all of that if you go to linux.ting.com right now and

47:48.000 --> 47:51.520
you already have a compatible device and chances are you do because they have so

47:51.520 --> 47:56.000
many GSM devices you get a $25 service credit but you're like Chris bro man I

47:56.000 --> 47:59.440
made a mistake I went over to this duopoly I signed up for this horrible

47:59.440 --> 48:02.760
contract where they extort money out of me I feel like a clown I'm like man I

48:02.760 --> 48:05.840
hear you here's the thing ting has an early termination relief program what

48:05.840 --> 48:09.520
yes an early termination relief program they'll help you pay to get out of your

48:09.520 --> 48:14.000
contract because you know why ting frickin hates contracts they're silly go

48:14.000 --> 48:18.280
to linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged

48:18.280 --> 48:23.560
program oh man those guys loving it I'm telling you though I I'm feeling like

48:23.560 --> 48:28.760
I'm ready to upgrade to a Cadillac the Samsung s6 is calling my name I want to

48:28.760 --> 48:33.240
put that s all over the ting network I tell you what

48:33.880 --> 48:38.140
yeah I'm looking at actually investing in one of those little GSM do here case

48:38.140 --> 48:41.080
because I got an old razor you know in conjunction with my existing ting phone

48:41.080 --> 48:43.440
I have this old razor it's like well this might be kind of a nice you know

48:43.440 --> 48:47.920
that's a backup phone I was thinking if I don't go s6 if I don't go Cadillac why

48:47.920 --> 48:51.000
don't I do this feature phone with battery for days because ting you go

48:51.000 --> 48:54.440
ting for like under 70 bucks so I get a feature phone with battery for days and

48:54.440 --> 48:58.960
then I get a Nexus 9 with the GSM SIM put the ting GSM SIM in the Nexus 9 so

48:58.960 --> 49:03.360
I do my telegramming my hangouts my web browsing on the Nexus 9 and I do my my

49:03.360 --> 49:08.820
old-school phone calls which I do like two or three a day of tops maybe from my

49:08.820 --> 49:12.000
old-school flip phone with battery for days I'm just saying I could do it I why

49:12.000 --> 49:20.280
not make sense okay so I had a real rough day I came in and I could not get

49:20.280 --> 49:25.580
my computer to start I sat down at my desk turned on the nice aces monitor

49:25.580 --> 49:30.880
that I am quite proud of acquiring I stare at a screen and it's nothing but

49:30.880 --> 49:35.240
errors Matt nothing and if you're watching the video version of the

49:35.240 --> 49:38.760
unplugged program I'm gonna pull those errors up on my screen right now it was

49:38.760 --> 49:43.860
devastating it starts as this booting the Linux kernel starting version 218

49:43.860 --> 49:49.600
oh yeah you know what that is and then hold on a second info task mount 175

49:49.600 --> 49:56.580
blocks for more than 120 seconds uh-oh uh-oh task butter fs transaction 197

49:56.580 --> 50:00.280
blocked for more than 120 seconds uh-oh and that's all it ever did and then I

50:00.280 --> 50:04.880
now now of course so here's Chris's here's Chris's conundrum Chris has a

50:04.880 --> 50:10.200
show he has to go to and he needs a computer right now like I do not have

50:10.200 --> 50:14.480
really like so my so here's what runs through my head when my most important

50:14.480 --> 50:18.040
computer doesn't boot I think to myself well I should go grab a live USB stick

50:18.040 --> 50:22.720
and probably boot in there if I can get the main OS up and just you know maybe

50:22.720 --> 50:25.360
true in there and get everything I need and then fix it later like I'm starting

50:25.360 --> 50:28.960
thinking like maybe I could like zombify this thing and like prop it up and like

50:28.960 --> 50:31.840
get in there get my work done for the day and then like get out before the

50:31.840 --> 50:34.720
whole thing collapses out from underneath me and I'm like yeah I'm not

50:34.720 --> 50:37.840
gonna do that okay so I'm starting to think okay what are my other options

50:37.840 --> 50:44.520
well I just the night before installed Ubuntu Mate 1504 beta 2 I think it is

50:44.520 --> 50:50.800
right now I think that's the current one yes yes and and so I had a USB stick

50:50.800 --> 50:56.960
already flashed I love you know what also props to Ubuntu Mate really I think

50:56.960 --> 51:00.200
the only distro where you just go to their website and the download links and

51:00.200 --> 51:04.160
they and and you put DD rescue up there the command to run and you just make it

51:04.160 --> 51:07.840
real clear use DD rescue to write this to ISO to a thumb drive everybody else

51:07.840 --> 51:11.680
always recommends DD and a lot of times they don't just clearly put the command

51:11.680 --> 51:15.840
right there above the download links it makes it so clear and in fact that you

51:15.840 --> 51:19.760
also update the name of the ISO image so you literally could just copy that whole

51:19.760 --> 51:24.760
command is is just brilliant it is so helpful because I myself always end up

51:24.760 --> 51:29.280
using DD and I forget to use DD rescue which is way better to write an ISO file

51:29.280 --> 51:34.760
to a flash drive so anyways props to Mate so I had this thumb stick ready to

51:34.760 --> 51:39.400
go and I needed to get working right here right now so I stick the Ubuntu

51:39.400 --> 51:45.880
Mate 1504 USB thumb drive into my rig I reboot and I get into the desktop

51:45.880 --> 51:53.400
environment it's pretty snappy in fact it's unbelievably snappy it's so fast

51:53.400 --> 51:57.920
that I was I was grousing to Rekai who was standing over me because I'm you

51:57.920 --> 52:02.000
know he's he's trying to console me as I'm in as I'm as I'm as I have been

52:02.000 --> 52:05.920
mortally wounded and I'm sitting and and and this gray screen comes up and I

52:05.920 --> 52:10.320
start grousing oh man now I gotta wait for the fancy grub screen to render

52:10.320 --> 52:13.080
because that because this monitor is so large that anytime there's a big

52:13.080 --> 52:17.520
graphical grub screen comes up it slowly paints onto my screen and I'm sitting

52:17.520 --> 52:20.720
here grousing about that and what I realized was is that actually wasn't the

52:20.720 --> 52:26.680
case at all it what I thought was the grub screen was actually x11 starting it

52:26.680 --> 52:30.720
had booted so fast that I thought I was waiting for grub but I was actually

52:30.720 --> 52:34.880
waiting for the entire desktop it was amazing it boots so fast it was so cool

52:34.880 --> 52:38.880
so I was like alright install I'm like after that I was like that's it that's

52:38.880 --> 52:41.680
all I needed I just needed my computer to be really fast I just want to get

52:41.680 --> 52:45.800
back to work as fast as possible I've got to do some clipping and so I I

52:45.800 --> 52:48.880
installed Ubuntu Mate on my main workstation this is my rig up in my

52:48.880 --> 52:54.520
office and I used it for a couple of days a day I think I used it for a day

52:54.520 --> 53:01.560
actually and I ran into a couple of issues first of all I'm just I'm here's

53:01.560 --> 53:06.160
the here's the thing you don't want to do it's not really a great idea to use a

53:06.160 --> 53:12.040
beta version on your main workstation because so many of the PPAs out there

53:12.040 --> 53:16.600
don't work with it they expect you to be on a released version of Ubuntu so as

53:16.600 --> 53:21.400
soon as you start setting up PPAs for like themes or like a calendar widget or

53:21.400 --> 53:25.760
whatever you just start getting 404s in your app get update like an animal

53:25.760 --> 53:29.880
constantly it's just a horrible mess and then you end up like you know having to

53:29.880 --> 53:33.160
go out there and pull some of them out so that was a bit disappointing things

53:33.160 --> 53:37.600
like telegram not working sort of were deal breakers for me and I ended up

53:37.600 --> 53:40.880
going back with Antigros because it was it was so early in the process I could

53:40.880 --> 53:44.760
jump back so now I'm sort of at square square zero and sort of setting up and

53:44.760 --> 53:48.600
trying to get advice from the audience on what should I try because I haven't

53:48.600 --> 53:51.080
set this machine up in about a year and a half so what would you try at this

53:51.080 --> 53:56.400
point and I've already got some base stuff on there but I have to say it was

53:56.400 --> 53:59.960
pretty slick so here's a couple of things I did in Ubuntu Mate 1504

53:59.960 --> 54:07.160
because I use Ubuntu or I'm sorry mate tweak to turn on compass and to set my

54:07.160 --> 54:11.280
style so it had like a more of a bar layout that I liked quite a bit and that

54:11.280 --> 54:16.360
was really really easy to set up really slick I decided I opted to use the new

54:16.360 --> 54:21.800
mate menu and I was pleased to see the super key activated that so I was all

54:21.800 --> 54:24.300
really good to know the main problems I ran into with the mate menu were like

54:24.300 --> 54:27.740
sometimes when I did the super key it would pop up behind other windows so

54:27.740 --> 54:30.800
when I would type I couldn't see the results and sometimes it was a little

54:30.800 --> 54:34.320
delayed and popping up so I'd probably still if I was gonna stick with that

54:34.320 --> 54:37.840
desktop I would probably use a dedicated launcher like synapse or gnome do or

54:37.840 --> 54:44.240
whatever the hell but it's it's such a nice setup like I was using that and I

54:44.240 --> 54:47.480
could physically just felt my computer was like it felt like it was running

54:47.480 --> 54:52.040
faster and I really was impressed by that so Ubuntu Mate edition 1504 is

54:52.040 --> 54:55.000
looking really sharp I ended up keeping it on the computer I'm setting up for my

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
son so he'll be running that for a while and I'm now running Antigros with

55:00.000 --> 55:06.360
gnome 3 on my main office workstation and it was tough it was tough it was

55:06.360 --> 55:09.720
really tough now did anybody catch that error message and maybe what was the

55:09.720 --> 55:15.320
problem oh you did poppy yeah so how long did you leave it after the four

55:15.320 --> 55:22.600
minutes I actually left it overnight and it is that night yeah and it just kept

55:22.600 --> 55:27.800
repeating the same message interesting so my home server running butterFS does

55:27.800 --> 55:31.640
that now and again and all I do but that's after it's booted like and it's

55:31.640 --> 55:35.800
fine and it's up I just SSH in an echo zero as it says and then I never see

55:35.800 --> 55:39.240
that error message again because it's only an informational message to say

55:39.240 --> 55:44.080
yeah holy crap there's a truckload of IO going well now here's what I think it is

55:44.080 --> 55:47.880
busy I think blackout 24 is calling it right now in the IRC and I think roof

55:47.880 --> 55:51.560
chicken in our subreddit called it another better fest gotcha has been

55:51.560 --> 55:56.060
added to the gotcha wiki entry for butterFS that's how I see it stable

55:56.060 --> 56:01.920
kernel versions 3.19.1 can cause a deadlock at mount time that's one of the

56:01.920 --> 56:06.520
new gotchas in the butterFS and I think this is exactly what happened to me I

56:06.520 --> 56:10.560
think this is I think as I'm on a rolling release I'm on a rolling release

56:10.560 --> 56:16.440
they wanted the packages with systemd and butterFS right what's that and they

56:16.440 --> 56:22.120
want to do the packages with systemd and better yeah yeah yeah yeah I so there

56:22.120 --> 56:24.840
are workarounds is so if I would have looked this up there's workarounds but

56:24.840 --> 56:31.400
you know what this is what I came to I am so effing done with effing butterFS

56:31.400 --> 56:35.280
it is not even funny so when I I was like you know what I don't care that I

56:35.280 --> 56:40.240
can fix this I'm going XFS so what I decided to do is my boot partition which

56:40.240 --> 56:45.600
is about 250 megabytes is extended for everything else on the system is XFS my

56:45.600 --> 56:50.760
my root file system my home partition my editing partitions my gaming all XFS

56:50.760 --> 56:56.640
only XFS butterFS is dead to me this is the second system I have to quote unquote

56:56.640 --> 57:01.720
kind of soft loss to butterFS as in I could have fixed it if I really effing

57:01.720 --> 57:05.280
wanted to in the bonobos case I would have had to format and in this case I

57:05.280 --> 57:09.420
would have had to do a workaround for the timeout it's stupid it's a clown

57:09.420 --> 57:15.080
file system it's nowhere near ready close to quality of ZFS and XFS has a

57:15.080 --> 57:18.600
rich history behind it and probably has another 20 years left of development in

57:18.600 --> 57:22.760
it so for my taste I'm going XFS on everything that's important to me my

57:22.760 --> 57:26.520
back-end storage I'm not even going to use a Linux file system I'm going to use

57:26.520 --> 57:30.880
ZFS well that makes sense to me for a number of reasons one thing that I

57:30.880 --> 57:34.400
thought was interesting is that when you all these butterFS issues it doesn't

57:34.400 --> 57:38.320
after a while feel like you're almost a battered spouse I mean it's it's it I

57:38.320 --> 57:41.440
mean I realize in some scenarios it's fine and I realize if you have great

57:41.440 --> 57:46.000
backups it's fine but yeah it's it is because because it's like well I can fix

57:46.000 --> 57:49.760
it well he's gonna he's gonna change you know it's essentially what this is well

57:49.760 --> 57:52.160
you could you know you just got to give it you just got to deal with this one

57:52.160 --> 57:54.600
issue and it'll be better tomorrow because that's essentially what it is

57:54.600 --> 57:58.640
you know so often though and so often like generally software improves but

57:58.640 --> 58:04.800
here so fedora 22 the server spin of fedora will be using XFS by default

58:04.800 --> 58:09.360
rather than extended for using XFS has been the default within LVM as part of

58:09.360 --> 58:12.240
the fedora server technical spec while fedora 22 it's finally going to go

58:12.240 --> 58:15.880
official the default layout for door server 22 installations will be using

58:15.880 --> 58:21.440
XFS atop of LVM while boot is outside the LVM setup it's exactly what I'm

58:21.440 --> 58:26.320
doing the boot is gonna be extended for outside that and I'm gonna go just XFS

58:26.320 --> 58:30.960
and I'm gonna use LVM to do my my drives and this is I'm done I'm done with

58:30.960 --> 58:35.720
butter fs I'm just gonna use LVM and XFS and call it good and and I just feel

58:35.720 --> 58:40.280
like you can consider me the canary in the coal mine or not I at this point

58:40.280 --> 58:43.760
will not be recommending butter fs to listeners I tried it on and I still have

58:43.760 --> 58:47.040
the scary thing is that what I'm worried about now is I still have very

58:47.040 --> 58:50.880
important computers in production using butter fs that is frightening because I

58:50.880 --> 58:53.840
need to think about it I mean at the end of the day you're talking about using a

58:53.840 --> 58:58.160
file system not an application if you're if the file systems got issues that need

58:58.160 --> 59:03.120
to be corrected there's red flags all over that I'm sorry so yeah forget that

59:03.120 --> 59:09.440
nope anybody in the room any any any opinions or thoughts on the files on top

59:09.440 --> 59:14.960
before I move on to the software section and here I am on XD for perfectly fine

59:14.960 --> 59:24.200
yeah I suppose I think I like about XFS is and and I you know we've gone in

59:24.200 --> 59:28.760
great detail before but yes it's very fast it handles fragmentation better too

59:28.760 --> 59:39.640
oh does it and I've actually used XFS in production years ago back when like

59:39.640 --> 59:44.040
extended to was going to extended 3 and riser fs was still pretty popular and I

59:44.040 --> 59:50.160
had I really never had any problems with it and yeah core OS is also yeah disk

59:50.160 --> 59:53.600
full errors yes exactly yes I know I know core OS is ran into the same issues

59:53.600 --> 59:58.240
and so if you are not really familiar with XFS does it sound like an alien

59:58.240 --> 01:00:03.520
file system to you well there is a really really comprehensive write-up on

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:08.920
lwn.net that I will share I guess as a subscriber I can share a free link I

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.200
don't know if there's a limit or how it works but so I put a free link in the

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:17.040
show notes because they just wrote it on the first by Jake edge and it covers the

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.840
background of XFS how it came from iris the shift of XFS is development to

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:30.280
Linux really back in 2001 and in 2002 it was merged into Linux kernel 2.5 3 6 so

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.160
it's been a available Linux kernel file system since kernel 2.5 dot 3 6 that's

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.500
way longer than butter FS and the fundamentals of a file system is is you

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:43.360
really don't consider a file system to be production ready until it's been in

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.960
use you know five seven years I mean that's what conservative people that

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.800
trust their do want to be able to trust their data considered butter FS

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:55.520
obviously doesn't meet that level of a qualification XFS does and I think

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.840
Linux is in a pretty pretty pretty pretty pathetic file system state from

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.960
butter FS Gloucester FS extended for just being sort of a stopgap measure the

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.200
fact that we can't get ZFS into the Linux kernel where the hell is that

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.440
gonna leave Linux file systems in five to ten years it's pretty pathetic and

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.360
I'm not so sure butter FS is gonna get there maybe maybe it will but I's not

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.320
gonna get there for me and I think there's other distribute I'm sorry other

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.240
operating systems that are way ahead of Linux right now in this area and I think

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.120
it's kind of pathetic actually actually there is things in the

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.600
baking area I know that it that we kind of everything in the baking section and

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:39.080
just a few minutes ago just a few minutes ago you're the Market League guy

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.720
with Docker and now you this is seriously this is why it's pathetic and

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:46.640
this is why I'm actually a little panicky about it is because Linux needs

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.800
to be about five to seven years into a effing incredible file system right now

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.520
because you can't even really seriously consider a file system until it's been

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:59.400
in widespread production for a few years and I'm sorry but butter FS at Facebook

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.600
isn't gonna cut it for me anymore I don't know if they have you know what I

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:05.680
think it is I think Facebook has to narrow the usage range to really be

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:10.720
putting butter fester its paces at scale it really is about different usages like

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.000
when you're talking about in the server side people care about one thing when

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.840
you're talking about the desktop side people care about the other thing so I

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:24.080
don't know when you say ZFS maybe on the server side currently is years ahead in

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:30.120
so many ways but when you're talking about having your system being using

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.120
Linux all over of course people are trying things that work with Linux right

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:38.420
I think that's why there is a big push for butter fests otherwise people

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:42.560
wouldn't care I think a file system that has ghost metadata that eats up your

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:47.760
system and says drive is full affects laptops phones and servers and VPS is

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.840
that's why I think and I think and I think a file system that falls apart

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.960
when you update your kernel and has to have an ever-expanding of gotchas that

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.040
include constant regressions is not a production ready file system and those

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.160
things like desktop Linux service I don't care what your use case is the

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:08.080
only you know I'm asking just how many laptops are being shipped with one with

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.600
Linux and two with better if you answer that this is my point we don't have an

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.560
answer to that question there is no answer to that question like we want to

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.000
be doing those things well are we gonna ship it with butter no of course not we

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.800
can't we don't have a serious file system yeah I disagree on that stance

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.480
though at this point it probably be safer than a regular user a regular user

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:35.440
ext4 does whatever fine yeah you know what HFS does whatever you need to HFS

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.120
fight it plus is fine it's fine most people don't care I would rather

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:44.840
present I would rather use NTFS I don't of course most people don't care that's

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.440
all we talk about is things that most people don't care about that's our

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.560
entire world is things most people don't care about we care though we should care

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:55.120
and Linux should be better this is the world's premier open source operating

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.320
system and we have the biggest joke file system in on the planet it is a joke

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:04.240
since we don't have the desktop market share I think that the fact that there

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.560
is one efforts in the direction of having something that will work for the

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:13.800
desktop as well and something that does work for the server space I think it's

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.280
having in the baking stage something that is progressively improving is good

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:24.040
since we don't have the desktop market share I mean we will have the things to

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:29.600
enter that market with strong with strength we currently are not in the

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.960
market but it's not because of the file system because if that was the cause the

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:38.040
only reason we weren't in the desktop no I think it'd be silly to talk about that

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.640
what's really more important is the server market share that we're gonna

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.600
lose to freeBSD and ZFS but Ryan I wanted to give you a chance to talk

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:52.360
about your concerns with butter FS well I've had one bad experience but to be

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:57.080
honest it was similar to yours where I was running something that was you know

01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:03.360
living up on the bleeding edge but I I've had this laptop that I've been

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:10.200
running it's a system 76 laptop and I've been running butter FS and not running

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:17.160
arch I'm I'm running I jump between evolve and or salute sorry and arch and

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:23.160
I've never and I've net or not arch Ubuntu and I've never had a problem so

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.200
far maybe it's because I'm not sitting right there on the bleeding I would say

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.080
too if you're gonna here's my pit is my bit of advice if you want to use butter

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:35.800
FS use an LTS kernel I think it'll probably be safer because I don't think

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.920
the LTS kernels are going to introduce major butter FS errors so if you're if

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.520
you've decided that butter FS is fancy enough for you you maybe want to

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:46.760
consider an LTS kernel here's what I've decided to do so I'm going to do rolling

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.840
release again but I'm going to stick with a better file system XFS currently

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.680
running gnome 3.14.2 with Chrome and Firefox and basic packages like

01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:01.400
Samba fuse Dropbox infatality fonts handbrake fish get her a pad YouTube

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:05.520
download I have I have a couple of things I wanted to get your all opinion

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:11.440
on here I've got two 600 gigabyte 10k rpm SATA drives that I would like to

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:16.080
software mirror or something to use for my editing and Steam library and I was

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.440
curious with the mumble room thought I should use as far as software rate

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:25.520
currently my thought was LVM and then format it with XFS but you know there's

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.720
MDM admin there's a lot of there's a lot of ways to skin that cat under Linux so

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.200
does the mumble room have any opinions on the best way to take advantage of

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:37.720
those two 600 gigabyte drives more and remember better FS I've actually gotten

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:41.760
that suggestion and I'm going more for speed not redundancy so I probably use

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:48.880
like a raid zero no okay well I think I'm gonna do LVM well if you if you want

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:53.680
to get change to happen in this area you know it's gonna it's gonna take

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:59.760
conversations in the community like this one and with you know those guys who run

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:03.560
the different distributions like I key and now other people contribute to

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:09.640
distributions of trying to decide you know what what really serves the end

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:15.600
user best at least in the desktop space in the in the server space they think

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.800
about about this more they've already made decisions yeah yeah sure I think in

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:26.160
the desktop actually overlay FS has a a very ten they can make it actually

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.480
happen it's one of the most appealing things it's like you having the ability

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:36.440
to section to have sections in your file system you don't have much work or

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:40.220
configuration to do which deal with different data differently like media

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.340
files being headed handled internally as larger blocks and that's faster to

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:48.280
access those and smaller files to have like there are the system files to have

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:52.360
redundancy butter up s like yeah this is are the capabilities that that file

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:57.280
system has you know for a regular user probably matter more because he doesn't

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:00.820
want to manage things he just wants to have the diversity of files he uses

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:05.680
directly and use it and still have same speed or better speed for each type of

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:10.720
file specifically so I think that there's no other place currently doing a file

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.120
system like that so that could be something maybe like to toy around with

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:18.040
that's that sounds like you know that could be an area to play with some more

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:22.320
I've noticed a couple common packages that I don't currently use at the

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:25.640
audience is using a lot of in this subreddit thread our torrent seems to be

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:31.760
the popular bit torrent client followed by Q torrent yeah that would be yeah not

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:35.440
too surprising a lot of people using fish the term of the shell I use fish as

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:41.280
well fish shell so that's not and a lot of M player or MPV and I've noticed a

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:48.120
course a lot of a lot of things like redshift or x-files VLC gnome tweaks of

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:56.680
course emacs and pi samba plex steam so here I when I when I first get my what

01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.320
my machine set up I find I have to do a couple of things first I install packer

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:05.600
or pack a you are then I install Dropbox and then I install Chrome and that that

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:12.080
gets me super far Chrome and Dropbox alone I'm a little ashamed to say have

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:17.400
really made reloading my machines a lot simpler and then after that I layer on

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:21.400
bit torrent sync or whatever likes or C file and out for this machine this

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:28.040
machine uses C file and I don't know how comfortable I am with that so I'm

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.980
getting my does feel like you're married to it a little bit right because if it

01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:34.800
something if something goes away Dropbox does a does a wonky and whatever is no

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:38.160
longer an option then what you know it's like here's my free Linux workstation

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:44.320
that becomes functional because I set up Dropbox and Chrome yeah no area feels a

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.520
little bit then again maybe I just not something I shouldn't worry about I I

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.840
don't know but it's within a couple hours I was able to get up and running

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.480
again and it does the AR doesn't make getting software installed very fast but

01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:00.360
I ended up going with gnome 3 simply because I'm looking forward to gnome 16

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.200
but I seriously considered just going mate I wonder if I would be able to get

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.320
a mattei experience as good as the Ubuntu mattei one I don't know if I

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:11.440
would maybe I'd be left a little a little unsatisfied so I went gnome 3

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:18.320
because I want to try out gnome 3.16 now the only big piece I'm missing is like

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.320
what should I do in case this ever happens again I know I don't like should

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:30.200
I do DD backups should I do image backups using like a part image or or

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.520
clonezilla I mean what should I do I think I think if it's a machine that you

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.800
need up and running like in a reason without having to screw with it I think

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:41.280
yeah I think an image backup makes sense in that regard but at the same time you

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.280
then have to think about okay are you what are you backing up are you backing

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:47.600
up actual data partitions as far as like your user data which obviously that

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.800
needs to be far more frequently in the weekly you might be doing with your when

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.920
I almost wonder like would it be possible to do something like like oh my

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:58.120
drive died I just plug in this USB Drive and I could literally just boot from

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:04.240
that you could yeah you had something our snapshot go tell me about that I know

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.040
I'm so familiar with it yeah if you're backing up you talk about backing up

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.840
data or bare metal restore I don't know I'm curious maybe I actually want to go

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.400
full bare metal just for total like you know all my software's right back where

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:21.240
it is everything's totally configured yeah so you were saying about you depend

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:28.840
on Chrome and Dropbox so I depend on Firefox last pass yeah and then still at

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:35.440
the moment bit torrent sink which which I use for sinking my roaming profiles

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:41.800
and once I bring so I need Firefox bt-sync to get to my password for my

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:49.880
main bt-sync server to get my keys and then sync my roaming profile and once

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.400
I've got that I'm back up and running you know all of my applications are

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:58.640
configured so I don't need to do a bare metal restore I can do a fresh install

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.040
and then just plunk my profile I am considering just doing to go I am

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.200
considering just doing that but it's I I feel like there's all such a long tail

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.920
of configuration after a clean install because I have so many little things I

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:16.160
need to do so many little tools that I have to install that it feels like if I

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:20.560
could just if I could just plug something in and almost lose no time it

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:26.640
would be such a nice dream so yeah well our snapshots great for you know

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.920
incremental backups of your like your home directory for example your first

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:35.280
backup is a full backup and everything thereafter is an incremental and it uses

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:41.360
hard links so it uses rsync underneath and hard linking so that the subsequent

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.640
backups are only the incrementals and consequently because it's all hard

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.120
linked you just go to any dated folder and you can just copy the whole thing

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:54.600
you know out of there so you can rsync the whole backup folder at whatever

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:59.760
point you want to restore and it all is just there simple so there's no you know

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.760
untar it find this version what was my encryption phrase you know so if you

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:10.320
want to stick it on an encrypted USB Drive that's kind of simple and then

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.120
you've got things like deja jupe if you want to send it offline you know fully

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:21.480
encrypted and duplicity is what runs underneath that yeah yeah yeah I'm a

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.400
duplicity guy myself I just can't decide like do I want just the data because I

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:29.120
kind of have the data solved now through different sync services or do I really

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:34.220
want like a full turnkey plug this USB Drive in and I boot up solution I feel

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:37.840
like that's kind of the way I go and I'm not sure well maybe we're overthinking

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.660
it maybe you just need a generic setup on a let's say an external drive okay

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:44.700
it's blank it's empty it has no personality at all and then you're

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:49.780
syncing your profiles to that drive oh shit everything went to hell okay whoop

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:54.520
do I plug in that drive grab my escape hatch you're done it literally takes it

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:58.440
yeah just and the entire top downtime is as fast as it takes to boot up into it

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.920
yeah Mondo rescue micro 89 and the chairman's that pointed out Mondo rescue

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.480
which is one that I've talked about a couple of times

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.600
fond of school I don't know if there is the project still getting updated I

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:14.200
think it is this Mondo rescue version 3.2.0 came out on 2015 of January 3rd

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.880
then there's also like what Amanda I think so you know what I might give

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.400
Mondo a try after the show tonight yeah yeah yeah there's a few other ones but

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.920
I'm just saying for the short term consider that though I mean literally

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.960
it's it's yeah it solves all your issues quickly yeah we've done you know give me

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:31.400
up there's just I'm worried about the fine nuances of all like like having

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.840
like all my cheapy-cheeky set up and Thunderbird and getting like you know

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:42.720
all my programs like take a lot of custom versions of wine and I would do

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:46.520
both because I'm paranoid I would do both because then you have your nuances

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:49.200
done with your imaging but then at the end it's like okay I don't really have

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.300
time to wait for that restoration I just need a plug-and-go yeah there's then you

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:55.440
have you have a quick and dirty machine yeah there W you want to make a comment

01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:01.960
on torrent clients yeah I just like to mention tribbler tribbler org it's a

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:07.680
kind of a new project and they are pretty much backing up using the same

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:13.800
similar infrastructure to tour mmm and it's like for you to search torrents so

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.440
you don't have to go to the tracker anymore and pretty much making it

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:22.920
possible to shut down crackers interesting Wow I just linked in chat

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:28.760
Ryan like that's an interesting problem or TRI BLER Ryan you had a comment on

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:36.720
building backup into Linux yeah I mean what a I key has said before that he's

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:42.000
been considering and working on something throwing something into solace

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.840
right into the actual distribution that can handle backups I know that we're

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:54.040
going to add a boom to one and there was really the perks to that but but we

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:59.000
really are lacking in in it's something that's built into the the actual

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.320
operating system that allows you to do all sorts of things like jump back you

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:11.520
know easily to a previous state and also you know the handle your normal backup

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:17.340
and so definitely a great feature add to for a distro to bring in say look our

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:20.440
distro has really solved this problem you know what maybe I should do Matt

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.520
maybe this would solve my problem I got an idea I should just get my butt over

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.760

need to take over a different environment you get to keep track of

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:09.520
your progress as you go along I think this is a really nice dashboard it's

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.120
really sweet system and they can also help give you a little reminders like

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:17.360
hey bro you got a test coming up you should probably study I'd be like oh

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:22.200
thanks Linux Academy you're right I will study it's nice they have so many great

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.120
courses too and they really follow the industry trends to make sure that the

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.480
technology that they're covering is the technology you could go out and

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:31.120
implement and get a job get get educated or maybe even get certified they have so

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:36.200
many great success stories I have this one here about from they have the LPIC

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:39.320
one and Linux plus exams now you can go take them at Linux Academy and then go

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.920
take the certification to be officially certified that's pretty cool and in fact

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:48.560
they have another big thing coming up on April 16th at 9 p.m. Central a big

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.860
content update over at Linux Academy new stuff coming all the time it's a really

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:56.920
cool platform with solutions available for those of you have very very limited

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:01.880

subject material linuxacademy.com slash on plugs take it up a notch big thanks

01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:19.280
to links getting for sponsoring the unplug program and touching on them a

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.200
little bit here recently someone pointed out to me something I didn't know and

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.280
they actually have courseware helping you to find work after you've been

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:30.840
certified yes it's level associate but yeah they actually it's literally how to

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.200
get a Linux job it's pretty cool and it's my guy does iron lots of lots of

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.600
relevant stuff there that just make the resume look great as well so we have

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.880
we've been dancing around at this whole episode but the solo s or I'm sorry

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.880
there's a new project out there everybody's called solos

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.800
don't call evolve OS anymore no sir no sir the project name has changed to

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:57.920
avoid unnecessary legal action so we have Aiki and Ryan here Aiki do you want

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:09.800
to tell us what happened yeah I really loved how this is really gone so on

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:15.560
April Fool's Day of all days I basically got an email come through and it said

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:18.400
that I was getting a letter coming through as well which is like okay this

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:23.520
is just pure lows I was like okay so I ended up phoning up the people involved

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:27.640
you know independently finding the the phone number for this place separately

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:36.640
and it actually does check out so I was like so the trademark is very very much

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:41.920
specific to the UK so a couple of months ago we were having problems with people

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.760
completely unrelated incident by the way but we were having problems with people

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:51.480
you know trying to assert ownership over the brand so I took a couple of steps

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.320
and I basically went ahead and put in a trademark application not to be a

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:58.800
painting troll but just to stop people trying to pull one over on the project

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:03.240
so that was like in the UK that happens for a couple of months and it's put up

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.720
so people can you know they can object to it and say hey we own that which

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:12.040
someone did and it's held by the Secretary of State in the UK and they

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:21.200
own the trademark for OS and which I did not see coming Wow Wow I could

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.720
understand if it was evolve like when I was reading through the letter I was

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:26.960
looking for the word evolve but no it was for OS I was like are you kidding me

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:32.760
that's so yeah I mean that absolutely and not least sucks I was like you know

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:36.880
that's one thing that Linux projects are traditionally done to to avoid that

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:42.440
kind of thing and like have a suffix of OS or Linux or something like that so

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:46.520
yeah I mean that absolutely and not least sucks so we went through on Google

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.280
Plus for a couple of well I think it's about two days asking for suggestions

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:56.080
to an IRC and you know we got absolutely nowhere with a with a fitting name so I

01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:59.840
just went back to a name that we've used before which was Solus but without the

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:05.160
OS part okay so you're saying that elementary OS is also violating that

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:14.440
trademark no that's not what I'm saying this is UK specific right yeah no it's

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:18.200
not an instant it's not an international trademark this is a UK application so

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:22.580
this doesn't affect anyone else abroad and because the project doesn't have a

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:28.280
legal entity I am that that legal entity so I represent it and even if I had like

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:32.280
the the trademark and the website and everything done abroad I'm still

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:36.420
operating in this country and you know I still fall under UK legislation so I

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:43.840
can't use that suffix which absolutely sucks but you know you adapt yeah that's

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:48.040
a hell of an April Fool's Day and so how has the community responded to the name

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:53.160
change everybody must be pretty understanding I would assume luckily

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:59.960
yeah and you know that does help like surefire way to kill your project so

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:04.280
there's been you know there's been a few misconceptions about this I did a did a

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:08.480
couple of posts on Google Plus one of them was compound irony which which you

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:13.080
posted on as well and so I mean everyone's been pretty good about it

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:19.360
the the media as it were haven't done such a good job you know they're saying

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.240
it's you know it's totally unrelated to the the old soulless West project which

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:31.760
is nonsense because mm-hmm evolve it's really hard not to say that so that that

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.720
came from the exact same code base as soulless OS the original soulless West

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:40.640
and we've sold well soulless West too so you know it was always a continuation of

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:44.280
under a different name but it was the only name I could go back to that people

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:49.320
still understand I'm not getting into trouble so now it's the soulless

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:54.920
operating system not soulless OS and you know if people want to abbreviate that I

01:22:54.920 --> 01:23:00.760
can't stop them right it's solace it's the soulless project though to be clear

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:07.640
so the well it's the the distro part of it is the soulless operating system it's

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:12.440
run by the soulless project which is not a company or anything like that it's

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:15.480
just the soulless project which also wants the budget desktop project and

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:19.440
things like that it was the only conceivable way I could come up with to

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:24.280
get out of it yes as someone's asked a question on IRC why not evolve

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:28.680
operating system so when I was looking into the whole name change thing it

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:34.560
basically if we reduced our name or took away the uniqueness of it as in evolve

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:46.280
OS there happens to be this game called evolve so yeah so it's like come on you

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:49.680
could just lowercase the OS instead of being a suffix it's part of the name so

01:23:49.680 --> 01:24:02.320
it's evolving loss I'd kind of like to add here that the community at least the

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:06.360
community members I spoke to who are already active in the project especially

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:11.440
like the art team actually really enjoyed the opportunity to especially

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:15.440
the art team actually enjoyed the opportunity to to take this as an up

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:21.320
because the evolve you know as it stands is is when you think of evolve you think

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:27.520
of like evolution itself and and these differences like that where as soulless

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:32.040
has its own it's its own thing so it allows a lot more branding opportunities

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:37.920
that that don't aren't necessarily tied tied down to that paradigm and

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:42.080
everything and so I know that's not that's kind of not really any technical

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:47.240
thing but but at least one sector of the community actually avoid the chance to

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:53.800
reinvent and and have fun with it and and that's that's a good you know get it

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:58.240
the community seems to have undid that they were trying to be really help

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:03.800
during the rename and then now they're they I didn't hear anybody really say

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:10.360
this is you know bullshit I'm leaving there they just they kind of followed us

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.880
in what else can you do really the new yeah age yeah it's not like it's your

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:20.560
choice true so I mean they just you know it's understandable and it's it's it's

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.680
just hard because you need it you don't even I've never even thought of that you

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.400
guys so it's understandable that that mistake could be made to begin with you

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:31.720
know I'm that that's that's a hard hard way to go but you know it's not the name

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:36.000
it's not the name that makes the project it's right I think you guys would be

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.240
alright so we'll fit we'll follow I have in the show notes I have links to the

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.400
new solace project community page on Google Plus so there's a new community

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:47.560
page for people to follow and I have a link to that in the show notes and if

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.920
you guys want to share any other links people needed to catch just drop them in

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.720
the IRC and I'll grab them I'll put them in the show notes too and then just stop

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:57.560
by and let's know how it's going yeah it's supposed to the link that helps searching

01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:03.800
for trademarks across the world just the you which might come in handy tmdn.org

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:07.880
and I will add a link to that in the show notes as well tmdn.org and

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:11.680
speaking of links in the show notes if you got bit by that butter fs kernel

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:16.600
3.19 timeout lockup issue thingy I just got tweeted by somebody that did I'll

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.720
have a link to the fix that you could apply so that way you don't have to

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:24.040
reload your whole rigamidig I'll have a link to that in the show notes as well

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.400
because that's not a lot of fun and also don't forget there's also that great

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:33.360
piece from LWN on XFS I'm just saying XFS for the future XFS for the next 20

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:38.560
years ZFS for everything else that's all I have to say about that alright guys

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.360

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.200
this week's episode of Linux Unplugged we'll see you right back here for

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:47.960
episode 88 next week

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:13.960
I won't lie though there's nothing like that fresh install feeling it's like

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:17.920
it's like underwear right out of the dryer right yeah it is and I installed

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:20.800
the Nvidia package and I immediately it could feel like it wasn't right like

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.280
something's not right oh I forgot I forgot libgl go I install that and then

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:27.920
I reboot again boom now I got a nice smooth accelerated desktop like oh yeah

01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:32.120
it's feeling good it's feeling fresh yeah I think that's nice I think it

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.360
feels real good and real tight you know and like I could just install just the

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:39.400
stuff I need so I only like one so it's just real clean like I only have a few

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.600
icons in my side dock it's looking tight I like it a lot

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:48.680
hey JBTitles.com yeah I'm going to be sending you an email with some

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:54.960
pictures of an Internet of Things device that I've been building with a group

01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:00.400
over here I think you'll like it is it a sex toy no but it's built entirely on

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:06.040
Linux and if all the code base will be open source and maybe we can send you it

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:12.920
is hardware so maybe we can send you a little unit to play around with I was kind of looking

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:18.240
forward to like a saddle with a pie attached or something right we can't tell you not to use it for that

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:28.040
purpose wow like you've got my email address right all right so butter fs

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:36.600
meltdowns not bad take solace and solace is not bad I found the link that we

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.520
mentioned in the beginning yeah oh yeah yeah yeah right yes there's a Microsoft

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:44.960
Linux version one yeah tell me about it I couldn't find I couldn't find in their

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:49.640
blog but I found at least in the answers maybe it was moved to the answers or for

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:55.480
some reason I found it that related somehow installing Windows 8 after eight

01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:00.160
years of Linux let me share my experiences Windows 8 after using Linux

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:09.400
only for eight years oh my gosh oh it's long I know me a favor drop that in the

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:23.600
yeah it's not a fix but it might make it to where you're not bumping up against it

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:27.920
gives a little bit of a delay and it works it's a hardware fix sin client is

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:33.160
our friend huh so what do you okay so we could do what happened to evolve OS

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:37.360
well that's not bad yeah we could also do something that's like warning people

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.720
about butter fs issues because it could be people listening that run into this

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:44.160
problem this week I'm sure it sounds like it's pretty easy to stumble upon I

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.800
mean it's a file system thing that's kind of a big yeah it's using kernel

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:50.120
319 and butter fs right that's kind of being that's isn't this gonna be brutal

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:53.200
for a little while as people update is this not gonna be a thing or am I

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:57.240
missing something well this isn't like oh my Wi-Fi went down or something well

01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:00.760
yeah I mean or distros won't upgrade to kernel 319 or something like that but if

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:09.080
you're on a if you're on a rolling release or a beta release
