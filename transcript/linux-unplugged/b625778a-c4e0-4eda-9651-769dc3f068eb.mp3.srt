1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Grab your pitchforks.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,120
YouTube pages load five times slower in Firefox and Edge

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,320
than they do in Chrome.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,400
Say it ain't so.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,680
It is so, Wes.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,200
It is so.

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,580
You see, YouTube's got this Polymer redesign,

8
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,880
which relies on deprecated shadow DOM API

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,280
controls that are only implemented in Chrome.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,000
So I was like, OK, what is this really about?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,840
I started looking into this.

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,700
First of all, my first reaction was,

13
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,520
this really reminds me of the stuff

14
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,720
that Microsoft used to do back in IE's heyday,

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,840
where they would design stuff to work better in IE

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,000
than anything else.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,360
Oh, it's an open standard.

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,040
It just happens to be an open standard

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,400
that we were behind that we wanted to implement,

20
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,680
and so we implemented it first.

21
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,920
Hey, my whole life is an active X app, OK, Chris?

22
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,240
Yeah, jeez.

23
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,280
The good old days, Wes, the good old days.

24
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,800
So it definitely reminded me of that.

25
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,920
But there is a little gold at the end of this rainbow.

26
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,680
Check this out.

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,520
I came across a Firefox add-on called YouTube Classic.

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,680
You got to go get this if you use Firefox.

29
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,380
It makes YouTube like it was a couple of years

30
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,640
ago, where everything just loads and none of the UI elements

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,100
are hidden, and you don't have to wait for comments

32
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,000
to load dynamically.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,800
They just instantly pop in like text.

34
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,440
Wait, is it like a site that's whole purpose is serving videos

35
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,520
and you get right to that?

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,760
Yeah, it's weird.

37
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,880
Suspicious.

38
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,480
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 259 for July 24, 2018.

39
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:35,920
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,720
show that's reconnecting with friends and back in Washington.

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,480
My name is Chris.

42
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,280
My name is Wes.

43
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,880
Hello, Wes.

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,640
Hello, sir.

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,360
And back in action, missing from last week, it's Brent.

46
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,160
Hello, Brent.

47
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,040
Hello, everyone.

48
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,280
Hello, sir.

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,360
We have a fine show assembled here.

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,080
We have some community news, a couple of stories

51
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
I'm really excited about.

52
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,760
Plus, and I told you so, I can't help myself.

53
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,280
And big news for those of us that

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,080
may be considering Chromebooks running Linux apps,

55
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,720
then we'll get into the Ubuntu corner.

56
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,400
Our friends over at Canonical have

57
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,160
been doing quite a bit of work.

58
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,260
And then we've got a batch of apps and tips

59
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,440
that we think will help quite a bit.

60
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,040
And then later on in the show, there

61
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,780
is a couple of things in the news this week.

62
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,120
Slackware's founder is struggling,

63
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,760
and I really mean that, especially in light

64
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,920
after the Slackware birthday.

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,280
He's struggling to be sustainable.

66
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,240
We'll also talk about a developer who

67
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,600
attempted to release software for Linux

68
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,420
but met a lot of harsh criticism because it was closed source.

69
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,800
And then we'll talk about a commercial piece of software

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,120
that's coming to Linux that could represent

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,400
a fundamental game changer for how an entire industry perceives

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,440
Linux.

73
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,560
But I'm a little worried that the rabid user

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,680
base of certain types of software

75
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,760
will scare them all away.

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,840
So we'll get into all of that and much, much more.

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,760
But before we go any further, before we even

78
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,440
get into that community news, we've

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,880
got to bring in that virtual lug time-appropriate greetings

80
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,640
mumble room.

81
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,140
Hello.

82
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,640
Howdy, howdy.

83
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,360
Heidi.

84
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,720
Hello, guys.

85
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,920
So good to hear all of you.

86
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,060
Such wonderful voices.

87
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,760
Hello, especially a special hello

88
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,520
to one Mr. Martin Wimpress.

89
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,160
Hello, Wimpy.

90
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,480
Good to have you back, sir.

91
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,120
Good evening.

92
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,840
How are you doing?

93
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,880
So have you been out traveling and shaking hands?

94
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,380
What have you been doing since you've

95
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,760
been on the show last?

96
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,640
Yeah, all of that.

97
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,040
So yeah, I was out last week.

98
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,560
I was in Montreal last week.

99
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,840
And other than that, work has just been keeping me

100
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
extraordinarily busy recently.

101
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,040
Montreal, you say?

102
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,160
Yeah, it was a mid-cycle product strategy sprint.

103
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,840
More and more of these sprints, all about the sprints

104
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,360
these days over at the canonical.

105
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,040
Yeah, this was a purely internal one.

106
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,720
So probably about 100 or so people there.

107
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,400
So this is looking at the progress towards 1810,

108
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,840
and also to some extent, 1804.1, making sure everything's

109
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,760
on track, doing a bit of course correcting here and there.

110
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,240
Yeah.

111
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,160
You know, that sort of thing.

112
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,560
So yeah, so it's all looking good and rosy right now.

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,800
Yeah, really good.

114
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,520
And boy, you say about 100 of you.

115
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,640
That's no small endeavor.

116
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,920
That is quite the thing.

117
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,660
So well, I'm glad this is our first show

118
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,080
since you've been back, I believe.

119
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
So I'm glad you could make it.

120
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,840
It's good to have you here.

121
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,000
We have had ourselves a big week since we last got here.

122
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,920
I'm back in Washington now.

123
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,760
And I've been going over some of the stuff.

124
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,480
And I want to start with something fun.

125
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,980
I want to start with something that I've

126
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,560
had just this huge amount of respect for recently,

127
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,720
and that is React OS.

128
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,800
When I gave it a go for Linux Action News,

129
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,560
I came away just feeling like it was peak Windows.

130
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,320
Like they had managed to just nail that Windows experience

131
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,160
that was somewhere between Windows 98 and Windows 2000,

132
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,720
like in a mix of the best of.

133
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,480
And I was just damned impressed with how fast it was

134
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
and how far they'd come.

135
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,760
And I knew the project had one major milestone.

136
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,840
And I don't even think I can fully appreciate

137
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,460
why this is a major milestone, but they've

138
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,080
been talking about what they call self-hosting, where you

139
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,080
can build React OS on React OS.

140
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,800
That to them has been a major milestone.

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
It's understandable, I suppose.

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,800
I think especially in the programmer community,

143
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,960
that's sort of a, it can be a benchmark oftentimes.

144
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,040
The thing you've worked so hard to build

145
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,640
is generalized enough to build the complex system that you

146
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,440
just made, right?

147
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,000
So you can be like, look, we're totally dog food now.

148
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,940
We built this OS.

149
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,600
We can build our OS on our OS.

150
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,680
It's all one platform.

151
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,520
Yeah, and as they point out in the React OS blog,

152
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,160
they say the ability to build React OS on React OS, known

153
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,920
as self-hosting, has often been touted

154
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,980
as sort of a milestone in an OS's maturity.

155
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,920
But the details are far more nuanced.

156
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,720
Compiling any large code base, whether it

157
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,820
be an operating system or even a web browser,

158
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,320
stresses the system in a lot of ways, one of the biggest

159
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,160
being memory usage and storage I.O.

160
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,680
Code being compiled needs to be loaded from storage

161
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,360
into memory, and more memory is required

162
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,800
to hold all of the compiled objects

163
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,080
as they're linked together.

164
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,560
Scheduling is also, to a certain extent, stressed,

165
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,160
as most modern build systems will

166
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,400
attempt to spawn multiple compilation processes to speed

167
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,080
up the process.

168
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,220
All right, so you could see how just building a complex project

169
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,920
in a way is a milestone, the fact

170
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,160
that the OS can survive that.

171
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,800
Yeah, very much so.

172
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,560
And in the spirit of open source,

173
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,720
it was FreeBSD's implementation of Qsort

174
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,480
that actually helped the main developer, Pierre,

175
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,200
bridge some of the last pieces needed to achieve this.

176
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
Oh, interesting.

177
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,040
That was FreeBSD developers.

178
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,080
There's always helping someone somewhere.

179
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,720
There's also just like shell improvements and new features

180
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,600
coming to ReactOS, like several quality of life improvements,

181
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,480
the ability to extract archives and whatnot all baked in,

182
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
and a new milestone.

183
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,080
Compatibility for Windows in ReactOS

184
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,200
is reliant on something called the shim engine.

185
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,160
That allows the loading of slightly different versions

186
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,080
of libraries and APIs, depending on what the application expects

187
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,560
from Windows.

188
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,880
ReactOS is much the same in this release,

189
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,240
but they added the ability for ReactOS

190
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,960
to present itself as Windows 8.1 now.

191
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,400
And so applications looking for that version of the APIs

192
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,720
will now get back Win 8.1.

193
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,800
Impressive.

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,600
That's got to cover a lot of applications, I would think.

195
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,200
Really, really, really nice.

196
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,080
I'm just watching this with awe.

197
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,520
Like, it's bizarro Windows in a reality

198
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,440
where Windows became a community project,

199
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,600
and they focused on making a fantastic development

200
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,360
workstation, and they didn't really

201
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,840
care so much about chasing convergence

202
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,360
or all of the other things that like.

203
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,160
You haven't even said the word enterprise.

204
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,360
Like, what's happening here?

205
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,320
I know, right?

206
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,720
It does seem like this would make a great Enterprise OS,

207
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,200
though.

208
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,160
Just say it once.

209
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,880
One day.

210
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,480
It is fun to separate the old specter of Microsoft

211
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,720
and then just the actual UI and experience of using Windows.

212
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,040
Because I feel like we've twisted them in our souls,

213
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,240
and there's obviously a lot of complicated feelings,

214
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,280
but using the old Windows UI is just fine

215
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,080
if you're just trying to get some work done,

216
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,520
and you're already familiar with it.

217
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,040
I agree.

218
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,840
And you know, maybe one day when Microsoft moves on,

219
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,920
it will be React OS that we go to for that compatibility

220
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,840
shim on Linux or something.

221
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,040
Could happen, Wes.

222
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,000
React OS might end up being like, you know,

223
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,440
future Chris and Wes's version of wine.

224
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,840
What you're calling it here, it's a Chris prediction.

225
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,080
Guys, do we have a sense of what the React OS developers are

226
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,760
hoping React OS will be?

227
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,080
It's essentially a Windows replacement

228
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,640
with full Windows application compatibility.

229
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,880
And they're doing it in a way that's so bottom up

230
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,320
that they just might get there eventually by the time

231
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,200
Microsoft gives up on Windows.

232
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,760
But do you think that makes it still

233
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,520
a goal worth pursuing, Brent?

234
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,080
Well, that's kind of what my question was leading to.

235
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,720
If, let's say, in five years they

236
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,240
get to a really usable system, then what?

237
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,600
And so for me, I would say not really,

238
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,000
because I've done the work to get away from that.

239
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,520
But I wonder what the usage case they're chasing.

240
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,320
I think it's a worthwhile endeavor.

241
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,440
Why do you say that?

242
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,400
Well, we see lots of these proprietary systems

243
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,840
fall by the wayside eventually.

244
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,360
And maybe Windows will fall out of favor completely

245
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,440
at one point, and it will become a relic, a thing of the past.

246
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
And perhaps React OS will be a means

247
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,840
to preserve that vast catalog of Windows software.

248
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,520
Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.

249
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,720
It's also just impressive that it's

250
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,280
been going for like 20 years.

251
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,000
And so even if it's not worthwhile or not,

252
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,120
it's clearly providing value to the people working on it.

253
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,160
Has it really?

254
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,040
Yes.

255
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
1998 was the initial release.

256
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,880
Isn't that wild?

257
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,200
I had no idea.

258
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,400
I mean, I know I've heard about it for years,

259
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,240
but I've only started taking it seriously in the last six

260
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,800
months or so.

261
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,360
It's just impressive.

262
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,400
There must have been a lot of days in there

263
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,840
that it didn't work so well as what we see today, right?

264
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,520
And still they went on.

265
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,920
Is it just me, or did they sort of hit a tipping point

266
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,080
in the last couple of years?

267
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,400
Because it used to be sort of a bit of a joke, a bit of a meme.

268
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,880
But in the last couple of years, progress

269
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,800
has been rapid and significant.

270
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,280
Yeah.

271
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,720
It looks like there's been some Google Summer of Code

272
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,840
joining in there too.

273
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,480
So maybe that may have played a role,

274
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,440
got some more people interested in the project.

275
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,960
Yeah.

276
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,720
It does have a way of doing that.

277
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,960
And it helps that they've reached some major milestones

278
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,440
recently.

279
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,600
They've been doing that now for a couple of releases.

280
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,320
And I think that helps too, is people, oh, wow,

281
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
they're really making progress here.

282
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,840
And when you start to see progress,

283
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,960
you start to take it much more seriously, I think.

284
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,440
All right.

285
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,160
Speaking of taking things more seriously,

286
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,120
I'm starting to take elementary OS's App Center

287
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,380
pretty seriously.

288
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,280
They hit two major milestones recently.

289
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,640
Number one is 100 native apps for elementary OS.

290
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,400
Oh, boy.

291
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,320
That's a great milestone.

292
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,520
That's a big number, yeah.

293
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,920
And then Cassidy James is blogging over

294
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,120
on their Medium blog about the ability

295
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,240
now to share App Center links directly.

296
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,320
And they're going to give out, think about that

297
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,200
from a blogging standpoint.

298
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,160
You want to give out a link to an application

299
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,920
that you want to cover.

300
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,480
And now you can link directly to it.

301
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,040
One of them is Dippy, which I played with just recently,

302
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,600
is a DPI calculator.

303
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,720
So you can go in there and say, this is my resolution.

304
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,360
I got a desktop.

305
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,160
I got a laptop.

306
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,440
This is what I'm looking for.

307
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,880
What should I have all my settings at?

308
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,120
It's just a nice little DPI calculator.

309
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,760
So some good progress over there.

310
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,200
And I don't know if we have any metrics really to say,

311
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,240
oh, this has been a success, or, oh, this isn't a success.

312
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,760
But 100 is a great milestone.

313
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,480
Now let's see how many of those make it to the next release.

314
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,780
I'd love to see that keep going.

315
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,480
Yeah, I'm curious about what role

316
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,240
in the broader ecosystem of various open source

317
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,160
or proprietary app stores will this play?

318
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,400
And will elementary as an ecosystem play?

319
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,880
OK.

320
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,120
What the hell is going on with SteamOS?

321
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,080
Is that still a thing?

322
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,440
Yeah, only it's kind of just pod fading in a way.

323
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,320
It's distro fading.

324
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,800
It's based on the previous release,

325
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,200
Debbie and Jesse, which reached end of life on June 17.

326
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,160
And that's kind of concerning.

327
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,680
But they have put out some updates.

328
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,840
Steam 2.154 came out, which contains

329
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,600
updates that are really just kind of minor bug fixes.

330
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120
They're nothing major.

331
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,360
All the standard security patches, et cetera,

332
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,120
that roll with a big distro like that.

333
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,160
It's possible that they're working on a stretch version

334
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,240
right now with a new graphic stack and a new kernel.

335
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,160
But SteamOS has developed into, at least

336
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,640
from the perspective of the Linux community,

337
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,360
a bit of an underwhelmer.

338
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm trying to be nice about it.

339
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
So it does sound like from the release notes

340
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,680
that they've recently updated their build infrastructure.

341
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,080
And this update was intentionally

342
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,720
kept small in order to test the waters

343
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,440
before more kernel and graphics drivers changes.

344
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,880
But on what schedule?

345
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,320
Is that going to be that gets released

346
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,480
after the next version of Debian is already gone?

347
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah.

348
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,800
I think it's dead for me, SteamOS.

349
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,120
I just saw a video that Linus Tech Tips did with Wendell.

350
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,400
And he's touting all the benefits of the VFIO GPU

351
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,760
pass-through stuff.

352
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,560
And that, for me, shows that SteamOS is dying.

353
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,240
Because if someone like Linus is going

354
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,200
to approach a topic like GPU pass-through,

355
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,280
it shows that people do want to play games on Linux,

356
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,520
but they're going to run a Windows VM with KVM

357
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,720
and then pass the graphics card through and just do it

358
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,240
that way.

359
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,160
Because it's so easy now to do that.

360
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,120
I disagree.

361
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,640
So I don't think that was how Linus was

362
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,480
wanting to run his games at all.

363
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,040
I think what happened there is Wendell

364
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,120
came on, who knows his stuff, and instead

365
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,240
of demonstrating how a Linux user would run games natively

366
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,720
on Linux, was actually showcasing what he knew

367
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,600
and getting bogged down in installing additional PPAs

368
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,800
for drivers in order to make the Windows version of Wine

369
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,960
Run in order to run Windows versions of games

370
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,320
in the Windows version of Steam on Linux.

371
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,160
And I just felt that it really didn't hit the mark.

372
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't think it did anyone any favors in terms

373
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,840
of actually bringing them over to Linux

374
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,720
as a serious gaming platform, because it

375
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,080
looked like a massive hack.

376
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,640
Thank you.

377
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,320
Thank you.

378
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,280
I have a lot of respect for Wendell,

379
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,440
and I also have a lot of respect for Linus.

380
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,480
As do I.

381
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,960
They've done a lot of good work.

382
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
But that was a hot mess.

383
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,800
And I think it was a combination of the editing folks

384
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,040
and Linus didn't know what was important and what wasn't.

385
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,240
And Wendell wanted to showcase several things, how

386
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,440
you could translate now to Vulkan, DirectX calls

387
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,960
to Vulkan.

388
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,200
So there's new layers of compatibility

389
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,920
coming to Windows gaming on Linux.

390
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,120
He specifically wanted to demonstrate which are three,

391
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,840
because Linus asked for that.

392
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,200
There was a lot of things happening in that video,

393
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,080
but it didn't really do a good job

394
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,240
of showing native Linux gaming, which

395
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,480
is quite strong on a lot of systems right now.

396
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,520
And I think they did miss the mark.

397
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,000
And it did kind of make me go, OK, we have a lot of things

398
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,240
going right now.

399
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,120
We do have virtualization pass-through,

400
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,040
which is a great, great option for a lot of folks.

401
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,440
We're starting to build the ability now

402
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,800
to have DirectX calls get converted to Vulkan calls,

403
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,400
which is going to just bring wine to the next level.

404
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,560
The video demonstrated those things.

405
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,320
But I felt like it was, as an ambassador video

406
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,040
from the Linux community to Windows gamers,

407
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,800
I felt like it underdelivered in a lot of ways.

408
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,360
Yeah.

409
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,720
Now, what's happened is that on Twitter,

410
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,120
there's been a little get together of Linux gamers

411
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,220
and people interested in Linux gaming.

412
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,840
And there's an effort to crowdsource five seconds

413
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,280
of 1080p video for every Linux native game, which

414
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,160
is going to be stitched together in a showcase in response

415
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,520
to that video.

416
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,720
So yeah, I'll dig you out a link you

417
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,040
can include in the show notes.

418
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,200
Because if anyone wants to get involved,

419
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,740
they've got a big spreadsheet of who's

420
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,680
doing the clip for each of the games.

421
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,680
That's a great idea.

422
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,160
But I wonder how long that's going to be.

423
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,400
How many games are there?

424
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,720
It's hundreds of games already.

425
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,880
It's going to take a while just to stitch it all together.

426
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,500
Love it.

427
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,640
Well, while we're talking about games,

428
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,960
we've been discussing Linux apps coming to Chromebooks.

429
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,280
Pretty big deal.

430
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,960
And it looks like they're also working towards GPU acceleration

431
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,840
on these Chromebooks that are running Linux apps.

432
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,400
For Linux apps?

433
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,520
Yeah, for the Linux apps.

434
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,760
Through the Chromebook GPU layer?

435
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,840
Yeah, so it's part of the Vert.io subsystem for,

436
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,480
and specifically, the Vert GPU subsystem.

437
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,440
So yeah, it is part of the same system.

438
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,120
It's using some of that same plumbing

439
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,320
that we just talked about in the Linux Tech Tips video.

440
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,720
Yeah, really, really interesting.

441
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,960
Because not only does that give you certain games,

442
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,380
but that's going to give you certain applications that just

443
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,600
work better with 3D acceleration.

444
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,200
And it also means that this is going

445
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,960
to take this Chrome Linux app support

446
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,840
and make it full-fledged, like a lot less limitations here.

447
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,000
And this should be landing, some of this,

448
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,440
beginning in Chrome OS 69.

449
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,440
And then the idea would be to focus

450
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,680
on getting all of the key functionality into Chrome OS 70.

451
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,760
This feels like that could now be a serious developer

452
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,440
workstation, almost, for the enterprise,

453
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,680
because they have all the management stuff for Chrome OS,

454
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,080
or just for your kid that you want to play with Linux,

455
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,120
but also don't have to deal with having to re-image his machine

456
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,680
all the time.

457
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,200
Yeah, it does feel a bit like traveling to the moon

458
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,200
and back to run a Linux app on a Linux box.

459
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,440
You know what I mean?

460
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,200
There's a few layers of indirection here.

461
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,880
You could also just install the GTK libraries

462
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,080
and just run the damn application.

463
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,440
I mean, that would be an option.

464
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,760
And it's not, you know what?

465
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,560
I'm just going to tell you, it's not going to break the system.

466
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,080
But is it Googs approved?

467
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,080
No, because it's not in a container, Wes.

468
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,480
It's not in a contained environment.

469
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,800
So exactly.

470
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,760
It's good to have the physical bell sometimes.

471
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,880
So anyways, I think this is, I mean,

472
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,880
I just, I dream of a day when I jump on a plane

473
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,120
and all I have to bring with me is a Chromebook.

474
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,040
Because I just, I love the idea of something like 13 inches,

475
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,560
a couple hundred bucks, it could get destroyed, it could get lost.

476
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,040
But at the same time, I could run QO notes.

477
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,160
I could maybe even run a few games.

478
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,800
Like, a Chromebook's all fine and dandy.

479
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,000
I want QO notes.

480
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,760
I want that now.

481
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,840
Right, you've spent a long time developing

482
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,040
specific Linux-based workflows, and you can just

483
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,200
patch that right on top?

484
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,760
Right.

485
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,840
Or imagine if I could run Reaper on a Chromebook.

486
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,880
There is some serious possibilities there.

487
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,600
And as hardware gets faster and that price point gets lower,

488
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,440
it might not be totally feasible today.

489
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,960
But it is actually possible that in a few years

490
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,400
we could have four-core and six-core Chromebooks.

491
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,440
And I mean, half of what it's optimized for

492
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,120
is browsing the web, which with all of our electron apps

493
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,600
and other things is basically all I'm doing besides the terminal

494
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,080
anyway.

495
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,800
I know.

496
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,880
Yeah.

497
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,320
Yeah, it is going to be the year of the Linux desktop.

498
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,440
And the thing is, they have a ton of time

499
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,600
to work this out to sort of shave off the rough edges over time

500
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,480
and then just really wait Microsoft and Apple out.

501
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,240
Like, imagine if Apple switched to ARM,

502
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,040
and Microsoft moves more and more to the cloud

503
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,800
and to Azure-based revenue and pulls back more and more

504
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,520
on Windows over time.

505
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,880
And Apple keeps missing the boat on Macs.

506
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,040
These vendors are just distracted.

507
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Microsoft's going to be more and more distracted

508
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,200
by devices and Azure and services.

509
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,920
And Apple is and has been distracted for a long time

510
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,080
now by iOS.

511
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,680
So Google is kind of nailing this at the right moment.

512
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,140
I'm not saying they're going to have

513
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,960
some sort of huge tide of adoption here,

514
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,000
but they're nailing this at just the right moment.

515
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,320
It's funny, too, because kind of quietly, you know,

516
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,280
it's not a big, necessarily huge branding, marketing push.

517
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,760
It's just rolling out and work is being done.

518
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,040
And yet, it might have some actual impacts.

519
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,480
Yeah.

520
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,160
We'll see.

521
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,440
I'm pretty excited by it.

522
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,040
Anybody out there going to get a Chromebook and try this?

523
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,240
Anybody going to actually put their money down and buy

524
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,760
one of these suckers?

525
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,600
No.

526
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,160
No.

527
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,680
No.

528
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,480
No.

529
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,160
No.

530
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,720
Hmm.

531
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,800
I might.

532
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,920
I might, but not.

533
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,960
Fake computer.

534
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,140
Noah's already bought one.

535
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,880
Well, of course he has.

536
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,640
Noah is already.

537
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,160
We're talking Noah.

538
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,600
He already got one.

539
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,640
And I'm not even sure if he's got the right model or not,

540
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,200
but he just got one.

541
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,040
It does seem like if you had a really nice Linux gaming

542
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,320
desktop setup that that could be the perfect little cheapo

543
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,800
satellite that you replace every couple of years.

544
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,680
Yeah.

545
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,480
I know.

546
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,960
Is that the draw, or is it a cost thing?

547
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,480
Well, actually, I use a Chromebook that's

548
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,280
provided by my IT department.

549
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,760
Well, we got those devices because it's

550
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,760
tough to go into our ticketing system with a mobile device.

551
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,800
And that, and also, it's another way

552
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,760
to easily type emails and respond to clients easier

553
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,880
than on a mobile device.

554
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,400
And it's pretty reliable when it comes to Wi-Fi connectivity.

555
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,600
It's one of the cheapo acers.

556
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,880
It does support the Play Store, too.

557
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,720
But I'm not sure if it supports the Linux apps yet.

558
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,320
I could definitely see it as, like, I'm

559
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,680
going to go do some emails.

560
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,600
I'm going to just do some basic web browsing.

561
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,200
And I've got hardware on either end of where I'm traveling.

562
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,800
I could really.

563
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,040
Like, I have a machine at home, and I

564
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,480
have a machine in the studio.

565
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,160
And I see it less, maybe, for people like us,

566
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,240
as well as people casually interested in Linux,

567
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,840
or maybe people who are professionally

568
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,600
using Linux as developers or other things,

569
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,000
but don't have very much interest in managing

570
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,520
a whole Linux operating system.

571
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,440
Yeah, well, yeah, there's probably a lot of.

572
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,120
You know what?

573
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,640
You know what the reality is we should just acknowledge here?

574
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,240
So that way we just, it's the elf in the room.

575
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,960
There are millions of more people

576
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,460
that fit that description than the people that are interested

577
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,680
in managing a Linux box.

578
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,120
There are millions of more people, right?

579
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
So let's be real about what the market is here.

580
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,240
My wife wanted a laptop two or three years ago,

581
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,160
and I got her a ThinkPad for 150 pounds.

582
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,760
It was, at that point, two years old.

583
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,120
And if cost is your main argument,

584
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,600
then I think the used laptop market is perfectly

585
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,320
serviceable for Linux.

586
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,160
But then if we are talking about this mythical new Linux

587
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,640
user who comes out of the swamp and wants to use a new box,

588
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,120
maybe a Chromebook's a good shout.

589
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,160
But I don't see too many of those, to be fair.

590
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,040
So that new user, there's been, I

591
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,540
don't know if you've seen these, there's

592
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,000
been a couple of articles in Forbes this week.

593
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,420
Yeah, I casually, via Twitter, invited him on the show,

594
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,840
and I haven't heard back.

595
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,920
So I'll give you some background on that.

596
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,280
So first of all, these articles were really good timing,

597
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,360
because the first one came out about two minutes

598
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,940
before I was about to give a presentation last week

599
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,280
in Montreal.

600
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,480
And it perfectly summarized everything

601
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,700
I was talking about, how the 1804 releases joined up

602
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,440
all of these things we were working towards.

603
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,600
And this is an operating system we can be proud of.

604
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,120
And people are using it and finding the software

605
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,740
that they want.

606
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,880
And this article said all of those things.

607
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,440
So I was able to flash it up as the concluding point.

608
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,140
The author of that article has said

609
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,920
that these two posts he's done about switching from Windows

610
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,600
to Ubuntu have been 10 times more successful than anything

611
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,400
he's written previously, which is why he's

612
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
going to continue the series.

613
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,200
And he's actually reached out to us at work

614
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,440
and asked us to help with the next installment, which

615
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,520
is a throwback to our earlier conversation

616
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,640
about gaming on Linux.

617
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,280
This is the thing that he's going to be looking into next.

618
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,040
Ah-ha.

619
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,000
I'd love to know how sticky that switch is

620
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,880
for a lot of those new Windows users.

621
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,720
Because I know, personally, a few years ago,

622
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,080
I switched probably several times a year.

623
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,400
And then, oh, there isn't this one thing.

624
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,440
So I went back to Windows.

625
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,720
I'd love to know how sticky Linux is for these guys.

626
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,880
I think what's changed, at least from talking to him,

627
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,480
is that he first of all installed Linux Mint.

628
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,120
And that didn't stick.

629
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,320
And then he installed Ubuntu 1804.

630
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,160
And I think the main reason why it stuck

631
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,200
was because the first run wizard gives you

632
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,140
this flash up of, here's some interesting software

633
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,640
you can install.

634
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,520
And that included all of the things

635
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,920
that he wanted to install.

636
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,320
He wanted to install Telegram and Spotify and Skype

637
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,480
and all of that stuff that's presented there.

638
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,160
And I think that was like a tipping point of, ah,

639
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,720
here's all of the things that I need.

640
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,600
And that encouraged him to then stick with it for a bit longer

641
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,640
and explore a bit more deeply.

642
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,600
It really does make a difference.

643
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,220
It seems to us technical users like such a small thing.

644
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,480
It almost seems irrelevant.

645
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,840
But it makes all of the difference to users

646
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,200
that are coming to the platform for the first time.

647
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,800
And there is real value in brand recognition.

648
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,760
There's real value in seeing brands

649
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,720
that you recognize on that Linux desktop.

650
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,040
Oftentimes, that's all you have.

651
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,920
It's like sort of a proxy for trust and for reliability

652
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,000
and just like, can I get my work done?

653
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,800
So what else can you tell me about that?

654
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,680
Because it sounds like you know more about the story.

655
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,880
Well, I know what the next, well,

656
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,040
I was saying the next piece is going to be on gaming.

657
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,760
But looking at the comments on Twitter

658
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,560
and the comments on the articles,

659
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,200
there seems to be not, I mean,

660
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,720
there's only hundreds of thousands of views

661
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,260
on the article itself.

662
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,940
But there seems to be a lot of people

663
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,280
who have been thinking about making the switch

664
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,860
and needed some sort of confirmation

665
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,480
in like the mainstream media

666
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
because they don't follow our communities

667
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,800
in these corners of the internet where we live.

668
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,680
And it's given them confidence to go out and try.

669
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,280
And what's been really good to see, uncharacteristically,

670
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,220
is other people out there who are running Linux

671
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,300
of one flavor or another and saying,

672
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,320
yeah, there's lots of good reasons to switch.

673
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,780
You know, here's this software

674
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,640
that could fill this particular need for you.

675
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,040
So it's been quite a positive thing

676
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,760
and uncharacteristically so considering

677
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,560
what we normally see when you get these articles

678
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,280
about switching to Linux and then it's a big bun fight

679
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,080
about you're using the wrong Linux and all the rest of it.

680
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,480
What do you suppose is different now?

681
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
Why is that?

682
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,240
Why has that not been, oh, you should have tried Arch.

683
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,120
Oh, you should have tried OpenSUSE.

684
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,280
Why has it instead been, because you're right.

685
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,900
I've been following the discussion as well

686
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,200
because I wanted to ask him about it

687
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,480
if he came on the show.

688
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,240
And it has been a lot of more like, can I help you?

689
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,840
Can I, is there anything I can do for you?

690
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,680
Do you have any questions?

691
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,840
What do you think's changed?

692
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,680
What's shifted?

693
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,720
I don't think anything's changed.

694
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,560
I disagree.

695
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,540
See, I think it's the switch to GNOME.

696
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,640
I think Ubuntu switching to GNOME and then working upstream

697
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,000
and being at Guadec and all of those things,

698
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,920
I feel like have maybe changed the response possibly.

699
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,440
I think a lot of people are exposed to a lot more Linux

700
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,560
at work now than they ever were before

701
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,480
with the rise of AWS.

702
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,200
You end up with a lot more people doing quote unquote DevOps

703
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,800
that was traditionally the sysadmins domain

704
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,520
and they never touched infrastructure.

705
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,000
And I think that's made quite a big difference.

706
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,080
With regards to GNOME and the reception that Ubuntu

707
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,120
is getting these days, I think it's two things.

708
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,920
Yes, I think to some extent it's returning to GNOME,

709
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,000
doing that in the right way,

710
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,240
contributing upstream very visibly.

711
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,260
I think all of the publicity and the blog posts

712
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,780
that were done through that 1710 cycle

713
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,360
to sort of chronicle that laid things out.

714
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,240
And I think there's a return to involving the community

715
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,960
with the new community theme that's in development

716
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,600
and will feature in 1810, which has now got its name.

717
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,960
But I think what was different with what I saw

718
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,280
with the commentary here,

719
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,960
it wasn't posted in the usual places the Linux community,

720
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,500
whatever that is, hang out.

721
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,120
It wasn't in our Linux.

722
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,140
It was in the comments of Forbes

723
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,800
and the comments of the tweets from the journalist

724
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,480
where our usual community don't hang out.

725
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,780
And I think maybe the response was more positive

726
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,680
because the people that were following on there

727
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,480
who had some experience with Linux

728
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,200
are maybe a little bit more pragmatic and level-headed

729
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,760
and not so sort of bipolar in terms of which distribution

730
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,760
that they would insist you have to use.

731
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,200
Right, so the areas in which it was spread

732
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,100
and talked about, the usual grouches didn't organize.

733
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,940
Yeah, that's my feeling at least anyway.

734
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,420
Yeah, I mean, I think there is,

735
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,720
especially as enthusiast people

736
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,640
who put a lot of identity into our use and love

737
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,480
of this operating system,

738
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,840
it's very different than just sort of the thing you're like,

739
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,240
oh, some casual news about how maybe

740
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,480
that makes my life easier

741
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,540
or a plus one for that thing I like.

742
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,280
Yeah, and I would actually add to that a bit.

743
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,420
And Brent, I think you could probably echo the sentiment

744
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,600
a degree as well.

745
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,600
And that is when you wanna just try switching

746
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,320
over your workflow to Linux

747
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,060
and the first bits of feedback you start to get are,

748
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,120
oh, you're dumb, you chose the wrong distribution.

749
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,240
That's a big turnoff.

750
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,120
That's a big, that's like this big,

751
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,440
like almost judgment that gets passed on you right away.

752
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,440
And it comes across feeling sort of like

753
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,960
you just get shut down in this

754
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
what was otherwise an exciting adventure.

755
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,960
And that kind of feedback isn't exclusive to user adoption.

756
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,920
Again, I think it was this week or last week,

757
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,660
Herey posted a blog about their experience

758
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,340
bringing a proprietary application to Linux.

759
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,760
And they touch on this that they went to seek out

760
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,420
the Linux community and where they started their journey

761
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,080
was on our Linux.

762
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,360
And based on the feedback they got there,

763
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,360
they dropped their plans to have a Linux client.

764
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,640
Herey, by the way, is an email client

765
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,440
specifically targeted at Exchange and Office 365.

766
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,000
And it's multi-platform, but they wanted to do Linux

767
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,840
and they were really dissuaded from doing so

768
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,840
because of the reception that they got there.

769
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,520
And then as it happens, Alan Popey

770
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,600
actually saw their application randomly some weeks later

771
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,560
and contacted them and worked with them

772
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,000
and helped bring Herey to the Snap store.

773
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,760
And this blog post then talks about

774
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,440
how this turned around their perception

775
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,200
about dealing with the Linux community

776
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,080
because they were dealing with a different Linux community

777
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,160
once they came into that platform

778
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,640
and they were welcomed and they were encouraged.

779
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,920
And then their blog post is very even-handed.

780
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,460
I think it points out some of the drawbacks

781
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,600
of targeting Linux and some of the plus points

782
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,680
and some of the plus points are actually

783
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Linux users are specifically helpful

784
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,500
in debugging and raising issues

785
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,680
and giving you technical insight into your application.

786
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,760
But Herey have gone from being turned off to a year later,

787
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,640
they're now making 25% of their revenue off the Snap.

788
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,360
Yeah, so I wanna talk about that

789
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,460
because I think that is a really interesting story.

790
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,260
And I think it's also fascinating in the context

791
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,960
of Reaper just coming out for Linux,

792
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,240
which is the editing software we use

793
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,080
to produce our shows and record right now this show

794
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,960
and also the dictator,

795
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,440
benevolent dictator for life of Slackware

796
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,960
coming out today saying I'm completely broke

797
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,600
and I've been getting scammed by the Slackware store.

798
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,400
I feel like all of that is,

799
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,520
I think that's what we should move to.

800
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,380
So before we switch to that,

801
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,320
so Wimpy, that was the tease.

802
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,280
Brent, I wanted to,

803
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,440
I know you were gonna say something there.

804
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,680
I wanted to come back to you for a moment.

805
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,440
Just wrapping this, putting a button on this conversation

806
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,520
just so we can move on and talk

807
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,960
what Wimpy just shifted to.

808
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Is there really, is there a big turnoff

809
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,120
if you were switching over to Linux

810
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,160
and people come at you and say it's the wrong distro

811
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,360
or could you just talk to that for a moment?

812
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,480
Yeah, I feel, so I've helped several users

813
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,640
move over as a professional service, I'll cut it.

814
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,720
But what I've noticed is that

815
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,180
it's hard enough to get someone to think about

816
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,880
changing their entire workflow.

817
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,040
And so to get that sort of discouragement

818
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,560
of someone saying, oh, you did it all wrong

819
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,340
or whoever helped you suggested the wrong thing

820
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,320
is a real turn down.

821
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,480
But what I like hearing here is that

822
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,760
when there is a suggestion that

823
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,160
any distribution is better than what you had before,

824
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,840
then I think that's really the direction

825
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,720
that we should be applauding people who are new users

826
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,760
and to encourage them to really explore

827
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,160
instead of being discouraged, right?

828
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
We shouldn't be saying, oh, why'd you do it that way?

829
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,520
You should have done it this way.

830
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,920
Instead, the conversation be,

831
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,780
oh, hey, you should try this one too, right?

832
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,360
You're striking out from Windows

833
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,320
or you're striking out from the Mac, congratulations.

834
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,120
Exactly, yeah, I couldn't agree more with that.

835
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,500
When we were doing Foss Talk Live a couple of months ago,

836
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,560
one of the segments in the late night Linux live podcast

837
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,100
was what do you wish would change

838
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,260
in the next five years in Linux?

839
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,140
And Will Cook made the point that he just wished

840
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,060
everyone could just get along.

841
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,200
We all believe in the same thing.

842
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,180
We've all got a slightly different thing

843
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,020
that we believe in,

844
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,500
but when people come to the thing that we believe in,

845
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,840
we should welcome them and we shouldn't fight.

846
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,680
And I nearly stood up and applauded when he said this

847
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,600
because I felt so strongly that he was correct about this.

848
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,240
And I really wish we would see this sort of mentality change,

849
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,960
this fighting, this infighting,

850
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,120
people adopting party lines, factions,

851
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,960
within the community and slagging each other off

852
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,320
is just really tired and frustrating.

853
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,680
Yeah, and I think we've probably talked it

854
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,080
as much as we can on this show in the past.

855
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,960
This is an area, though,

856
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,680
that both Wimpy and I care a lot about, and if you do too,

857
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,440
I would encourage you to check the back catalog.

858
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,240
I'll just really quickly say every week

859
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,740
I hear a story or two from somebody who's burned out

860
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,020
just because of that issue,

861
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,360
and they don't wanna make a big deal about it.

862
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,720
Not everybody wants to burn down the web with a blog post.

863
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,920
They just kind of quietly go off into the sunset.

864
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,800
And it's like we should come up with,

865
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,920
maybe if we came up with a term

866
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,960
and we had a website and a logo,

867
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,640
then maybe it would get more attention then.

868
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,400
All right, so Wimpy really just,

869
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,060
he just cracked that can of worms right the heck open

870
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,760
just a moment ago.

871
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,160
Mentioned, if you've heard about Hiri, H-I-R-I,

872
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,600
it is a really fancy-looking,

873
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,480
super well-designed email client

874
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,920
that we haven't talked a lot about.

875
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,320
In fact, if you read the blog post,

876
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,780
podcasters have outright refused to talk about it.

877
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,480
Joe, Joe Resington.

878
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,280
Podcasters have outright refused to talk about it.

879
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
So let's talk about what they're claiming

880
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,040
about some of the difficulties they've had

881
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,920
about moving a commercial product over to Linux.

882
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,400
And then I wanna conclude it all

883
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,760
by discussing why I think Reaper coming to Linux

884
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,620
is a massive deal,

885
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,620
even though Ardour is out there and open source.

886
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,880
And the shitstorm I'm getting just for saying that already,

887
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,900
which is amazing, I wanna talk about all of that.

888
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,000
Plus we'll end it all on a few ways for you

889
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,940
to examine the performance of your Linux box,

890
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,780
look at perhaps the PSI of your system,

891
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,440
if Facebook has their way,

892
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,040
and then a tool that will give you

893
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,760
essentially a quick snapshot

894
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,520
of all the essential information you need

895
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,820
on the command line about your GNU slash Linux box,

896
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,680
and yes, that situation going over at Slackware.

897
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,800
So let's take a moment and thank DigitalOcean

898
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,520
for making this episode possible.

899
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,120
Do.co, oh, slash unplugged.

900
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,600
So you got to go to the do, to the dot co,

901
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,080
to the slash unplugged,

902
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,240
so that way you can get the $100 credit over at DigitalOcean.

903
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,040
And you know they're not gonna offer this forever,

904
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,400
so go take advantage of this

905
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,280
while you're hearing these words of wisdom

906
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,080
come from my mouth hole into your ear holes.

907
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,640
Do it right now, do.co slash unplugged,

908
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,160
you get a $100 credit for 60 days

909
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,480
when you sign up with a new account over at DigitalOcean,

910
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,520
now they have industry leading price and performance,

911
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,960
I don't say that lightly.

912
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,760
My favorite system, the three cents an hour rig is amazing,

913
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,880
and they have systems that go up to nearly 200 gigs of RAM.

914
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,080
What? I know.

915
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,760
80 gigs of SSD, three terabytes of transfer,

916
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,320
two beautiful CPUs,

917
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,560
four gigabytes of the random access memory,

918
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,640
and I get that all for three cents an hour.

919
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,680
You can get one that's $5 a month,

920
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,240
that's $10 for every two months,

921
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,480
you can imagine how far you can get though

922
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,040
with a $100 credit.

923
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,360
They also have flexible droplets

924
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,040
where you can mix and match the resources

925
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,720
depending on what your application needs,

926
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,640
and you can deploy the entire application.

927
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,260
So you want GitLab, we actually are doing that right now.

928
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,240
As we record, there is someone mysterious in the background

929
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,000
who has been on the show before in the Mumble Room,

930
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,280
but is not here today, and may be here next week,

931
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,080
who is deploying GitLab on a DigitalOcean droplet

932
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,760
to manage some projects for us over here

933
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,600
at Jupiter Broadcasting.

934
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,000
What? Wow.

935
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,440
Yeah, and it's just one of those nice things

936
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,960
where because we have a team account,

937
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,000
he has access to my resources,

938
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,520
so he can deploy it under my account,

939
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,120
so ultimately I have total control over it all,

940
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,720
but I can have someone in the community work with me.

941
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,440
And I just love the flexibility that DigitalOcean brings,

942
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,120
and the interface is super easy to use,

943
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,640
so managing DNS or SSH keys is easy,

944
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,940
and they have lots of documentation as well.

945
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,520
So go to do.co slash unplugged to get a $100 credit.

946
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,400
That's, you know, I mean $100.

947
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,000
Oh man, I can think of all the fun ways

948
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,840
I could burn through that credit.

949
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,840
I mean, even on a Seattle budget, $100 is not bad.

950
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,680
You know what I'm saying?

951
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,480
That's some pretty good spending money.

952
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
Speaking of Seattle budgets, Ting.

953
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,720
Let's go over to linux.ting.com right now.

954
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,920
linux.ting.com, it's smarter than unlimited.

955
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,440
If you use less, you just fricking pay less.

956
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,920
Here is the best part about it.

957
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,200
It's just $6 a month for your phone, plus what you use.

958
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,480
So if you're texting the ladies or the guys a lot,

959
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,160
you're gonna pay a little more for texts,

960
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,840
but if you don't text the ladies or the guys a lot,

961
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,680
then you won't pay anything for texts.

962
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,240
If you use a lot of data, you'll pay for data that month.

963
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,160
So like last month, I used more data.

964
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,840
I'll pay that month, but for the other 11 months of the year,

965
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,200
I pay a lot less because I'm always on wifi.

966
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,680
I also do not use the phone.

967
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,000
I've got Slack, I've got Telegram,

968
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,560
I've got Skype, I've got FaceTime.

969
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,320
Why would I actually make an actual phone call?

970
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,760
In fact, little fun Ting fact for you.

971
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,960
I spent the last collectively two months in Texas

972
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,200
and never made a single phone call.

973
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,600
Spent a lot of time on the FaceTime

974
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,960
with my internet phone from Apple.

975
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm so fancy you.

976
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,440
Using the FaceTime audio,

977
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,800
and then you add that with some earbuds and stuff,

978
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,080
it is a great way to go.

979
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,720
And never, never used a minute.

980
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,720
I mean, what do you wanna be on that publicly switched

981
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,600
telephone network for?

982
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,160
Anyway, that's last century technology.

983
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,600
Please Wes, so beyond that, please.

984
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,160
I want my voice in packets.

985
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,720
And that's why I love Ting.

986
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,560
So when I'm on wifi, I just use wifi.

987
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,840
And if I need the cellular network is like a data backup,

988
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,680
I've always got it.

989
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,320
They've got nationwide coverage.

990
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,280
Ting has you covered from coast to coast,

991
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,680
and they have CDMA and GSM.

992
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,520
They have both of them.

993
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,680
Whatever you want on the multiple of the frequencies.

994
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,800
And here's the best part.

995
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
The contracts, they don't got them.

996
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,560
No early termination fees,

997
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,520
no quote unquote service agreements.

998
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,680
You just pay for what you use,

999
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,960
and when you're done, you can stop.

1000
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,200
You can do it all through the website,

1001
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,960
or you can talk to one of their really great

1002
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,240
customer service reps.

1003
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,160
So go check it out.

1004
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,040
Just go to linux.ting.com.

1005
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,880
That'll take $25 off a phone if you wanna grab one

1006
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,040
from the Tings.

1007
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,800
And if you bring one, and like I said,

1008
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,240
they got the GSM and they got the CDMAs,

1009
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,480
then you could just get $25 in service credits.

1010
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,960
And Wes is gonna sit here and tell you

1011
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,760
that's gonna probably pay for more than your first month.

1012
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,600
Right, Wes?

1013
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,440
I would be very surprised.

1014
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,800
Or you have a lot of friends,

1015
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,160
and hey, that's not a bad problem.

1016
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah.

1017
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,240
You know what, you're right.

1018
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,600
Oh, so what you're saying is the reason why my Ting bill

1019
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,080
is so low is because I don't have any friends.

1020
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,160
I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't make that connection,

1021
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,640
but yes.

1022
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,600
You know what, you might be right, actually.

1023
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,320
You know what, plus I talk to them all over Telegram, right?

1024
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,840
It's all those gifts you send, buddy.

1025
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,880
It is, right?

1026
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,600
Anyways, go check them out, linux.ting.com,

1027
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,040
and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring

1028
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,680
the Unplugged program, linux.ting.com.

1029
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,120
First sponsor, first sponsor of the show right there.

1030
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,960
Deserve it.

1031
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,160
I gotta also say a big thank you to Linux Academy,

1032
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,000
number two sponsor of the show, boom, right in there.

1033
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,920
Hot after Ting was Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com.

1034
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,760
That's where you go to sign up and support the show

1035
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,520
and get a free seven-day trial of a platform that

1036
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,000
is growing like crazy.

1037
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,840
They just had a live stream today

1038
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,680
where they announced the essentials of AWS Lambda,

1039
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,480
which is awesome.

1040
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,520
They completely rebuilt their Lambda courseware.

1041
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,520
Nice.

1042
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,560
AWS Security Essentials was also announced.

1043
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,280
That's important.

1044
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,480
Last week, Red Hat Enterprise Security Essentials

1045
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,920
and a bunch of container management courseware,

1046
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,960
as well as Salt and OpenStack has been announced.

1047
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,720
They are rolling out more than 150 bits

1048
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,560
of new content, courseware challenges,

1049
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,440
and more at Linux Academy.

1050
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,240
And you can try it out at linuxacademy.com slash

1051
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,080
Unplugged.

1052
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,840
They have so much in the works.

1053
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,200
I just got a taste of some of it.

1054
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,280
And I gotta tell you, there's never

1055
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,920
been a better time to subscribe, because they are super fired

1056
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,720
up about creating new content as accurately

1057
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,180
and as fast as possible.

1058
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,280
And they are building a team around checking things,

1059
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,360
making sure things stay up to date,

1060
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,960
and that the best people are on those topics.

1061
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,680
Your subscription will be worth it.

1062
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,880
Go to linuxacademy.com slash Unplugged

1063
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,800
to learn more about anything that runs Linux

1064
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
or that Linux runs on top of.

1065
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,640
And why not go check out their YouTube channel?

1066
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,940
Not only did they just recently announce some new Google

1067
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,200
platform courseware and some really good stuff,

1068
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,620
including you get some videos of some of the different people

1069
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,920
behind the scenes, but their live streams,

1070
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,540
which I've been on for a couple of them

1071
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,280
and the one they had today, are all over on the linuxacademy.com

1072
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
YouTube channel.

1073
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,480
So you can see everything they've announced recently.

1074
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,280
You can see my live stream appearances,

1075
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,680
including me eating a cupcake that had gold dust on it

1076
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,800
that then got in my beard, which stayed in my beard

1077
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,240
for the rest of the live stream.

1078
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,440
And that's why, even after 13 years of broadcasting

1079
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,880
on the internet, I haven't learned

1080
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,040
to not eat gold cupcakes on a live stream.

1081
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,800
You can see that as well.

1082
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,360
That's a thing that happened.

1083
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,440
linuxacademy.com slash Unplugged.

1084
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,160
But it was delicious frosting.

1085
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,360
And nobody else was eating it.

1086
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,880
It was like a poppy seed.

1087
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,040
Oh, I love poppy seeds.

1088
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,720
Yeah, it was like a poppy seed batter

1089
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,720
that they had for the cupcakes.

1090
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,760
This is a fancy cupcake also, so I

1091
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,800
think you can be forgiven for indulging just a little.

1092
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,800
That's how they celebrate OpenStack's birthday.

1093
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,000
They know what they're doing.

1094
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,200
Yeah, they're fans over there.

1095
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,560
linuxacademy.com slash Unplugged.

1096
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,400
OK, so let's talk about a couple of tools you can use.

1097
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,040
And then we'll cover those later.

1098
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,320
We'll cover those later.

1099
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:44,880
Screw it.

1100
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,040
Let's get into the topic.

1101
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,920
Let's talk about Heri and that email client.

1102
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,620
We were going to talk about the tools,

1103
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,200
but I just want to move right to this.

1104
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,080
This has been something that got me personally fired up

1105
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,960
because they took a shot at Linux podcasters,

1106
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,680
and they called our Linux part of the Linux community.

1107
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,600
And those two things make me very, very, very angry.

1108
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,440
And I don't know what to do for these guys

1109
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,960
because they did their best.

1110
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,000
You know, they reached out to Canonical.

1111
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,160
They worked on making a Snap package.

1112
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,880
And you can't expect them to spend 15 years in the community

1113
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,240
and learn every esoteric aspect of our tribe

1114
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,920
before they try to launch a product.

1115
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,300
So I don't have any good advice for them,

1116
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,900
but there are several things in this post that

1117
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,080
really piss me the hell off.

1118
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,880
And I feel like they are representative

1119
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,800
of a much, much, much larger problem that

1120
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,960
is becoming worse than ever, than I have ever witnessed.

1121
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,320
I've been using Linux since the 90s as an end user,

1122
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,960
and I have never seen this headwind

1123
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,420
against commercial software.

1124
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,680
So I want to cover all of that.

1125
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,480
Let's start, though, with how they tried to interact.

1126
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,360
Six months before they went to market with their Linux app,

1127
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,000
they went to what they considered

1128
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,800
to be the Linux community, reddit.com slash r slash

1129
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,500
Linux.

1130
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,600
And they wanted to see if people there would

1131
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,040
pay for a proprietary product.

1132
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,340
That's kind of like going to a free water bar

1133
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,480
and trying to sell bottled water.

1134
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,160
I mean, like, I don't know how else to, like,

1135
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,360
and I don't blame them, because where else do you go?

1136
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,980
You're like, oh, I want to find the community for that.

1137
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,180
Well, there's probably a subreddit,

1138
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,440
and sure enough, there is.

1139
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,400
Yeah, where else do you, like, there's nowhere else

1140
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,320
you can go where you can start, like, anyone can just

1141
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,800
start a thread asking a question and then get engaged.

1142
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,920
Like, you go to reddit.

1143
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,900
Like, there's no other option.

1144
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,000
And the problem is every single person over there

1145
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
is a son of a bitch.

1146
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
All of them.

1147
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,920
I'm one of them.

1148
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,480
I'm a son of a bitch.

1149
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,360
I was going to say, yeah, I'm over that.

1150
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,320
I mean, accurate enough.

1151
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,320
Yeah, I mean, our Linux is a, we've

1152
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,600
also just sort of tracked these things over the years

1153
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,840
at Jupyter Broadcasting, because we have Telegram.

1154
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,680
We have email.

1155
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,960
We have YouTube comments.

1156
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,620
We used to have website comments.

1157
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,240
We have Reddit comments.

1158
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,040
We have tweets.

1159
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,320
We have Facebook comments.

1160
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,920
And so we really kind of watch all of this stuff

1161
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,800
across all of these different platforms that

1162
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,560
allow for audience engagement and feedback,

1163
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,180
Instagram, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1164
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,760
And there is a really, really, really close parallel

1165
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,040
to YouTube comments and Reddit comments.

1166
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,680
Same topics, same people they reference, same everything.

1167
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,760
The vernacular, the grammar, all of it, it's the same crowd.

1168
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,940
It is the same people that are commenting on our Linux

1169
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,240
are a lot of them, not all of them.

1170
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,740
I'm not trying to, I shouldn't paint in such broad strokes.

1171
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:35,120
But many of them are also on YouTube making comments.

1172
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,920
Like, there's a lot of similarities there.

1173
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,000
I've been doing this for a really long time.

1174
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,300
I watch all of the comments.

1175
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,920
And then we also track some of them in spreadsheets

1176
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,900
to try to get idea of general audience feedback.

1177
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,480
And it has gotten to the point where Angela

1178
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,680
can read a comment to me.

1179
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
And I can say, that's a Reddit comment.

1180
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,720
That's a YouTube comment.

1181
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,420
That's a tweet.

1182
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,440
That's an email.

1183
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,140
Before she's even told me the source,

1184
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,560
I can tell you where that came from because

1185
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,160
of the type of commentary we get in the different sources.

1186
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,040
This was super, super, super, super obvious to me

1187
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,720
as we were wrapping up Linux Action Show.

1188
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,280
In fact, it was a point of discussion

1189
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,440
that we made just because it was an interesting data point.

1190
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,960
And it's something we've followed

1191
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,840
since the last 10 episodes of Last or So.

1192
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,080
We have followed it in a very close way.

1193
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,400
And I can tell you that the kind of commentary

1194
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,980
you get out of our Linux is some of the most hostile, least

1195
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,560
informed, bigoted type of commentary

1196
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,760
that you will get in the Linux community.

1197
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,680
A small percentage of it is well-informed, well-intentioned,

1198
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,440
and the other percentage is toxic.

1199
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,960
And so that right there is, I think, a huge issue

1200
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,320
because our Linux is going to be representative

1201
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,680
of the community to so many people that

1202
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,880
are investigating the Linux, quote unquote,

1203
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,480
market for the first time.

1204
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,440
I mean, you're absolutely right.

1205
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,280
And it's hard, too, because I think many of the reasons

1206
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,820
that Reddit is a powerful platform,

1207
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,660
it can also be kind of a dangerous platform.

1208
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,020
And there's so many of us that just love Linux

1209
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,680
and just are just trying to get things done and go

1210
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,400
about our lives.

1211
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,040
And I certainly go over there, but I

1212
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,080
don't spend a lot of time there.

1213
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,040
You know, I might see what people

1214
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,680
are talking about, pop in a few threads here or there.

1215
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,440
But if you're completely outside the bubble.

1216
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,120
Oh, yeah.

1217
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,000
I mean, you have no way to know.

1218
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,040
Where else do you go?

1219
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,640
And it's hard because you don't know about all the best blogs

1220
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,160
or the Google Plus pages.

1221
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,080
It's a hard community to key into, and then especially hard,

1222
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,240
I think, for the product area they're targeting

1223
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,680
because, again, it's kind of the theme of this whole show,

1224
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,980
the casual Linux user who doesn't love it enough

1225
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,400
that they want to go spend all their free time at home

1226
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,600
on the Linux subreddit, but would

1227
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,720
love to have this exchange client for their work email.

1228
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,640
Yes, exactly.

1229
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,280
And so as Wimpy implied a little earlier,

1230
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,900
they got a pretty negative response

1231
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,720
when they went to rLinux asking about the interest in this.

1232
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,920
They cite a couple of examples here in their blog post.

1233
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,120
One is, quote, this is going to be a very hard sell being

1234
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,900
a proprietary-based source system to Linux users.

1235
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,000
Many use Linux because they have bought

1236
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,120
into the idea of open source, but good luck with it anyways.

1237
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,760
And then another user writes, if it

1238
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,200
were free and open source software,

1239
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,920
I would have downloaded and compiled it 20 minutes ago.

1240
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,840
So they say after reading these comments,

1241
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,360
they, quote, promptly shelved their Linux ambitions.

1242
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,320
But the guys at Canonical were persuasive.

1243
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,480
They had a vision.

1244
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,040
They wanted to bring Ubuntu to the widest possible audience.

1245
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,560
To do this, they needed to attract more software to the OS.

1246
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,320
More than that, the software should be easy to find,

1247
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,800
update, and install.

1248
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,420
They created Snaps, a software deployment and package

1249
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,840
management system.

1250
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,200
The results would be available on the Ubuntu Software Center,

1251
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,120
amongst other places, which is essentially

1252
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,440
like an app store for Linux.

1253
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,200
We bit the bullet and spent some time creating the Snap.

1254
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,320
The opportunity to reach a new market and scale

1255
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,000
was too good to miss.

1256
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,760
By far, most of our Linux downloads

1257
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,840
now come through Snaps.

1258
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,880
Although tracking exactly where those Snap installs are coming

1259
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,760
from isn't possible at the moment,

1260
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,440
Snaps available are online, and they're

1261
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,920
available for other distros.

1262
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,200
But success in any app store is contingent

1263
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,840
on the amount of exposure you get on the front page

1264
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,500
in editorial areas.

1265
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,740
But financially speaking, I do believe

1266
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,360
you can make a living out of selling software to Linux users

1267
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,080
alone.

1268
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,920
But we couldn't rely on just Linux users right now.

1269
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,920
I'd say it nearly pays for itself,

1270
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,780
and the numbers are gradually increasing.

1271
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:23,720
But the main challenges remain getting the word out.

1272
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,320
Unfortunately, the fundamentalist FOSS mentality

1273
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,400
we encountered on Reddit is still alive and well.

1274
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,080
Some Linux blogs and podcasts simply

1275
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,320
won't give us the time of day.

1276
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,140
If Linux as a platform is going to succeed,

1277
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,640
Linux users should think about the riches

1278
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,000
of the entire ecosystem rather than to seek to limit it.

1279
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,440
There's just a lot in there.

1280
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,160
There is just a ton of that.

1281
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,660
I mean, so much of it, I think, also

1282
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,080
comes down to how we represent ourselves

1283
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,000
or how disparate parts of the community self-organize.

1284
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,720
Because proprietary software used

1285
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,320
to be, for a long time, the norm.

1286
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,380
And in many ways, open source, free software

1287
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,920
was a reactionary movement against that.

1288
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,620
And so I think it is legitimate that there

1289
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,120
can be sub-communities that say, no, I

1290
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,960
want to build a life for myself on this stuff.

1291
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,420
And frankly, I'm just not interested

1292
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,880
in your proprietary product.

1293
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,320
That doesn't mean that you shouldn't

1294
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,240
be able to do that as part of the community.

1295
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,740
And then how do you identify that?

1296
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,280
How do you know who you're talking to?

1297
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,400
I guess I feel like I wish he knew he could come on this show.

1298
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,720
We have an open mumble room.

1299
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,080
He could come in here, and they could tell us

1300
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,960
about this cool application they're building.

1301
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,240
They didn't have to ask for permission.

1302
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,280
They could just be here and telling us about it.

1303
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,880
And they say that the podcaster has turned them down.

1304
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,040
That's not true.

1305
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,920
I mean, maybe some podcasts did, but other podcasts

1306
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,200
would be interested in what you're doing.

1307
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,600
There's different markets.

1308
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,000
I think you and I both have a realistic look at it.

1309
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,500
There's people out there that are trying

1310
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,360
to use Linux in environments that have been traditionally

1311
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,960
Microsoft-centric.

1312
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,020
Very much so, yeah.

1313
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,120
That was me early on.

1314
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,800
If it wasn't for Crossover Office and Xandros

1315
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,920
and later on Evolution with its Exchange Connector,

1316
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,800
I wouldn't have been able to switch to Linux

1317
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,280
in the workplace.

1318
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,520
And now when there's applications like Heri here,

1319
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,120
H-I-R-I, that support Exchange, well, that's

1320
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,680
a question we get every single week,

1321
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,240
is how do I use Exchange under Linux?

1322
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,760
So I would have been very happy to talk to this person,

1323
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,440
but they don't know when they're outside the community,

1324
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,880
when they're outside our bubble, when they're outside our echo

1325
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,200
chamber, like Wimpy was talking about with the Forbes editor.

1326
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,400
They just don't simply know.

1327
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,760
So what can we do here, Wimpy?

1328
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,280
I think the first point that we start with

1329
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,320
is where do people go and find the Linux community?

1330
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:41,800
There's no one place to go and visit and be part of it

1331
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,960
and sound it out.

1332
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,160
Our Linux is just one of the many online communities

1333
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,400
for Linux.

1334
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,880
So yeah, that's a tricky one, because we've

1335
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,400
got like 900 distros out there now,

1336
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,480
so it's quite a fragmented space.

1337
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,440
Yeah, otherwise it seems like the problem's

1338
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,120
going to get solved at the other end by business interest, which

1339
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,000
in some cases like this, canonical,

1340
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,440
getting them to use snaps, I think is a good thing.

1341
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,480
But that's going to be the other driver in this.

1342
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,020
And I don't know if that's what the community wants necessarily

1343
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,640
for everything.

1344
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,800
What do you mean?

1345
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,720
Well, if we don't have an organized spot

1346
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,280
for outside people to find that is truly

1347
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,080
representative of the community and different resources,

1348
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,320
then it's going to be left up to businesses

1349
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,800
to solve that problem, where they can fund somebody

1350
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,680
like yourself to reach out and convince them to package

1351
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,960
this thing up in a snap.

1352
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,600
And while that's certainly a decent effort,

1353
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,360
canonical can't solve this problem all on their own.

1354
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,720
We need something that is more than that.

1355
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,240
Yeah, I agree.

1356
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:47,680
You know, this is a real thorny problem, right?

1357
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,920
So you only have to look at how distributions are maintained

1358
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,560
and how many hundreds of people are

1359
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,600
responsible for managing the archives

1360
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,660
behind those distributions.

1361
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,560
In order to scale the distributions up,

1362
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,080
the distribution repositories up to encompass

1363
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,480
all of the software that's available,

1364
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,280
you would need an order of magnitude more people

1365
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,480
packaging up that software.

1366
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,800
And clearly, this doesn't work.

1367
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,760
So when you look at the likes of the iOS store and the Android

1368
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,160
store, there's millions of applications there,

1369
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,760
and the model is simple.

1370
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,320
The developer or the vendor publishes their application

1371
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,360
directly to the users.

1372
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,560
That scales.

1373
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,520
And so this is the model that we need

1374
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:36,760
to pursue in order to give Linux as a whole a better footprint

1375
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,240
in the desktop market.

1376
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,640
Because there is more software out there

1377
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,680
than the free and open source software

1378
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,960
that we have in our distribution archives.

1379
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,760
There's also tons more free and open source software out there

1380
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,480
that is not in our archives.

1381
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,920
And we need to find a way to get that software to users.

1382
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,440
And finding more archive admins is not the way to do it.

1383
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,840
Yeah, in a way, that's a pretty good response

1384
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,480
to recent criticism that that model has

1385
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,680
led to malware or cryptoware.

1386
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,000
Because I agree, making software more available

1387
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,800
is the ultimate end goal there.

1388
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,320
Yeah, and that's a compromise that you have to make.

1389
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,200
And we have to improve the safeguards

1390
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,240
that we put in place to detect that stuff automatically,

1391
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,400
just in the same way Apple and Google and Microsoft

1392
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,080
do in their stores.

1393
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:31,600
So they say the takeaway is it's not so easy, in their case,

1394
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,280
to sell to an open source platform.

1395
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,880
Because what everybody has told them in feedback

1396
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,920
is, well, just open source it.

1397
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,080
And that is so easy for us to say.

1398
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,560
But they point out, we have professional VCs

1399
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,680
that have funded this.

1400
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,440
And they want us to hold on and own

1401
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,680
our intellectual property here.

1402
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,160
And there's really no wiggle room.

1403
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,520
Plus, the support model won't pay for the whole thing.

1404
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,560
And that's a real problem that a lot of developers face.

1405
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,960
A lot of shops face that.

1406
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,880
When Linux users tell vendors that nobody's

1407
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,400
interested in proprietary software,

1408
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,760
they are blissfully ignoring the fact

1409
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,120
there are 700,000 Linux users on Steam.

1410
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,040
So that percentage of the Linux user base

1411
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,320
is quite happy to buy proprietary software,

1412
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,280
no problem whatsoever.

1413
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,720
And there are other examples.

1414
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,400
If you're paying for any of these web services,

1415
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,040
nine times out of 10, you're buying into proprietary systems.

1416
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,760
So I just don't believe that people aren't prepared

1417
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,360
to buy proprietary software.

1418
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:40,520
I do believe that there is a section of our community who

1419
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:46,000
are absolutely committed to the notion of free and open

1420
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,560
software.

1421
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,960
And that's all that they will use.

1422
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,520
And there are good reasons why they believe that

1423
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,640
and why that's the way they want to use their computing

1424
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,320
environment.

1425
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,360
And that's brilliant.

1426
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,360
Those people are well-supported and have got

1427
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,320
plenty of software available.

1428
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,080
But that doesn't mean to say that for the rest of us who've

1429
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,800
got a more pragmatic outlook shouldn't have access

1430
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,800
to proprietary software on Linux.

1431
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,280
I wonder, too, if maybe we should pivot this discussion

1432
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,320
or just think about it like if they had gone out

1433
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,200
to survey all of the Outlook users or Exchange users

1434
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,840
and said, how many of you would be interested in this software

1435
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,560
running on Linux?

1436
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,520
How much different would that be?

1437
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,400
Because like, that's a great question.

1438
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,760
Or gamers, if you were like, hey, how many of you

1439
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,480
would use a Linux system if you had the ability

1440
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,480
to do so with our Steam client?

1441
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,320
But that's just harder to do, right?

1442
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,240
And you think about it.

1443
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,880
I think we often think about it in the reverse.

1444
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,960
So listening to this week's LAN when you brought up Reaper,

1445
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,920
Joe just shut the conversation down.

1446
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,640
It's proprietary.

1447
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,280
No, not talking about it.

1448
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,240
And sometimes I think that can be just as harmful

1449
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,840
to the discussion as things like on our Linux being toxic.

1450
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,520
Because if, for example, this company

1451
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,280
was listening to that podcast, they go, oh, well,

1452
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,400
I'm going to have 50% of my users that think this is great.

1453
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,720
I mean, maybe that's an unfair brush.

1454
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,480
But maybe you get my point.

1455
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,760
And hopefully, I think the thing about the Linux community

1456
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,840
for me is that it is made up of lots of different individuals.

1457
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,680
You have some freedom-respecting,

1458
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:25,060
stalemate types who are, to the core, free and open

1459
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,360
is the only way to go.

1460
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,000
And then you have people like me who

1461
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,600
I am essentially a pragmatist at heart.

1462
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,480
And if I see something like Hiri come up

1463
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,960
and it solves a genuine problem that I'm having,

1464
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,360
I'm going to think long and hard about whether I run

1465
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,820
a proprietary piece of software.

1466
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,740
But at the end of the day, if that's the only option

1467
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,360
and it adds a feature to Linux that's

1468
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,400
going to mean that more people can use Linux,

1469
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,640
I think, on balance, that's probably a good thing.

1470
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,320
I agree.

1471
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:59,720
And my understanding is that's the vast majority

1472
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,840
of the audience's belief.

1473
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:07,560
But there is a portion that do have strong moral beliefs

1474
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,800
around using only free software.

1475
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,440
And I feel like the news that Reaper is coming to Linux

1476
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,240
officially is an effing game changer.

1477
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,440
And I've been trying not to talk about this

1478
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,280
because it hasn't officially been available.

1479
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,200
It's been on a website where you're not

1480
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,560
allowed to share the link and all of that kind of stuff.

1481
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,840
But since the beginning of 2018, we've

1482
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,680
been recording every single damn show at Jupiter Broadcasting

1483
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,680
in Reaper.

1484
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,220
And Noah was doing it before that as sort of like my test

1485
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,160
guy.

1486
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,640
He was my canary in the coal mine to see how it worked.

1487
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,240
And so when Reaper was officially announced,

1488
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,740
I am elated because it now makes Linux the best podcasting

1489
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:47,820
platform.

1490
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,020
It is the best platform to record podcasts.

1491
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:53,800
And that industry is exploding right now.

1492
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,200
The podcast industry, and that is now an industry,

1493
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,520
is blowing up in a way that scares the shit out of me,

1494
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,640
to be honest with you.

1495
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,120
But there is more and more people

1496
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,720
looking to produce podcasts.

1497
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,640
And the fact that you can now say

1498
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,820
there is an entire workflow that is Linux-based that

1499
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:10,380
is superior to the commercial offerings, including Macs.

1500
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,040
So extrapolate that argument to photography.

1501
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,720
I know we've got Brent here as well.

1502
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,180
I use Lightroom very heavily for all of my photography stuff.

1503
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,240
I would absolutely love Lightroom

1504
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,680
to run natively on Linux.

1505
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,160
I know it's a proprietary thing, and I

1506
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,360
know you have to pay for it.

1507
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,360
But the fact that a commercial-grade piece of software

1508
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,600
would run on Linux would just be life-changing.

1509
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,480
It is important, and we don't all

1510
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,120
get to live in the world of where, in many cases, yes.

1511
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,540
And for many people, it does work.

1512
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,240
And we spend most of the time on the show

1513
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,580
celebrating the fact that open source and free software is

1514
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,640
just so fricking awesome.

1515
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,120
But there are times and places where you need other things.

1516
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,180
And while we can all say, how do we

1517
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:51,640
help open source grow in this area?

1518
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,220
Does it make sense for open source

1519
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,520
to have a replacement there?

1520
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,480
A lot of times, for people who are just trying

1521
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,000
to start their journey, they just

1522
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,800
need to have it happen so that they

1523
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,380
can continue to explore things while still getting stuff done.

1524
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:02,880
Absolutely.

1525
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,640
There's only so many hours in a day.

1526
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,160
Unfortunately, yes.

1527
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,260
And I think one thing that we should keep in mind

1528
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:12,280
is that choice is really what we should value.

1529
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,400
We should have open source choices.

1530
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,280
For instance, your Lightroom alternative is darktable,

1531
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,800
and that's come a long way in the last few years.

1532
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,920
It's what I use for 80% of my professional photography.

1533
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,560
But you should have the choice to continue using Lightroom

1534
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,440
on Linux if you want to.

1535
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,480
Maybe that's a workflow that works better for you.

1536
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,840
Maybe it's something you're used to,

1537
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,180
and you just don't have the time or energy at the moment

1538
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,080
to learn another piece of software.

1539
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,160
But we should be celebrating the fact that we have choices,

1540
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,960
not that we only have free and open source software choices.

1541
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,960
Absolutely agree, 100%.

1542
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,600
Yeah, we don't want to live in a little sandbox where we only

1543
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,840
have our open source or free software apps that

1544
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,080
don't feel that little competitive pressure to have

1545
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,960
to compete on the same platform with other commercial software.

1546
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,440
I think it's a balance.

1547
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,440
It's a balance, really.

1548
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,440
It's a balance between what is free and what is closed.

1549
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,880
And I think if you have too much in either direction,

1550
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,840
well, I'd say you can't have really too much free,

1551
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,720
but you can have too much in the closed direction.

1552
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,560
And so it's a balance.

1553
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,080
And in a way, when you have a free base operating

1554
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,320
system and a free kernel, and all the libraries are free

1555
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,760
and the UI is free and the applications on top

1556
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,720
are free and you're running one or two commercial applications,

1557
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,840
one or two commercial or proprietary applications,

1558
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,560
I think that's not a bad balance.

1559
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,080
And I think that we as a community

1560
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,440
have to be more accepting of that idea.

1561
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,440
The idea is to strive for as much free and open software

1562
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,120
as possible.

1563
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,040
But we shouldn't completely shut down

1564
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,960
anyone who wants to have something commercial.

1565
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,280
And I have gotten tweets and telegrams

1566
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:45,040
since Sunday when we released Linux Action News.

1567
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,080
People are shaming me for using Reaper when Ardour

1568
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,760
is out there and available.

1569
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,800
And I respect Ardour.

1570
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,040
I think it's a great project.

1571
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,840
And I've actually donated money to Ardour

1572
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,160
before, even though I don't use it.

1573
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,040
I just prefer to use Reaper for the type of workflow

1574
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,800
that we have.

1575
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:04,480
And I just thought, people don't know

1576
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,400
what it takes to record 32 tracks of audio in real time

1577
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,720
to multiple different rate arrays and to a NAS.

1578
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,200
So how dare they judge what software

1579
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,520
I choose to use to accomplish that task?

1580
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,200
But yet still, I have received quite a bit of criticism

1581
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,720
in the last three days because I'm

1582
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,560
using Reaper instead of Ardour.

1583
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,960
And here, I'm just happy that we're

1584
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,960
producing all of this in a high-quality way on Linux.

1585
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,120
You go back, I don't know, was it three years ago

1586
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,960
when LAS was video?

1587
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,720
And how much of that workflow was done?

1588
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,280
You had Wirecast going in a Mac and all the rest of it.

1589
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,160
And you think, well, where you are now

1590
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,480
running one proprietary application on Linux

1591
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,800
is much better than running your entire workflow

1592
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,680
through a Mac, surely, isn't it?

1593
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,400
Yeah, and I kind of have been trying

1594
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:58,320
to get to a spot where I'm not judgmental what anyone uses.

1595
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,840
There was people that I've met recently

1596
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,400
that I thought were just super, super hardcore Linux

1597
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,760
developers that are on a MacBook.

1598
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,520
And I had to really kind of sit with that for a minute.

1599
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,080
I know that seems like a weird thing,

1600
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,680
but I had to sit with that for a minute.

1601
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:15,440
And I had to be mindful about not judging them

1602
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,320
for using a MacBook.

1603
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,000
I thought you were this big Linux person.

1604
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,960
I thought, like, I know somebody who

1605
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:25,520
is a massive, massive Linux personality on YouTube

1606
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,320
who I've recently discovered has been using Windows for a year

1607
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:35,640
plus and is still purporting to be a Linux person on YouTube.

1608
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,240
You're talking about Noah, right?

1609
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,600
Yeah, that'll be the day.

1610
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,800
If there is one person you can guarantee

1611
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,200
will never be that person, it is Noah.

1612
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:45,720
It's a lie.

1613
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,960
And that will never be a problem with Noah.

1614
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,360
And I also had to sit with that for a little bit.

1615
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,320
And it's like, it doesn't change.

1616
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,000
I guess what I'm trying to say is I have to leave room for that.

1617
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,840
I have to leave room for that because there

1618
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,200
is space for open source and free software

1619
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,580
on all of the platforms now.

1620
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,920
And I have to leave room for some people

1621
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,840
to have a more closed down, locked down, proprietary,

1622
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,600
spying operating system at the base level

1623
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,720
and using free software at the top level,

1624
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,200
just like we should make room for having a free operating

1625
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,840
system at the base level and a privacy respecting

1626
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,720
kernel at the base level and a free and open source

1627
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,480
backed community operating system and desktop.

1628
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,960
But maybe we use a couple of proprietary applications

1629
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,240
at the top level.

1630
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,200
Who's to say one's better than the other?

1631
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,160
And that's something I have to remind myself

1632
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,600
because I have been the guy that has come on this show

1633
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,360
and been like, yeah, Wes, I saw 15 MacBooks

1634
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,680
and I saw six Lenovo's at this conference,

1635
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,040
or I saw 35 MacBooks.

1636
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:45,920
You sure have.

1637
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,560
I have.

1638
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,320
That has been me for a long time.

1639
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:53,360
And that is a form of judgment that I have passed on people.

1640
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,600
And who the hell am I?

1641
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,680
I mean, I think I can go both ways a little bit maybe.

1642
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,760
And I think it's a big difference between someone

1643
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,520
who really supports and values Linux and maybe a Mac just

1644
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,560
works, or maybe they got it free from their employer

1645
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,000
and just makes financial sense.

1646
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,040
Or there's like 1,000 reasons.

1647
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,480
But in not all cases is that a detriment

1648
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,040
to the free or open source community.

1649
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:13,760
It can be, right?

1650
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,000
If we still lived in the old days of a pervasive like,

1651
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,440
you can't do that on Linux and you'll never

1652
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,480
do it on the next world.

1653
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,960
But we're slowly not there.

1654
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,320
And so we need to win on our merits.

1655
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,880
In the case of Chris's example, they're

1656
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,680
saying that there's a high profile Linux developers

1657
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,600
or high profile Linux YouTubers using Macs.

1658
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,600
One is a Mac, one's a Windows guy, so it's both.

1659
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:40,120
But they are still forwarding the open agenda, are they not?

1660
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,840
And that's got to be more valuable than having them,

1661
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,320
I don't want to say restricted, or have a workflow that

1662
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,400
is less productive for them.

1663
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,360
I don't know if I agree that the answer is yes, actually.

1664
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,560
I would actually like to open that up to the audience

1665
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,080
a bit and get their take, linuxunplug.com slash

1666
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,200
contact.

1667
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:01,800
I mean, I feel like if it came out

1668
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:06,640
that I had been using Windows all this time,

1669
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,840
wouldn't you feel like I was a fraud?

1670
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,240
Is that part of the question that you're asking, though?

1671
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:14,560
Yes, because you specifically got on about Linux so much

1672
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,800
and your workflows.

1673
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,480
Yeah, I know.

1674
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:16,960
Yeah.

1675
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,120
But if you just never talk about the topic of production,

1676
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,840
if you had a better produced podcast that

1677
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,880
could reach more ears highlighting

1678
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,760
the values of Linux, which is a worse podcast.

1679
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,480
Yeah, that was our argument for doing LAS

1680
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,920
and having it edited on a Mac.

1681
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,520
That was the argument that we used for a long time.

1682
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,520
But the thing that Noah and I just

1683
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,600
kept going back and forth on, and we kind of just,

1684
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,180
you know, there's just no way around it,

1685
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:39,640
is how can you legitimately be a proponent of something

1686
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,320
that you can't use yourself?

1687
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,560
Alex's point is it's more about spreading the message.

1688
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,560
So take the guy that runs the Linux Foundation.

1689
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,840
He was recently seen using a Mac.

1690
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,000
But he's doing good work with the Linux Foundation

1691
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,360
in some cases.

1692
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,880
Which one is more important to you?

1693
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,000
linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1694
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,320
I'd love to know, actually.

1695
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,160
Just one more point.

1696
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:00,660
Yeah.

1697
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:03,360
Don't forget there's lots of different types of Linux.

1698
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:07,680
There is desktop Linux and server Linux and IoT Linux.

1699
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,960
And so to be a Linux user, you don't necessarily

1700
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,880
have to be glued to a desktop the whole time.

1701
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,200
There's also, like, you can prefer something

1702
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,880
and not also be arguing that the other system can't do it,

1703
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,360
right?

1704
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,040
Like, I might just like a Mac workflow,

1705
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,280
even if Windows or Linux can do the same thing.

1706
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:28,320
I had lunch with a couple of Azure guys from Linux Academy

1707
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:33,440
who live, eat, and breed Linux from their Windows boxes.

1708
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,080
And it was a real, it was a thing.

1709
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,320
Like, it just took me a bit like, really?

1710
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,040
Really?

1711
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:41,920
OK.

1712
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,520
But you know what?

1713
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,840
That's their workflow.

1714
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,160
And they make their living on Linux.

1715
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,920
And they live, eat, and breed Linux.

1716
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,680
And they connect from their Windows boxes.

1717
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,560
And I was just, I sat there and I go, you know,

1718
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,680
that's probably happening a lot more than I realized.

1719
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,720
So who am I to judge?

1720
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,640
Because it works for them.

1721
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,960
And so I am concerned a bit about this strong headwind

1722
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,840
that is building more than I've ever witnessed.

1723
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,600
Like, in the past, people just would

1724
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,120
have been happy that we're making content under Linux

1725
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,460
and that we're able to do it at a certain quality level.

1726
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,840
But now it's not good enough.

1727
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,360
Now every single application, every single application,

1728
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,920
every library, everything in the entire pipeline

1729
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,000
needs to be free software.

1730
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,600
And it's not always possible.

1731
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,960
Because if you think about it, you

1732
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,400
can't even really boot your system without a couple of blobs.

1733
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,640
So where do we draw the line?

1734
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,800
And that chorus, as Linux has grown

1735
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,560
and as people have gotten more and more into the free software

1736
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,240
message and started to grok why it's important,

1737
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,000
more and more people have become radicalized and advocates,

1738
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,020
which is understandable.

1739
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,440
Because when you really understand

1740
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,360
the importance of free software, you kind of

1741
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,360
do get sort of passionate about it.

1742
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,800
And that passion is turning away people

1743
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,200
that could be making tools that enable

1744
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:02,380
Linux to be approachable by even more people.

1745
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:09,640
And that crowd is now dominating areas that, quote, unquote,

1746
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,960
represent the Linux community.

1747
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,000
I have two podcasts, Linux Action News and Linux Unplugged.

1748
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,360
Those two podcasts know, I mean, I'm not sure about Ubuntu

1749
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,440
podcasts, I think they do quite well.

1750
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,520
They are one of, and maybe each one of them,

1751
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,180
maybe the largest Linux podcasts,

1752
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:32,080
if not some of the largest Linux podcasts in the world.

1753
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,200
Nobody approached me about a commercial piece of software

1754
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,200
that we could talk about.

1755
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,080
Nobody approached me.

1756
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,320
So how do you define what represents the Linux community?

1757
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,520
I would argue that it's each to our own,

1758
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,560
to which area we look, which lens we use to look in

1759
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,880
on the Linux community.

1760
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:50,960
And that's a problem, too.

1761
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,920
Because when you don't have one company representing you,

1762
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,440
when you don't have a Steve Jobs,

1763
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,480
when you don't have a Mark Zuckerberg,

1764
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,360
when you don't have somebody like an Elon Musk who

1765
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:07,480
can be your front man, who can be your singular point of focus,

1766
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,840
you end up trying to go to the different, quote, unquote,

1767
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,800
communities.

1768
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,720
And what you get are a bunch of shitheads.

1769
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,220
And that's what our Linux is, and that's

1770
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:16,080
what a lot of the Linux community is.

1771
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,540
I say that as one of them.

1772
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:20,440
And completely, as somebody who's there every single day,

1773
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,560
I am absolutely one of those sons of bitches.

1774
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,480
And it turns away people.

1775
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,320
And I know that because I've been doing this for a long time,

1776
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,520
and I get emails all the time telling me that.

1777
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,920
And it's super frustrating to read those emails,

1778
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,920
and I never have a good answer for them.

1779
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,920
And they're not wrong.

1780
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,680
And at the same time, we also have

1781
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,960
to balance that with advocating free software.

1782
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,760
We can't just sit on our hands and not advocate free software

1783
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,640
and not encourage people to try to open source their software.

1784
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,660
Because my god, if we did that, where the hell would we be?

1785
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,600
So it's not a simple problem to solve.

1786
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,920
So you know I have a penchant for containers.

1787
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,160
I've long made the argument that they were the reason that I

1788
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,040
ended up finally understanding Linux,

1789
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,920
because I didn't have to go on the forums

1790
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,600
and admit that I didn't know how to do apt-get install basic

1791
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,360
thing.

1792
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:13,800
I just ran this magic black box, and this container just

1793
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,720
ran Plex.

1794
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:18,200
It ran all sorts of other stuff.

1795
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,760
And it reduced that barrier to entry.

1796
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,360
So I think anything we can do to make it easier for people

1797
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,440
to join the community, whether that's packaging software

1798
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,840
with snaps, Docker containers, whatever,

1799
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,660
proprietary companies that it's in their commercial interest

1800
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,920
to make it as easy as possible, as demonstrated with Hiri

1801
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,920
going through the snap process, I

1802
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,600
think anything we can do as a community to encourage

1803
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,600
new people, more people to contribute and be

1804
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,040
part of this community, the better.

1805
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:56,800
And if we can get away from the cesspit of YouTube comments

1806
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:02,240
and Reddit comments as well, then it's so much the better.

1807
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:05,840
Because I don't think anybody really likes them.

1808
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,800
Isn't it interesting, I feel like free software

1809
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,640
would be better off if Reddit and YouTube were to go away.

1810
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,680
And that is a sad state of affairs,

1811
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,600
because that's not going to happen.

1812
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:21,240
Me, myself, I'm still what I consider myself a noob.

1813
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:24,600
I'm actually still going through this journey

1814
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:30,440
of trying to discover gaming on Linux.

1815
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:33,520
And through that, the Telegram channels

1816
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,440
and all that sort of community shows

1817
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,880
the positive side of what people on Linux

1818
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,720
are willing to discuss in terms of solutions to problems,

1819
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,680
as well as directing new users, such as myself, who still

1820
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:57,240
dual boot, who are still trying to get through this market

1821
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,400
of applications, regardless of proprietary or commercial

1822
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,880
or free and open source.

1823
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:08,280
I do see there is a positive side to versus that yang

1824
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,440
that you mentioned about Reddit and YouTube.

1825
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,760
I think also to that point, it's unfortunate it also

1826
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,400
is one of the interfaces where occasionally,

1827
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,880
like in this instance, the wider world sort of stumbles

1828
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,000
on to our little community in ways that are not good,

1829
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,720
and maybe ways that we talk about less that are good.

1830
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,720
Or at least it becomes a mixing ground,

1831
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,560
and that's probably a lot of work

1832
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,280
and a lot of misconceptions get generated.

1833
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,080
But maybe some other things happen too.

1834
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,120
All right, well, I'm going to sort of wrap this up

1835
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,400
by asking Brent if perhaps maybe this solution isn't

1836
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,880
worrying about it from a general user standpoint,

1837
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,800
but the niches, niching down.

1838
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,440
Like people that are coming to solve a specific problem,

1839
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,160
photography, gaming, data science, web development,

1840
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,860
that's where we need to focus our efforts.

1841
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,640
And those particular communities might

1842
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:57,600
be where people end up actually finding themselves.

1843
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,640
What are your thoughts around that, Brent?

1844
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,520
Perhaps this overall problem is too big to solve,

1845
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,680
and we need to solve it by breaking this up a bit

1846
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:08,080
and figuring out what people need to do on their Linux boxes.

1847
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,520
In some way, I probably represent the non-developer,

1848
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,600
non-sysadmin user here in some ways.

1849
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:21,160
And so I got introduced to Linux just to get stuff done,

1850
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,920
but get stuff done in a way that felt a bit more secure

1851
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,600
and a bit more empowering for me.

1852
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,920
So I think a lot of users might have that same approach

1853
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,240
to coming to Linux.

1854
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,320
And so you mentioned maybe there should

1855
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:41,680
be these sub-communities in photography, or in design,

1856
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:45,880
or in engineering, or those different vocations.

1857
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:50,580
And wouldn't it be great if those niche communities

1858
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:54,800
existed because Linux was spread a little bit everywhere?

1859
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,460
When I go to any photography, anything,

1860
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:02,600
there is absolutely no one talking about Linux

1861
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,360
as far as the professional networks that I'm part of.

1862
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,400
I'm kind of the black sheep there.

1863
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,080
I know there's a lot of Linux advocates

1864
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,680
who play with photography and get a lot done that way,

1865
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:16,480
but coming at it from the other angle doesn't always happen.

1866
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:20,080
So I think in a way, if we can spread the word starting

1867
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,840
at those vocations and those careers and coming back,

1868
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,600
that might be a new interesting approach instead of having

1869
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,360
them come to the Linux community, which is,

1870
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,480
as we're seeing, a little bit of a mess.

1871
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,760
Yeah, it would really be solving it one workflow at a time

1872
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,320
in a way.

1873
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,880
And I think I could see that working.

1874
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,080
It would take a long time, but open source

1875
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:44,200
is pretty good about sticking at it over the long haul.

1876
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:50,200
I think we could probably find some professionals or advocates

1877
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,800
in each of those fields easily.

1878
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,760
And we just need to lean on them a little bit.

1879
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,480
Yeah, that's an interesting idea.

1880
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,640
Worth exploring perhaps some more.

1881
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,800
Also, I have a link in the show notes about the situation

1882
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,240
over at Slack where I encourage you

1883
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:06,120
to go check that out because it's an area I think that

1884
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,320
really could use some love.

1885
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,120
And if you have ideas on how we could help,

1886
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,240
I would love to hear at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1887
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,240
I was thinking about running a GoFundMe campaign or something

1888
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:19,760
for the Slackware developer, but I don't know.

1889
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,560
I don't know if that should be coming from us.

1890
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:25,560
I don't know if that should be coming from the community.

1891
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:29,320
I would happily dedicate some of Jupyter Broadcasting's time

1892
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,040
to help manage something like that.

1893
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,840
If you have ideas on how a show like ours

1894
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,720
could help in a situation like Slackware, please let us know.

1895
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,600
And if you don't know what I'm talking about,

1896
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,680
please go check the show notes and read up on it.

1897
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,520
And then send me your thoughts, serious thoughts only, please,

1898
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,320
linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1899
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:48,520
I'd like to make a difference in situations like Slackware.

1900
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,560
We have a project that's been around forever

1901
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,920
that's working on their best release of all time.

1902
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,760
And their core developer is suffering

1903
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,840
with holes in his house and driving around

1904
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,360
in a car on a spare tire because I absolutely

1905
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,680
know exactly how that feels.

1906
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,600
And I would love to help make a difference in somebody's life

1907
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,400
if you have ideas and thoughts on that.

1908
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,960
linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1909
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,320
If you want to get more on Westpane, where should they go?

1910
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,160
Ooh, go check out TechSnap, TechSnap.Systems,

1911
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,440
or I'm over at at Westpane.

1912
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,120
Boom.

1913
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,960
Mr. Brent, why don't you give a plug of skis

1914
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,760
for your social media profile or somewhere

1915
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,440
where people can get more of you during the week?

1916
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:20,840
Sure, yeah.

1917
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,400
There's a little bit on Twitter, so at Brent Jervow,

1918
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:28,240
just spell that out, B-R-E-N-T-G-E-R-V-A-I-S.

1919
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,440
And then before we go, we have to plug

1920
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,160
the excellent and always competitive Ubuntu podcast.

1921
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,840
And Mr. Wimpy, I have to ask you, sir,

1922
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,320
is there anything else we should mention or give a little plug

1923
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:40,640
ski here before we run?

1924
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,880
I've got a plug for some proprietary software.

1925
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,680
Let's have it, baby.

1926
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,200
I love it.

1927
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,720
OK, go ahead.

1928
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,440
Well, might as well stay on topic, eh?

1929
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,800
Yeah.

1930
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:00,040
So a while ago, Popey snapped the Minecraft launcher.

1931
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,560
That's the Java, the old Java UI.

1932
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,360
And this week, we've released into the store,

1933
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,600
Minecraft is now using the new launcher that they

1934
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,240
released a few days ago.

1935
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,520
Yeah, I saw that.

1936
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,440
Very excited.

1937
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,080
As a parent who is installing that for his kids,

1938
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:16,760
very excited.

1939
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,920
Couldn't be easier.

1940
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:19,760
That's awesome.

1941
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,680
All right, very good.

1942
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,720
Well, thank you very much.

1943
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,800
Yes, go check out the Ubuntu podcast,

1944
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,920
and go check out more Westpain over at TechSnap.

1945
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,400
And if you heard us making vague inferences to Joe,

1946
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,120
you can go get more Joe over at LateNightLinux.

1947
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:37,160
And he joins me on Linux Action News every single Sunday

1948
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,560
over at linuxactionnews.com.

1949
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,000
And you're welcome to check that out.

1950
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,880
Hey, why don't you join us live on Tuesdays?

1951
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,200
We do this show at around 2, it really

1952
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:48,880
kind of starts around 1.30 Pacific over at jblive.tv,

1953
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,800
jupitabroadcasting.com, slash calendars,

1954
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,040
where we have that converted.

1955
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,000
And you come hang out with us.

1956
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,080
You get a bunch of pre-show, you get some post-show,

1957
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,520
and then you get the Ask Noah show.

1958
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,640
It's a whole lot of show.

1959
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,340
Thanks so much for joining us, and we'll

1960
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,880
see you right back here, not now, next Tuesday!

1961
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:27,320
Now, you're watching Hertzinated Live's live audience

1962
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:41,080
You know, one thing we didn't get to mention in the show, but is absolutely awesome, is

1963
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:46,600
that PowerShell was launched as a Snap this week. That is so cool.

1964
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:52,720
Yeah, so PowerShell was something that I worked on. That originated in the Snap community

1965
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:57,760
as it happened. So Chris, you'll remember when you're in Seattle, you met Dan, he was

1966
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:03,420
there from the community and he created the initial PowerShell Snap and at that event

1967
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:09,680
in Seattle, handed it over to Microsoft in person. And then since then it's been in legal

1968
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:14,720
review and then released just this, just this week, this week, last week, back into last

1969
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:15,720
week.

1970
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,280
They really do take this quite seriously, don't they?

1971
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,280
Yeah. Impressive.

1972
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,640
Yeah. I mean, that was months and months and months ago.

1973
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:25,520
Yeah. We're finding this. So we were just talking about all these companies doing proprietary

1974
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,520
software. This is actually PowerShell's actually open source software, but they've spent five

1975
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:34,520
months doing the legal review to make sure that all of the libraries that they're now

1976
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:40,720
distributing in the Snap, all of that licensing and copyright is all above board. They're

1977
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:45,800
very thorough on this, the experience we've had dealing with all of these, all of these

1978
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:51,240
organizations, proprietary or open, when they publish their snaps from sort of big vendors,

1979
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,000
they take that stuff very seriously.

1980
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,480
Yeah. As they probably should. And I would imagine it's going to be a process for quite

1981
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:01,360
a while and then they'll, you know, it'll probably get a little bit smoother. You know,

1982
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:05,240
they'll round out the rough edges as time goes on and it'll get faster and faster.

1983
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:17,040
Yeah, let's hope so.
