1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's a big day. Microsoft has officially launched Microsoft Edge for Linux.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This changes everything.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I've just installed it, the dev version on this machine,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and I'm going to launch it for the first time.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm going to capture my reactions live.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm firing it up on a Neon system, which is a 2004 base.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Ooh, Wes, did you get this?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm getting like a first time welcome to Edge wizard, a full screen job.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's set up your new tab page.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Do you want inspirational, informational, or focused?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You know what, I'm going to go ahead and send helpful information back to Microsoft,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and I'm going to go for a focused design, whatever that means.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, I'm going inspirational, come on.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh yeah? Okay, that probably means you get a pretty background.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is a lot like Chrome. It's a really clean Chrome, isn't it?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But almost as if you're running Chrome on Windows.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You know, everything's like a little flatter there.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, interesting.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So it's not an Electron app, is it?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Maybe that's hard to say. What is Electron but a whole bunch of Chromium?

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Isn't that what Edge is underneath too?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's true. That's why it feels a lot like Chrome.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But it does seem to be running pretty snappily.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Maybe I'll make this my default for a while, you know, live on the Edge.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to check in. Let's see.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We'll check the RAM total for Microsoft Edge.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It is currently the brand new fresh installation of Microsoft Edge is taking.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Drum roll please.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
63 megabytes of RAM.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hello, friends, and welcome to episode 376 of your weekly Linux talk show.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
My name is Chris.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My name is Wes.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hello, Wes. You can just move the chips and dip out of the way.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This episode is brought to you by the all new Cloud Guru.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Cloud Guru now includes Cloud Playgrounds,

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Azure AWS and Google Cloud sandboxes on ACG's credit card, not yours.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Just one click for fast, fresh and disposable cloud instances at your fingertips.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Check out a cloud guru dot com.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We have a really fun episode today because nominally we're reviewing Ubuntu 2010,

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
which we've been looking forward to the groovy gorilla for quite a while.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And we'll tell you why here in a little bit.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But there's also a lot of big news today.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So there's a ton of stuff for us to break down, including Edge and a bunch of other stuff.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So, Wes, what do you say we start by welcoming in the virtual lug,

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hello.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hello.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hello.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hello.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, hello.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That is an excellent sounding turnout.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think we'll need their help today.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, definitely.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We also have Philip in there from Manjaro returning

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
to share some good news about the Manjaro pine phone.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hello, Philip. Good to have you.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello. Happy to be here again.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hello, hello.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And we have Lindsay joining us from System76.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She'll be joining us in a little bit to talk about the new Thaleo Mega.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hello, Lindsay.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hi, everyone.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hi. Thanks for joining us.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So we're going to get to Thaleo here in just a moment.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But, Wes, let's start with the news that, yes, indeed,

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Microsoft today, just as we went on air, has released Microsoft Edge for Linux.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And this is a bigger story than I thought, Wes,

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
because after I kind of brushed it off a little bit and said,

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
oh, who's really going to use this,

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
we got a lot of feedback of people saying, me, I'm using this.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, at this point, you've got to think, all right,

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
some of us are in the Google camp.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But at least especially, perhaps, in the workplace,

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
there's a ton of people whose online lives,

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
or at least a section of them, are off in the Microsoft ecosystem.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So if you've got a browser that just sort of plays ball in that sphere,

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
maybe that makes sense.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And honestly, at this point,

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you're going to have to trust Google or Microsoft,

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
and now you can have your pick.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's do the acid test here.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We'll do a search for Linux unplugged.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, Wes, surprise, surprise, it's using Bing.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of course.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's also telling me that I can easily collect, organize,

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and share content I find across the web with collections.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's interesting.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But it seems to have nailed the search result right there coming up.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Page render is just fine.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I mean, it's very much a Chromium experience,

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
only if I dare say maybe a slightly leaner feeling one.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't know, Wes.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You know, we've been running 2010, Ubuntu 2010,

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and it comes with Firefox.

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And it feels like Firefox has gotten really, really good.

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And so this was one of the first times I just chose not to install Chrome.

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You know, actually, I was in the same boat.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It was sort of like Firefox looked nice.

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's got a really shiny icon in 2010,

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and it just, I didn't need to go beyond it.

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now, sometimes there are the random sites, unfortunately,

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
that just sort of assume that you have Chrome,

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but at least it might, you know,

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the testing I've been doing for the past week or so,

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I didn't run into that.

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I might just, you know, for the show,

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I think what I might do is if I end up needing

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
a Chromium slash Blink browser on these machines,

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
maybe I'll put Edge on there,

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and I'll give it a test drive for a little bit.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Maybe I'll see if I can get it on Fedora 33, eventually.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, yeah.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You know, it is kind of interesting that on one hand,

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I have worries about this sort of Blink monoculture

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
that we seem to be inevitably heading towards.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But on the other side,

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
it's also maybe an open source success story

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
that Microsoft can do this at all

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and that we're here running Edge on Linux

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
because of all the hard open source work done in the Chromium project.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, exactly.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I'd also be interested if anyone throws Wireshark at this thing

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
just to kind of get an idea of how many connections an hour or a day

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
it's making back to Microsoft headquarters.

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And maybe now it might be not fully a fair test

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
because in beta, especially in early beta,

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
it's collecting certain crash metrics and whatnot

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
that it might not in production.

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, you already agreed to give them those metrics, Chris.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I did.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Well, I feel like in a way, it's sort of,

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
it's registering a vote for Linux support.

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I often will say go ahead and collect information

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
even though I don't feel great about it.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But it serves my broader goal of telling corporations

136
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that there's Linux users out here.

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hey, I'm over here.

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Support me.

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All right, so let's be real.

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Could you see yourself actually use,

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I mean, if you're using Chrome day-to-day,

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
is it really that different to use Edge?

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, I think Joe probably put it best.

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I think it was Joe who said that Google's already got them.

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Right?

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So at least that's like already a deal he's made.

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why invite another corporation into that circle of trust

148
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and give them all of your activity information?

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So even if it is maybe better in some regards,

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
you've already kind of,

151
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
you've already gotten yourself comfortable,

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
at least in my case, with Google.

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Interesting.

154
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You know, I was almost thinking the opposite,

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
like it might be nice to disconnect things.

156
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I've already got so much in Google.

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Maybe I want to better isolate and deal with, you know,

158
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
not having my browser sign me in automatically

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to any Google accounts that I'm signed in.

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That might be nice.

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, I think that's a very, very, very valid use case.

162
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And, you know, real, actual, genuine Linux support

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
could mean that you have a viable Blink alternative

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
that is supported by a large-scale vendor

165
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
with industry support.

166
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So it's nothing to blink at.

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And I could see it because there's a story that was out today,

168
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I think, as we record at least,

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
that when you clear your history and browsing history inside Chrome,

170
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
a couple of sites are actually excluded from that clearing.

171
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And surprise, surprise, they're Google properties.

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Who would have thought?

173
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So, you know, that kind of thing,

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I think gets more and more people looking at them sideways

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and thinking, gosh, the browser is pretty essential

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
to my day-to-day use in life.

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So maybe.

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And in the meantime, people that are in Linux

180
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
but in a Microsoft-centric environment have a pretty good option.

181
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And also, people who are buying GPU-powered workstations

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
have a pretty good solution.

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Today, System76 announced the Thaleo Mega,

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
the world's smallest quad GPU workstation,

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
primarily made for deep learning and scientific computing.

186
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Of course, I'm sure you could probably play video games on this thing.

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Carl says it's kind of their hype car of sports cars.

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
They put all of their most advanced engineering and technology

189
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
into the Mega, and he says they got stunning results.

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And it goes way beyond industry standard quad GPU systems

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
in a compact, quiet little box.

192
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And we have a special guest joining us from System76 today

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to tell us some of the secrets that went into this.

194
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Lindsay Cross, System76's mechanical engineer, is joining us today.

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Congratulations on the release.

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You must have been working towards this for quite a while.

197
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Thank you.

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, we have, even though things move pretty quickly here, we'll say.

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So this is the thing I noticed immediately about this,

200
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
because you have one picture on the website

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
where you get a real good sense of the size,

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and it's shorter than a monitor in terms of height.

203
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The monitor is taller, a widescreen monitor is taller than this case is.

204
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And I'm wondering how the heck you managed to pack four GPUs

205
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
into a smaller version of the Thaleo.

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, it was hard.

207
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There were times where I was like,

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Carl, can we just make this a little bigger?

209
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No, we got to make this the smallest.

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So it took a lot of thermal coordination,

211
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
a lot of messing with different manufacturing methods,

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
but I think we got there.

213
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You must have had to build an exceptional cooling system.

214
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes, yeah, we did.

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We almost had to treat everything kind of independently.

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So the CPU has its own kind of cooling system.

217
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The GPUs have their own cooling system.

218
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And then we added some intake fans here and there

219
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
to kind of round everything out.

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
When you're building something like this,

221
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
you must have situations where you have to generate a lot of heat

222
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to get an idea if things are working.

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So you must have had to throw some workloads at this thing

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
to test this stuff out.

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, we tested it with four 2080s all the time.

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't think we ever tested it without four GPUs.

227
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And Carl had some crazy workloads where he was taxing each GPU

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
to use at least 250 watts to make sure it actually worked.

229
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Before the show started, I asked you how big the power supply

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
must be in something like this to support four GPUs.

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Will you share that?

232
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, we have a 1600 watt power supply in there.

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's pretty big.

234
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Some people are like, you know, maybe we should put a thousand in there

235
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
just in case someone wants something smaller.

236
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And we're like, nope, 1600 it is.

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why so much effort into making a quad GPU system small?

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Because it seems like the easy route would be to take the largest Thalio

239
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and just pack a full of GPUs.

240
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Right. I mean, it makes it a little more accessible,

241
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
especially now that, you know, more people are working from home.

242
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You don't necessarily have the option to go work on a server farm

243
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
or on this huge computer.

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You just need something that's a desktop that can sit under your desk

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
or on top of your desk and be able to work in the situations

246
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
you needed to work in.

247
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And it really seems like it's targeted right at professionals

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
because I think it's all essentially professional grade GPUs in this thing

249
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
with insane amounts of RAM.

250
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, but, you know, if someone, an individual who has, you know,

251
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
a little bit of money lying around, they want to do some crazy machine learning

252
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
on their own, they're more than welcome to pick one up.

253
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Right. I mean, this would be quite the git.

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's sort of, like Carl said, it's like a super sports car that if you can afford it,

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
it would be quite the treat.

256
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The size, I think, would make them perfect for the studio.

257
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So I could almost talk myself into it.

258
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, I think you should. I think you really should.

259
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It makes me think the whole line here is getting more mature, you know,

260
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
that Thalios come far enough now that you can pack all this into such a small thing

261
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
that you're comfortable with the thermals, with managing,

262
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
with changing up the manufacturing process.

263
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's interesting.

264
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah. And, you know, there's more to come.

265
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We're trying to fill all the gaps in the line, if you will.

266
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So stay tuned.

267
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
More Thalios to come.

268
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So I know you're on the factory floor right now as we chat,

269
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
and I'd love to get some insights into what it's like to build something like this,

270
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
how many iterations of the chassis and the kind of details

271
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
that consumers never really know because what we end up seeing is just the finished product.

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yeah, exactly.

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
One of the joys of just being able to build all these desktops right here in Denver

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
is we can move real quickly.

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
For example, I'll make a design in CAD and then I'll be building it later that day,

276
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
which is unheard of if you kind of outsource it.

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Really?

278
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So, you know, me and my coworker, John, we come up with these crazy designs.

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We go over to the laser punch and cut it out

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and then take it to the bender and powder it up if we want to make it look cool.

281
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And it all takes, you know, a day or two just to build something up and test it out.

282
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That is some fast feedback.

283
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, exactly.

284
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah, that is really great for building.

285
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you get to keep one or do you end up getting a final one

286
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
or do you have one of the – does like one of the iterations become your machine?

287
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, this machine is a little too expensive to just have one of my own.

288
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Right.

289
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I wish, though.

290
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But, yeah, I definitely – you know, I have a – I work on a Thaleo major right now

291
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and it's kind of hobnob together of pieces we found.

292
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So, it's kind of fun to be able to do that.

293
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Right.

294
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's very much how it goes when you're actually on the factory floor

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and building these things.

296
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's kind of – I figured something like that.

297
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, you got a Thaleo so you're not doing too bad then.

298
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No, I'm not.

299
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll say my CAD renders very quickly.

300
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I really wish I had a good reason to grab one of these things

301
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
because they just look so great.

302
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And the size I feel like is one of those things that would really strike you in person.

303
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So, not only is it something that has four GPUs in it,

304
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
but getting the right size components that support that much GPU capacity must have been tricky.

305
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Like motherboard.

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah, the motherboard we definitely had to hone in on.

307
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And Carl definitely did a bunch of work to kind of dial that in

308
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and figure out what would work best for this four GPU system.

309
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Colonel in our Mumble Room noticed on the System76 site

310
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
that you know that you're using closed loop phase cooling.

311
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What is that?

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah.

313
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So, for example, for the CPU, it has an intake and a duct, its own duct.

314
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So, basically, we're trying to move air over the CPU specifically.

315
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And then on the other end, kind of out the back, has its own exhaust.

316
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So, it's kind of like its own loop for the CPU there.

317
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I see.

318
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's called a closed loop.

319
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Very cool.

320
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Lindsay, this has been a really interesting release to go over this

321
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and just see what a monster this thing is.

322
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And really, I kind of can't think of another machine that's pre-built to run Linux,

323
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
pre-installed with Linux, that's this powerful in shipping today.

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I think you guys have nailed it.

325
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
All right, that's what we'd like to hear.

326
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Well, thank you for coming on and telling us about it.

327
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Of course.

328
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
linode.com slash unplugged.

329
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account,

330
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and go there to support the show.

331
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Linode is our cloud provider.

332
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And because their price is so great, it makes it possible for a small team

333
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
to have killer infrastructure.

334
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And personally, one of the things I think is great about Linode

335
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
is all of the distributions they support.

336
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
All the Alpines, Arch, the recent Centaurses and Debian releases,

337
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
same with Fedora and OpenSUSE, and of course, several versions of Ubuntu.

338
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But what I really get about them is their love for Linux

339
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and their support for open source.

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
They've been the backer of initiatives that we love,

341
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
like Linux Fest Northwest, or a supporter of All Things Open

342
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
going on right now, I think.

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And also a sponsor of the Kubuntu project.

344
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It goes on and on and on.

345
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
They started in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing.

346
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That was three years before AWS, and they've got their game together.

347
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They're independently owned, which I also get that.

348
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And they started with a love of Linux.

349
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They got into this business because they saw the features

350
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and capabilities coming to Linux, and as Linux users recognized

351
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
what they could do with them before anybody else pulled the trigger.

352
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And Linode is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

353
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If it runs on Linux, well, it runs on Linode.

354
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And they don't have just machines either.

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Let me tell you, they've got node balancers, central logging tools,

356
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Kubernetes support, Terraform support, as well as object storage,

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
which I love and use all the time.

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And unlike entry-level hosting services that lock you into their platform,

359
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Linode gives you full backend access to customize

360
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and control your server to fit your needs.

361
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So go to linode.com slash unplugged.

362
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account,

363
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and you go there to support the show.

364
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

365
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Big thank you to Linode for sponsoring the unplugged program.

366
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Linode.com slash unplugged.

367
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well, NVIDIA made some news this week.

368
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It appears that they won't have support for Linux 5.9

369
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
at least for another month,

370
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
and it's all about a GPL condom.

371
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They sent out an advisory to their customers on Friday

372
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
that they don't expect to have 5.9 kernel support

373
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
in their proprietary graphics driver until mid-November

374
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
or about one month until after the stable version of that is released.

375
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The advisory notes, Linux kernel 5.9 plus,

376
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
in case, you know, they're really slow,

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
is incompatible with current and previous NVIDIA Linux GPU drivers.

378
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We advise customers to defer updating to Linux kernel 5.9 plus

379
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
until mid-November when an NVIDIA Linux GPU driver update

380
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
with support is expected to be available.

381
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
NVIDIA is aware of the impact this will have on customers,

382
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and we are working diligently to provide the driver update

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
with kernel 5.9 plus support as soon as possible.

384
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh man, how aggravating.

385
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So we're about to talk about Ubuntu 2010 today.

386
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That release is using Linux 5.8, so it won't have that issue,

387
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
but it means if you want like the latest and greatest hardware support in 5.9,

388
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
you're kind of left out until at least mid-November timeframe.

389
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Now, as you mentioned, Chris, NVIDIA didn't publicly spell out

390
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
why it's taking them much longer than normal

391
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
to deliver support for this new kernel,

392
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
but it may very well have to do with the change around

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
tainting that module with GPL shims

394
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
that circumvent GPL symbol exports used by proprietary drivers.

395
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
We talked about this a little bit.

396
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It all came out of some work from Facebook around net GPU,

397
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
but it sort of reminded kernel developers that, well,

398
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
the NVIDIA proprietary module has been playing fast and loose

399
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
with that old GPL shim requirement anyway.

400
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Maybe they're catching up.

401
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, it is kind of a shame because, you know,

402
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Linus and other kernel developers try not to disrupt user land,

403
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
but obviously this is one of those that absolutely will,

404
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and the NVIDIA driver won't be the only one that is impacted by this,

405
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
but they may be the one that's perhaps best capable of responding to it.

406
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And this is really from a discussion that has been,

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
shall we say, colorful at best,

408
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
which has been hostile to certain vendors,

409
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and this is what it has come to.

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And the thing that I find tricky about this is if you aren't on

411
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
a distribution that's watching for this, you could get bit.

412
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
For example, if you're on Gen 2 or Arch,

413
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
you're going to get the new kernel eventually,

414
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and your NVIDIA card just won't be able to use the driver.

415
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah, that is unfortunate, kind of the pains of rolling,

416
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and, you know, it's sort of the pains of using and relying

417
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
on this proprietary driver from NVIDIA.

418
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's two separate projects being developed,

419
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and, you know, sometimes NVIDIA just has to play catch-up.

420
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yeah.

421
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Until then, some good advice from gamingonlinux.com

422
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
that if you're on an Arch-based distribution,

423
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
well, you might try out the NVIDIA installer from TK Glitch.

424
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We'll have a link in the show notes,

425
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and it sounds like it works well enough for the moment.

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Hmm, yeah, okay.

427
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, that's just sort of a public service announcement to everybody,

428
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and if there's anything that develops, we'll let you know.

429
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I know Manjaro has been watching out for this particular one.

430
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
They've been talking about it for a while.

431
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Philip joins us on the show, really here to talk about

432
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
the new PinePhone Manjaro Edition,

433
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
but, Philip, do you have any follow-up thoughts to this NVIDIA issue?

434
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Well, I did also post and had the famous Linus picture on it,

435
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and then I got a tweet about it.

436
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Hey, what is that for, silly?

437
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And we should be mature more and so on,

438
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
so I had to change it and apologize,

439
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and in the end, the tweet was deleted.

440
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But anyway, the topic is still there,

441
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and new users found out about it and talk about it,

442
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
so it's a big thing,

443
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
and from our standpoint as a distribution,

444
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
we cannot change the kernel stuff,

445
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
so when Linus is adding the scheme

446
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
so that the kernel doesn't accept the NVIDIA driver,

447
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
then it is like it is.

448
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The distro has to follow,

449
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and we cannot simply reword it as that might be against the law,

450
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and so we have to wait about NVIDIA to fix it on their own so it works,

451
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
but the good thing is on Manjaro, we have all the kernels,

452
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
so you can choose between the latest is 5.9,

453
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
as of course that doesn't work there,

454
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
but the earliest we have is 4.4,

455
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
so we have plenty to choose between 4.4 and 5.9,

456
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
and if you don't want to lose that,

457
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
then still use one kernel, which still works.

458
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You know, I just thought of a show segment idea, Wes,

459
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
where we go back and try the oldest possible supported Linux kernel

460
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and see if we can tell any difference in our day-to-day usage.

461
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It would obviously depend on the hardware,

462
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
but it might be a fun segment.

463
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, I love it. 2.6 anyone?

464
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah.

465
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So, Phil, when we talked before,

466
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I recalled that there was going to be two Manjaro PinePhone community editions,

467
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
a 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of eMMC edition,

468
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and then a slightly more expensive version that had 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of eMMC.

469
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It also included a dock with that one.

470
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm curious if you've got any early results on how the reception has been

471
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
and any update on when things are going to be shipping out.

472
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, we ship out early November, mid-November,

473
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
as we could manage to get production one week earlier.

474
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That was done because we had the backup image ready.

475
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We had planned to ship it with Lumiri,

476
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
but things happened, and we could not do that,

477
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
so we go for Phosh now,

478
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
and the good thing about Phosh is it's already established by Purism

479
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and all the other projects,

480
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and we patched everything together,

481
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
so we have the torch working,

482
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
the camera is working with autofocus and so on,

483
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
so it's the best experience what you can get now with Phosh,

484
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and we also have the 5.9 kernel with better audio stack.

485
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh, it's great to hear about autofocus in the camera.

486
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That seems like a big deal.

487
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Somebody must have really worked hard on that.

488
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It was done by Martin from PostmarketOS,

489
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and it's really good to have all the people

490
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
around all the distributions to push and help you out

491
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
to get these community editions out,

492
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and if they have a patch or some cool package,

493
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
then we speak internally with all the developers

494
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and see how we can get it done on each base,

495
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and we also help each other to get it out

496
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
because in the end, it's about the phone experience,

497
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and so everybody works closely together across the distros.

498
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah, man, that is a really nice aspect

499
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
of free software development, isn't it,

500
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and giving us a real edge

501
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
because we don't have teams 200 people deep

502
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
like some of the carriers or manufacturers do

503
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
to design certain aspects of their OS.

504
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Well, it sounds like people that ordered one of these

505
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
will be getting them soon.

506
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Any numbers?

507
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Like, do you have a rough idea

508
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
of how many phones are going to be out there?

509
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Well, we got half, so 3,000 are out,

510
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
so we still have some, so you can still buy them,

511
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
and the numbers are obviously the 3-gigabyte version

512
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
is the most wanted, so they mostly got sold there.

513
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Still, some people cannot afford the big price of 2,200,

514
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
so they go for the cheaper one for 1,500,

515
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and, yeah, we have 7 to 3 ratio here,

516
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and, yeah, it's still there,

517
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and you can still grab them.

518
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Very good.

519
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Any other mangero news you want to share with us

520
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
before we move along?

521
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Well, we are working on the new version called Nibia.

522
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
We might go with the 5.9 kernel

523
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and the latest Plasma and the latest GNOME,

524
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
but if you want to keep the stable version,

525
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
we got released yesterday the Mica 20.1.2,

526
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
which fixed the Bluetooth bleeding tooth issues.

527
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Very good.

528
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You can go there and have that.

529
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
How was that process?

530
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Did that get fixed upstream fairly quickly for you guys,

531
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and then it was a matter of integration?

532
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The problem was the news about the vulnerability was too early,

533
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
so nobody was informed.

534
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The kernel developers had it, so you could not do it properly,

535
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
like there's the patch, and then we release the vulnerability,

536
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and everybody can be prepared and have it in every branch,

537
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
so we had to play the catch-up as usual.

538
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
We did it first in the unstable branch,

539
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and then fast-forwarded to testing

540
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and did a snap only for the kernels in the stable,

541
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and then I had to spin all the isos,

542
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
which are six by now for the main releases,

543
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and then I had to announce it and so on,

544
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
so it took me one day to get the isos out,

545
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
so today we have the homepage also updated,

546
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and since yesterday, you can already download it.

547
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Very good.

548
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah, we covered the news in Linux Action News

549
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and did a little analysis,

550
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and one of my takeaways on that BlueZ story is,

551
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
you know, once again, Intel blew the messaging.

552
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
They didn't inform the kernel developers

553
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
or the distribution projects fast enough,

554
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and then it essentially, you know, they put the word out

555
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
early Eastern time, and then by lunch Eastern time,

556
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
it was on ZDNet and other sites.

557
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It had been released to the press as well,

558
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and so then people knew about an act of vulnerability

559
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
before the developers even had a chance

560
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
to start getting the patches shipped,

561
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
so thanks for jumping on that really quick,

562
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and it sounds like good news is ahead

563
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
for Manjaro PinePhone Community Edition,

564
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
so thanks for joining us, Filip.

565
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
No problem.

566
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm always happy to be here.

567
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Well, then let's do a little bit of—

568
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
let's do a little housekeeping.

569
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I got it tidied up around here.

570
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I want to mention the Luplug is rocking.

571
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
They had a great one this Sunday

572
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
where they talked about browsers

573
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and had some extension developers stop by.

574
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Talk about an awesome hangout.

575
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's every single Sunday, noon Pacific time.

576
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's on the calendar though,

577
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar.

578
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Hang out at the Luplug.

579
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The other nice thing about it is you get your—

580
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
you get your mumble set up to do that,

581
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and you do that in the lobby,

582
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
and then you can join us for the main show,

583
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
hang out in the show.

584
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You're set up for Tuesday.

585
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Pro tip.

586
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Also, another pro tip,

587
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
consider grabbing the Jupiter Broadcasting All Shows feed.

588
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
We've relaunched Linux Action News and Coder Radio,

589
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and you know the network itself has a nice focus now.

590
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's a great feed,

591
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and you get anything new we might be launching.

592
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Also, it is political season in the States,

593
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
so there will be a debate this week,

594
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and I will be live streaming that over at twitch.tv slash unfilter,

595
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
or you can just go to unfilter.show slash live.

596
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Unfilter is no longer part of JB,

597
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
but it is up and cranking to cover the people's history in real time.

598
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So go check that out and join me and hang out.

599
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I think it's, is it Thursday night?

600
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It is.

601
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah.

602
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So welcome to join me over there.

603
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Also, I am very excited to announce that Wes Payne is joining

604
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
the internet's favorite Linux news show very soon.

605
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Mr. Joe Resington will be taking over editing duties from Drew

606
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
on this podcast.

607
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's a good news, bad news situation.

608
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Drew got a job.

609
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
We're very, very happy for that.

610
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But Drew also now has to make that his first priority.

611
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So he is transitioning editing to Joe,

612
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
which takes a considerable amount of time.

613
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And one of the things we want to do is keep people sustainable.

614
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Don't want to burn them out.

615
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I mean, we make a mess over here and someone's got to clean it up.

616
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Learned that lesson the hard way last time we were independent

617
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and taking that forward, you know, Joe and I had a real talk

618
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and to keep him healthy and not overwork him,

619
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
he's going to focus on editing

620
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
because if it's not Drew, there's really nobody else in the world qualified.

621
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And I mean it.

622
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Thank you for offering to edit.

623
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But this is a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

624
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
sometimes eight or twelve track production live audio podcast.

625
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And we have a very high standard.

626
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And so when it came down to it, we wanted Joe to have that job.

627
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And it gives him his Sunday back, too.

628
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So he'll be editing and Wes will be taking his place on Linux Action News.

629
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And I'm really excited about that because not only has Wes always been involved

630
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
behind the scenes on Linux Action News,

631
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
he's been there when one when Joe or I needed a day off.

632
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But Wes follows tons of stories that never make it into LUP.

633
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So we're going to have a lot we can talk about there.

634
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And we'll do a good job of separating out what goes into LUP,

635
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
you know, more of the community focused stuff

636
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
versus the stuff that really dented the open source universe.

637
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
That'll be in Linux Action News every Sunday.

638
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And so if you want a little more Wes and myself, go over to linuxactionnews.com

639
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
slash subscribe and start getting it because it's going to be us rocking it.

640
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'm really excited to do it with Wes because you guys, you know,

641
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I love doing a show with him. Right. So it's great.

642
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Plus, it gives another day of the week we can barbecue, which is a victory.

643
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Oh, I'm excited for that as well.

644
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And I mean, Linux Action News is it's a network staple.

645
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I was so excited when it started being relaunched.

646
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And I've always been honored to be a part of it.

647
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And you're right. I think, you know, Linux Unplugged, it's our community space.

648
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's time to hang out with the mumble room.

649
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It's time to talk to folks doing all this great work.

650
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But Linux Action News stands alone as this sort of, you know,

651
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
bastion of keeping up with what's actually happening, tight, critical analysis.

652
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The only thing I'm sad about is I no longer have my favorite Monday morning podcast.

653
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yeah. And that is one of the things when you start doing the shows,

654
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
you can listen, but it's just not quite the same experience.

655
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So that'll be coming up at the beginning of November is when we're going to make that transition.

656
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So Joe's got one more week.

657
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And, you know, it's kind of nice for us because it means he can still be involved.

658
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We still get to hang out with our friend.

659
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
He's now integrated into Linux Unplugged, which means that we'll be talking to him on a daily basis.

660
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So for us, it means Drew gets a job, Joe gets a little better work life balance,

661
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and Wes gets to join me on Sundays to crank out a Linux Action News and do some barbecue.

662
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So I think it's going to be pretty good all around.

663
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It just means a little adjustments, but we wanted to give you a heads up right here

664
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
that it's happening so that way you're not caught off guard.

665
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And that is all the tidying.

666
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Let's get it all out of here and let's talk about Groovy Gorilla Ubuntu 2010,

667
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
which is released this week.

668
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The release candidates are like everything done and frozen has been out for a few days.

669
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That's what Wes and I have been kicking around.

670
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I may do a little follow up next week on a couple of other items once it's officially released.

671
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But by the time you're listening to this, it probably already is.

672
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Ubuntu 2010 ships with a lot of new stuff that we've been waiting for,

673
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
like a new version of GNOME Shell and what was once considered or called

674
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
the largest kernel update ever, Linux 5.8.

675
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So there's a lot of really good stuff that makes 2010 a compelling release

676
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and something I wanted to give a go.

677
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Some quality of life things that have improved like better fingerprint support

678
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and active directory integration, more on that later.

679
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But also like, you know, actual decent hardware support.

680
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Getting 5.8 in there, which was released in May of 2020, no small feat.

681
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It has new features like the option to specify an initial RAM disk image.

682
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It has mitigations for the special register buffer data sampling flaw,

683
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
a.k.a. the crosstalk hardware vulnerability in Intel processors.

684
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It has inline encryption support for the block layer.

685
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It now supports the RockChip video decoders, which is awesome.

686
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah.

687
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It has a new event notification mechanism in 5.8.

688
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Also 5.8 has support for LZO RLE compression in the F2FS file system.

689
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And that's just scratching the surface.

690
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
There's improvements in there for AMD graphics.

691
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
There is CPU frequency scaler improvements in there.

692
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
There's a ton of stuff in 5.8 that you just get by installing Ubuntu 2010.

693
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And also your video card still works.

694
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Well, and, you know, 5.8 was a great kernel.

695
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But if you've been sticking with Ubuntu since 2004,

696
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
you get all those interim updates as well, right?

697
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I mean, like 5.7 had some good stuff, everything in there.

698
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It's just a fancy, shiny new kernel.

699
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And I think in order to really appreciate everything that's nice

700
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
about the official flavor of Ubuntu, we can talk about the other ones later,

701
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
is you also get GNOME Shell 3.38, which will also be landing in Fedora 33 soon.

702
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But you have an improved settings panel where you also can now manage

703
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
parental controls for standard user accounts,

704
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
which I have two kids that are using Linux as their desktop.

705
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
That's actually kind of an interesting feature for me.

706
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
There's other improvements to settings to include

707
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
the fingerprint enrollment stuff that I mentioned.

708
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And better multi-monitor support is in 3.38,

709
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
as well as a new revamped screenshot and sound recorder tools

710
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
which have been redesigned.

711
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And there's the new tracker search stuff.

712
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Tracker 3 is in GNOME Shell 3.8 and 3.38.

713
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And a lot of the core GNOME apps have been updated

714
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
to take advantage of the new search tool.

715
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And then under the hoods, they've switched from IP tables to NF tables

716
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
for the networking stuff.

717
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So in a way, it's a really significant release that on the surface

718
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
doesn't feel ultimately all that different from 2004, the LTS.

719
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Did you get that experience?

720
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Things are definitely a little bit shinier.

721
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I can tell there's been polishing going on in the backend,

722
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
especially with GNOME 3.38, which is just...

723
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I've been spending a lot of time on Plasma lately,

724
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and it's nice to be back home in GNOME.

725
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But you're right.

726
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I mean, new background, you know, some smoothification,

727
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
some new updates, some new features.

728
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
But honestly, I can't tell that much of a difference

729
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
because it just feels like being back on a modern Ubuntu desktop.

730
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I don't think that's bad, though.

731
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It definitely is the...

732
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's become cliche to say this now,

733
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
but it is the best performing version of GNOME Shell.

734
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And that translates to a very, very good desktop experience.

735
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And it is good enough that after what has been a very long, stable process,

736
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
it has pulled me off of Plasma again.

737
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I can't help but feel like GNOME Shell just feels like

738
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
a super refined, cohesive desktop experience that is barely in my way

739
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
when I'm using an application

740
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and gives me just the right amount of tools

741
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
to do some window management in a way that I like

742
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
without it feeling sort of like it's been put together,

743
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
like by multiple pieces, like the taskbar is one piece,

744
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
the system tray is one piece, the launcher is another piece,

745
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
the icon is another piece, the desktop is another...

746
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It all feels like in some desktops, like individual components

747
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
that are all working together, which it all really is,

748
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
but in GNOME Shell, especially with 3.3.8,

749
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
and I really like just the minor improvements to,

750
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
like, check a box now to show battery percentage

751
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
or Wi-Fi share with a QR code or...

752
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Now, it's just a small thing, right?

753
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But they've added the...

754
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
They've just kind of redone the way that the user menu settings work,

755
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
so you click that down and you have an option right in there now to restart.

756
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It's just a lot of little small things that maybe should have always been there,

757
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
but they're there now.

758
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Right. That's it. I think it's...

759
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
This whole series of, you know, modern GNOME,

760
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
it started off with a very strong sort of design language,

761
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
design intent, but there's been holes, there's been gaps,

762
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
there's been changes figuring things out.

763
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But I think we're now finally at, not the end of that road,

764
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
but a really healthy middle spot of that road,

765
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
where it all just works together,

766
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
and as each of the small pieces gets updated, brought into line,

767
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
it just gets smoother and smoother.

768
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Although the one thing that I have hated about Plasma is,

769
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
you know, on your default login screen,

770
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
when you're testing out a new distro, it looks terrible

771
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
if you haven't set yourself up a nice little home user icon,

772
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
you know, a user icon for yourself at the login screen.

773
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You've got that not-GNOME now, too.

774
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah, boy, that...

775
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You know, I still... I know it's been out for a couple of releases

776
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
or at least one release, but the new login and lock screen is...

777
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It's so good.

778
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So good. It's so good.

779
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I have decided, though, that I am not a fan

780
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
of bringing the OEM logo forward during the boot process,

781
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
which is now supposed to be that, you know,

782
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
that so-much-lauded-after seamless boot process.

783
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I don't like it.

784
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Because it makes it feel like my machine's taking way too long to post,

785
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
which, back in the day, if your machine was taking a while to post,

786
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
that meant something was wrong.

787
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And so it makes me uncomfortable.

788
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Is this one of those divides between new-school Linux users

789
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and old-school Linux users, where you have that built-in suspicion?

790
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But if you were just, you know, you were migrating from modern-day Mac OS,

791
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
wouldn't that be what you expect?

792
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Well, I got a little special Ubuntu-flavored conspiracy bacon.

793
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Actually, it's not just Ubuntu, but I think the reason, my conspiracy...

794
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Get your tinfoil hat ready.

795
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
My idea, the reason why all the distributions went for the seamless boot

796
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
is because it essentially puts the boot-up process on the OEM.

797
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So what I see when I boot up, say, like a ThinkPad,

798
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
is I get a Lenovo logo the entire time.

799
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So if I was just a, you know, an average user

800
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
who didn't really know how this stuff worked,

801
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I would think it was something with my Lenovo that was taking a while,

802
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and then, boom, all of a sudden, I get my desktop, right?

803
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
They're punting the blame.

804
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
That's it. All the hard work of, you know, enabling the nice UEFI pass-through,

805
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
keeping that vendor logo displayed seamlessly with no flashing,

806
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
it's just to blame the OEM.

807
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Right. I figured it out.

808
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You're welcome, everybody.

809
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So I also know that one of the other major things about this release

810
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
is straight-up desktop support for the Raspberry Pi 4.

811
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Now, I didn't get a chance to give this a go like I want,

812
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
so I think this will be one of the items I follow up on in the future.

813
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I downloaded it. It's an ISO, not a traditional, like, image

814
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
that you would get for an SD card.

815
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
It's an ISO that I tried flashing to my SD card,

816
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
but I also tried flashing to a standard USB thumb drive.

817
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I was going to say, yeah, did you need a special tool to burn it,

818
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
or it just worked?

819
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You know, it's possible that that Pi doesn't,

820
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
hasn't been updated enough to support USB boot,

821
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
but I think you're supposed to flash it to a thumb drive

822
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
because it's an ISO image, not like a file system SD card image.

823
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So what do I know?

824
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
But I wanted to give that another pass and give that more time

825
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and see, maybe if I could even pull out my 8 gig Pi and try it on that,

826
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I thought that'd be kind of cool.

827
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So I'll follow up on that, but seeing Canonical just go after the Pi 4,

828
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
like a series platform, I just give high marks to.

829
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yes.

830
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Really like it.

831
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Well, you know, I think we kind of complained.

832
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
It took a little while.

833
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It wasn't always where we wanted it, but once they've added it,

834
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
just having that there as a continual burden of support

835
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
and seeing that followed through, that's awesome.

836
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yeah, and it seems like the situation on the Pi

837
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
just keeps going from good to better.

838
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Like, last week we talked about ESXi,

839
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
which will have some follow-up and the feedback coming out

840
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
for the Raspberry Pi.

841
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And then today, as we sat down to record the show,

842
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I saw that there was a pretty big update on the Raspberry Pi blog about Vulkan

843
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
getting merged into Mesa and then that being upstream.

844
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And so you're getting official Vulkan Mesa drivers

845
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
that are compatible with the Raspberry Pi 4 being upstream now,

846
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
and that is just...

847
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Awesome.

848
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Big news.

849
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah, it's big news.

850
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And it's passing 100,000 different Vulkan standard tests now

851
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
that come from the Kronos group, and it's just more and more.

852
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Like, it's basically becoming one of a small handful

853
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
of fully Vulkan-compliant little small board computers.

854
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And the Raspberry Pi, I think, should be taken more seriously

855
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
by all the distributions.

856
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I know they're all trying, but the reality is that, you know,

857
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
the Pi 4 is fantastic.

858
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
The Pi 5 is going to be even better.

859
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
The Pi 6, the Pi 7, the Pi 8.

860
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And if you start now, when it's just on the cusp,

861
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
if you start now, then by the time that the Pi 6 or the Pi 8

862
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
is rolling around, your distribution is going to have this nail.

863
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Now, thankfully, all that will be upstream,

864
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and other distributions will be able to jump on board,

865
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
but I think Canonical is showing leadership here.

866
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So I really do want to give it a go on the Pi 4,

867
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
because I think that has serious long-term potential.

868
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But we will see.

869
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Maybe the performance will be horrible.

870
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I don't know.

871
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And I don't even know what desktop I'm on.

872
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I might be GNOME Shell.

873
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I don't know.

874
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I guess we'll find out.

875
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I also had some strange issues that I didn't run into

876
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
that I kind of chalk up to being early days.

877
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
But I didn't run into these issues before I put 2010 on the system.

878
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
My Wi-Fi reception just seemed to be a lot worse,

879
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
dropping off a lot when I'm upstairs in the studio.

880
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I've never, ever had this problem on this machine.

881
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I had Manjaro on it before I put 2010 on there.

882
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
No issues at all.

883
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I don't really know if that's a 2010 problem, a driver problem,

884
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
or maybe just some weird Wi-Fi interference going on.

885
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It did strike me as funny that over on Discourse,

886
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
better Wi-Fi performance was one of the highlights for kernel 5.8.

887
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
But to my end, I've not had that problem.

888
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And I think we're on pretty similar hardware.

889
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

890
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It really could just be the Wi-Fi in the studio on that one.

891
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The other one that bit me at one point was I did the minimal install,

892
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
because I love that they have that as an option.

893
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Also, all of my test systems were CFS,

894
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
because I'm going to push all the buttons.

895
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And when I did the minimal install, the Ubuntu Software Center

896
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
was not installed, but the icon was in the sidebar.

897
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And as I try these in their earlier versions,

898
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I try to figure out if that's a bug or not.

899
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I didn't see that one listed as a bug.

900
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Might also just be my box, because I tried 2010 on another box,

901
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and it didn't have that problem.

902
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So my intention here is to kind of take Ubuntu 2010

903
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and try to give the audience an idea if it's worth upgrading

904
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
if they're running on 2004 every day.

905
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And I saw some people in the chat room were saying

906
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
they're actually going to put 2010 on their servers.

907
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I think that's a pretty clear line there is 2004 LTS

908
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
is going to be your best option for a server.

909
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But as far as a desktop or a workstation goes,

910
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm not absolutely convinced that 2010 is a must upgrade

911
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
unless you need something in 5.8

912
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
or you need something in GNOME Shell 3.3.8-like performance.

913
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But 2004 will get a lot of this backported.

914
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Hardware enablements will be backported.

915
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Sometimes even significant GNOME Shell performance fixes

916
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
will get backported to the LTS, to the version that's in the LTS.

917
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So I actually think I don't know if I could make the recommendation

918
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
if 2004 is working for you today to actually upgrade to 2010.

919
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You know, I think you're right about that.

920
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You know, it's just that the deltas get smaller and smaller,

921
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
you know, as you have more features, as more things are made,

922
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
snaps, as just the Linux ecosystem gets better and better

923
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
with more application support.

924
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Modern GNOMES, you know, a small point release

925
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
might get you a lot of nice features, but it's already pretty darn good.

926
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It feels like right now, 2010 is more of a back-end polish release

927
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
than it is as something maybe more user-facing.

928
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Now, if you, you know, you really love the Linux desktop,

929
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
yeah, there's a lot of great stuff in here to like,

930
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
really happy to see the work.

931
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It just doesn't have a noticeable feel difference.

932
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And it's clearly building towards the next LTS,

933
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
which is going to accumulate all of this stuff and going to be really great.

934
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
For myself personally, when I load a new Ubuntu system though,

935
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'll be going 2010.

936
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It's got enough for me that it pushes the buttons.

937
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I do think you're right there that the next LTS is going to be super solid.

938
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Yeah.

939
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And then I think there's one other category of user

940
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
that should very seriously consider going to 2010,

941
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and that is anyone who needs to integrate with an Active Directory environment,

942
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
because they've built an Active Directory support into the installer

943
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
like Fedora has now.

944
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And with Fedora 33 coming out soon and 2010 coming out soon

945
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and both of them rocking Active Directory support,

946
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
and then today Microsoft announcing Microsoft Edge for Linux,

947
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
there is, there's a version of me from about 15 years ago

948
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
that was using Xandros and Crossover Office

949
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
to barely integrate with a Microsoft infrastructure

950
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
that looks back at that and goes, wow, what an era we're in now.

951
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And so if you are an Active Directory user

952
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
that you need Active Directory support on your Linux desktop,

953
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
this kind of seems like a slam dunk for you.

954
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Something Wes and I want to try in the future,

955
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
it's all a matter of timing,

956
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
is maybe set up something like free IPA

957
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
or maybe even Azure Active Directory, I don't know,

958
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and see if we can point our Fedora and Ubuntu boxes at it

959
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
to start authenticating.

960
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Let's go crazy. Let's enterprise the studio.

961
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I mean, I would actually, even just for my LAN,

962
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
would very much like to have a single sign-on across all my machines

963
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
and across all the studio machines.

964
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I mean, you could have a Wes account here at the studio

965
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and you could log into every system as Wes

966
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
and we wouldn't have to set it up manually for each one of them,

967
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
which we legitimately have enough now where that would be kind of nice.

968
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It would be nice.

969
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I think I'd also kind of like it to be everywhere I am though.

970
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I'd kind of like to be able to use the same logins at home

971
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and get access to some of the same resources,

972
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
which is maybe where hosted Azure,

973
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I don't know if that's even worth it,

974
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
but if anybody out there has any experience with the like free IPA

975
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
or hosted Azure or something like that,

976
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I don't really fancy actually installing Windows

977
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
and running Active Directory.

978
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Yeah, we'd like this to be Windows free,

979
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
but also we want encrypted VPN everywhere roaming accounts.

980
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Yes, exactly. So if you've got any tips, linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

981
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
That'll be on our to-do list to test as well as following up on Raspberry Pi 4 efforts.

982
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And just a big congratulations to the canonical team

983
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
and to Wimpy and the desktop team in particular.

984
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
This is, in my opinion, it's one of the best looking.

985
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I think it's now a toss up between 2010 and pop

986
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
and they are two really great experiences that are very opinionated.

987
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I think Ubuntu remains now one of the most opinionated Linux experiences

988
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and I mean that in a good way than many distros out there.

989
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
There's some out there, I'm not taking away from all,

990
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
but they have a real branded look going.

991
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You can tell you're on an Ubuntu system right away.

992
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I can tell because I know enough Linux desktops.

993
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I can recognize usually a SUSE system and a Manjaro system,

994
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
but the Ubuntu colors with the Ubuntu theme and all of it just really pop

995
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
and they're really iconic at this point.

996
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
And it's great because we will often talk about how the distribution doesn't matter

997
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and that is so true in so many ways now.

998
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But there's still some differentiation out there.

999
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Like next week when we try Fedora 33,

1000
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
it's going to be a very upstream experience, which is also a good thing.

1001
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It's just a different experience.

1002
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And I am very grateful that we have some standout differentiators in the desktop.

1003
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Some may look at it as fragmentation, but I look at it as everybody taking a crack at something

1004
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and sometimes like in the case of Ubuntu, I think they get it right

1005
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
and they get some things nailed that maybe upstream should consider.

1006
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I really like their dock implementation.

1007
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It is super slick as an eGPU user.

1008
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I very much appreciate that I can right click on an icon

1009
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
and right there from my launcher in GNOME Shell,

1010
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I can say execute this application on the external GPU.

1011
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
That's on a Linux desktop, a mainstream Linux desktop.

1012
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah, so I'm hitting that all the time for Steam.

1013
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
What I used to do, and they're all still in there actually when I think about it,

1014
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
but I used to have to do it in the Steam launch options for every single game.

1015
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And this is way better.

1016
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's just right there integrated in.

1017
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Notifications for Telegram look great on the dock.

1018
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It's all really, really well done.

1019
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
And the experience of getting things up and going is simple.

1020
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I'm not always clear on when I install something if I'm getting a snap or deb still,

1021
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
but I'm starting to get a better sense the more I use the system when that's going to happen.

1022
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
So it'll be my driver.

1023
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Any Ubuntu system I set up, it'll be a 2010.

1024
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Now, the real question will be if I end up sticking with 2010,

1025
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Fedora 33 or POP 2010, but that's all yet to be seen.

1026
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
We will be trying Fedora 33 next week.

1027
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So if you want to install that when it's released

1028
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
and join us in the mumble or join us in the chat room and share your thoughts

1029
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
or in the Luplug, you are absolutely welcome.

1030
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And congratulations to all the teams involved and all of the hard work.

1031
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It's a killer release.

1032
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Woo-hoo!

1033
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It's pretty great.

1034
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's pretty great.

1035
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Also, thank you to the Unplugged Core contributors.

1036
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
We really appreciate you helping us keep this show independent at unpluggedcore.com.

1037
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
You keep this show going.

1038
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You help reduce the ad load needed to make the show profitable,

1039
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
and you also get some perks.

1040
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
As a core contributor, you get access to two different feeds of your choice.

1041
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Well, or both, I suppose.

1042
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Feed 1 is an ad, limited ad version.

1043
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I have to be careful because there are some we are contractually obligated to include.

1044
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
But it is a limited ad version of the show.

1045
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It's the same full production.

1046
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's got now Joe's special touch and sauce that has been sprinkled onto it

1047
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and then packaged up and released for your consumption.

1048
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And that's Feed 1.

1049
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Then there's Feed 2, which is the full live stream.

1050
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
All our screw-ups, all the stuff that never makes it into the show,

1051
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
our test audio when we take a break, if somebody gets disconnected,

1052
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
the extended pre- and post-show, which is almost an entirely additional show,

1053
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
that's all in that feed.

1054
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And you can get that as well if you like something that's long

1055
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
and maybe doesn't sound quite as good.

1056
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Full disclosure.

1057
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
But it is absolutely out there,

1058
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and it's another way we can be fully transparent with our community.

1059
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
That's a special sauce on the side.

1060
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Unpluggedcore.com, you become a member, you support the show.

1061
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Now let's do a little feedback.

1062
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
We got some messages in about ESXi Arm and Fling.

1063
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So since this first one is in my namesake, will you take it?

1064
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Yeah, all right.

1065
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Chris writes, and actually I think this feedback was over on Telegram.

1066
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Just caught the recent episode of Links Unplugged.

1067
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
That'd be last week.

1068
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And your comments regarding ESXi on the Pi.

1069
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
VMware seems to be targeting this as a platform for edge computing

1070
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and network services.

1071
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
At the end of the day, I think for you and I,

1072
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
a Pi 4 is really only going to give you a very limited ESXi host

1073
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
without much in the way of features.

1074
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
You know, at least without vCenter,

1075
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
running on a much beefier hardware somewhere else on the network.

1076
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
But I'm looking to play with this as well,

1077
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and it might just be a catalyst for me to purchase a couple more Pis.

1078
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Now I don't believe VMware sees the Pi as anything other than a test

1079
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
and development platform, but it's exciting nonetheless.

1080
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I think so.

1081
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah, Debrass in the IRC is asking,

1082
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
is there any take on performance of ESXi on the Pi versus KVM?

1083
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So we don't have our own internal numbers yet,

1084
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
but I did do early testing on KVM, and it was unusable.

1085
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It was just, it took 10 minutes for an ARM version of Debian to boot.

1086
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
It's not going to happen, guys.

1087
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So if ESXi is doing better than that,

1088
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and what I seem to observe so far, it is doing much better than that.

1089
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Also, there's a, as I understand it at the moment,

1090
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
a limitation where you're not able to use local storage

1091
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
on the Raspberry Pi for ESXi,

1092
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
so you need to use something like NFS or iSCSI.

1093
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
It does make me think that Chris, other Chris might be right in that,

1094
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
you know, this is still probably set up for larger or lab environments

1095
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
where you've got those resources already there.

1096
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
That's not a big deal.

1097
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It might be a little more work if you're trying to set it up

1098
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
just to play with at home.

1099
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah, I think that's well put.

1100
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And obviously, and I talked a little bit about this on,

1101
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I think, Koda Radio too, but it's hugely compelling for developers

1102
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
who are targeting large ARM servers in the cloud,

1103
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
but they need something local that doesn't cost them $3,000 to $6,000

1104
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
just so they can do their dev test on.

1105
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And so, you know, if you can get a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8 gigs of RAM,

1106
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and you can run maybe two test VMs just to try executing your code

1107
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
in an ARM environment that isn't necessarily very hardware-specific

1108
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
because the virtualization abstracts away the individual hardware components,

1109
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
it may mean that developers now have a really easily

1110
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
and approachable way to develop ARM cloud software

1111
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
and then, you know, build it locally on a Raspberry Pi with VMware

1112
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
and then deploy it on a big beefy VMware server in the cloud.

1113
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
That could be it.

1114
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Well, let's see.

1115
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Drew actually, Drew came in with some feedback, voice mail style.

1116
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Hey, Chris. Hey, Wes.

1117
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
First time, long time.

1118
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I was just listening to LUP 3.75,

1119
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
and I think you guys might have missed the mark a little bit about ESXi on ARM.

1120
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Yes, I know it's on Fling,

1121
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
but this doesn't feel like just some random experiment to me.

1122
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It feels more like they're trying to move towards being able to support ARM data centers.

1123
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And the Raspberry Pi is a really great way to build a minimum viable project.

1124
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You have known hardware and you can start building on ARM

1125
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
before you start looking at some of the bigger processors that have been coming out.

1126
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I don't know, I could be wrong,

1127
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
but this feels more to me like they are planning for the next five years

1128
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
of trying to make sure that they are up to standards

1129
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
of what data centers are going to look like.

1130
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And that could be ARM.

1131
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Anyways, love the show.

1132
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Keep it up. Thanks, guys.

1133
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Thanks, Drew.

1134
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Yeah, that's kind of where I'm thinking.

1135
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
What do you think about that, Wes?

1136
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It's really a move for developers.

1137
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Yeah, right.

1138
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I mean, it's a big change.

1139
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
In some ways, maybe not,

1140
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
but you got to make sure everything actually works throughout your entire stack.

1141
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And this is the first step down that road,

1142
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
get you comfortable using ARM.

1143
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And yeah, okay, maybe the Pis aren't the hardware that ends up being deployed,

1144
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
but local development needs something in dev,

1145
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
you need something in staging before that you actually ship it on, you know,

1146
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
whatever hardware gets allocated down the line once the contracts are all signed.

1147
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Raspberry Pis are ubiquitous already.

1148
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Probably a lot of developers in this space have one or two

1149
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
or however many you have, Chris, already.

1150
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
So if you're going to start somewhere, make it cheap and easy.

1151
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I plead the fifth on that one.

1152
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
All right, let's do some picks before we get out of here.

1153
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Self-hosted 30 comes out later this week.

1154
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And in there, we'll talk about this cool rig for like under $100

1155
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
that Alex built to stress test a bunch of USB drives that he shucked

1156
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
with Prime Day and Black Friday coming up.

1157
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
He wanted to go through and figure out, like,

1158
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
if you're going to buy a drive on Black Friday,

1159
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
get this one because it's got XYZ drive in there.

1160
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And he actually found a real gem, but I won't spoil it.

1161
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
However, and we'll take out a little bit that he used on the stress test system.

1162
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
If you would like to test your own disk, get a sense of their smart status,

1163
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
but also put them through their paces, I recommend you check out bad blocks.

1164
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
You may have heard of it before.

1165
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It's been around for a very long time.

1166
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
But if you never have, it's worth a go.

1167
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Give it a try.

1168
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Punish one of your disks and see what happens.

1169
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
So, you know, for example, if you get a disk that has a smart error,

1170
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
that gives you an idea that something's wrong.

1171
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But what if there's something further down on the disk

1172
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
that you don't really access that very often that wouldn't trigger a smart error?

1173
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
It's only going to passively watch for errors.

1174
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So what you can do with bad blocks is actively write simple patterns

1175
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
to every block of the device and then check them.

1176
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Search for damaged areas.

1177
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Kind of like you would do with a RAM check, actually,

1178
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
only it's on a disk and it takes a long time.

1179
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And this is just a great way to say you get a used disk

1180
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
before you put it in production.

1181
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Run this at it.

1182
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
We have very graciously a listener, Mike, has sent us like a whole batch of disks.

1183
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
This would be a great tool because they're refurbished disks.

1184
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I'll run this on it first before we put them into production.

1185
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
It's bad blocks.

1186
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It's just that kind of forgotten Linux infrastructure and tooling,

1187
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
you know, that we all have at our fingertips

1188
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
because many sysadmins before us have come and gone

1189
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
and these tools are out there.

1190
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
If you're going to invest in a whole bunch of stuff, yeah,

1191
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
why not test it first?

1192
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Right.

1193
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Also, shaking the disk to try to find the bad blocks does not work.

1194
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Chatroom is suggesting that.

1195
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
They are incorrect.

1196
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
It is a good workout though.

1197
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
If you'd like to be in our chatroom or our mumble room,

1198
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
we'd love to have you join us live.

1199
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
We do it every Tuesday at noon Pacific.

1200
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
See you next week.

1201
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Same bad time, same bad station.

1202
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
We do it over at jblive.tv.

1203
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
We also stream at twitch.tv slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

1204
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
If you just want to follow us over there if you're already a Twitch user,

1205
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
you get notifications when we're live.

1206
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Or get the download version.

1207
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Honestly, it sounds the best.

1208
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
You can subscribe at linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe.

1209
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
The show is at Linux Unplugged.

1210
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
On the Twitter, I'm at Chris LAS.

1211
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
He's at Westpane.

1212
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And the whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

1213
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Thanks to our guests for joining us this week.

1214
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Thanks to our listeners.

1215
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And thanks to all our core contributors.

1216
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
We'll see you right back here.

1217
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Not Monday.

1218
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
No, not Sunday.

1219
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Wednesday?

1220
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Nope, nope, nope, not Wednesday.

1221
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Next Tuesday!

1222
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Do not hammer your disks either.

1223
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
That will also damage them.

1224
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I do know somebody.

1225
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
We all know somebody.

1226
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
We've known him.

1227
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
He's been on the shows before that does like to take a big drill to hard drives

1228
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
before he throws them out and just goes to town.

1229
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Just drilling holes into them.

1230
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Well, you can't trust that encryption, Chris.

1231
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I go for D-band myself.

1232
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Before I give away a disk, I run old D-band on there.

1233
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And that's my preferred way to clear a drive before I turn it over.

1234
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
You don't just fill it with a bunch of good JB content.

1235
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Why not, right?

1236
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Here's the back catalog, stranger.

1237
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:31,000
That's a great idea.
