1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Since you a web-based IRC client. Oh you did. Where did you send that to me? Oh, oh in the slacks

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,920
Oh, okay, speaking of slack speaking of slack

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh jeez no not that oh no not that not

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,480
Anything but the Gibson I just actually with full Gibson just for a second full Gibson

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,800
So what is this West what is this? Oh, a

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:34,600
Self-hosted web IRC let it speak for itself. Hmm. Yeah, so this is called shout a self-hosted web IRC client

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,800
That's pretty cool. Always connected shout never sleeps

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,880
Just sign in and pick up where you left off the client works smoothly on every desktop smartphone and tablet

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,520
Shout is open source and licensed under MIT

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,120
This is exactly exactly what I was talking about West. Let's say we got a demo right here. Let's try it out. Yeah

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,560
So let's call did now your name is gonna be Chris demo. Okay guys, don't be a jerk. Okay, don't don't troll me

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,440
Okay, so oh, oh, they won't let me change the server. Oh, yes, they will Willie. Nope. I can't change the server

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,040
Well, okay. We'll just go then I was gonna try to connect to geek shed

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,840
you know, this is

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,280
This is pretty plain, but it's quite plain. Yeah, is it is it configurable?

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,520
Here's the thing. I'm gonna go ahead and show you what it looks like

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,120
Here we go. Change sessions show join show parts. I like that. I like that. You can turn that off. That's cool

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,720
Show quits. I don't need any of that enabled colored nix. I like that. I

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
Enable notifications do not want that

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,620
Okay, so it's got some configuration options, but the one thing it doesn't let you configure is the look of it. Apparently

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,520
It's pretty stark. I mean would be nice, but it's almost doable

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,320
You know

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,320
I think I'm gonna give it a I think I'm gonna give it a try

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,280
Because I was looking at IRC cloud and this is I'm liking this so self-hosted web IRC client shout. Thanks Wes. Good find

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,160
How did you find that? I think that is a good find found it somewhere laying on the Internet

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,760
I don't know just laying around laying around that crazy. You know, I'm I should be making use of that

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,200
I did something else with a web IRC thingy today and

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,360
I'm gonna replace it with this. What a web IRC thing. Does anyone tell me what was it? What was it? Oh

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,960
I said, well, I guess it's very oh, it's awkward. I can't I can't say oh

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:23,240
Was a proprietary garbage it was wasn't it? No, no. No, it's it's for another podcast. I've been always another podcasts website a

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Facelift

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,440
This isn't no, so this isn't IRC client you embed in the website

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,640
This is a web based IRC client. That's always connected that you bring up in your web browser

34
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,920
Yeah, no, that's that would be better than what I've done today

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,240
I'll put a link in the in the show notes

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,960
This is Linux unplugged episode 130 for February 2nd 2016

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
You

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,920
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show and it's Jones and for a new rig. My name is Chris

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,440
My name is Wes. I don't know Wes

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,040
Maybe it's because before every show Wimpy gives me a hard time about the fact that my that has something to deal with it

41
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,680
That might be stoking the flames as they say well coming up on today's episode of the unplugged show

42
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,800
We're not talking about my drama. No. No, we actually have a great show coming up for you on this week some really interesting updates

43
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,240
We're gonna spend a little more time than usual going through some big stories that have come up

44
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,520
Since the Linux action show was on the air

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,800
We have a lot to cover up on and then we'll talk about this Linux command that's getting blamed for bricking laptops

46
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,480
Even when you're not running away. Yeah, I love these controversies that we just seem to fall into we'll do a quick review of tails

47
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,480
2.0

48
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,560
They say it's Edward Snowden's always of choice Wes has got it loaded right here

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,040
He's gonna give us his take and some of the challenges he ran into and then later on in the show is Linux mint drunk

50
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,220
with power

51
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,520
What the heck is X apps? I know I I we got to talk about this

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Maybe they are brilliant or maybe they're going off into the weeds Linux mint is introducing its own suite of applications

53
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,120
We'll talk about that in the show today. I got it. I just got to get your guys's take on that

54
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,600
I gotta know I gotta know and then did you hear the news?

55
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,160
Dell is

56
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,680
making their own Linux what Dell is making their own Linux and

57
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
You're not gonna believe the name

58
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,800
Do you have a guess what it is? Do you know what it is? No, I don't you don't I'm not telling anyone

59
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,480
No, no, I if you have a guess

60
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,720
I would love to hear your guess as to what you think Dell is gonna name them

61
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,280
We're gonna talk about it later in the show, but I think we give away the name now

62
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,280
I think cuz it's so great. It's so great. No, I don't know. Should I not say should we wait?

63
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,520
Okay, we'll wait don't say chat room. Don't say don't say we'll make everybody wait till the end of the show

64
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,200
But you're not gonna believe the name of of does links. Don't say it. Don't say it

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,680
Jerem we have so much to get into but before we do that West, you know

66
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,200
We got to talk about because it's become a tradition now just sort of accidentally on the show is the beer we're drinking

67
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,040
Yes, it has and I like you. So you heard me complaining and moaning on the

68
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,440
Last as you do as I do I was beer desperate and I went and I grabbed this coffee beer

69
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,400
Which actually was delicious by stone IPA or by stone?

70
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,320
This however is something completely different. This is a local Washington brew where so I doubt they'll be able to

71
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,600
To drink this so they'll just have to drink vicariously through us. How do you suppose you say that coal?

72
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Colchon, I believe Colchon

73
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,040
You're probably absolutely right so this is their this is their red ale and

74
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:47,160
It's actually it's it's not it's surprisingly good. It's not amazing, but it's surprisingly good. It's easy drinking on the show

75
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,660
You know what? It matches the weather. It's very nice out. It sure is kind of clean and crisp out

76
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,440
So there you go. I could almost be spring that almost like it's teasing us

77
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,860
So that is our beverage of choice today while we're getting started now, let's get into the show

78
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,240
Let's bring in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mumble room

79
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
freedom

80
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,720
Hello, I like it. I like it. Yeah, it's fired up today for a good show

81
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,160
Well, so let's get started with some updates. We have a little bit of a birthday party

82
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,320
I'd play the jingle but it'll get us taken down on YouTube

83
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,100
15 years of

84
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:28,800
VLC and I think actually specifically it's 15 years since VLC went GPO. Whoa. Yeah, can you believe that you know VLC?

85
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,360
Everybody has a VLC trick right like you have anything like you use VLC for that maybe is a little unconventional

86
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,100
Well, I mostly I just I do stream it every every which way. Yeah when possible

87
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:46,460
I my favorite is I take our TSP our TMP streams a lot of the television networks

88
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,120
Use these for their back-end streaming between each other and if you can find them

89
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,920
You can use them to get the raw feed and then you can record it which is great for unfiltered

90
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,440
And so you can use VLC to read it right to an MKB file with perfect, you know x264, whatever your codec

91
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,480
It could be Vorbis and Theora, whatever

92
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,400
And it is I mean that's what I use it for. I know a lot of people. Oh, oh

93
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,320
We use it here in studio to send

94
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,400
Where as you can see over there on that screen we have VLC that is playing reruns over there

95
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,000
Yep, and then we have OBS run this so that's on an arch desktop

96
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:28,380
We have OBS that is taking that VLC window and recapturing it and sending it as an RTSP stream back over to

97
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,100
This machine to run as reruns and I can tune into that stream using VLC from any computer in the studio

98
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,620
And I can check on what's going on in the live stream just by doing that. It's really cool

99
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,080
I did that over the holidays. I set up a repeating Star Wars stream for some of my friends

100
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:48,900
You know before before the movie came out with the VLC up on a droplet and your password protected with nginx

101
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,940
You just have to sign in and we'll see there and that's awesome. That sounds like a segment. That is super cool. Yeah

102
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:00,100
So congratulations to VLC 15 freaking years. What would we do without you now Wimpy?

103
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,960
Have you had a chance to try out them beautiful blu-rays in VLC?

104
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:11,780
Just recently I have yeah, I've got blu-rays playing in VLC. How are you? How does the encryption work in that setup?

105
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,560
So you need a few bits and pieces. There's lib

106
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,660
AACS which does the decryption stuff and there's two ways of doing it my old

107
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,600
Desktop workstation. I patched the firmware to in the blu-ray drive

108
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,060
Did you know you had to get this blu-ray player? Yeah, I've had it for donkey's years

109
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:44,660
No, no, I've had this since blu-ray was new so it's very old and that's what I've been using to

110
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,700
Dump my blu-ray discs into plex for the longest time

111
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:56,300
But it died about a week or so ago. So I've got a new blue USB 3 blu-ray drive and

112
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,120
I needed to dump the blu-rays, you know with make MKV

113
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,360
So I needed to do that with the way where you get the key DB file and all those bits

114
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,180
And then I thought well, I wonder if you can get them playing as well

115
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,700
So I've been working on that for a bantu mate and that's all all going now

116
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,620
that

117
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,180
Yeah, I met make MKV man. That's great, too. So

118
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,340
Yeah, also just sort of related. I also just want to give props to VLC

119
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:28,780
It has become such a badass on Android and the VLC iOS app is actually pretty great

120
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,020
It's great. Yeah, and I can't believe this either

121
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,140
But they have a VLC has an Apple TV app and when one of the things that the Apple TV app can do

122
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,900
I have not tried this

123
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,460
But one of the things the Apple TV app can do is it sets the Apple TV up as a media server

124
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,620
So you can send any video stream to the Apple TV using VLC

125
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,700
I know that Chromecast support is coming that I mean it is so the Android app is great

126
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,220
The Android TV app is great. The Apple TV app sounds cool. I know the

127
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,060
Really, so they've they've been able to sort of

128
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,020
Keep up and they're 15 years old. This is really cool

129
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,660
So yeah, there you go. I five years before it was called VLC. It was called Network 2000

130
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,660
It's called Network 2000

131
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,940
So never been the best with names no that doesn't matter because it turns into a Christmas code that is one of my favorite things

132
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,900
Okay, I'm hoping somebody in the mumble room

133
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,660
I saved this story just for unplugged because I'm hoping somebody in the mumble room knows more than I do about the new

134
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,220
Pac-man that was released Pac-man version 5.0 came out and

135
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,020
I guess here's what I know that's new about it, but I don't know much

136
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:41,540
Pac-man 5.0 is finally here after many months of development during which maintainers managed to add a great number of new features such as support for

137
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,060
running hooks

138
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,700
Before and after transactions, which sounds pretty cool

139
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,380
Pac-man 5.0 also ships with support for handling sim links to folders that have been replaced by a directory

140
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:58,980
support for recording the package a variable in a local package database and the ability to print extra info for dependency errors and

141
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,340
Support for comparing the internal versions of a package with a database where you can store your files

142
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,940
You can store your files in a folder that contains the internal versions of a package with a database one after downloading it

143
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,740
These all seem neat. Yeah

144
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,860
Anybody in the mumble room have any more info about Pac-man 5.0. I know it's kind of a big deal

145
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,660
But I don't really have I'll just start with using Pac-man is always a pleasure. I don't know

146
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,420
It's just I'm very rarely unhappy with it. Yeah, and it just works. I guess my systems if it's out

147
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,420
I guess my systems are upgraded. I didn't really notice

148
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:36,020
So nobody has any comments on that. That's fine. We can move on from there quickly moving then to something that I bet people

149
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,020
Do have some comments on

150
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,180
Edward snowden's favorite distro tails 2.0 is out. That's what they that's what they get to market it now

151
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,920
And they really push that uh, so a couple of things new about tails 2.0

152
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:55,380
Lots of changes to the gnome shell environment debbie and 8 base, which pretty much means all the software has been upgraded under the hood

153
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,860
Uh, you're using the gnome shell. It's in classic environment and you're sitting here right now wess

154
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,740
with the new tails 2.0 on

155
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,060
How's it going?

156
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,220
It's actually working. It's actually working, isn't it? Yeah

157
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,260
It's working. All right. Uh, so let's start there actually was a little bit challenging to get working

158
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,660
Well admittedly I was trying to install it in a very handy way with grub 2's loopback support

159
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,140
So you can just dump the iso file on a hard drive actually that works brilliantly totally supported

160
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,420
um

161
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,620
Although their live cd disables root permissions by default, which probably does make sense

162
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,220
There's like an extra boot option. You can check to have that happen

163
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,340
Okay, I have not been able to get that working

164
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,380
So I believe you'll probably need to you may need to install it or set it up to boot just from the iso to get

165
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,740
All of the options so i've not been able to set up the wireless

166
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
But the gnome shell environment is nice

167
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,540
What was with the error message you got about it not being compatible with your hardware?

168
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,260
I'm not sure. It is like a little dell laptop here. So yeah, it doesn't have an ethernet port

169
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,180
It just has wireless and you're not getting that error message now, or are you still getting that error message?

170
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,580
That's a good question. I'm not sure

171
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,780
So, I mean that was really kind of strange like when it was quite strange when he booted up

172
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,180
He literally got an error message that said it's not compatible with your hardware just trying to get to the network settings

173
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,620
Yeah, and uh, it was like a gtk air air message

174
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,100
Really really strange, uh, but uh, you know, but they've got a lot of great built-in stuff

175
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,500
They've got a tor browser. They've got an unsecure or unsafe browser. Do they have a bunch of great

176
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,740
built-in stuff

177
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,260
libre office

178
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,700
p2v

179
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,340
Life era. Yeah, I don't know about those things. Why the hell are these on my super secure distribution?

180
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,060
Can you give me a single justification because you know what those sound like to me attack surfaces

181
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,020
They sound like software that can have flaws. They sound like software that can be exploited sure

182
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,460
They're not a super critical software, but why is anything that's not necessary on my security distribution?

183
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,060
See I was gonna I was gonna say that but they probably need libre office because all those leaked nsa powerpoints lives

184
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:02,500
Okay. No, I think what it is is they are setting themselves up as a full-time desktop distribution the switch to gnome shell

185
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,740
The upgrade of libre office and p2v. I mean give me a break

186
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,840
Also the switch to system d like they're coming up now as a desktop distribution

187
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,380
That you can use if you're security-minded

188
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:20,020
I don't believe the two things hold up. I think what makes tails secure is that you only use it when you're in right like

189
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,260
Stealth mode when you need to be secure

190
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,460
You can spin it up and throw it away and just because it just seems to me

191
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:32,660
Reasonably so that the longer you use a desktop distribution the longer you make it more insecure the longer your passwords get cached on

192
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,620
The hard drive the longer your your web history builds up the longer you have a piece of software

193
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,820
You don't update or that a zero day vulnerability is available for for a stretch of time that you're not aware of

194
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,820
Like there's so much more

195
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,140
Exposure when you use a desktop full-time than when you just boot into it to do banking or buy your bitcoins or whatever

196
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,740
Right, right. It's useful to not have as a real desktop environment

197
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:03,460
Uh aco says that it's so that media creators can create with privacy. Yeah, but nobody's actually going to use p2v

198
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,340
So there's not that's not really why I mean I don't mean to be dismissive

199
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,980
But I just I don't that sounds that sounds like a really niche

200
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,220
possible use case that probably doesn't actually happen

201
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,740
And what it actually does is exposing everybody for editing

202
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,900
Family trips but for witness relocation, it's so that isis can post their latest jihadi. John 2.0 videos

203
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,140
That doesn't make any sense

204
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,180
It's just that's such a edge case that it's not worth making the rest of the distribution more vulnerable

205
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,860
I mean, this is supposed to be a security distribution. Am I missing something mumble room?

206
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,260
I don't think so. Also, I don't think youtube creators are going to use this to

207
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,060
To make their videos. Yeah

208
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,060
Yeah, you will be happy to know

209
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,300
High dpi displays are better supported. Yeah

210
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:58,580
Yeah, go ahead. Sorry going. Oh, is this a live cd you'd be willing to uh boot into during black hat for example

211
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,180
Yeah, exactly. This is yeah

212
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:06,180
It's that kind of thing or or like I say when you're when you're doing your online bitcoin or stocks or whatever

213
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,940
It does come with a bitcoin wallet

214
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,740
Yeah, they do because that's something you can use it for or you know

215
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,620
If you're going to communicate with a journalist for some purpose, maybe I mean, let's be honest legitimately

216
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,620
You could be a savvy member of the us military witness something that you think somebody in the journalism

217
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:28,420
Industry should know about and use tales to communicate with them and it would be a mistake to continue to use tales for other

218
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,340
things yes, it would

219
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,180
I just don't I mean, but good for them for the new release. I don't mean to crap on the new release

220
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,260
uh

221
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,820
They also are shipping the vivaldi browser with it

222
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,020
Uh, which is weird and they got the tor browser, of course

223
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,020
Uh and gnome shell, it seems reasonable in classic mode

224
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,860
It's pretty straightforward hard to yeah, it's hard to miss anything that you have there

225
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,860
Yeah, it's still a great distribution being based on debbie and eight. I think it's just a little confused

226
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,020
Yeah, so what is your impression overall of just sort of does it feel like a debbie inbox to you?

227
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,940
Does it feel like something different?

228
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,580
Yeah speed is good speed is fine. Uh, I might try installing it in a vm later and just play with it there

229
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,260
Yeah, that would be cool. Like a vm you could go into when you're doing certain things

230
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:16,660
You know like your uh, like your big bitcoin exchange enterprise you got going on the side, which is hosted on github. Yes

231
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,500
Well naturally naturally, hopefully it doesn't go down. That's a lot of that's a lot of income

232
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,460
Um any closing thoughts on tails good pro

233
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,740
Uh doesn't have to be related to them being a full-time distro anybody in there tried it before or is this one of those distros?

234
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,740
We all talk about but nobody's using

235
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,260
I've used it before been not for like a full desktop environment

236
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,620
I've used it just you know, do some things and then you know

237
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,220
You know just boot out of it to the regular os

238
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,100
That sounds about right. Yeah, it sounds about right

239
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,540
Uh, I would love to have somebody from the tails project come on the show. Yeah, that would be great

240
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,740
Wouldn't that we have an open mumble room our virtual lug is open to all of you even windows users

241
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,580
Even windows just don't say anything. We won't ask I mean probably sometimes we do

242
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,640
So just say when they're on when their audio seems to be working really well, then we get suspicious

243
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,260
I kid I can't

244
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,540
Bitter much no, I just I'm just joking. I've never installed gnu slash linux. All right

245
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:24,740
So before we move on, uh, there's something really big that has gotten a lot of headlines from snarky tech press about linux

246
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,100
Brick and laptops and and and the headlines have been

247
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
I actually did read this headline, uh

248
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,660
Ubuntu can brick your laptop even if you run windows

249
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,660
Isn't that a good one? Yeah. Wow. Yeah, I I thought that was pretty great

250
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,620
so

251
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,980
And i'm like, okay

252
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,740
And it's right as del's about to announce a new uh, new developer edition of the xbs laptop, too

253
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,420
Then we go come on guys

254
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,820
Uh, so we'll tell you about what's going on there and what actually and actually how you can actually brick the laptop

255
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,980
Now that is actually legitimately something you could do

256
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,420
Uh, but first let me tell you about ting go to linux.ting.com to support this show and get yourself a 25 dollar discount

257
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,500
discount

258
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:10,820
Linux.ting.com. You can also get 25 in service credit if you have a compatible phone and you might because they got cma and gsm

259
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,100
average monthly bill per device for ting 23 bucks

260
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:20,740
Isn't that something linux.ting.com? You just pay for what you use. It's a flat six dollars for the phone line

261
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,340
And then your usage on top of that I would suggest to go check a look at some of their devices so you can get an idea

262
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,400
Uh, so this one right here the samsung m400

263
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,820
47 dollars kiosara dura xt. This is the one that no has tried out for a bit

264
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,540
47 he says the speaker on that thing is ridiculous and the battery life is ridiculous

265
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:45,420
I myself because i'm a classy lady. I would probably upgrade to the ansetel one touch fling. It's new. It's got a camera

266
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,620
It's got an I think it's oled on the front. It totally has a cpu in it. It's a feature phone

267
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,220
And the more I the more I look at the smartphone landscape, I think geez

268
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,140
63 dollars for an unlocked phone. I own that outright. No contract only pay for what I use that

269
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,660
That's ridiculous. You can also get things like the motorola g

270
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,060
Or go all the way up to the really nice phones

271
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:13,660
In fact, like the blue studio 6 is a great deal for 181 bucks. You own these motorola g third gen 193 dollars unlocked

272
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,680
It's yours. No contract. You only pay for what you use no early termination

273
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,920
nothing like that a really good dashboard super fanatical customer support that rocks and

274
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,000
Geeks, they're geeks too. In fact, they have a blog post up

275
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,320
Watch the Super Bowl without table. Look at that. This is this is like I am NOT a sports ball guy, right?

276
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:45,160
But I cannot avoid the Super Bowl hype. It's a good excuse for nothing else to have some great appetizers. Yeah, that's that's true

277
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,760
Yeah, have great appetizers be judgy about the commercials

278
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,160
And drink some beer. So Super Bowl 50. Yeah, you guys all know it's upon us

279
00:20:53,800 --> 00:21:00,520
And they have a great breakdown about ways you can watch it. Even if you're a cord cutter, which I think is pretty cool

280
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,600
They also have some internet fiber services depending on your location. Go check them out. We had the

281
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,880
Linux dot ting comm visiting their supports this show try out the savings calculator. See why I've been a customer for three years

282
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Linux dot ting

283
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,760
Commit a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program. You guys are fantastic and thanks for the

284
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,400
MiFi on the way down to back from scale. Yeah, that's great. Mm-hmm

285
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,360
That's how I was able to listen to you and Noah do the unplugged show

286
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,780
Legitimately though. Um, I'm this is I missed I missed about 30 minutes of the show

287
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,260
Not because ting got disconnected but because at that point in time I was an organ

288
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:46,840
Mm-hmm, and you know, you know, do you know about Oregon gas? I do know about Oregon. What's the deal about Oregon gas?

289
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,760
What's the deal? Well, it's a it's a hazardous liquid. Yeah

290
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:58,020
Trained and certified to handle so it's so funny you say this because so we get down to Oregon and we're gonna fill up the

291
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,040
Lady, Jupiter

292
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,260
We're almost down to scale right? I mean cuz we got a lot of California is the next the California is the neck

293
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:08,520
Yeah, glory, ladies. Glory to lady Jupiter, California is the next state and I'm like, I'm gonna blow half a tank and

294
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,440
If I need a boondock, I want to have enough fuel for my generator. So I'm figure we'll fill up

295
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,040
pull off

296
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
thing about Oregon is

297
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Like Wes was alluding to

298
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,920
You are not allowed to fill your own gas up

299
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,400
You can it is state law that somebody pumps your gas for you or your petrol or whatever you want to call it

300
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,160
And so we get into a flying J which is designed for large vehicles

301
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,440
Okay, and should have a high pump capacity we get into a flying J truck stop a truck stop

302
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,720
Because lady Jupiter is big and we need a truck stop

303
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,840
I pull in there I go over the ding ding and I spend five minutes lining this huge rig up with the pump

304
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,920
Which wasn't big enough and I had to be pulled way into the parking lot

305
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,400
I'm pulled way into the parking lot blocking the flow of traffic and I sit there five minutes go by

306
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,240
Ten minutes go by oh boy 15 minutes go by

307
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,760
20 minutes go by I'm getting pissed at this point cuz I'm waiting 20 minutes

308
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,720
I'm like I could go out there and pump this gas myself, right and I'm sitting there at least I'm listening unplug

309
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,280
So it's not all lost right 25 minutes go by I start the rig back up

310
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,240
I put lady Jupiter in reverse I go over the the court again to make the thing ding

311
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,200
I go back over the court again. I go back up again this huge motor back up over the court ding ding back up over the

312
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
court ding ding

313
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
So that way they hear like four times I do this, right and then I park it

314
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,680
I turn it off and I go outside and I wait for the guy he go. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Yeah, we've been real busy

315
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:37,560
Forgot sorry comes over there. It took it's a hundred gallon tank. It took forever

316
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,840
It took 25 minutes to pump it

317
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,480
So I think so not only to have to wait 25 minutes then took 25 minutes to fill it and I missed that whole part

318
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,220
of the show

319
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,480
So I made a declaration right there. No more fuel in Oregon. No more

320
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,200
We drove through the rest of the one that did not stop again for fuel in Oregon

321
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,440
I was not gonna put up with that crap. And so while we were sitting there in the chair like

322
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,160
We're like, okay. Now we got to know is the state law. What is the reason that it is?

323
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,120
2016 and we are not allowed to pump our own gas in Oregon

324
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,040
What is the reason and so then we found like the whole controversy like there's a for it and against Oregon drama and the against

325
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,840
It folks are like gas stinks

326
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,000
It gets on you it makes your clothes smell and it's gonna kill a bunch of jobs

327
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,480
And then the for people like it takes too much time. It was we fell into a whole controversy

328
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,980
Trying to get our dinner. Are you guys split on opinions? Oh, no, we wanted to pump our own gas. I'll tell you but anyways

329
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Moving on from there. It's just a story from the road that didn't get get on camera because I was too grumpy

330
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,840
So let's talk about this command that can permanently brick some laptops. It is actually a thing

331
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,520
It is really a thing and some people are actually dumb enough to do this

332
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,460
So what we're gonna have to cover it now because it's made controversy and I want to arm you with the knowledge to combat

333
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,700
The controversy some fun may develop and we're gonna be the anti fun solution

334
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:05,220
So as all things that are relevant and important to the Internet a user posted on the arch Linux forms. We're all great things start

335
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,580
Back in January, which is still this month. I don't know why they wrote it like that

336
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,500
Wondering why their laptop wouldn't boot at all after running the simple RM

337
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:20,100
tack RF tack no dash preserve dash root slash so

338
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,820
Delete the entire freaking root directory

339
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:29,380
It's a fairly stupid thing to run such a command, but usually not destructive anything, but the Linux installation itself

340
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,580
And I've done this to myself sure who hasn't spun up a VM just to see well

341
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:39,900
How long will it keep kicking or a old install of like Red Hat 5 really mad at your friend?

342
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:46,320
And and it was like the first thing you tried doing it. Anyways, however, it turns out on some MSI laptops

343
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:53,400
It is possible to completely wipe the EFI boot partition from within Linux. So this is what's happening

344
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,400
It completely wipes it at the directory that destroys that gets destroyed is at slash sys

345
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:08,160
Firmware slash EFI slash EFI vars it stores information and scripts that the computer uses to boot using the modern EFI standard which

346
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,640
Of course once you wipe that out, it's like not having a BIOS on your machine

347
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,800
essentially and so because it's under a slash sys slash firmware slash EFI slash EFI bars

348
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,020
When you delete everything under root, you are also deleting that right?

349
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
and then it no longer boots a

350
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Thread discussing the issue

351
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,280
The system to your repository on github is full of discussions between developers arguing the director where the EFI boot data stored should not be

352
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
entirely writable

353
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,720
How about just don't mount it writable? Yeah, that's not bad

354
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,360
So far the issue appears to only affect MSI laptops

355
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,920
But that's only because there are a handful of cases of it happening the wild few people are wild and brave and have tried on

356
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,680
Their own machines. That's a good point. It could affect other machines, but who wants to be the person to try it?

357
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,760
At how you know, I saw it. Have I told you my story? No, I was actually still in school

358
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,760
so this was a really really long time ago now because I'm an old man and

359
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,280
I

360
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,200
sat down at a Red Hat machine that somebody had set up for me and

361
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,240
I don't know why RMRF was a thing. I tried maybe somebody told me maybe it was in the bash history

362
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,760
That might have been possible. I did RM dash RF slash

363
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,600
And she was this it was this it was one in the computer lab

364
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,780
So it was a school machine and I was logged in as root because why not?

365
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,080
Somebody must have set me up looking back on it

366
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,120
I wish I remembered because it was such a pivotal moment in my young computer history because I

367
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:41,220
I remember watching the system fall apart completely degrade in front of me and I remember thinking to myself

368
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,140
This is a badass OS

369
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:49,500
It let me do that. It just let me delete itself and everything that's in RAM is still running

370
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:56,340
I can still like cuz it was some old desktop environment and the windows that I thought open could still be used and I remember

371
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,380
thinking

372
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:03,740
This is something I want to learn like I something that lets me delete itself and then continues to run until I restart

373
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,940
At least everything that was existing is like this is freaking impressive

374
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,500
And that was really like so then later on when Linux was suggested as an alternative to NT

375
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,220
I was like, let's give it a shot. That thing was cool. Yeah, it was like a real pivotal moment for me

376
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,040
Wimpy you had a story that I wanted to hear

377
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:24,740
well, I used to work for a Unix vendor back in the day and

378
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:33,020
When there were the conferences, you know, and everyone's got all of their workstations out on the on the stands and everything

379
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:39,780
We did used to go around and accidentally RM minus RF slash our competitors workstations

380
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,460
Really?

381
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:51,220
At lunchtime, you know when they're having a break just do that and reboot

382
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,700
something kind of equivalent from the technical side is when you're using Linux terminal servers and

383
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,100
the clients lose connection back to the terminal server

384
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,060
They still have x11 and any applications that were loaded in RAM, but they've lost their root file system

385
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:11,940
It's kind of the same effect and and what's actually really damn impressive and I haven't seen this for a couple of years

386
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,860
But I did see it a couple of years ago is when when the internet connection or the network connection

387
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,860
The LAN connection or Wi-Fi connection, whatever it is comes back online

388
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,460
The clients just resume keep working like in any in just no big deal

389
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,180
They guess there's yeah, there's some errors, but it's no big deal. It was it was like wow

390
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:33,260
This is a really cool operating system. This is really neat and I remember like some stuff was even GPU accelerated and it still worked

391
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:39,660
So yeah, yeah, there you go. There that is the that is the rumor this spring around. There's lots of news stories about it

392
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:46,780
And I guess it is technically possible just don't it should be noted that a lot of this the EFI standard lets you do this

393
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:51,620
It should work. It just may not be tested go figure was an arch user, right?

394
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:59,020
Yeah, yeah handles and also some of some parts of the EFI system need to be mounted read write in order for the stuff

395
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,220
to work

396
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,460
Change the very long. Yeah at your next boot things like that. Yeah

397
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,060
Yeah, that is a thing. That's a bit of a problem and it's probably gonna happen again

398
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,060
Okay, so I don't really have any action to take on this myself

399
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:19,780
Because I'm not on the right side of the pond, but if you are in London or in the area

400
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:24,200
You might be able to make an impact on the future of the unity 8 desktop

401
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,520
Canonical is posting on their social media accounts that they saw on Twitter g-plus and Facebook so far

402
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
They're conducting a research

403
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,040
And the research is a user experience research the studies about Ubuntu

404
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,360
Applications developed by members of the Ubuntu Linux community for the next generation unity 8 user interface

405
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,920
The research study is being led by Ting Ray Chang a user experience researcher at the Canonical or maybe it's yeah

406
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,800
I think it's Chang and it's targeted mainly at Ubuntu or

407
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,920
Fedora users yeah fedora users probably because gnome 3 I guess

408
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,880
Yeah, swathpedia that speculates. They don't know why

409
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,840
But anyways there, so they're gonna do some research and they'd love your help

410
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:11,440
They're looking for two for participants in a research study on a community developed a unity 8 apps in this survey Canonical

411
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,760
Would like to know what email terminal calendar diary and music after use as well

412
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,480
So I have some links to this there's a survey you can find out

413
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,200
and if you're in the area, they're gonna be doing a study at

414
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,720
they have the

415
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,960
Say it looks like it'll be about about an hour-long study, then there may be a cash incentive

416
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,760
Oh, and you get to talk about Linux mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, so we'll have info about that

417
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
the unity 8 desktop West

418
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,080
Do you think they have to nail it when they first ship it as default or do you think there's gonna be?

419
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:45,920
Capacity to let them improve do you do you think people are at a point where your premiere desktop can be a little undercooked?

420
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,480
I mean it does keep happening. So maybe I think it'll go a lot a long ways if they do nail it

421
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,480
Because people already using it installing it and if it just comes with like that's really first rate

422
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,920
Then you know all the better. I think they do have staying power that if it's improved in a you know

423
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,920
Pretty yeah quickly, then it'll be fine

424
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,280
Micah 68 says I wish they could do the user study more openly than London, but at the same time

425
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,440
What other?

426
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,160
Linux distribution is doing actual real-world user studies that we know of I don't know of any other ones

427
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
So at least they're actually doing some

428
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
That is extremely

429
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,440
New road trip, I I hope I hope

430
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,600
Wimpy, what do you think? I'm curious to pick your brain as somebody who probably is gonna try it out

431
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,900
How much do they have to nail this right out of the gate?

432
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:42,260
Oh, you're asking the wrong person really aren't you but I'm very interested in participating in this

433
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,640
So yes, I shall enroll and try and go along to it

434
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,660
You're not gonna try it when they ship it

435
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,380
Well, I'm already trying it. I'm already running

436
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:59,660
The converged experience on my Nexus 4 and my Nexus 7 and I'm trying out all the new stuff and have are you really using?

437
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Are you really using it?

438
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:09,180
I'm experimenting with it. But starting next month. I'm going to go for two months just using

439
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,540
the

440
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:17,620
Ubuntu touch on a phone in a tablet and I'm gonna actually turn off and set aside my Android phone really

441
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,620
Are you gonna do you're gonna use the Nexus 4?

442
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,420
Gonna use the Nexus 4 and an extra 7. Yeah

443
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,620
So when when and when the new I did it last year and it didn't go so well

444
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,700
I did it for one month last year and it was hard work and

445
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,500
I'm doing it again one year on to see you know

446
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,920
It kind of sounds like what your answer then is for a certain category of users

447
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,280
They've already started they're getting close to nailing it now. So it's just gonna depend on who's using it

448
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,100
It's improved an awful lot over the last year

449
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:54,020
You know, I got a chance to play with it quite a bit at scale and I wasn't super impressed

450
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:59,220
But I was playing with it on a Nexus 4 and I guess a lot of the canonical folks there are using it on a one-plus

451
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,220
And getting much better

452
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,940
Were you?

453
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,220
Using it as a phone or were you using it as the converged just the phone. I was just experimenting with the phone

454
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,260
There's a really there's a couple of great Jupiter broadcasting apps and I was playing

455
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,220
Yeah, I was playing around with those and stuff like that

456
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,100
But I haven't tried it on anything as powerful as the Nexus 7 or up

457
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,740
They really all my experience has either been on the Nexus 5 or 4

458
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,780
so

459
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:28,460
I'm I'm gonna set out my criteria of what what I'm going to attempt to get get it to do and

460
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:34,000
Work for me because there are a number of things that I need to do on a day-to-day basis with it as a phone

461
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,740
but I think really the

462
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,240
Convergence stuff is starting to become

463
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,040
Like the silver bullet because it's really compelling

464
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:52,160
It's quite amazing actually when you connect your Nexus 4 up and you realize this is a desktop and this is running off a phone

465
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,820
It really is very good

466
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:00,360
So yeah, if you haven't seen that you're really missing out on the whole point. I think I could see it

467
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,820
I mean, I I do see the point of it. Yeah, I can see you know, it's something I have at home

468
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,440
I bring it to work

469
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,160
I hook it up and I have all my stuff there all my notes that I already had up on my text editor are still

470
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,200
Up on my screen people are already moving to laptops that are you know, but today today for example

471
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,040
They just got the full Chromium browser working. Oh

472
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,080
Oh, that's a touch in the converged mode. So not you know

473
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,560
I've sort of a full-blooded browser, which is that's really, you know important. I think

474
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,880
Important step forward. It's a shame. Popey's not here. I think he must be busy

475
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,040
But maybe another time you can pick his brains about all of this. He's much much closer to it than I am

476
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,380
So how do you just stuff just an observer? What do you square the user between?

477
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,320
So this is really interesting

478
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,840
I find it fascinating that you're so following you're following this so closely on the cutting edge

479
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
and then you're also

480
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,680
You know behind Ubuntu Mate edition, which is sort of like this

481
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:00,540
distribution that epitomizes the traditional desktop environment that is kind of so far away from convergence and mobile that

482
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,680
So, how do you how do you slice that? Like what is it? Is it the different workloads?

483
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,200
Is it different use cases? Where do you see that sort of lighting up?

484
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:13,500
Or do you think maybe eventually everybody who's seeking out a Mate type desktop would eventually go for a converged device?

485
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,600
well

486
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,360
so many questions, so obviously I'm I

487
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720
am close to all the new

488
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,900
innovations and advancements in the Linux community just because I work on Ubuntu Mate doesn't mean that I'm

489
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,120
laser focused on on that paradigm

490
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:40,360
I want to experience everything from the Linux world and learn what I can from all the different projects

491
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:45,720
But you mean you really are investing a lot of your time and energy and life into one particular paradigm

492
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,080
Yes, and that's mostly because as I've said before family

493
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:00,000
Depend on having that computing platform, you know, and so that's really where it comes from and it's become popular in its own, right?

494
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,800
So I will continue to support it and back it

495
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,040
But for example, there was a guy at the weekend who had Ubuntu Mate running on a huddle tablet

496
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:16,240
You've probably not heard of those but that's some the Tesco supermarket over here. Hmm make a line of tablets

497
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,240
I don't really tablets and

498
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,640
He's put Ubuntu Mate on it and I have to say it worked remarkably well and I was thinking to myself

499
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:30,560
Hmm, we're just a few little user interface tweaks. This could be you know, really quite usable and another guy actually got

500
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:37,600
The Mate desktop via an Ubuntu CH root running under Android's and

501
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,680
Another one has got it running under

502
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:47,560
Ubuntu touch as well. So it's interesting that this convergent stuff, you know canonical

503
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,000
Er, you know pioneering this on their platform

504
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,760
With their user interface, but already there are people in the community who are experiments

505
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,640
Experimenting with other desktops and getting them to run under

506
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,440
X mirror and what have you?

507
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
and I'm not not sure that I

508
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,120
I want to try and turn Mate into a touch

509
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Platform because that's a bit nuts, isn't it?

510
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,780
but I'm certainly interested in experimenting with all of these touch devices and particularly Ubuntu because

511
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,040
Android has become very entrenched in my life and I use it because

512
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,200
it was the best option five years ago, but I

513
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,840
I'm not I I don't want it to be the thing that I'm wedded to I very much feel that way too

514
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,920
So I've put a lot of effort in the last six months

515
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,600
Get getting to know Ubuntu touch and I've written a couple of apps for myself and I'm starting more and more to get familiar with

516
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,840
snaps and mirror and XMir and

517
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,660
That's something I'm definitely interested in in learning and doing more with

518
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,480
In the coming year, but that's not to say Ubuntu Mate is gonna stop or go away that will continue on its merry way as well

519
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,680
I I find it to be

520
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,680
Exciting that it's actually getting so, you know

521
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,600
We've talked about unity and convergence and all this stuff for it feels like three years now

522
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,400
Yep, but being at scale

523
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,360
I find it to be really exciting to be at scale playing with these devices and seeing real community apps created for like a telegram

524
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,840
app like a jupyter broadcasting apps and

525
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,960
Yeah, I was talking to Ryan from the mycroft project and he was there with his Ubuntu touch device and you know

526
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,240
We're talking about the pros and cons of it and you know for the most part he does

527
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
It and you know for the most part he likes it

528
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,840
But when using his device, I could definitely see the performance

529
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,900
Issues there and that's something I'm pretty hypersensitive to because I I just I have a very high expectation

530
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,800
but if I you know if I could read

531
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,760
If I could reconsider some of that stuff and if they could close the gap on some of that stuff

532
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,080
It might just be right just right and when there's a phone that runs it very well and you can get it. I

533
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,640
I liked the idea that was floated that to someone should take an Android device

534
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:07,800
That was this far into its lifecycle as as the Ubuntu touch phone is now and compare the two and see where the two are

535
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,240
And I was like, oh somebody could get me, you know a good idea of what hardware to use

536
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:17,440
I would like to try that has a little review is where it's aware was Android at this point in its development lifecycle versus where

537
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,920
Ubuntu touches well, it was sort of the gingerbread

538
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,800
Stage, wasn't it? Would you consider this gingerbread or is this still more like the like the

539
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,600
The well the Moto G or whatever. What was that? What was no not Moto G

540
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,080
What was that first phone called the one that had a little roller on I can't remember now

541
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,840
But it feels like because it's all since we've only gotten really one industry phone. It's like their first phone

542
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,760
Well, if you're talking about, you know device launches, then yes, it's closer to that

543
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:52,040
I thought you were referring to you know time of time incubating and being developed

544
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,680
Yeah, I guess that that would be they'd have to figure out those ground rules. Do you want to go by that rule or hardware rules?

545
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,240
Yeah, I think what you need to do is work out how many people Android had working how many people Google had working on Android

546
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:11,720
Yeah, and then and then because what you actually work out from that is that actually Ubuntu are punching above their weight because they've got far far

547
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,240
far fewer people

548
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:20,760
Yes have made you know pretty much a full fully fledged mobile operating system that with the convergent story in

549
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,960
Three years and I think that's pretty amazing

550
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,400
Yeah, you know people are giving up into a hard time about it and saying it's not good enough yet

551
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,800
And it's not quite ready

552
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:36,200
But they've achieved such a lot so it can only get better from here because the foundations are pretty solid now

553
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,240
I don't actually I don't know that like that mocking attitude towards Ubuntu. I don't know if it actually

554
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,260
exists in the real world at like

555
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,160
Beyond be I mean beyond internet keyboard warriors

556
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,640
There I just I didn't get the sense of that

557
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,320
I don't you know it's just to keep drawing not to keep drawing on the scale thing

558
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:01,440
But Ubuntu came up a lot at scale because it would become was going on and there was never any shame

559
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,440
There was never any oh

560
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,840
eye-rolling

561
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,760
And when like display servers which I heard several conversations about display servers

562
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,960
It would go X mere and Wayland or mere Wayland X or Wayland mere X

563
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,920
You know it was just like whatever like it was just these are the things it wasn't like this. Oh effing mere

564
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:27,320
You know there was time. Yeah, I think there was sort of some it was a community meme wasn't it sort of three years ago to just

565
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,160
outright

566
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,360
Slander Ubuntu for everything they did and I do think that those days of sort of generally behind us now

567
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,880
Yeah, it seems like it. It seems like it was not even a thing

568
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:43,000
At least in person and so then you still see some you know disro shame and things like that online

569
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,840
But I think the other part is is that people are looking at what they're doing okay?

570
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,360
They actually got something that really working. I think there's a lot of excitement for this upcoming LTS in April

571
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,440
Maybe so Micah. Maybe that is true. I mean yeah

572
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,400
I think it's still it's people that are trying to be funny

573
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,320
They're still gonna be able to take a shot at it

574
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:09,680
But I think people that are getting work done we recognize the fact that they're trying to get something interesting done and accomplished

575
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,680
I don't know. I I walk away from scale. I didn't really get the opinion that people shamed Ubuntu

576
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:21,560
I thought that was a good thing it and you know there are just a lot of conversations to about sent OS and Debbie

577
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,800
I'm really yeah, that's great. Yeah, that really seemed to come up a lot

578
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,700
So I it is interesting times and I say good for canonical for actually reaching out to

579
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:36,660
Actual human beings and getting them in London and paying them for getting feedback on using these applications now

580
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,260
What'd be really cool is if they published the information yeah?

581
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:47,660
All right, well let me tell you about something else you can get on that's a digital ocean sponsor of the Linux unplugged program

582
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:51,040
I love digital ocean is my on-demand Linux infrastructure

583
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,140
You can get a super fast rig and if you use our promo code do unplugged you get a $10 credit

584
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,780
Try their $5 rig two months for free

585
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,380
We were just talking a little bit ago about setting up a web-based IRC client

586
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,180
Yeah, put that on digital ocean do it that on do it put everything on digital ocean

587
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,340
They've got all the different distros. You'd really want on demand

588
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,980
Even free BSD well

589
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,940
What is that about? I don't know, but they you know what they got a great implementation of it

590
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:20,220
They got a great one if you use the promo code do unplugged you try it out two months for free in less than 55 seconds

591
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,720
You get a rig with 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte

592
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,860
SSD because they all SSDs

593
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:32,660
All SSDs a blazing fast CPU and a terabyte of transfer. They got data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore

594
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,460
Amsterdam London Toronto

595
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:41,520
Right by Alan Jude and Germany, which is actually a really great spot if you want to distribute to its neighbors

596
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:47,300
But they really really have excelled at the interface. It is a really good UI very straightforward and

597
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,460
Not only they have a great UI

598
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,260
They have a great API and a bunch of good open source code is written around that API in fact

599
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,020
I was just looking at some of the projects on there

600
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,280
They have a whole bunch listed, and this is just like a tip of the iceberg stuff and like things like a command

601
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:05,420
Command at IO can integrate using the API a lot of different services with that API

602
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,780
Oh that API the droplet your digital ocean droplet manager. I love that one

603
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:16,420
But also really good tutorials really good tutorials that help you get a lot more out of your rig

604
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,820
So they have one click to application deployments

605
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:23,940
So you can get something set up and really you can get you could get we were talking about setting up matter most right?

606
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:26,300
You can get an Ubuntu LTS stack

607
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:33,100
Set up with your web server in less than 55 seconds. It's not some weird custom version of Ubuntu

608
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:38,580
Yeah, it's just it's just really straightforward using great open source code and the KVM

609
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,540
Yeah, all the run on top of Linux

610
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,980
Which is great all sitting on top of the mess SD's and then they have these tutorials to sort of round it all out

611
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,140
So five dollars a month you get a great rig pricing plans are really straightforward, too

612
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,180
So if you want to take our ten dollar credit and just use it for learning or experimenting

613
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:58,660
You can break it down hourly like that use the promo code do unplugged at digital ocean and go set up a Linux rig

614
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:06,040
Go play with own cloud. I got myself the own cloud the bit torrent sink the sink thing quasi core. I forget minecraft

615
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,700
We have mumble for the the right

616
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:15,500
Installed free switch this how do I not mention the fact that we have our virtual lug on a droplet?

617
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,140
That's what makes the show work. I should probably say that from time to time

618
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:24,500
The mumble on a droplet. Yeah. Yeah, lots of core part of the show infrastructure. You think I would have thought of that

619
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,340
Well, you can try something out either

620
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:34,980
Little experience or lots of experience you'd be surprised digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplugged and a big thanks to digital ocean

621
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,120
Okay, Wes get ready for this one

622
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,660
I I hope I don't I hope I don't upset anybody

623
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:52,320
But I I got I got to ask if mint is just a little drunk it with power. I mean this seems this seems like

624
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,280
Biting off way more than anybody would ever want to chew in

625
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,200
2016 you might have heard about it. We covered in the Linux action show Linux mint is getting its own

626
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:09,760
Application starting with the Linux 18 branch. We're gonna call them X apps for Linux mint distros meant to work across multiple desktops

627
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:16,500
It'll be gtk3 applications with traditional interfaces. I eat no us, you know, what CSD? What do they call them?

628
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,660
Clients decorations with the header bars. Yeah

629
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,300
no client-side decoration header bars and

630
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:29,500
the idea would be that anybody could really take these on but they're really gonna be meant for the cinnamon matte and XFCE desktops and

631
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,940
this is part of the mince project of sticking to their guns and

632
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,220
you might say

633
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:43,900
Askewing new design trends they they say we've all witnessed the rise of the iPad the iPhone

634
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,980
This is in the mint blog and this has caught this great a whole bunch of new trends

635
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,580
But we will not be swayed by those trends

636
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,580
And so X apps are gonna be introduced and you know

637
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:58,380
I think it's is it Clem that wrote this yeah Clem that wrote this Clem talks about some of the challenges

638
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,540
He's run into with gnome 3.18 and things that depend on that and moving that into mint

639
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:09,460
it's just a big mess and so the whole idea here is X apps X app X apps and

640
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,420
My initial reaction was a little strong

641
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,260
I don't know. I wanted I wanted to kind of consult with the lug and see if maybe I was overreactive

642
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:22,540
Maybe there's a point in missing and I definitely want to pick wimpy's brain. So let's start with you wimpy

643
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,140
What do you think about X apps and what Linux mint is doing here?

644
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,100
I've got lots of thoughts about this

645
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,060
I've been very careful not to

646
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:37,820
Criticize or rag on other distributions and projects since Ubuntu Marte got started. So

647
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:45,420
Everything I'm about to say isn't intended as a bashing or a ragging on Linux mint. It's my opinion

648
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,300
So if anyone thinks I'm trying to dog on them, that's really I want to say too

649
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,460
I have a lot of respect for Clem. He's worked really hard and he's built a very

650
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,060
Very good distro that I raved about the last version

651
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:04,500
Yeah, um, I do understand where this comes from so I

652
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,140
I understand technically why

653
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,180
Clem probably feels this is necessary and

654
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:22,740
I'm active in my local community with small businesses and home users and I can also see why

655
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:27,060
They don't give a fig for these fancy new. Mm-hmm

656
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,020
Desktops. Sure. If you look at what's happened with

657
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:37,700
Windows a lot of people are really disenfranchised with with Windows now

658
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,140
These are

659
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,340
Home users and small business users that just need their computer to do stuff

660
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:51,740
They don't care for all of these redesigns of the user interfaces. They just want the user interface

661
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,740
is they just want the

662
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,020
Look and feel that they're familiar with so they can carry on their merry way

663
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:03,140
So there are an awful lot of people out there who don't move in technical circles

664
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,900
who are quite happy to stay the course with

665
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:11,140
traditional user environments, right so I can understand

666
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:18,980
Why Clem would want to do this and it's been a while now, but there was some discussion

667
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,660
Within the Marte and

668
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:29,340
Linux Mint teams and a couple of others from some of the other projects, although I think they may have moved on now

669
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:36,100
About one one idea was potentially forking a tool kit. Hmm. So looking at forking

670
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,580
GTK 2

671
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,100
Retrofitting retrofitting

672
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:46,740
Modernizing where needed. Yeah. Yeah, and the other idea was forking GTK 3

673
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:50,420
so that we could establish a

674
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,180
I

675
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:57,780
Use the word stable to represent a non-changing API rather than

676
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:03,420
Suggest the GTK 3 is an unstable buggy platform because it isn't the issue with

677
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:11,900
GTK 3 that a lot of the projects that are trying to write against it are encountering certainly, you know for full desktops is that it's

678
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:17,020
It's a moving target and it's difficult, you know with each new version of GTK 3

679
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:21,940
There's new features that primarily target genome 3, right?

680
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:26,060
And it requires an awful lot of work for the other projects to actually adapt

681
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,900
to those changes

682
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:33,100
So with that as a backdrop you can understand why forking

683
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:40,580
These projects to create X-apps is an idea and we did discuss this idea of creating a common

684
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,780
set of cross desktop applications and

685
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:49,260
At the time we were talking about looking at what?

686
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:57,740
Cinnamon required what Marte required what XFC required and what LXDE required and the aspiration was is that

687
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,540
all of those desktop environments could

688
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,620
Collaborate and work together on a common set of things

689
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:14,220
It's it's a sensible suggestion, you know rather than having four different file browsers and four different text editors and so on and so on

690
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:18,220
That you know, you will coalesce around a common a common set of applications

691
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,260
but then of course, there's nothing to differentiate them and

692
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:27,820
One of the reasons there's all these different desktop environments on on Linux is because

693
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:31,980
People have different wants and needs and they want to go their own way and do their different thing

694
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,300
So there was never going to be sort of broad

695
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,940
agreement from all of those desktop environments about you know

696
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,740
Which way to go on which of the file managers would be the you know

697
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:49,100
The chosen one and all the rest of it. So I imagine that's how Clem has got to

698
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,180
The point he's got to now which is to effectively

699
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:58,380
Go and cherry-pick different applications that are out there

700
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,980
And bring those in under this banner of Xapps

701
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:09,820
To use in Linux Mint to sustain this, you know, traditional environment

702
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,380
And I think you said at the weekend that you know

703
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:19,660
They weren't, Mint weren't keeping up they'd stuck their head in the sands and they weren't

704
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:25,660
Adopting header bars and client-side decorations, but by and large most of the other desktop aren't

705
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,220
The desktops aren't either. I mean Xfce have started to

706
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,500
Or rather Xfce, I'm not, sometimes the lines are a bit blurred between Xfce and Xfce

707
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:42,700
But certainly within Xfce some of the newer applications that have come along some of the settings bits and bobs that they've added recently

708
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,980
Those use header bars and client-side decorations

709
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:50,620
I don't know if that's a trend that Xfce is going to follow

710
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,460
Or if it's just for a few bits and pieces that they've developed recently

711
00:53:54,540 --> 00:54:00,220
It seems like that would be the real winner here for these Xapps if if Zubuntu and other distros started to also

712
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:07,100
Yeah, as far as I can remember there was not enough engagement and obviously LXDE are going with Qt now

713
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,460
So, you know, they're kind of out of that that discussion

714
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:17,020
Besides Xfce, it's kind of just Cinnamon and Mate who are the ones they're talking about here. Yeah, I also acknowledge

715
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:24,300
No, there's two others. There's two others and there's this elementary and they seem to be they do seem to be

716
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:29,500
Adopting client-side decoration and header bars. I think I think that's their

717
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:35,580
You know the direction they're headed in from what I've seen. I think that's where they're going. But here's an interesting one

718
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:44,940
Unity is not a client-side decoration header bar desktop environment. Canonical have been actively patching out

719
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:52,540
Client-side decorations and header bars from those forked applications that Unity is built upon

720
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:57,660
And continue to do so, you know, I still see this come up in the um, you know

721
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:03,980
The Ubuntu desktop IRC channel from Qt. I don't know if that's a trend, but it seems like it's a trend

722
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,300
Ubuntu desktop IRC channel from time to time when a

723
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:10,860
A new version comes out and somebody has to go in there and refactor the patches to remove it

724
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,700
so

725
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:19,500
In some respects, you know Gnome is trailblazing this and it's not that the other desktop environments aren't keeping up

726
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,300
They're choosing not to do it

727
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:28,220
I wonder if uh, this isn't the perfect timing for something like this. He's

728
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,140
you know, uh, he's got to be looking ahead at at

729
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:36,860
At the desktop for the next couple years and going the demand for a really well done

730
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:42,300
Tightly controlled Linux based traditional desktop is only going to go up safe easy to use

731
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,580
Pretty predictable. I mean

732
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,020
Clem has been

733
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:57,500
very shrewd in the way that he's put mint together and he's clearly listened to his user community and I should imagine

734
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:00,540
This is what they want

735
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:05,820
But I think forking the applications is not

736
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,460
Not the way to go

737
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,340
um

738
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:15,740
It and this sounds a bit strange as somebody involved in Marte, which is one of those big, you know forking efforts

739
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:23,260
um in in some respects, I think we've been justified in doing that because it wasn't

740
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,120
initially it was more about

741
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:33,560
um, sort of refused nicks, people didn't want to adopt the new thing, but now it's more about

742
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,100
preserving

743
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,120
what was GNOME 2

744
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,720
uh and and keeping that, you know, usable

745
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:48,040
desktop paradigm available for, you know, the next generation of people to, you know, use

746
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,080
um

747
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,600
I think that just keep forking things and

748
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,240
it's a lot of it's a lot of work and

749
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:03,800
Uh, I think these XApps will only ever be available in Mint. I don't see that they will

750
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:09,240
They will get used much if at all outside of Mint's ecosystem

751
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:15,000
A couple of things strike me about this that make it seem like a a challenging long-term strategy

752
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,280
XApps

753
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,680
Uh and the avoidance of client-side decorations

754
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:25,320
So client-side decorations, like Tyler points out, doesn't look super great on non-GNOME desktops

755
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,280
I've actually not really had a problem with them, but then again, I'm kind of a fan

756
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:28,760
Yeah

757
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,440
And I want to make a difference here

758
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,640
We need to we need to be we need to be clear client-side decorations and the header bar in GNOME

759
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:42,040
Are two different things. Client-side decorations is simply how the decoration is drawn on the client window

760
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,520
And the GNOME header bar is a certain implementation of a client-side decoration

761
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:53,000
So the reason why that's sort of important to understand going into this conversation is client-side decorations are going to become more critical

762
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,560
When we move to Wayland

763
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:01,720
Uh and because it'll no longer be up to the X server to draw the decoration because there won't be an X server

764
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:06,220
So the client will be responsible for its own decorations. Hence client-side decorations

765
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,440
Uh, it's not just for vanity. It's also to support Wayland better

766
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,880
So what Mint is also saying here with these XApps

767
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,240
Is they're saying Wayland is not in our future

768
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,960
Maybe

769
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:25,720
Maybe that is what they're saying. Um, and what I would what I would add to that is that um,

770
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,320
All of the energy

771
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:34,600
Almost all of the energy in the Marte team at the moment is focused on uh, GTK 3

772
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,160
um, and

773
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,360
That we had a 1.10 release. Um,

774
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:45,880
April-ish last year. That was the first experimental version of GTK 3

775
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,520
Uh, we had a 1.12 release, uh towards the end of last year

776
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,980
And that was a much improved GTK 3 implementation still considered experimental

777
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:01,960
We've got 1.13, which is uh, just trickling out as um, testing tarballs at the moment

778
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,280
I think about three quarters of the components are

779
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:10,200
Out with um, 1.13 and with 1.14 to follow, uh early this year

780
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,840
And we're getting to the point now where we've only got a handful of sort of

781
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,400
Issues to overcome for for where GTK 3 is a really

782
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,440
um, targetable platform

783
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:26,360
unfortunately, GTK uh, 3.2.0

784
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,760
Has thrown a couple of spanners in the works. So we've we've we've tried to

785
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:35,560
We've tried to adjust our release cadence to match GNOME and GTK 3

786
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:42,680
And because we hadn't had uh, that many regressions to cope with in the last couple of cycles, but um,

787
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,960
A lot of stuff's busted this time. So it's just difficult just as we were about to

788
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,520
Just get comfortable for it. Yeah. Yeah, but um,

789
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,160
You know Marte is

790
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,020
Supporting GTK 3

791
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,300
He is supporting GTK 3

792
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:08,660
And we do have support for client-side decorations and some of the applications that I ship by default

793
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,980
In Ubuntu Marte

794
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,980
Do use client-side decorations

795
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,460
They don't look horrible

796
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:20,580
They just look a bit different. But they work they work just fine. They do work. Yeah, that's a good point

797
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,740
See this is what we're now

798
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:26,900
This is sort of I see three tracks in the Ubuntu based distro world

799
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:33,380
The heavy hitters, of course, I do not mean to take away from Kubuntu or Zubuntu or Neon or whatever

800
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:37,860
But uh, you have yourself in one corner the Unity default desktop

801
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:41,780
Which is going to be undergoing radical changes like we've never seen from a completely

802
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,780
From a transition from GTK to Qt and apps that are designed for both

803
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:51,300
Mobile and desktop and that powered by an entirely new display server called Mir

804
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:56,660
That's in corner number one, right the primary contender in corner number two

805
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:04,500
You have Ubuntu Mate edition where you have a traditional desktop paradigm, but is integrating current technologies in a very logical

806
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:11,160
Reasonable fashion keeping up right and then uh, but it could but that could mean in some circumstances

807
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:16,260
Your apps look a little different or things are just a little different like maybe systemd sneaks in there, right?

808
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,100
These kinds of horrible things, right?

809
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:22,260
But and then in corner number three, you now have Linux Mint 18

810
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:29,540
Which as Clem promises in his blog post will give you one button to make it look exactly like Linux Mint 17

811
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,860
So that way nothing looks any different nothing changes

812
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:37,860
It's going to be again based on a very long-term support and these X apps are now going to be a thing and

813
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:42,580
I'm two minds of this because it's like these are three very unique

814
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:48,740
And very radical approaches in their own right on in a belief of what the desktop should be

815
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:52,980
And so that's my first thought and then my second thought is man as a reviewer

816
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:58,100
This is really going to be a treat because now these are three very unique and distinct beasts

817
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:04,660
That uh, you know fully deserve their own review and in the case of mint, you know, i'm going to be using different apps

818
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,980
I mean, yeah, they're maybe going to be very similar, but they're going to be their own set

819
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,060
I mean, it's a really its own unique experience

820
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:15,960
And in some ways it is it is sort of like this. I know I should I actually shouldn't leave out elementary OS

821
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:20,420
Yeah, in the fourth, it's right in here. There's a fourth quarter west with elementary OS

822
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,420
The ring is getting full

823
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:27,780
And all there's a fifth corner as well because LXQT is going to be a thing this year as well. Oh

824
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,300
A new contender enters with the sixth ring

825
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:34,180
the six rings of Ubuntu

826
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:39,060
Uh, and they all are extremely fascinating all based on one

827
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,460
mother distro if you will

828
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,500
Uh, I just find that to be really and and which are all based on Debian

829
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,700
I find it to be really interesting the way it's all shaping out and uh,

830
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:53,780
Uh, I I guess in that regard more power to the mint team

831
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:59,380
I mean, uh Clem brought in more funding for his project than ever. I wonder how many of these there will be

832
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:04,020
And they might be good. I like I like nemo the the file browser. Yeah, it's not bad

833
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:07,060
Yeah, nemo's not bad like if they fit in really well and they

834
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:13,940
Maybe somewhat limited feature set and they just perform well and are well integrated and easy to use then maybe it'll work

835
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:17,160
Well, if you zoom out and take it to its ultimate conclusion

836
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:23,780
This is what well what's really happening here is these these individual groups are taking Linux

837
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:28,020
And they are truly building their own platform and their own desktop vision on top of it

838
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:33,060
They are not necessarily trying to make a distro that plays with all other distros

839
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:36,740
They are trying to make a desktop experience or a mobile experience in some cases

840
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:44,100
That is a unique platform all into their own and Linux is the software that is making that possible, but it's not

841
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,380
You know, it's not what's defining what it must be

842
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,140
No, it's kind of just at the bottom of the stack hiding away. Yeah

843
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:54,580
Uh, which is kind of which makes exactly or Chrome OS. Yep

844
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,460
But uh just a little closer

845
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,460
That's interesting time

846
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:06,500
All right, uh, we should go to uh this Dell Linux distro speaking of distributions that are uh,

847
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,420
This one I I would argue may actually well, you know what?

848
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:14,260
I'm just gonna you're not even gonna believe it. But first

849
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,720
Let's talk about Linux Academy go to linuxacademy.com

850
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,960
Unplugged, please. Why don't you go there to support this show linuxacademy.com

851
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:27,240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and read more about a great education platform to learn not just about Linux

852
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,280
But all the technology around it i'm going to tell you more about that in a second

853
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:36,920
But first for those of you who've heard about Linux Academy before I should mention they have had recently had some major updates new courses

854
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:43,000
Ansible and AWS courses advanced AWS security. What's up, Docker and Elastic Beanstalk?

855
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,880
They have a new Cloud Cadet episode as a new series they're doing

856
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,360
Uh, and also I love it

857
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:53,000
They now have a mobile app they're working on but on top of all of that i've mentioned they have group accounts before

858
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,920
Taking it up a notch

859
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:00,040
Now you got big old enterprise accounts big old enterprise accounts west where you can have big groups and sub teams

860
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:04,220
Linux Academy is really stepping up to the next level here. So if you've got an organization

861
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:09,480
I encourage you to go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged. This is a great resource

862
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,320
Started by Linux enthusiasts who first thought well, how do we spread the word?

863
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:17,800
I am so excited about this technology. Let's go spread the word now

864
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:22,760
They they teamed up with friends that are developers and educators and they created the Linux Academy platform now

865
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,360
They've gotten some success

866
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:28,040
You might say I think so you might say and as a result of that

867
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,440
They've been expanding their team bringing their content up refreshing it keeping it current

868
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:37,160
They have an incredible system where there's seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from you choose that distro

869
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,640
It automatically adjusts the course where which when we were trying to figure out how to Linux

870
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:47,960
We're like how how good we were we were running through ideas like this and when I saw this I was like, okay

871
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,840
That's cool. And he's like and I remember I was talking to Anthony about he's like, yeah

872
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,240
But it doesn't just change the course where it also

873
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:58,120
Adjust the virtual machines that we spin up on demand right as the courseware calls for it the SSH into it

874
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:02,520
It's the same environment you chose earlier. It's really slick. They have over

875
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:08,360
2200 self-paced courses. These are great courses. You can go in there self-paced

876
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,640
So you do it at your own convenience at a speed that is comfortable to you

877
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,520
And you can also set up timelines and reminders

878
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:20,920
They have scenario-based labs that put you in the middle of tasks common to everyday environments instructor help is available when you need it

879
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,960
They have graded server exercises. You can get immediate feedback. They have AWS training

880
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,760
So when you need to do something on AWS, they spin up those instances

881
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,120
You don't got to worry about Amazon charging you a whole bunch of monies

882
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:36,760
They have a community stack full of Jupiter broadcasting members live events where you can ask the instructors questions

883
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:41,800
Or get news directly from Linux Academy folks. It's a really great way to run an academy

884
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,040
It's a great resource for our audience and it's a super cool way to support our show

885
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:52,200
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

886
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,680
I'm telling you that instructor help is so valuable for a topic like this. Yeah, no kidding

887
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:02,440
All right. So Dell is uh, well, you know what? Maybe they've been looking at Ubuntu snappy

888
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,720
And they're thinking to themselves. Hey, this might not be such a bad idea

889
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:13,000
So Dell is launching its own Linux distribution get hyped everybody get hyped. All right, I'll tell you the name

890
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,120
You've all been patient Super Dell OS. They're calling it OS 10

891
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,800
Wait, isn't there isn't there an operating system called that already? I think so. Yeah, only this one isn't with an X

892
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,800
It's with a one and a zero

893
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,120
OS 10 that's a little more clear actually

894
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,840
This is unbelievable

895
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:34,840
This is their Linux distro called OS 10 and they plan to make it a strategic operating system offering

896
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:41,640
Expanding Dell switches and their storage products OS 10 is based on a native and I like that they're promoting this

897
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,480
As somebody who's worked in the enterprise west. Have you ever heard this term before?

898
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:49,240
A customized hardened Linux kernel. Yeah, right

899
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,520
Here's a new spin. This is 2016 spin on this

900
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,160
an unmodified Linux kernel

901
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,480
That's stock. That's their marketing an unmodified Linux kernel

902
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:04,280
Uh that can support broad range of applications and services from the Linux ecosystems Dell officials say

903
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:12,040
Dell claims this differentiates from cumulus's network cumulus Linux and HP's open switch because this one's meant for open network systems

904
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:18,120
You know because of open OS 10 is I can't believe I'm saying that it's comprised of a base module

905
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,360
And various operational application modules

906
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:28,680
Separated to offer choice control and programmability. I'm gonna get me some of those application modules later

907
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,440
Yeah, because you get control. This is an alternative where things are bundled tightly

908
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:36,840
Essentially what Dell has done here. Tell me if this reminds you of something

909
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:45,160
separation of the OS 10 application modules from the base modules allows customers to tailor IT operations for different use cases and

910
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,560
operational processes

911
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:53,800
Dell didn't comment if they're just forking Ubuntu snappy or if they just think it's free BSD. Yeah, right. Yeah, right

912
01:08:53,800 --> 01:09:01,000
Yeah, exactly. So they've got they're basically doing the Ubuntu snappy thing or the free BSD thing where you have your base OS

913
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:08,120
And the applications are separated out and the base OS is a read write or read only image and they're calling it OS 10

914
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,880
OS 10 maybe it's in binary. Is it one zero? I just

915
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,200
I just don't understand what's wrong with Dell, you know

916
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:24,120
because like at one hand Dell's like watching the Linux scene and totally into it releasing drivers and stuff like

917
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,520
It was this week. It's announced that Dell's about to ship a new XPS

918
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:34,520
Developer edition based with Skylake processors, which means they're taking like a hundred bucks off the Broadwell ones right now if you want them

919
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:38,560
Which are probably better. Yeah, I have I have the Broadwell XPS

920
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,480
I think my I don't know and I think it's a pretty good machine

921
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:45,040
I and and I would not get it with high DPI and you get a bunch more battery life and

922
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:50,080
Better video performance. Yeah better application support so

923
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,940
You have one hand on one hand

924
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,320
Dell keeps revving a pretty damn nice machine on the other hand

925
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,320
They're relaunching their own custom Linux called OS 10

926
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:05,040
What is that said I it would be kind of nice to run and you know

927
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:09,720
Be running a nice Dell switch in production and be like, hey, it's Linux and I know how it works

928
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:15,680
Well, I don't know how you'll see it though. We'll be caught your your binary joke and you have it. You have an observation

929
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,680
Go ahead. We'll be

930
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:23,280
So the first is they've missed a trick because I wonder if they're trolling Apple here and they're just

931
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:32,440
And this is just you know to get it out in the press and they'll rename it after you know after the dust settles

932
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,860
But why isn't it? You know Dell OS it goes to 11

933
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:41,300
You know you go back to cool back to spinal tap and

934
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:46,580
If it's binary, then it's some OS 2 so neither of them work, particularly well

935
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,900
The worst possible name, yeah

936
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:55,060
X apps is worse. But yeah X apps is worse. I

937
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:00,660
Jacob in the chair. I'm just asking if I'll update my XPS 13 to OS 10. Yeah, sure

938
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:05,780
I'll run OS 10 on my XPS 13 just ask me where yeah, it's just this just a train wreck though

939
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,700
It is of the pics. It'll be the top application. I know it's it's almost a joke

940
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,320
It is almost joke, but it is it is it is actually true

941
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:18,380
And I don't know maybe somebody out there have experience with it because there's your Dell OS 9. Yeah

942
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:21,220
straight to 10

943
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,580
No, that's that's what I'm wondering like is it just some

944
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:30,640
Something built for data centers that I wasn't aware of no

945
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:39,600
I've had clients that have had Dell switches and they did not call it that they didn't call it always no

946
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:45,440
No, that is that is funny. Wow. Well, there you go. There's marketing 101

947
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:50,120
We're watching it in right here. Just go straight to 10 the next show

948
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:53,760
We can we announce we just gotta call it 10 start with episode 10 call it 10

949
01:11:53,760 --> 01:12:00,120
That's ridiculous. Well linuxactionshow.reddit.com. You'll find a feedback thread for 130 stories community out

950
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:06,800
You know like spotlights or call outs anything like that application modules. Yeah, sure sure application module separated from your base

951
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,760
OS those are welcome at linuxactionshow.reddit.com

Alright, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode athletics unplugged now that I'm done smacking microphones

959
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,400
You get the hell out of here. See you next week

960
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,400
See ya

961
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:53,400
Oh

962
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:59,400
Oh

963
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:18,520
Alright JB titles calm let's boat. Oh wimpy. I love that. Tell me about your New Year's resolution

964
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:25,000
Yeah, so, um, I've obviously been consuming independent content for some time now

965
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,840
Yeah, it's true. It's really true and I was thinking about you know

966
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:36,840
New Year's resolutions and what have you like everyone does at the end of the last year and I you know wrote up the usual list of

967
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:42,120
New Year's resolutions, you know go to the gym more often. Mm-hmm eat healthily

968
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,680
Not my whole intake alcohol intake to 60 units a week all that sort of thing

969
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:50,760
And um after I did that, I thought no, I'm I never keep these resolutions

970
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,880
So let's try and think of one. I'm actually going to keep so I I decided right. I'm going to support all of these independent

971
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:00,520
Content creators and then I thought well, how do I

972
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,760
How do I do that? How much am I gonna spend on this?

973
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:09,560
So you might be familiar with the fact that in the UK we pay for a TV license. Yeah

974
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,280
And yet that supports the BBC

975
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:17,160
And yet that supports the BBC so I looked at how much that cost a year

976
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:21,720
And I took the exact same amount and I have spread that amount of money

977
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,680
across all of the

978
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:32,120
Content creators that I consume content for so i'm effectively paying the same amount as I pay for my UK TV license

979
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,120
For all of the independent content creators that I listen to and watch

980
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,280
That's really cool. Yeah, i'm i'm working on something kind of similar

981
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,600
I was looking at the price of satellite TV where i'm at

982
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:47,240
And I think i'm going to figure out how much that is and then first i'm going to contribute that to independent media

983
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:51,000
And then once if I can i'm comfortable doing that then maybe i'll let then you maybe i'll get this

984
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,480
And I actually feel like that's actually since i've done that

985
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:58,920
I'm more comfortable at patreon signing up on patreon. It's like it's all really like I feel much better about it

986
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,240
And and honestly, you know what?

987
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,800
With all the great set top boxes now

988
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:10,520
It's easier on the go to get online content a million times over than it is to get your traditional. Yeah, right

989
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,640
Especially for someone like you who's roving all over the place quite literally

990
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,920
Yeah, good point wimpy

991
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,920
All right. Well I finish up

992
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:20,760
I'm gonna ask you wes

993
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:25,720
And then you I mean then somebody in the moment room anybody in the moment willing can it can answer but wes

994
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,440
What would you do?

995
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,440
What would happen?

996
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,520
How screwed would you be?

997
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,520
If github shut down tomorrow

998
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,040
If github went away off the internet

999
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:46,440
Totally offline mildly inconvenienced too quite frustrated after after about a day or so

1000
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,600
How would I update youtube to yeah

1001
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:54,840
See this is the thing is I think the way would impact me is all of the open source stuff

1002
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:59,480
I use that's on github that would be like offline like aur things would break

1003
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:05,480
And now updates would get around mumber of anybody in there having thought how screwed would you be if github went offline tomorrow?

1004
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Uh, I think it will

1005
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:12,040
Sorry fretsel go ahead. I think that

1006
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,200
primary thing for the links community would be that um

1007
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:23,400
Like for example aur a lot of aur packages pull sources directly from github

1008
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:28,280
a lot of people who use go applications would be screwed because

1009
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,960
go

1010
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,960
resolves dependencies by

1011
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,960
downloading stuff directly from github, um

1012
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:44,600
I have for the reasons that there is a chance of github going down. I do have um

1013
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:51,240
a private git instance running on the server that has a lot of stuff that I need but

1014
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:59,800
But it would be massive inconvenience I would have access to my own stuff and all the dependencies that I need for my own

1015
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,400
stuff, but if I

1016
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,400
Want to install something completely new?

1017
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,320
Yeah, it would be horrible. Yeah, that's kind of my take on it

1018
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:12,280
Like it would be hey, you know because if you had a cause git it's git so your own code you see

1019
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:18,120
Yeah, you have on your own machine. It's all the other stuff you depend on that probably doesn't have everything tamir

1020
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:23,480
You don't have local. Yeah now free. So do you have a way to bring that mic closer to your mouth?

1021
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:26,440
Because we're getting a lot of room echo and background noise on you

1022
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,840
Go ahead will be

1023
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:35,960
Um, well, I was just going to say that um, yes for all of those other dependent services

1024
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,360
A lot of things would stop working

1025
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:45,640
But if you're an organization or an individual that puts stuff in something like github or trello or bitbucket even

1026
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:49,000
There are tools out there to back up

1027
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,480
your stuff

1028
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:56,440
So that if github or bitbucket or any of those go away

1029
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,040
You actually have your own copy of your data

1030
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:04,760
And a lot of people think that simply having a checkout of github's enough

1031
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,760
But if you're an organization with lots of developers with with code checked out

1032
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,120
That's not actually a recovery position

1033
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:16,200
So, you know if you're using those services, you should be routinely

1034
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:22,520
Um mirroring your repositories to your own instances inside your organization

1035
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:27,080
So if it goes away, you can just repoint your origins and carry on

1036
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,880
Very well put well said

1037
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:35,160
Well, here's why I can feel that i'm slipping because I am coming up with more and more ideas to use slack for

1038
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,440
And now i'm realizing okay

1039
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:40,520
This is starting to speed up to a pace where if I don't watch out this is going to become irreplaceable

1040
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,000
And I have learned that lesson

1041
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:44,600
I have learned that lesson

1042
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:49,480
So now i'm i'm putting a plea a call out to anybody who could help me get a mattermost install

1043
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,160
Ideally i'd like to put one on a digital ocean droplet because that's where I manage all my stuff

1044
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:56,200
I would like to do it there if anybody has uh

1045
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,080
Anybody wants to help me with that?

1046
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,920
I would love to chat with you because it's happening fast and not only that

1047
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,000
But I have ideas that I want to take public

1048
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,360
And it would just make sense to have people if i'm going to work with people in the public

1049
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:15,160
It would make sense to do it do it on mattermost and not require people to sign up for slack and things like that

1050
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,160
And yeah, that would be nice. Yeah

1051
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:22,520
So i'm putting a call out there if anybody does have any experience with mattermost or a slack alternative

1052
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:29,400
I know of I know like there's trello and things like that, but I want something ideally that would be on my own droplet that

1053
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:35,800
I can take snapshots of and things like that. So wimpy you're gonna you say you're you're about to play with it

1054
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:41,560
No, no not about to play with it. No, it's on the very long list of things to do. Yeah. Yeah

1055
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,960
Yeah, I could see how I could see there's a lot of

1056
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,840
I guess I guess I took I guess I didn't

1057
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:53,960
I guess I didn't take slack seriously first and like it's irc and I have telegram. I have irc and I have telegram. Why do I need slack?

1058
01:19:53,960 --> 01:20:00,600
But the really nice thing about one really nice thing about slack. I don't even know if mattermost supports this

1059
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,560
Well, first of all, it has a good phone app

1060
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:08,920
Which is really nice because if I have an idea on the go I can just quickly open up slack and throw something in there

1061
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:15,080
And it can include a picture or audio. That's super nice. But um, the other thing that slack really nails

1062
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,720
And I don't have any experience with mattermost is

1063
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,360
Switching teams so I can be an I can be a member. I'm like a member of three slacks

1064
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,200
Right. Yeah, I have two

1065
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,480
that is

1066
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,920
That is so that way and I because for me it's all about

1067
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,800
Divisioning off things because I work on things as you know

1068
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,640
I have time for them and that being able to slice things up like that is really nice

1069
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:38,680
You can just ignore one for a while if you need you just don't look at it

1070
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,000
I have no idea if mattermost has anything like that, right?

1071
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:47,400
So having heard of slack, uh, but never used it and having used irc and telegram

1072
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,200
How does slack?

1073
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,280
How does slack differ from telegram and irc?

1074
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,640
well, so a few things that are nice about slack is

1075
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,960
Um, it's persistent chat for everybody. So regardless of anybody's client setup

1076
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,480
They're always getting all of the chat history that even though the stuff that they weren't present for

1077
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:12,200
Um, it has bot integration which is actually kind of handy and of course any major service it has integrations for so

1078
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:18,600
Uh, for example, we have a bot that monitors the google calendar and whenever there's a calendar change

1079
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,720
It it sends those changes to a specific channel

1080
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:27,240
Uh, and it also does a daily check of the calendar and post the recording schedule to the to the channel

1081
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:34,040
And this has helped us. I mean, it sounds like a really dumb simple thing, but it has helped us keep the calendar accurate

1082
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:38,680
It's like the thing that's helped us make the calendar accurate now is because there's a thread where we're seeing

1083
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,360
We're have we have to look at the calendar every day every show that we do

1084
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,360
Has a next thread so the next episode of that show

1085
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:51,320
So that way we can we have a spot to communicate with the people who are involved in each of those episodes

1086
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,360
Uh what we need to have in place for the next episode

1087
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:59,000
And uh, what's really nice about that is if you like if you link a youtube video

1088
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:04,280
It will it will preview the youtube video right there in slack or you can get the link

1089
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,520
It doesn't do a bunch of like crazy redirector

1090
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,160
Urls, you can just get nice clean

1091
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,840
Links, uh, or it does it has uh, you know

1092
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:17,880
Like support for a lot of uh, like you can just plus one a comment instead of having to say I agree

1093
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:22,220
That's kind of nice. Um, it it has support for some offline functionality

1094
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,000
And it has limited markdown support

1095
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:28,760
It has like code snippet support and and things like that that are also

1096
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:35,320
You know nicer than you get with any typical irc client and and regard and I guess what and really the thing about it

1097
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,600
Is is there's a ton of good irc clients and telegram and things like that

1098
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:44,680
But what you get with slack is every single person is on the same playing field as far as functionality and capabilities go

1099
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,760
And then the other nice thing that comes with that is a lot of people know slack already

1100
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:51,320
Just like like one of the great things about using skype is

1101
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,640
A lot of people use skype one of the nice things about using google docs is a lot of people have a google account

1102
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,000
Use google docs

1103
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,280
And it's the same thing now with slack is you know when I invited west to the

1104
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:04,600
Linux unplugged slack. He already had a slack account. He was already set up. Easy peasy. Yeah

1105
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:09,240
Yeah, so there's that too. Okay, so so it is a sort of um

1106
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,680
It's taking irc

1107
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,600
And abstracting away some of those bits that you would have to have an admin set up for you

1108
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:24,600
Yeah, and then and then making it super easy to integrate things like dropbox and google docs and you know

1109
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,880
So like if I post a link to a google like i'll say okay

1110
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,880
The uh, the doc is up for this week's episode of unplugged and when I post that link in there

1111
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:38,200
It it gives it a big google doc button. It's obvious this google docs like it's so sort of intelligent about that kind of stuff

1112
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,880
um

1113
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:45,640
It's all and and I guess and then of course all you get all of that and it takes you a grand total of 30 seconds

1114
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,520
To set up a team slack, which is also very nice

1115
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,080
Right, but like anyone can do it

1116
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,880
well, that's the other the other thing is

1117
01:23:54,440 --> 01:24:00,680
Uh, it's pretty much free until you want like fancy stuff like maybe private channels archiving of messages

1118
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:05,000
Yeah, but even then like you still get an incredible history like it's still ridiculous 10 000. Yeah

1119
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,160
uh, so

1120
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:10,760
There is and then and then it's eight dollars per user basically after that

1121
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,080
And and it costs you your freedom, of course

1122
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:15,400
Yeah

1123
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,880
And if you really want some of the fancy integrations

1124
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,200
You have to have like a heroku account

1125
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:24,120
And you have to host some of the apps on there, which means you're using another closed platform

1126
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:27,640
But then you can really start doing some serious shit that is you know

1127
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,840
people are really integrating like with their business workflows and stuff like

1128
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,800
And there's like there's a lot of support for people who do development work and get integration and things like that

1129
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:39,160
That I don't ever use i've made a few slack integrations. They're they're pretty easy

1130
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,520
Yeah, like what kind of things?

1131
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:43,720
Uh, like we have a an alert console at work for things that happen

1132
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,080
And uh, so we just made it so like if you're away from that you wanted to ping you on slack

1133
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:53,240
It'll just send all the new alerts new emails for things. We like share inboxes right to live. See this is the problem is

1134
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:59,320
Is there is a community now out there that knows how to do this and if I go to something like mattermost i'm

1135
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,880
I'm forfeiting that

1136
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,880
We got to start making some mattermost plugins, I guess

1137
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:10,200
Yeah, maybe maybe that could be the goal is to get enough traction publicly that people get interested to build that stuff

1138
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,040
I'll help set up a mattermost server

1139
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,200
Have you done it or you just you're just willing to take that challenge. I would like to play with one

1140
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:23,400
Oh, no, I i'll take the challenge to set one. Well, you know what ham if you do it build it on a do droplet

1141
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:26,120
Because then if it works you could transfer it to me then I could just start paying for it

1142
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:32,360
Okay, sure. Well, I got some instructions on how to build do it on a ubuntu 14.04

1143
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,400
Yeah, use one of our promo codes, right?

1144
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:38,760
And uh, and you get so you'll get two you'll get you can try it out two months for free actually

1145
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:42,280
Build it on a nicer rig. So do like uh, do like one with one gig of ram

1146
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,360
Just that way because I like to do one gig of ram now

1147
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:48,600
Uh, so do a one gig of ram rig. This is going premium up in here and i'll get you one month

1148
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,480
To build it and then you transfer to me and i'll just start paying for it

1149
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,600
I've already used your promo code. So they won't let me use them again

1150
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,640
all of them

1151
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:04,360
Uh, what's the latest good man good man? No, let's just you have okay you could use coder digital or last digital, right or uh,

1152
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:12,840
We got here you got snap ocean do you use do unplugged use support this show snap ocean coder digital or last digital?

1153
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:18,200
I've been pushing that do unplugged man. Good man. Good man. That's right. Anyways, i'm just saying uh,

1154
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,440
Uh, yeah only probably only one promo code per I don't know exactly how it works

1155
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:26,520
But either way or you know what for god's sakes ham i'll send you the ten dollars whatever it takes

1156
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,360
but I would love if

1157
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,800
I got a big I

1158
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:33,560
Got something I want to do. I want to go big. All right, boy, that's you know, that's the sign i'm done

1159
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:42,520
I might just walk out of the studio
