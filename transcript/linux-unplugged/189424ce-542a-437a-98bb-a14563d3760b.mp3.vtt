WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.480
Let's do an informal poll.

00:01.760 --> 00:04.720
Wes, when's the last time you updated your daily driver?

00:05.080 --> 00:06.200
My daily driver?

00:06.720 --> 00:09.520
Actually, this weekend. OK, pretty recent, pretty recently.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.000
What about you, Mini Mac? When's the last time you updated your daily driver?

00:12.880 --> 00:13.960
Two days ago, I think.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.480
OK, what about you, Carl?

00:15.640 --> 00:20.080
Yeah, probably about two days ago because Fedora tells me every time I go to shut it down, that I have updates.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.800
So I just check the box and then do it.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.320
Right. What about you, Neil?

00:23.520 --> 00:28.240
I did it this morning because like Carl said, I was running out the computer.

00:28.240 --> 00:32.720
Wow. OK, so is there anybody in the mumble room that's been like a month or longer?

00:32.840 --> 00:33.880
Anybody who's gone a while?

00:34.880 --> 00:37.080
Nobody? That can't be normal.

00:37.320 --> 00:53.600
Hey, if you want a sample size of one of somebody who's gone a month or longer, when I had my office computer before it gave up the ghost after a series of rolling power outages that burned out my SSD, it would usually be about three to four weeks before I would get a chance to to do updates.

00:53.720 --> 00:58.200
There you go. But at home, I do it enough times and the computer freezes up enough times that I wind up

00:58.200 --> 01:00.200
getting updates basically daily.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.160
Is that your Soos workstation or are you fiddling with it?

01:12.560 --> 01:15.440
Hello, everyone, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.840
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

01:17.840 --> 01:21.800
You know, there's a lot of possibilities for career in the cloud, but there's little time.

01:21.960 --> 01:27.520
ACG's learning paths help you take the right course to prepare for architect developer security and many more high paying cloud jobs.

01:27.520 --> 01:31.040
Get hired, get certified, get learning at a cloud guru dot com.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.400
My name is Chris and my name is Wes.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.920
Hello, Wes. We got a great show today.

01:36.400 --> 01:43.320
Today, I'm going to do I'm going to describe what I think is the perfect laptop for me for Linux.

01:43.920 --> 01:54.880
I ordered a ThinkPad X1 Carbon with Fedora preloaded on it, and I am going to give you my experience with receiving my first ever Fedora preloaded machine.

01:54.880 --> 02:03.600
Why I chose this laptop, what the results have been, how Fedora fared on there, what I would do differently, and a little bit about the performance and the experience and all of that.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.600
But, you know, I've been looking at it, Wes.

02:05.600 --> 02:09.440
I've been thinking about it, as you know, since summer.

02:09.840 --> 02:15.800
I've been thinking in December, right before the end of the tax year, a little holiday present for yourself, maybe.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.400
Merry Christmas to me, right?

02:18.400 --> 02:20.120
So I thought, you know, I get myself something.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.960
And ultimately, it was a tough choice.

02:22.960 --> 02:30.720
Wes was above and beyond, had to listen to me just go on and on about all my different laptop ideas and possibilities.

02:30.880 --> 02:36.880
There really were. I mean, there's a lot of good options right now, which is both a good thing, but doesn't make the choice easy.

02:37.080 --> 02:42.960
Yeah, especially when it's your own hard earned money that, you know, you don't you don't want to you don't want to spend that on the wrong thing.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.880
So we'll tell you about that in a little bit.

02:45.240 --> 02:48.520
But before we get to that, we have some community news and all of that to get into.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.600
So let's say hello to that virtual lug.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.200
Time appropriate. Greetings, Mumble Room.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.200
Hola, Chris and Helen.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.200
Hello.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.200
Good evening.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.200
Hello.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
Hello.

02:58.200 --> 03:04.680
Somebody slipped the virtual lug a little caffeine before we got started, I think, or somebody on the pre show just got them all riled up.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.040
I'm not sure which one.

03:06.360 --> 03:14.440
Before we get into the community news, I want to remind everyone you have just a little bit of time to cast your nomination for the 2020 Tuxys.

03:14.440 --> 03:26.120
Coming to an Unplugged podcast very soon, it is our best of 2020 voted by you and selected by our panel, and then we will be sending out little care packages to the projects that win your nominations.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.760
There is just a little bit of time left.

03:28.760 --> 03:35.720
Also would be then curious about feedback on what we could do to expand it next year, because this is a minimum viable Tuxys.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.680
Yeah, we're just trying this out, you know, getting started with it.

03:38.680 --> 03:44.960
I'm already excited by the submissions that we're seeing, though.

03:44.960 --> 03:45.960
Yeah, there's some good ones.

03:45.960 --> 03:52.920
I think we've had we've had a couple of hundred submissions so far last time I looked in there, which is which now means it's officially entered the territory.

03:52.920 --> 03:58.840
We're like, we're going to have to come up with a way to programmatically sort and go through this data.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.600
Yeah, we've got some work ahead of us now.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.600
Look what we signed up for.

04:01.600 --> 04:02.600
Yeah, yeah, right.

04:03.080 --> 04:06.920
But before we get to that, Wes, you know what?

04:06.920 --> 04:09.520
You know what time it is.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.160
Oh, yeah, I know that sound.

04:11.160 --> 04:16.880
It has been a long time since we have done an ARCH update, probably just about 40 days or so.

04:16.880 --> 04:17.880
Yeah, I think so.

04:17.880 --> 04:30.160
So we have committed when we deployed this ARCH server in production, which you should never do, but we did it and we committed to doing the updates live on air and owning if it bites us in the butt live.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.240
And we won't cut it out.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.240
We'll just do it.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.880
So are you ready to kick this off, Wes?

04:33.880 --> 04:35.800
I'm standing by at the keyboard now.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.760
All right, what kind of what kind of update load are we looking at?

04:38.760 --> 04:39.760
Because it has been a while.

04:39.760 --> 04:46.280
It looks like we've got a hundred and ninety two packages, total download size of seven hundred and fifteen megs.

04:46.280 --> 04:51.520
That's total install size of nearly three gigs, but a net upgrade of just forty four megs.

04:51.520 --> 04:56.880
OK, now this server is even more important than ever because we have a much more hybrid cloud cloud approach.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.520
We have a lot of stuff locally now trying to think if this is going to take anything out.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.800
Is there a kernel update in there?

05:02.800 --> 05:06.000
Oh, yeah, although we are we are on the LTS kernel still.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.480
So if there is here, let me let me give Pac-Man S.Y.U.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.160
a go here and see what we got.

05:12.160 --> 05:18.880
That's what my concern would be is especially and if there if there is a kernel update, we should make sure there's a CFS module in there.

05:18.880 --> 05:19.480
Oh, yes.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.880
Linux LTS five dot four dot eighty three dash one is what we're going to be running soon.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.440
Oh, not five ten.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.160
OK, because we have that because we you know, I mean, it's the brand new one.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.920
Yeah, I know.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.520
All right. Wes, you know what?

05:32.520 --> 05:33.520
Go ahead. Kick it off.

05:33.520 --> 05:40.800
We'll get the updates going and we'll check back in.

05:40.800 --> 05:48.960
Nothing like a live production server upgrade on air while you're recording a show that helps support your back end production infrastructure.

05:48.960 --> 05:55.520
But I think Centos developers are I should say admins and developers kind of know how I feel right now.

05:55.520 --> 06:02.560
Here we are one week in after Red Hat announced that Centos was shifting its focus to Centos stream,

06:02.560 --> 06:11.720
that the traditional Centos releases would be wrapping up with Centos eight and that support would be ending at the end of December twenty twenty one.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.600
There has been a gamut of reaction to this.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.720
I'm really proud of the analysis that Wes and I did in Linux Action News this week.

06:18.720 --> 06:22.760
So if you want a lot of the details of functionally what's changed,

06:22.760 --> 06:27.960
you can either catch last week's episode or get just the straight shot version in Linux Action News from this week.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.360
That's one sixty seven. Thank you, sir.

06:30.360 --> 06:35.800
But now a week in, we've had a couple of we have had a couple of contenders step up.

06:35.800 --> 06:41.320
Rocky Linux enjoyed being one of the number one projects on GitHub over the weekend.

06:41.320 --> 06:47.480
Rocky Linux is is proclaimed to be going to be a Centos alternative for the traditional release model.

06:47.480 --> 07:00.560
And Cloud Linux, while it seemed like they were initially talking with Rocky Linux, has now kind of stand out on its own with news that they were going to invest more than a million dollars a year into their Centos clone.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.040
Whoa, that's a big commitment.

07:03.040 --> 07:14.640
And they proclaimed that it would I guess they have it would be called Project Linux, not not not like Linux the way we would spell it, but L E N I X.

07:14.640 --> 07:19.760
Yeah, that's an interesting name. But I guess Cloud Linux has been doing this for a while.

07:19.760 --> 07:34.520
They've made a business of taking REL and Centos code and fine tuning it into Cloud Linux OS is a customized, high performance, lightweight Linux server for multi tenancy web and server hosting companies, something something they do themselves.

07:34.520 --> 07:43.360
Project Linux will be a free, open source, community driven, one to one binary compatible fork of REL 8 and future versions.

07:43.360 --> 07:48.120
So I guess they'll be just sort of continuing what they do internally and opening that up.

07:48.120 --> 08:05.880
Yeah, they even claim you'll get the ability to port what they say is an entire fleet of Centos servers with a single command, no reinstallation or reboots required, which, by the way, it's also it's also straightforward to switch to stream just sort of the same thing.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.360
Yeah, sure is right. Which command will you choose?

08:08.360 --> 08:16.000
Yeah, and I think that that choice will say a lot. It seems like Cloud Linux is really stepping into play a little more than I kind of expected here.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.600
But I don't know. I mean, is the difference is, you know, if stream is not that big of a difference, is that enough of a motivation?

08:22.600 --> 08:24.800
I think that's yet to be determined.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.200
Listener Mike wrote into the show over the week.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.680
He said, I listened to the last episode discussing the end of Centos as well.

08:30.680 --> 08:37.400
I know it and the upgrade path that's available to Centos stream based on what those from Red Hat said on the show.

08:37.400 --> 08:43.760
And what I read online, I decided I'd go ahead and try to upgrade my personal WireGuard Bastion VPS that I host on Lidnode.

08:43.760 --> 08:47.880
Thanks, guys. From Centos 8.3 to Centos stream.

08:47.880 --> 08:58.680
I thought, of course, a supported upgrade path on a mainstream distro couldn't possibly update the kernel without bringing along all of the appropriate Kmod packages for the packages that I have installed.

08:58.680 --> 09:07.920
Well, imagine my surprise then when I realized that Centos stream didn't have the appropriate WireGuard Kmod package for the new Centos stream kernel after I upgraded.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.400
This is behavior I might expect from Archer Gentoo.

09:10.400 --> 09:19.640
I haven't used Red Hat to drive distros in quite a while, and I'm just disappointed that a purportedly mainstream distro that just made such a huge change doesn't control for this.

09:19.640 --> 09:27.040
Maybe I'm missing something here on how yum and DNF work, but I feel like if a user had functionality installed like the WireGuard packages,

09:27.040 --> 09:35.960
then a simple DNF upgrade should block from completing if the transaction would result in those packages no longer loading against the new kernel.

09:35.960 --> 09:41.800
I realize I could have forced the kernel back to the old version, and I did confirm that it worked when I loaded that kernel,

09:41.800 --> 09:46.240
but I was just so frustrated and annoyed that I blew the whole server away and just decided to replace it with Arch.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.240
Well, that's no way.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.880
That's actually what he says, which we're going to see.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.080
We're about to do an upgrade, and we'll see if it pulls down the right modules.

09:54.080 --> 09:58.320
I mean, we're building the ZFS DKMS module right now, so...

09:58.320 --> 10:00.160
I mean, this is a tricky one.

10:00.160 --> 10:07.200
See, what Mike hit here is, it's like why you always want something baked into the kernel whenever possible

10:07.200 --> 10:15.080
and not have it be a module that gets built with like DKMS or something at install time.

10:15.080 --> 10:20.000
The thing I would wonder is if maybe that just hasn't been packaged for stream yet.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.120
Carl, is something like that possible where like a WireGuard module for the kernel just doesn't package in stream

10:24.120 --> 10:26.440
because stream doesn't have a huge base right now of users?

10:26.440 --> 10:30.920
So to be clear, WireGuard isn't shipped by CentOS Linux or CentOS Stream,

10:30.920 --> 10:35.800
so these are all something third party that I honestly don't know exactly what the issue is.

10:35.800 --> 10:39.280
If it is a DKMS thing, it could be a number of problems.

10:39.280 --> 10:45.120
In reality, we know that anyone building against the kernel headers, they're going to have some challenges ahead of them,

10:45.120 --> 10:51.040
and what's going to probably have to happen in a lot of cases is they're going to have to build packages that are for rel and clones

10:51.040 --> 10:53.480
and then packages for CentOS Stream separately.

10:53.480 --> 11:01.680
Right, and I bet WireGuard by December, by this time next year, I bet there will be WireGuard stream packages that are pretty easy to get your hands on.

11:01.680 --> 11:03.360
Yeah, they seem to be pretty good about that.

11:03.360 --> 11:11.440
Yeah, the WireGuard developer, he's actually already been in contact with CentOS Stream working on ways to get all of his builds working correctly,

11:11.440 --> 11:14.880
so it is a known issue and we're working through it.

11:14.880 --> 11:22.320
Is there an opinion at Red Hat that if you're dependent on kernel ABI stability, that you should just probably that is a use case for rel?

11:22.320 --> 11:28.280
I mean, if you ask the Red Hat business, you know, something like that, of course, they're going to say, OK, that's what they say.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.880
Yeah, there's a there's this thing called the kernel ABI.

11:30.880 --> 11:36.880
The Kabi is what some people will say it as, and there's a lot of documentation out there about what that exactly is.

11:36.880 --> 11:43.040
But if you ever noticed that some kernel module that whenever you upgrade point releases on CentOS or rel,

11:43.040 --> 11:46.960
that a kernel module requires an update at the same time, that's what that is.

11:46.960 --> 11:53.160
That Kabi is usually stable within that point release, and then the next point release will get a new Kabi.

11:53.160 --> 11:57.880
So that's some of those things that you have to work through, some of those details that are getting exposed to people now.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.800
Right. Very good. Thank you for setting us straight on that.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.320
Sorry to hear that Mike had trouble. I mean, there will be that's going to be what happens.

12:04.320 --> 12:09.720
It is still a change, even if it's mostly a small change, but especially for I think, as we mentioned a little bit last week, you know,

12:09.720 --> 12:13.840
long live system systems that have some third party modifications, customizations.

12:13.840 --> 12:17.880
It might it might not be trivial. Hopefully, hopefully, though, it's all very doable.

12:17.880 --> 12:23.920
One of the biggest third party Kmod providers out there for enterprise Linux is L repo.

12:23.920 --> 12:28.560
And anyone that is frustrated by this, I would encourage you to get involved in that community.

12:28.560 --> 12:33.680
They are working with us right now trying to make heads and tails of this and figure out what they need to do to provide a good,

12:33.680 --> 12:38.880
workable solution that's easy to consume for people. And this is a great time to get involved with them.

12:38.880 --> 12:47.880
Good to know. I thought I'd do a little follow up on my matrix usage because we talked a lot about matrix on the show a couple of months ago.

12:47.880 --> 12:56.480
I have been slowly using it more and more. I think I kind of slowed my roll when we got a lot of reports that people are having onboarding issues,

12:56.480 --> 13:01.360
just figuring out how to get on to our matrix server and sign up through element that killed a little of your enthusiasm.

13:01.360 --> 13:10.240
Yeah. And then element itself, while ultimately I think it's the most feature rich matrix client, it has a bit of a wackadoo UI.

13:10.240 --> 13:18.520
It really does. It's I didn't really appreciate that until I started looking at other matrix clients besides element because like, you know, a web browser.

13:18.520 --> 13:23.560
You can have you can have Firefox and Chrome and browse the web. You can have multiple matrix clients.

13:23.560 --> 13:32.040
So I tried out Fractal, which is a GTK, simpler matrix client, and I think it supports lib handy, too.

13:32.040 --> 13:35.480
So I think it'll rescale down to like mobile devices as well.

13:35.480 --> 13:39.440
Oh, here. See, it's written in Rust. That's why you ran it. I got it.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.840
I'm sorry, Wes. It was it was written in. What was that, Wes? What was that?

13:42.840 --> 13:44.040
Rust!

13:44.040 --> 13:51.680
That's right. You got to introduce it properly.

13:51.680 --> 13:56.320
We have a system. You're right. You're right. This looks nice, though. Minimal, maybe, but clean.

13:56.320 --> 14:05.040
Very minimal. It's but it's much more like an IRC client, and it just is way easier for my brain to navigate.

14:05.040 --> 14:08.360
And it works great. It doesn't have all the features, but it works really well.

14:08.360 --> 14:14.240
And it's really easy to get up and going. There's a flat pack available and there's others, packages and whatnot.

14:14.240 --> 14:23.880
And then the other one I think I looked at that I didn't like quite as much Neko, N-H-E-K-O, Neheco.

14:23.880 --> 14:29.480
It tries to kind of have a Discord like interface.

14:29.480 --> 14:36.280
They say the motivation behind the project is to provide a native desktop app for Matrix, which I like that.

14:36.280 --> 14:40.120
That feels more like a mainstream chat app.

14:40.120 --> 14:46.400
So I think they're kind of going for a cross between, well, to me, it looks like Discord, Discord and Element.

14:46.400 --> 14:52.280
And I had trouble getting this one running, so I just stuck with Fractal.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.000
But that has made it a little bit simpler.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.240
And then the other thing that has been kind of spurring more adoption on my part.

14:59.240 --> 15:06.280
Is the audience still seems to be finding our Colony.JupiterBroadcasting.com matrix server.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.880
So we still have people that are joining at a good trickle.

15:09.880 --> 15:17.040
But additionally, I am seeing more and more open source projects that are setting up matrix rooms.

15:17.040 --> 15:25.920
And I am really delighted to see that because there was a time where we were trending towards Slack for a lot of this stuff.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.160
Oh, boy. Right.

15:27.160 --> 15:33.480
And so it's really, really great to see kind of like how people started just spinning up rooms on FreeNode back in the day.

15:33.480 --> 15:37.680
You're starting to see projects just spin up rooms on matrix.org.

15:37.680 --> 15:49.480
And I went in and, you know, I've actually I've had more conversations with upstream developers in the last couple of weeks on matrix than I've probably had in the last year.

15:49.480 --> 16:00.360
I think because I had gotten so used to talking to these people in person that I hadn't really invested time in tracking all of them down virtually.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.440
And then as they've now moved over to matrix and I've been moving over to matrix, I've found them again.

16:04.440 --> 16:09.360
And it's like reconnecting with long friends and meeting new people. And it's been a nice experience on matrix.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.520
So I just I haven't fully switched over. It's not my primary communications platform.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.960
If you message me there, I'm probably going to take a couple of days to respond to you if I do.

16:16.960 --> 16:31.560
But I like it more and more and I have a lot of long term hope for it as you know, as an open chat platform that that really offers so much more than than what any of the closed like Slack and teams could even begin to touch on.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.360
That's just it. Right. There's a lot more potential.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.880
And I don't know. Have you been checking in at all with this week in matrix?

16:36.880 --> 16:38.840
No. Is that a podcast they have?

16:38.840 --> 16:41.680
Yeah. I mean, it's like a weekly thing that they do update to the project.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.160
This last one was a demos week.

16:43.160 --> 16:43.960
Oh, it's like a blog.

16:43.960 --> 16:47.640
Yeah. A blog and then a video, like a meeting that they do.

16:47.640 --> 16:57.880
So you can hang out, watch that and then or, you know, just follow up after the fact like I end up usually doing and checking out all the cool stuff that they're working on like, hey, you know, I see you on Instagram sometimes.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.400
Did you know there's a new bridge for that?

16:59.400 --> 17:02.560
Are you telling me you've been geeking out on matrix and didn't tell me about it?

17:02.560 --> 17:06.560
Well, just trying to follow along, you know, I love the bridges stuff.

17:06.560 --> 17:07.920
I love that it's all open.

17:07.920 --> 17:11.000
I love that they're developing a whole bunch of clients and a whole bunch of servers.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.240
Like, it just seems like there's there's a lot of investment.

17:13.240 --> 17:20.640
And even if it is still not the king of all chat clients, at least in in UX at the moment, it seems like the bones are really good.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.960
Huh? Yeah. Boy, I'm digging this week in matrix thing here.

17:23.960 --> 17:29.760
They have they have this most recent one has a little bit on here about home server deployments.

17:29.760 --> 17:37.360
You know, host is an operating system aimed for the simplest administration of a server that's been democratized for self hosting.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.880
That's cool. There's some neat stuff in here.

17:39.880 --> 17:44.200
Oh, yeah. Look, they even integrate with the element web bit, which we've been thinking about exploring, I think.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.280
Oh, yes. For an embedded embedded chat.

17:46.280 --> 17:51.640
Hey, put a link to this in the old show notes keys there, which are because already done.

17:51.640 --> 17:54.480
That's great. Oh, and they got Docker arm images.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.160
Watch out. Watch out, Raspberry Pi.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.040
I figured you'd find that one.

17:59.040 --> 18:04.040
I'm going to have a I'm going to have a matrix powered Raspberry Pi server soon.

18:04.040 --> 18:08.320
All right, Wes, get your crack your knuckles because you know what time it is.

18:08.320 --> 18:14.200
It is time for us to get back into the ARCH update.

18:14.200 --> 18:18.120
How are we looking over there? We've finished our our DKMS.

18:18.120 --> 18:22.880
The next question is, should we should we move on to our AUR updates or would you like me to reboot first?

18:22.880 --> 18:26.360
I say let's skip the AUR updates. We can do those electively later.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.160
Nothing too important in there.

18:28.160 --> 18:35.600
I want to know if these core updates are going to cause the system to A not boot and B not get the file system mounted again.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.520
This is the thing that I worry about. This is where I start to worry.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.560
I got to pull up a ping here. Yeah, you tell me when you're ready.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.160
I've got fingers over the button now. All right.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.960
Do it. We'll do it. Here we go.

18:45.960 --> 18:50.520
This is going to take a while because it's it's not the fastest booter out there.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.560
I can't go on with the show. Oh, my gosh. OK.

18:53.560 --> 19:02.760
All right. What we'll do is we'll keep it up in a UA tab and I'll just drop it down from time to time.

19:02.760 --> 19:06.880
Oh, gosh, Wes. Really, this is ideal because now you don't have to ask me for an update.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.800
You just you've got it right there. What have I gotten myself into?

19:09.800 --> 19:12.920
What have I gotten myself into? I need to distract myself.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.200
All right. We'll be back. We'll come back and look at it in a moment.

19:16.200 --> 19:21.280
You keep an eye on it, right? Yeah, of course. All right.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.880
Linode.com slash unplugged. This will make me feel a little bit better.

19:24.880 --> 19:28.160
I love talking about Linode. They're our cloud hosting provider.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.600
That's where we run things like our matrix server.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.520
We run it up on Linode.

19:32.520 --> 19:37.760
And the other thing that's really nice about Linode is if you go to Linode.com slash unplugged,

19:37.760 --> 19:41.080
you get a one hundred dollar sixty day credit and you support the show.

19:41.080 --> 19:45.920
But that one hundred dollar sixty day credit is going to get you really far because the prices are great.

19:45.920 --> 19:51.240
I wanted to just go through the experience of setting up CentOS 8 and then converting it to stream.

19:51.240 --> 19:57.280
And I suppose I could go through the hassles of installing software on my machine or, you know, virtualizing it.

19:57.280 --> 20:01.360
But it takes me 10 seconds to get it up and going on Linode.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.000
I tried it and then I destroyed the machine.

20:04.000 --> 20:08.680
And I love using it for just quick little checks like that because you get great performance.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.840
You get an IP address, you can connect to it.

20:10.840 --> 20:16.280
And it's also just kind of rad to like have a system right up there that you then SSH into.

20:16.280 --> 20:20.720
And you're like on the super powerful box from your remote machine and you're trying out something.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.720
And then as soon as you're done, you just destroy it.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.840
It's just it's a really cool sensation.

20:24.840 --> 20:30.120
But maybe you want to build a personal portfolio or a blog or or host some holiday photos.

20:30.120 --> 20:33.400
Linode has like a five dollar a month rig that would be great for that.

20:33.400 --> 20:38.680
But if you want to deploy infrastructure for your business or your community, they have systems that are more than capable of that.

20:38.680 --> 20:41.240
Dedicated CPU systems is what we use for our encoding.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.960
They have systems with GPUs that you can load up like crazy.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.520
They support all the different distributions you could possibly want to run in production.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.320
And they even give you access.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.960
They don't prevent you from getting in there and just re-imaging the disk yourself.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.240
They got a guide on how to do that.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.880
They know how all of this works.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.280
They've been around since 2003, way before AWS.

21:00.280 --> 21:06.520
And I love saying that because I'm so damn proud of them because I was, you know, that's how I got started in IT.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.080
I saw where Linux was going.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.840
I saw the problems it was solving.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.520
And I kind of just hitched my way into that.

21:11.520 --> 21:21.600
And I started replacing Windows NT boxes that were crushing with Linux boxes that would just come in and do way more work and could support way more users.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.520
And it was so great to watch that technology develop.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.040
That's where Linode was at back in 2003.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.360
Their founders came together and built something around Linux.

21:29.360 --> 21:32.320
And and now they're the largest independent cloud provider.

21:32.320 --> 21:37.480
And you can get a one hundred dollars, 60 day credit when you go to linode.com slash unplug.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.400
Go there, support the show and check it out.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.800
I keep seeing people who try it out.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.960
They're like, OK, I gave it a go.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.040
I've been thinking about it, Chris.

21:45.040 --> 21:45.760
I finally did it.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.360
I see what you're talking about.

21:47.360 --> 21:49.320
You know, we got an email into the show.

21:49.320 --> 21:52.960
I'll have to share it with you in the future about their awesome support.

21:52.960 --> 21:59.720
That's not something I touch on very often, but we got a really great email into the show about how fantastic their support is.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.920
Go try them out. Linode dot com slash unplugged.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.120
See what I've been talking about.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.920
All right.

22:07.920 --> 22:16.280
Before we get to the X1 carbon review, which I have sitting right here, I have the I have the keyboards turned on.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.560
I can't really think about anything else, Wes.

22:18.560 --> 22:24.160
I can't really. So we got to check back in.

22:24.160 --> 22:27.880
It looks like it's just back online, I'm ssaging in right now.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.400
OK, I'm going to check my pings.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.480
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was down.

22:30.480 --> 22:35.440
It was down basically for and all of our containers are back online.

22:35.440 --> 22:38.280
No, really? That easy? Yeah.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.160
They said it couldn't be done, Wes.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.520
I mean, they've just started, so maybe some of them will have problems.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.320
But once we get to this point, it's usually fine.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.240
There you go, Wes.

22:50.080 --> 22:54.840
Now, I suppose for, you know, for completion's sake, I should probably do some updates, right?

22:54.840 --> 22:56.480
Yeah, sure. Go and do your updates.

22:56.480 --> 23:00.080
I was mostly just wanted to make sure that that, you know, when we're doing the kernel upgrade,

23:00.080 --> 23:03.160
I want to make sure that that ZFS file system now, huh?

23:03.160 --> 23:07.560
Well, also here. So here's where it gets fun, actually, because we have the LTS kernel.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.760
It meant that we could just continue.

23:08.760 --> 23:13.120
You know, we didn't need a new build from ZFS to work with that new kernel.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.160
Right. So that keeps it simple.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.600
And I think that was honestly I'm glad we made that choice.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.640
I think it just makes this simpler every time.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.520
And it's not like we really need the latest kernel for this box anyway.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.840
I see. So it wasn't a major version change of the kernel.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.160
I got exactly.

23:25.160 --> 23:29.120
But, you know, we talked about last week, two weeks ago, whenever that was recently,

23:29.120 --> 23:35.040
that there's been the 2.0 release of open ZFS with all those new goodies that is now available in the AOR.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.800
So we can do this whole cycle again and get brand new ZFS if you want.

23:38.800 --> 23:45.280
Oh, my God. Why? What? What? Oh, my God.

23:45.280 --> 23:48.520
OK, so you're telling me even though I just dodged a bullet,

23:48.520 --> 23:52.680
there's another firing squad we could stand in front of and do it all over again.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.680
If you'd like to or do it later, that's up to you.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.080
Let's do it.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.120
You know what, because I'm going to get on my soapbox here for a moment,

23:59.120 --> 24:02.680
because everybody told us we couldn't use Arch in production.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.560
And this server has only gotten more production.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.760
It's only gotten more critical.

24:08.760 --> 24:11.000
Has it been two years, Wes? How long is this install?

24:11.000 --> 24:11.920
Do you have any idea?

24:11.920 --> 24:14.320
No, that might not be the Arch install, though, right?

24:14.320 --> 24:17.000
Because we were running it as Fedora.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.720
Yeah. Yeah. Fedora for a bit.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.040
So a year, maybe.

24:21.040 --> 24:24.200
I think at least we'll have to do some spelunking in the logs after the show.

24:24.200 --> 24:28.800
And we went we went over 40 days in between updates on that one by mistake.

24:28.800 --> 24:37.400
And OK, I'm just saying people talk a lot of shit about Arch a lot,

24:37.400 --> 24:39.400
but I don't know.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.040
I mean, there it is working and we're doing it.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.960
We're not we're not doing it properly.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.360
We're not doing it as well as we possibly could.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.560
And we're doing it like jackasses live on a podcast.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.360
And it's still working just fine. I'm just saying.

24:50.360 --> 24:53.440
I will say I do like even when we've occasionally had some troubleshooting

24:53.440 --> 24:56.240
or things just going slowly that we were worried about.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.520
It's nice that we set the system up.

24:58.520 --> 24:59.400
It's really simple.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.680
I feel like we have a good understanding of it.

25:00.680 --> 25:03.800
So when we do have to do a little troubleshooting or reconfiguration,

25:03.800 --> 25:05.200
it's usually not a big deal.

25:05.200 --> 25:08.880
And when it does, Dianas will switch over to Centaustream.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.080
Exactly. We've got a plan.

25:11.080 --> 25:13.560
I don't know what we're going to switch over to,

25:13.560 --> 25:16.400
but I am running Fedora on this ThinkPad.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.960
And you know what?

25:17.960 --> 25:20.080
Maybe maybe there's something there.

25:20.080 --> 25:26.880
So if you have listened to my work over a decade,

25:26.880 --> 25:30.200
you know that just about any time a vendor has come out

25:30.200 --> 25:33.760
with a big splash with a new Linux product,

25:33.760 --> 25:35.960
I inevitably have bought that thing.

25:35.960 --> 25:39.600
It goes back to when System76 became a company.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.520
I bought one of their laptops.

25:42.520 --> 25:46.360
When Dell announced their very first developer workstation,

25:46.360 --> 25:47.600
it was a tower.

25:47.600 --> 25:48.560
I bought one of those.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.080
You're not going to miss out on something like that, right?

25:51.080 --> 25:52.680
One of my favorite computers ever, actually,

25:52.680 --> 25:56.120
I still have it here in the studio.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.240
It's just out in the living room, not hooked up to anything.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.400
But it was a great little machine.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.680
I even used it as a hackintosh for a little while.

26:02.680 --> 26:07.680
When Lenovo announced consumer ThinkPads running Fedora,

26:07.680 --> 26:09.840
which are now also available with Ubuntu,

26:09.840 --> 26:11.840
I knew there was a good chance I eventually

26:11.840 --> 26:14.720
would end up getting one of them.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.880
Because this entire time, whenever

26:16.880 --> 26:19.240
I've been buying a machine preloaded with Linux,

26:19.240 --> 26:23.440
God bless them, they've been with Ubuntu, which is great.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.600
But this was my first chance ever

26:25.600 --> 26:29.480
to get a computer preloaded with Fedora.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.640
And I didn't just buy it because of that.

26:31.640 --> 26:35.440
I did try to think about what I wanted in a laptop.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.040
And I wonder if this maybe connects

26:37.040 --> 26:39.120
with some of you out there.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.680
I wanted my money, the limited amount

26:41.680 --> 26:43.120
that I have if I'm going to spend it,

26:43.120 --> 26:45.960
I want that to vote for Linux.

26:45.960 --> 26:49.640
So regardless, I was going to buy something preloaded

26:49.640 --> 26:50.760
with Linux.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.080
If I'm spending that kind of money,

26:52.080 --> 26:54.040
it's got to further that cause.

26:54.040 --> 26:57.240
I also, maybe even more so than the average bear,

26:57.240 --> 27:01.200
I want a laptop that I can load any distro on quickly

27:01.200 --> 27:04.360
and often with very little minimal fuss.

27:04.360 --> 27:07.240
That means everything needs to be upstream as much

27:07.240 --> 27:08.880
as possible.

27:08.880 --> 27:12.400
Fan control, screen brightness, keyboard brightness,

27:12.400 --> 27:13.880
everything.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.440
It needs to have Thunderbolt 3 and eGPU compatibility

27:16.440 --> 27:18.320
because my work from home setup is all

27:18.320 --> 27:22.840
based around a Thunderbolt 3 eGPU dock.

27:22.840 --> 27:26.560
And my experience, my number one complaint with the ThinkPad

27:26.560 --> 27:30.640
T480 that I used to have was the screen.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.240
We got them with 1080p screens.

27:33.240 --> 27:36.960
And Lenovo just didn't put a lot of effort

27:36.960 --> 27:39.400
into that particular model screen.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.680
It's always been a source of complaints.

27:41.680 --> 27:44.800
So I wanted something with a 1440p screen,

27:44.800 --> 27:46.960
or 2K as you call it.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.760
And I highly preferred, though, did not require something

27:49.760 --> 27:51.560
with LVFS support.

27:51.560 --> 27:52.560
Highly preferred, though.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.080
Just about required.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.080
And I preferred something I could pop the bottom off

27:56.080 --> 27:58.840
and put a bigger disk in or put more RAM in.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.240
Perks, if it was thin and light.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.520
I want something thin and light.

28:02.520 --> 28:03.840
That's why I have an eGPU.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.520
Because when I want something powerful, I've got that.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.640
And I'd like something that has solid construction,

28:08.640 --> 28:09.720
high-end materials.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.960
Right, if you're spending your own money here,

28:11.960 --> 28:13.520
it shouldn't look clunky.

28:13.520 --> 28:19.920
And a high-resolution 1440p screen, backlit keyboard,

28:19.920 --> 28:22.400
and Thunderbolt 3 with eGPU support,

28:22.400 --> 28:29.560
that is actually a very small overlap of devices.

28:29.560 --> 28:33.880
That's what brought me back to the X1 Carbon,

28:33.880 --> 28:37.760
is it has an optional 1440p screen.

28:37.760 --> 28:42.080
It has Thunderbolt 3, works exactly like it did on my T480.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.440
It's thin and light.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.440
It has LVFS support.

28:45.440 --> 28:49.600
And it ships with vanilla Fedora.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.200
Not like an OEM version of Fedora

28:52.200 --> 28:54.840
that's been patched for the sound card and the webcam

28:54.840 --> 28:59.080
to work, but a vanilla version of Fedora 32,

28:59.080 --> 29:03.840
actually, with high DPI mode turned on.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.840
So on a 2K screen with high DPI mode,

29:06.840 --> 29:09.240
that's really zoomed in.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.480
200% is way too much on 1440p.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.720
But it does ship with that.

29:13.720 --> 29:17.600
And it's the GNOME version of Fedora 32, totally vanilla.

29:17.600 --> 29:22.460
And it uses the Fedora OEM GNOME welcome experience

29:22.460 --> 29:23.760
to get you going.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.720
And then you're in, and you're off to the races.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.600
And I thought that was fine, but I actually quickly

29:28.600 --> 29:30.040
replaced that after a bit.

29:30.040 --> 29:32.120
I want to keep it Fedora for as long as possible,

29:32.120 --> 29:34.800
because this wasn't meant to run, in a way.

29:34.800 --> 29:38.160
So I put Fedora 33 on there, plasma spin.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.160
And everything just works.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.600
I just formatted the entire disk.

29:41.600 --> 29:45.680
Didn't care to keep any special partitions or anything.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.140
I just blew away everything and put my own distribution

29:48.140 --> 29:48.640
on there.

29:48.640 --> 29:50.280
And absolutely everything works.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.680
I have a hardware probe in the show notes,

29:52.680 --> 29:55.320
if you want to see what this machine has in it.

29:55.320 --> 29:56.760
It's a nice little box.

29:56.760 --> 29:58.400
I like it quite a bit.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.600
And the nice thing about this Linux hardware probe site

30:00.600 --> 30:04.000
is it just tells you everything that the Linux kernel can see.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.100
Yeah, bury your secrets for us here, buddy.

30:06.100 --> 30:06.800
Everything, right?

30:06.800 --> 30:09.360
It does an LSPCI, and it organizes it nice

30:09.360 --> 30:11.400
in an HTML table for you.

30:11.400 --> 30:14.400
It calls out that my fingerprint reader isn't currently working,

30:14.400 --> 30:16.840
because I haven't bothered setting it up.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.640
Everything that Linux sees, it's in here.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.960
And Linux sees everything that's in this device.

30:20.960 --> 30:24.520
I can even control the keyboard backlight level

30:24.520 --> 30:27.840
using the plasma desktop lighting applet, where

30:27.840 --> 30:29.760
you set your monitor brightness.

30:29.760 --> 30:32.320
I can control everything on this laptop.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.080
It sounds silly to be excited about that in one sense.

30:35.080 --> 30:37.840
But I think, as someone who's been trying Linux laptops

30:37.840 --> 30:40.360
for years now, that you didn't have to fuss with that.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.920
There was no special arch wiki page

30:41.920 --> 30:43.800
about how to find this driver on GitHub

30:43.800 --> 30:46.300
and get it built and installed to make that work.

30:46.300 --> 30:47.120
Awesome.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.720
It's tricky buying a ThinkPad if you're not already convinced.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.520
There's some people I talk to, it's

30:52.520 --> 30:54.320
like that's all they would ever buy.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.200
That's all they get is ThinkPads.

30:56.200 --> 30:56.800
That's not me.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.200
I'm not that guy.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.440
I like to look at everything.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.960
I consider the Galago Pro very seriously.

31:02.960 --> 31:07.320
I considered the XPS 13 very seriously.

31:09.920 --> 31:13.560
But ultimately, what won me over for the X1 Carbon,

31:13.560 --> 31:15.200
besides the fact that it was preloaded

31:15.200 --> 31:19.520
with Fedora, which I wanted that experience,

31:19.520 --> 31:25.360
is it remains to be a very practical laptop.

31:25.360 --> 31:29.440
It is so thin and so light that you

31:29.440 --> 31:30.680
can't tell it's in your backpack.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.560
So that's the kind of heaviness it is.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.320
You don't know it's in there, it's so light.

31:35.320 --> 31:39.640
But yet, somehow they've managed to still have room

31:39.640 --> 31:45.680
for two USB-C ports and two USB-A ports and HDMI out.

31:45.680 --> 31:50.920
And one of those ThinkPad dock connector things

31:50.920 --> 31:53.720
that I'm not familiar with that goes over Thunderbolt as well.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.200
Wow, yeah, those are some ports.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.000
And you know what it was?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.080
Keyboard is great.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.000
The sound is adequate.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.480
It's better than the T480.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.440
And my overall experience with the X1 Carbon

32:03.440 --> 32:05.840
is it's in the hands.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.880
Everything kind of comes together.

32:07.880 --> 32:13.440
The build, the weight, the quality that you can feel.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.000
It's a very well-built product.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.600
How does it do on the old one-handed carry test?

32:17.600 --> 32:20.200
That was always one thing that kind of upset me about the T480

32:20.200 --> 32:23.040
is just you could feel it, the whole system kind of bending

32:23.040 --> 32:24.760
if you carried it just up by the corner.

32:24.760 --> 32:26.200
So it's a much better chassis.

32:26.200 --> 32:31.880
So this is their carbon fiber magnesium composite.

32:31.880 --> 32:34.000
I mean, there's no flex in the body at all.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.800
And it's light enough that you could just

32:35.800 --> 32:36.880
pinch-hold it in the corner.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.800
So what I'm doing right now, even with it open,

32:38.800 --> 32:40.840
is I'm just holding it with my pointer finger

32:40.840 --> 32:42.400
and my thumb in the corner.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.640
And I'm bouncing it up and down.

32:43.640 --> 32:44.320
It's so light.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.920
And there's zero flex in the machine.

32:46.920 --> 32:47.720
That's great.

32:47.720 --> 32:50.360
It's really, really solid.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.240
It really has kind of checked all the boxes.

32:53.240 --> 32:56.360
It's, from a performance standpoint, I benchmarked it.

32:56.360 --> 32:59.280
It's a little bit faster than the T480.

32:59.280 --> 33:03.240
It's a notable improvement, but not a huge improvement.

33:03.240 --> 33:06.880
The multi-core story is a bit of a dog's breakfast,

33:06.880 --> 33:08.240
to tell you the truth.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.760
It does OK in some benchmarks in multi-core,

33:10.760 --> 33:13.520
but it doesn't quite do as well in other benchmarks.

33:13.520 --> 33:16.040
But the single-core performance turns out

33:16.040 --> 33:19.120
to be really fantastic, actually.

33:19.120 --> 33:22.360
It benchmarks faster in single-core performance

33:22.360 --> 33:25.600
than that giant Dell Xeon that I had in not too long ago,

33:25.600 --> 33:26.440
about a month ago.

33:26.440 --> 33:27.440
Wait, really?

33:27.440 --> 33:29.320
Yeah, the single-core is ridiculous.

33:29.320 --> 33:30.760
Wow.

33:30.760 --> 33:34.040
So I mean, that's kind of nice.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.880
And I hooked it up to my eGPU.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.880
And I'm running Plasma with Wayland,

33:39.880 --> 33:43.840
hooked up to an eGPU, playing Red Dead Redemption 2

33:43.840 --> 33:44.520
under Proton.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.760
And it works great.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.800
Actually, I haven't played for more than about 15 minutes,

33:48.800 --> 33:52.240
because I didn't have time this morning, but it all worked.

33:52.240 --> 33:53.080
I had a show to do.

33:53.080 --> 33:56.080
But wow, yeah, that's a really good day-to-day.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.680
Can you have a little fun before you

33:57.680 --> 33:59.320
have to do some work test?

33:59.320 --> 34:05.280
So my build, as I have it here, is the i7 4.9 gigahertz burst.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.300
It has 16 gigs of RAM.

34:07.300 --> 34:10.320
And I got it with a 256-gigabyte NVMe.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.980
And I'm already kind of regretting that.

34:12.980 --> 34:16.120
So my plan is to kind of just tell you guys

34:16.120 --> 34:18.960
what this is like, having had this for about a week

34:18.960 --> 34:19.560
and change.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.320
It took forever, UPS is a bunch of dummies.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.640
But then I'm planning to see if I can open it up and put

34:24.640 --> 34:27.760
a little more RAM in, or put a little bit more disk in,

34:27.760 --> 34:29.760
and see what it's like long-term to use it.

34:29.760 --> 34:33.520
So I'll plan to follow up and do a long-term review.

34:33.520 --> 34:37.180
This, I have to say, is probably one of the finest machines,

34:37.180 --> 34:39.120
though, that I've owned.

34:39.120 --> 34:42.560
And I am extremely happy with the purchase.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.640
And it's small and light enough that I'm

34:44.640 --> 34:47.320
using it in places where I was using an iPad before,

34:47.320 --> 34:48.320
like the couch.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.480
Now I'm just cracking out the laptop.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.360
And I can then just wedge it in the cushion seat

34:53.360 --> 34:55.280
when I'm not using it.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.440
It works great for that.

34:56.440 --> 35:04.200
The 14-inch screen with a 1440p resolution is a little small.

35:04.200 --> 35:09.440
But under plasma, you can really have fine-grained control

35:09.440 --> 35:11.360
over the UI elements.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.880
And so I notched the fonts up a little bit.

35:13.880 --> 35:16.640
And I have the scaling at 125%.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.800
Because you can refine it.

35:18.800 --> 35:22.480
So instead of being 200%, I just have it 125%.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.560
And it's really at a spot where I like it.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.500
I can fit a ton on the screen, especially in a web browser,

35:27.500 --> 35:29.920
or in a text document, or in a terminal.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.840
But I have everything just turned up just a little bit larger.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.340
And it really complements the 1440p resolution.

35:35.340 --> 35:37.240
And I think in a way where I probably

35:37.240 --> 35:39.480
would not have been quite as happy under GNOME Shell.

35:39.480 --> 35:43.640
Because I do not have some of the same knobs I can turn

35:43.640 --> 35:45.240
that I do under plasma.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.800
So just the extra configurability

35:46.800 --> 35:49.360
of more precision on what your scaling looks like?

35:49.360 --> 35:50.820
Yeah, there's just so many options.

35:50.820 --> 35:53.360
Not only is there more precision with the scaling,

35:53.360 --> 35:55.880
at least in Fedora here with the stock,

35:55.880 --> 36:00.200
but I have so many more options for UI element control,

36:00.200 --> 36:02.840
from the buttons in the title bar

36:02.840 --> 36:04.760
to all the various different fonts that

36:04.760 --> 36:06.680
can be set throughout the entire UI for all

36:06.680 --> 36:09.960
the different little types of dialogues, and title bars,

36:09.960 --> 36:12.000
and consoles, and all that kind of stuff.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.800
So you can just notch it all up a little bit.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.560
It's really easy to do so.

36:15.560 --> 36:18.680
This is as close as I've ever felt to the metal with an OS.

36:18.680 --> 36:20.840
Because the performance is great.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.200
And it turns out multi-core is wonderful.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.840
But a lot of stuff really benefits

36:25.840 --> 36:28.240
when you have really good single-core performance.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.840
Being able to burst to 4.9 gigahertz

36:30.840 --> 36:34.400
means that things just fly, like opening up applications

36:34.400 --> 36:36.900
and whatnot, just absolutely scream.

36:36.900 --> 36:41.000
And all meanwhile, I just have access to everything

36:41.000 --> 36:42.520
through all of the built-in things,

36:42.520 --> 36:44.440
like in the plasma desktop.

36:44.440 --> 36:47.860
There's no sensors that can't be detected.

36:47.860 --> 36:50.120
It has no problem controlling screen brightness,

36:50.120 --> 36:53.440
or no problem controlling volume and audio.

36:53.440 --> 36:56.120
Everything just works absolutely perfectly.

36:56.120 --> 36:59.260
And I'm expecting that updates will come down via LVFS

36:59.260 --> 37:01.120
when they're available.

37:01.120 --> 37:04.880
And if you're not looking for a system with a GPU or a 4K

37:04.880 --> 37:07.280
screen, I haven't tried the 4K screen variant,

37:07.280 --> 37:10.160
I think the X1 Carbon is really, really nice.

37:10.160 --> 37:12.240
The only knock, and it's not really a problem for me,

37:12.240 --> 37:14.800
because it's still a pretty nice upgrade from the T480

37:14.800 --> 37:18.360
I was using, is that it's 10th-gen Intel processors.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.520
I'd love to see 11th-gen, and I think

37:20.520 --> 37:24.840
that might be where the Galago Pro has a leg over this.

37:24.840 --> 37:27.640
But for me, it wasn't a deal breaker.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.040
I absolutely would love it.

37:29.040 --> 37:32.120
But when I need GPU power, I have an eGPU,

37:32.120 --> 37:34.360
and that would be the primary thing you would get,

37:34.360 --> 37:36.280
I think, in my opinion, by going with 11th-gen

37:36.280 --> 37:39.040
is you'd get nicer graphics, a pretty notable upgrade

37:39.040 --> 37:40.320
in the Intel graphics.

37:40.320 --> 37:44.000
It would be nice to have that, but when I need nice graphics,

37:44.000 --> 37:45.880
that's just when I go to the eGPU,

37:45.880 --> 37:47.200
and I'm fine with that process.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.320
So 10th-gen processors work for me.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.920
Battery life has been pretty impressive.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.960
It's not blowaway battery life.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.800
It's not all-day battery life, but I actually

37:56.800 --> 38:00.320
haven't drained it down yet, and I use it pretty consistently.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.080
But I usually, around 30%, 40%, I plug it in,

38:03.080 --> 38:07.160
and I'm probably getting at least four or five hours out

38:07.160 --> 38:10.040
of the battery, which is plenty for me.

38:10.040 --> 38:13.680
So it's reached the threshold of it hasn't been an issue yet.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.120
And even when I've left it in my bag overnight,

38:16.120 --> 38:17.800
and I open it up in the morning, and I need

38:17.800 --> 38:19.280
to get some work done, I've still got

38:19.280 --> 38:20.480
plenty of battery life left.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.980
Yeah, that's the real test is, do I

38:21.980 --> 38:24.840
notice that I have to constantly keep plugging this thing in?

38:24.840 --> 38:26.480
Yeah, and I haven't yet.

38:26.480 --> 38:30.820
And it's USB-C as well, so any USB-C power source I have,

38:30.820 --> 38:34.280
I can plug it into, which I love that versatility of it.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.780
So very, very happy with the purchase.

38:36.780 --> 38:40.720
I was nervous as hell when it arrived,

38:40.720 --> 38:43.360
because like I said, I'm not necessarily

38:43.360 --> 38:44.360
sold on all ThinkPads.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.980
I don't think Lenovo has been a great steward of the brand.

38:46.980 --> 38:49.480
But some ThinkPads have really held up over time,

38:49.480 --> 38:52.620
and I think the X1 Carbon is one of them.

38:52.620 --> 38:55.260
And now I kind of see what everybody's talking about.

38:55.260 --> 38:57.960
Really like it, and I'm very happy with my purchase.

38:57.960 --> 39:01.480
This will probably be my daily Linux driver for a long time.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.760
And it checks the number one box I

39:03.760 --> 39:05.920
needed from a laptop from a functionality standpoint,

39:05.920 --> 39:11.000
and that is just this sort of universal works with Linux.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.200
Everything I load on it works, because we

39:13.200 --> 39:14.440
talk about distros so much.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.200
We try out different things so often.

39:17.200 --> 39:20.120
I just want that variability removed.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.640
I don't want to have to fight to get

39:21.640 --> 39:23.520
anything working in the laptop.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.480
I want to be able to focus on the distro.

39:25.480 --> 39:28.440
And that's totally what this gives me.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.400
Even if it's not blowaway performance,

39:30.400 --> 39:34.000
it's good enough performance that I'm happy.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.080
And I give it a big recommend if you're in the market.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.360
Boy, isn't that tempting.

39:38.360 --> 39:41.320
I mean, it's nice that we've got a solid set of options

39:41.320 --> 39:47.560
in this higher end set of Linux laptops that just work.

39:47.560 --> 39:52.240
Yeah, I think my overall config was pretty well under 2 grand,

39:52.240 --> 39:53.200
but I'm not positive.

39:53.200 --> 39:56.600
I can't remember now, because I ordered it a long time ago.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.800
Well, what feels like a long time ago.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.880
I ordered it two, three weeks.

40:00.880 --> 40:01.600
I can't remember.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.680
It's been a few weeks.

40:02.680 --> 40:05.160
And then UPS actually got here pretty quick,

40:05.160 --> 40:07.880
but then UPS took a week and a half

40:07.880 --> 40:09.360
to actually deliver it to me.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.960
They just kept missing me and screwing it up and taking it

40:11.960 --> 40:13.040
to the wrong place.

40:13.040 --> 40:15.200
And so that whole thing, it just sort of

40:15.200 --> 40:16.660
made it feel like it took forever.

40:16.660 --> 40:18.080
And it was really disappointing, because I was sitting there

40:18.080 --> 40:19.200
waiting and waiting for it.

40:19.200 --> 40:22.840
Because you get that new rig anticipation.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.760
And then they kept blowing it and claiming

40:25.760 --> 40:28.240
they showed up when they hadn't actually showed up.

40:28.240 --> 40:30.720
All that was pretty frustrating.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.360
But in the end, it was worth the wait.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.560
And I've been really quite happy with it.

40:34.560 --> 40:38.800
And I'm really impressed with how sturdy it feels,

40:38.800 --> 40:40.560
for how thin it is, and all of that.

40:40.560 --> 40:43.960
So it's going to take a lot of machine now to replace that.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.640
It would really take quite the argument

40:45.640 --> 40:47.120
to switch to something else now.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.000
Yeah, no kidding.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.640
I'll be excited to see how it performs in some upcoming

40:50.640 --> 40:51.760
Distro reviews.

40:51.760 --> 40:52.960
Guess we'll find out.

40:52.960 --> 40:56.240
And Plasma, you know what?

40:56.240 --> 40:57.480
I really think I'm happy with it.

40:57.480 --> 41:00.560
Coming back to Plasma after spending the summer

41:00.560 --> 41:02.760
and change the summer and fall on Gnome Shell,

41:02.760 --> 41:05.720
coming back to Plasma, I feel like I've really

41:05.720 --> 41:07.880
kind of got down tweaking it.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.000
And so when you've got a desktop environment set up

41:10.000 --> 41:11.160
the way you really like it, you've

41:11.160 --> 41:13.160
got it with hardware the way you really like it,

41:13.160 --> 41:16.240
and I'm really satisfied with Fedora on that machine so far.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.680
And I think I'm going to try to keep it

41:17.680 --> 41:19.260
Fedora as long as possible.

41:19.260 --> 41:20.680
It's really checking all the boxes.

41:20.680 --> 41:22.280
So it worked out well, right?

41:22.280 --> 41:24.520
You've got a comfortable, well-provisioned home.

41:24.520 --> 41:28.400
Well, let's do a little cleanup.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.280
Got to get the boxes out of here.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.920
And let's talk about the Luplug.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.960
It happens on Sundays.

41:34.960 --> 41:38.320
We do them at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern in our Mumble Room.

41:38.320 --> 41:41.800
You can get information about that at linuxunplug.com.

41:41.800 --> 41:46.680
And rumor has it that there will be some released recordings soon

41:46.680 --> 41:48.480
of their talks.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.780
And what Wes and I will probably do

41:50.780 --> 41:52.640
is set up an RSS feed for them soon

41:52.640 --> 41:54.720
that we'll be able to tell you here in housekeeping

41:54.720 --> 41:55.640
that you can subscribe to.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.440
And then when they have people come in and do

41:57.440 --> 41:59.980
a talk about something, you'll be able to get access to that.

41:59.980 --> 42:00.840
Stay tuned.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.800
Stay tuned for that coming very soon.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.320
In the meantime, we talk about feeds all the time.

42:05.320 --> 42:06.960
We should talk about the all-shows feed.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.160
Just get everything we make.

42:08.160 --> 42:10.000
Coda Radio is back.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.080
Linux Action News is fresh and new.

42:12.080 --> 42:13.840
Covering stuff as it happens.

42:13.840 --> 42:15.520
And then this show here.

42:15.520 --> 42:19.260
And of course, of course, self-hosted every other week.

42:19.260 --> 42:20.680
So it's not so much that it's going

42:20.680 --> 42:22.840
to blow out your podcast player, but you

42:22.840 --> 42:24.160
get all the shows we're producing right now

42:24.160 --> 42:25.640
and anything new that comes along.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.960
So go get the all-shows feed if you haven't yet.

42:27.960 --> 42:31.640
We have that linked at the Jupiter Broadcasting website.

42:31.640 --> 42:33.360
And a note about Coda Radio.

42:33.360 --> 42:35.160
It has a new live time.

42:35.160 --> 42:38.360
Coda Happy Hour now starts at 5 PM Pacific, 8 PM Eastern.

42:38.360 --> 42:40.880
And then the show usually starts about a half hour after that.

42:40.880 --> 42:45.040
I was playing a little cyberpunk on the live stream

42:45.040 --> 42:47.360
and cracking jokes with the chat room.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.400
It actually turned out to be a really great event.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.640
And we're doing that now Monday evening as a chance

42:51.640 --> 42:53.160
for people to hang out.

42:53.160 --> 42:56.320
5 PM Pacific, 8 PM Eastern at jblive.tv.

42:56.320 --> 42:57.360
Join us for that, won't you?

42:57.360 --> 43:03.080
Mr. Payne, why don't we do a little bit of feedback?

43:03.080 --> 43:04.600
Do you want to take Rob's?

43:04.600 --> 43:05.240
Oh, sure.

43:05.240 --> 43:06.280
All right.

43:06.280 --> 43:10.080
Well, Rob wrote in about the tuxes, actually.

43:10.080 --> 43:13.600
And Rob's been doing his own version.

43:13.600 --> 43:14.440
Hi.

43:14.440 --> 43:16.480
I just wanted to share my picks for the tuxes,

43:16.480 --> 43:20.360
but with a particular angle of an academic perspective.

43:20.360 --> 43:22.400
And he links us to his blog post.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.440
And he's got a whole bunch of picks for the academic tuxes.

43:25.440 --> 43:26.160
I love this.

43:26.160 --> 43:27.280
That's a great idea.

43:27.280 --> 43:30.080
He forked it, and he made it his own.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.640
If this is your area of interest,

43:32.640 --> 43:35.120
we'll have a link to this in the show notes.

43:35.120 --> 43:35.640
I like it.

43:35.640 --> 43:36.760
He got to it before we did.

43:36.760 --> 43:39.160
He took the idea and he ran with it.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.960
That also serves as a nice little reminder

43:40.960 --> 43:43.200
that the tuxes are closing soon, so you

43:43.200 --> 43:45.400
have a little bit of time left.

43:45.400 --> 43:48.800
But Marcus writes in with the best top tool.

43:48.800 --> 43:53.080
And he says, I've been following your discussion on tips and tops.

43:53.080 --> 43:53.920
Nice.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.560
Different utilities with great interest.

43:55.560 --> 43:58.280
I have to say, even though the various tops,

43:58.280 --> 44:01.240
you've never really got to one that's the great, the best,

44:01.240 --> 44:04.480
nothing that beats Glances in usefulness.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.960
Glances not only shows more information on the screen

44:06.960 --> 44:08.840
than any other utility I've come across,

44:08.840 --> 44:11.880
it also color codes values, indicating problems.

44:11.880 --> 44:14.760
It also provides you with a human-readable warning log

44:14.760 --> 44:16.540
when it detects anomalies in your system.

44:16.540 --> 44:19.280
I just thought I'd share this invaluable gem.

44:19.280 --> 44:20.200
And he's right.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.640
Marcus is totally right.

44:21.640 --> 44:24.040
You know, it's been a long time since I looked at Glances,

44:24.040 --> 44:26.720
so I went ahead and gave it a good old install.

44:26.720 --> 44:28.760
And it does fit a lot on the screen,

44:28.760 --> 44:31.800
and I do like the information and how it displays it.

44:31.800 --> 44:34.200
Right, and it comes with a web UI.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.440
That's awesome.

44:35.440 --> 44:39.280
Plus, you can export to stuff like Influx or OpenTSDB

44:39.280 --> 44:41.760
if you have other metrics you want and also want

44:41.760 --> 44:43.160
a handy little feature like this.

44:43.160 --> 44:46.920
And I feel like, I don't know about when you run the web

44:46.920 --> 44:49.240
server part of it, but when you just run the command line

44:49.240 --> 44:53.080
version, it seems like it takes less resources than bash top,

44:53.080 --> 44:56.960
go top, bpy top, all the other tops we've been talking about.

44:56.960 --> 45:01.520
You don't always see it at the top of the top.

45:01.520 --> 45:02.840
Exactly.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.000
It just seems to sit there.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.600
At least Glances on the command line,

45:05.600 --> 45:07.720
and it does fit a lot of information on there.

45:07.720 --> 45:09.840
And I felt kind of foolish because I knew about it,

45:09.840 --> 45:12.040
but you get these new and shinies on there.

45:12.040 --> 45:16.120
I mean, bpy top is still, I don't know, it might look better,

45:16.120 --> 45:20.200
but Glances might be the overall more practical tool.

45:20.200 --> 45:21.600
Let's do another practical tool.

45:21.600 --> 45:23.480
This is our pick this week.

45:23.480 --> 45:25.080
This is something that Wes found.

45:25.080 --> 45:27.960
It's called pbgoppy.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.160
God damn it, Wes.

45:30.160 --> 45:32.120
Hey, I just find the picks, I don't make sure

45:32.120 --> 45:34.040
they're easy to pronounce, OK?

45:34.040 --> 45:35.600
Yeah, pbcopy.

45:35.600 --> 45:39.960
And if you've used a Mac, maybe you've, now I can't speak.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.480
If you've used a Mac, maybe you've

45:41.480 --> 45:47.000
used pbcopy, their little handy dandy pasteboard helper,

45:47.000 --> 45:50.320
much like Excel or XClip on the Linux side of things.

45:50.320 --> 45:53.920
Well, this is like that, except it's cross system.

45:53.920 --> 45:56.040
So if you want to copy between machines,

45:56.040 --> 45:57.760
maybe you don't want to have a full set up

45:57.760 --> 46:00.040
of something like a barrier or synergy

46:00.040 --> 46:01.920
or other solutions for this.

46:01.920 --> 46:05.040
Well, maybe pbcopy is the tool for you.

46:05.040 --> 46:08.200
You just get started by running pbcopy serve on one machine that

46:08.200 --> 46:09.840
access the server, and then you just

46:09.840 --> 46:12.000
define an environmental variable on other machines

46:12.000 --> 46:13.500
that you want to talk to that server

46:13.500 --> 46:15.360
so they know what server to point to.

46:15.360 --> 46:19.480
And then you can pipe to and from pbcopy

46:19.480 --> 46:20.440
and share between systems.

46:20.440 --> 46:21.440
It's pretty easy.

46:21.440 --> 46:24.120
And they have packages for just about anything,

46:24.120 --> 46:27.120
or you can just go get and grab it.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.680
It looks like it's really easy to get up and running.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.800
And don't worry, it looks like there are some options.

46:31.800 --> 46:32.840
I hadn't played with that yet, but you

46:32.840 --> 46:35.420
can add authentication and end-to-end encryption,

46:35.420 --> 46:37.560
if those are concerns of yours.

46:37.560 --> 46:41.480
So I bet we could set up a WireGuard tunnel, right?

46:41.480 --> 46:44.680
And then we could do it over the internet, too.

46:44.680 --> 46:47.160
Yeah, we can just copy and paste to each other.

46:47.160 --> 46:49.920
I mean, who needs a messaging platform anymore, Wes?

46:49.920 --> 46:52.720
I like the idea of me constantly replacing your clipboard

46:52.720 --> 46:53.960
with little surprises.

46:53.960 --> 46:58.360
OK, maybe I don't like that.

46:58.360 --> 46:59.840
It's like a clipboard stocking stuffer.

46:59.840 --> 47:01.240
Let's talk about something else.

47:01.240 --> 47:03.640
Let's talk about our core contributors.

47:03.640 --> 47:07.080
Thank you to the Unplugged Core, unpluggedcore.com.

47:07.080 --> 47:09.800
These folks help keep the show independent,

47:09.800 --> 47:12.400
help us run with a reduced ad load.

47:12.400 --> 47:17.140
They also get two feed choices, a limited ad feed,

47:17.140 --> 47:19.680
with only the ads we're contractually obligated

47:19.680 --> 47:25.400
to include, or a full firehose feed, all our screw-ups,

47:25.400 --> 47:28.640
all the stuff that never makes it into the show, just a raw,

47:28.640 --> 47:30.360
live feed.

47:30.360 --> 47:32.120
Those are two feed options, and they're

47:32.120 --> 47:34.640
available to our Unplugged Core contributors.

47:34.640 --> 47:37.180
Thank you, everybody.

47:37.180 --> 47:39.760
We really, really do appreciate your support over there.

47:39.760 --> 47:43.560
Also, go find our sponsor, Cloud Guru, on social media.

47:43.560 --> 47:46.000
They are at slash the Cloud Guru at YouTube, Twitter,

47:46.000 --> 47:46.960
or Facebook.

47:46.960 --> 47:49.000
You can find them anywhere over there.

47:49.000 --> 47:49.760
Mr. West, what else?

47:49.760 --> 47:50.760
Is there anything else we should mention

47:50.760 --> 47:53.200
before we get out of here, besides the taxis?

47:53.200 --> 47:55.520
Well, just that, unfortunately, we're still

47:55.520 --> 47:58.400
compiling the ZFS module, so this one might have to wait.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.160
But we can provide an update later.

48:00.160 --> 48:02.160
I thought maybe we'd see if we make it to the post-show

48:02.160 --> 48:03.280
and see how it goes.

48:03.280 --> 48:05.640
But yeah, that's a big build.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.840
That might be like we follow up next episode.

48:07.840 --> 48:08.840
We've got the utils done.

48:08.840 --> 48:12.000
We're just doing the actual kernel module itself right now.

48:12.000 --> 48:12.560
Oh, really?

48:12.560 --> 48:13.800
We'll see, yeah.

48:13.800 --> 48:14.920
Almost there.

48:14.920 --> 48:16.080
Do a reboot, test it out.

48:16.080 --> 48:17.000
I bet it works great.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.600
And hey, I'm excited for some of that new stuff in ZFS.

48:19.600 --> 48:20.440
Yeah, we'll see.

48:20.440 --> 48:22.600
If you'd like to join us live, we'd love to have you.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.080
We do the show Tuesdays.

48:24.080 --> 48:28.120
We do it at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern over at jblive.tv.

48:28.120 --> 48:29.400
See you next week.

48:29.400 --> 48:31.920
Same bat time, same bat station.

48:31.920 --> 48:32.480
There you go.

48:32.480 --> 48:34.800
The show is at Linux Unplugged on the Twitter.

48:34.800 --> 48:38.120
Your contact, your feedback, that stuff, I don't know.

48:38.120 --> 48:39.120
I don't know what you do.

48:39.120 --> 48:40.600
I don't even know what I'm saying right now.

48:40.600 --> 48:41.800
But we want your feedback.

48:41.800 --> 48:43.040
That's what I'm trying to say.

48:43.040 --> 48:44.960
Linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.480
You go stuff our box over there.

48:46.480 --> 48:47.080
We got a form.

48:47.080 --> 48:48.640
You fill it out.

48:48.640 --> 48:50.200
It goes into a box.

48:50.200 --> 48:51.560
We read it.

48:51.560 --> 48:53.120
Makes for show content.

48:53.120 --> 48:54.680
Do I need to explain it, really?

48:54.680 --> 48:56.000
Why are you making me explain it?

48:56.000 --> 48:56.640
This is awkward.

48:56.640 --> 48:57.320
It's the end of the show.

48:57.320 --> 48:58.880
And now this is what the end of the show is about.

48:58.880 --> 49:00.320
I don't know why you did this.

49:00.320 --> 49:01.960
Linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

49:01.960 --> 49:03.640
Just go there so Chris can shut up.

49:03.640 --> 49:04.960
Damn it, you know?

49:04.960 --> 49:06.400
Just ruin the end of the show.

49:06.400 --> 49:07.840
I hope you're happy.

49:07.840 --> 49:16.200
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

49:37.840 --> 49:50.480
All right, JBtitles.com.

49:50.480 --> 49:52.400
I've been doing this for a long time.

49:52.400 --> 49:55.000
So in my experience, you really kind of want to shame and give

49:55.000 --> 49:57.480
the audience a hard time on your way out.

49:57.480 --> 50:00.680
That's my pro tip to any podcasters out there looking

50:00.680 --> 50:01.920
to copy my style.

50:01.920 --> 50:05.120
Really give your audience a what for right at the end.

50:05.120 --> 50:08.600
Chris, I feel like intuitively that's

50:08.600 --> 50:12.240
the opposite of a good pro tip.

50:12.240 --> 50:14.080
Oh, oops.

50:14.080 --> 50:15.680
All right, well, let's go pick our title.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.320
How's that build going there, Wes?

50:17.320 --> 50:18.120
Good, just finished.

50:18.120 --> 50:20.400
I'm going to install these new packages now.

50:20.400 --> 50:23.000
All right, you let me know when we're going to do the reboot.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.240
It's fun that this ZFS release includes Zstandard and then

50:26.240 --> 50:29.320
also the package that it built while building it.

50:29.320 --> 50:33.360
Wait, do we have to reboot for a file system upgrade?

50:33.360 --> 50:37.040
Depends on how DKMS is configured in your distribution.

50:37.040 --> 50:39.680
Oh, it's a new module too, right, right, right, right.

50:39.680 --> 50:41.800
Most distributions do require that.

50:41.800 --> 50:46.560
I mean, the main exceptions would be Fedora and Debian,

50:46.560 --> 50:50.640
where DKMS will build against all the kernels automatically

50:50.640 --> 50:52.960
and then reload the modules automatically.

50:52.960 --> 50:55.000
But most distributions don't do that

50:55.000 --> 50:56.960
because it's a pain in the butt to make

50:56.960 --> 50:58.960
that kind of automation work.

50:58.960 --> 51:01.040
I didn't want to put this in the official review,

51:01.040 --> 51:03.280
so it feels like it's OK to say it now.

51:03.280 --> 51:05.880
But I didn't think a Linux laptop could be this good.

51:05.880 --> 51:10.280
And that's someone who regularly reviews the latest XPS, right?

51:10.280 --> 51:11.960
I feel slightly insulted and hurt

51:11.960 --> 51:14.520
that you think I couldn't produce a good Linux laptop

51:14.520 --> 51:15.640
experience.

51:15.640 --> 51:19.840
No, it's the absolutely nothing needs

51:19.840 --> 51:22.560
to be installed to get it working.

51:22.560 --> 51:26.080
There is zero vendor software on it.

51:26.080 --> 51:28.440
And that's not something that appeals to everybody,

51:28.440 --> 51:30.480
but it appeals to me.

51:30.480 --> 51:33.360
There is zero penalty for wiping it and putting anything

51:33.360 --> 51:34.200
I want on it.

51:34.200 --> 51:37.760
That was a prerequisite for us working with Lenovo on this.

51:37.760 --> 51:44.480
We worked very hard to establish this process of we

51:44.480 --> 51:48.040
want the default base image that you download from Fedora

51:48.040 --> 51:51.280
to be able to do all the same things as your OEM preload.

51:51.280 --> 51:53.280
And what's great is it comes with Fedora 32, which

51:53.280 --> 51:56.360
means, by now, everything.

51:56.360 --> 51:59.440
Anything that just made it upstream for that release

51:59.440 --> 52:01.240
or anything, it's just everybody has it now.

52:01.240 --> 52:03.160
33 just runs fantastically on there.

52:03.160 --> 52:03.760
Yeah.

52:03.760 --> 52:05.880
I mean, we're not doing this in a way.

52:05.880 --> 52:07.680
We're not trying to do this in such a way

52:07.680 --> 52:12.720
where we have the, quote unquote, upper hand,

52:12.720 --> 52:16.000
as some other platforms tend to do when they're

52:16.000 --> 52:17.400
doing hardware enablement.

52:17.400 --> 52:21.160
We're doing this mostly because people keep asking for it,

52:21.160 --> 52:22.560
and they want it.

52:22.560 --> 52:26.040
And so that's why we're even doing this at all.

52:26.040 --> 52:29.280
Otherwise, I think, really, it wouldn't have happened.

52:29.280 --> 52:31.200
And the funny thing is, it wasn't even our side

52:31.200 --> 52:32.320
that asked for it.

52:32.320 --> 52:35.840
It was the other side, Lenovo, because their customers

52:35.840 --> 52:36.880
asked for it.

52:36.880 --> 52:39.880
So what I see is that a lot of big brands

52:39.880 --> 52:45.720
go with Linux and partner up and create one of their brand

52:45.720 --> 52:46.440
laptops.

52:46.440 --> 52:50.160
But what you also see is that KDE, for example,

52:50.160 --> 52:52.720
brought out their KDE laptop, and there

52:52.720 --> 52:57.560
are some others that, for example, use the Clevo.

52:57.560 --> 53:01.640
But what of those laptops have you tested and think

53:01.640 --> 53:02.800
were nice?

53:02.800 --> 53:06.080
Well, I mean, if you've tried anything from System76, Tuxedo,

53:06.080 --> 53:09.680
Slimbook, or others, they're all using the same Clevo shells.

53:09.680 --> 53:12.080
I mean, obviously, there's a slightly different mix

53:12.080 --> 53:14.280
of hardware components from time to time,

53:14.280 --> 53:17.600
but they're generally the same base thing.

53:17.600 --> 53:19.800
Yeah, I see a lot of Clevos.

53:19.800 --> 53:21.600
But what I also found, and I think

53:21.600 --> 53:25.840
that's also the one that KDE uses, is the base of Tong Feng.

53:25.840 --> 53:26.600
Yeah.

53:26.600 --> 53:28.240
But that's coming from Tuxedo.

53:28.240 --> 53:35.360
And so their design is the one that bases that.

53:35.360 --> 53:38.320
Where the X1 Carbon kind of, I think, has the edge

53:38.320 --> 53:44.080
is it has this really sturdy magnesium body, right,

53:44.080 --> 53:46.460
and carbon fiber, whatever the hell they put in there,

53:46.460 --> 53:47.360
space material.

53:47.360 --> 53:51.480
But just regardless, it has a very rigid build,

53:51.480 --> 53:53.640
but it's extremely light.

53:53.640 --> 53:56.960
And yet, the performance is, like in single core

53:56.960 --> 53:59.040
especially, competitive.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.800
And so that's where it's like, wow,

54:00.800 --> 54:05.120
so I've got this laptop that is 100% pure upstream.

54:05.120 --> 54:08.640
Everything is, every distro under the sun is supported.

54:08.640 --> 54:11.640
It gets update via LVFS, so I just have to support.

54:11.640 --> 54:13.920
Anything I install just has to support that.

54:13.920 --> 54:18.200
But additionally, it's not really compromised in any way.

54:18.200 --> 54:19.600
It's extremely light.

54:19.600 --> 54:21.680
It has quite good battery life.

54:21.680 --> 54:22.680
The performance is good.

54:22.680 --> 54:26.000
It gets that Venn diagram just in the right spot of all

54:26.000 --> 54:27.600
of those features that I like.

54:27.600 --> 54:30.880
Like for example, the new KDE laptop

54:30.880 --> 54:35.160
or some of the other higher performance laptops,

54:35.160 --> 54:36.560
they're just too big.

54:36.560 --> 54:37.760
They're too big.

54:37.760 --> 54:40.960
And this is just the right size.

54:40.960 --> 54:41.840
It's not too small.

54:41.840 --> 54:43.320
It's almost too small.

54:43.320 --> 54:44.520
And it's not too big.

54:44.520 --> 54:46.840
And it's just in that, for me, that perfect size

54:46.840 --> 54:48.440
where I could take it on an airplane,

54:48.440 --> 54:50.120
but I can also work on it all day.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.520
You can easily drag it forth back to the studio

54:52.520 --> 54:53.880
or the RV wherever you are.

54:53.880 --> 54:55.400
It's not just sitting on a desk all the time.

54:55.400 --> 54:56.640
You're actually taking it with you.

54:56.640 --> 54:58.960
Yeah, and really, there's no penalty for taking it with me

54:58.960 --> 55:01.360
because it's so light.

55:01.360 --> 55:04.200
It doesn't feel like there's a big penalty in my bag

55:04.200 --> 55:06.200
for carrying around this big, heavy.

55:06.200 --> 55:08.360
I really like that high-performance Dell laptop

55:08.360 --> 55:09.760
I reviewed recently.

55:09.760 --> 55:13.600
But man, could you feel that big metal chassis in the, yeah.

55:13.600 --> 55:14.920
You could feel the chunking.

55:14.920 --> 55:16.680
Yeah, you really could feel it in the bag.

55:16.680 --> 55:18.520
It was a notable, like the bag could be empty,

55:18.520 --> 55:19.400
and the bag was still heavy.

55:19.400 --> 55:20.920
Get a little sweaty carrying it.

55:20.920 --> 55:21.520
It's embarrassing.

55:21.520 --> 55:23.120
There's nothing but that laptop in the bag.

55:23.120 --> 55:24.440
It was still heavy is what I mean.

55:24.440 --> 55:25.240
It was notable.

55:25.240 --> 55:27.880
And this, I literally, for the first couple of days,

55:27.880 --> 55:30.160
was having to double-check my bag that it was in there

55:30.160 --> 55:33.120
until I just started accepting that, yes, I did, in fact,

55:33.120 --> 55:34.120
put it in there.

55:34.120 --> 55:37.400
When you look at Lenovo laptops and the design for them

55:37.400 --> 55:40.000
and how they're approaching this,

55:40.000 --> 55:43.040
they have the wherewithal to customize

55:43.040 --> 55:44.920
every layer of the hardware.

55:44.920 --> 55:47.160
And that's just something to appreciate

55:47.160 --> 55:50.280
because it's one of the reasons we like Apple computers.

55:50.280 --> 55:53.720
They have that flexibility, and they take advantage of it.

55:53.720 --> 55:55.600
Yeah, and you could see some of that same thing

55:55.600 --> 55:57.280
like in the XPS 13.

55:57.280 --> 56:01.800
It's got a very competitive design and chassis and screen

56:01.800 --> 56:04.080
because Dell has a little more leverage there when they're

56:04.080 --> 56:05.640
putting all the components together.

56:05.640 --> 56:06.760
Just a question, yeah.

56:06.760 --> 56:08.360
What's the noise level of that thing?

56:08.360 --> 56:12.120
Could you use it in the studio, just working with daily work?

56:12.120 --> 56:15.160
So a week into it, setting up my software,

56:15.160 --> 56:18.800
loading a bunch of stuff on there, even installing the OS,

56:18.800 --> 56:22.000
I didn't hear the fans until today

56:22.000 --> 56:24.600
when I was starting Red Dead Redemption

56:24.600 --> 56:27.760
and Steam does that thing where it pre-processes the Vulkan

56:27.760 --> 56:28.640
shaders.

56:28.640 --> 56:31.320
That was the first time I've ever heard the fans kick in,

56:31.320 --> 56:33.440
and it was not bad at all.

56:33.440 --> 56:37.040
It was very tolerable, and it was pushing it.

56:37.040 --> 56:38.120
It was really pushing it.

56:38.120 --> 56:42.200
Yeah, that's good because if I want to buy another laptop,

56:42.200 --> 56:43.920
I want to use it at quiet places, too,

56:43.920 --> 56:45.440
like a library or something.

56:45.440 --> 56:48.200
And if you have that van noise kicking in all the time,

56:48.200 --> 56:48.960
that's bad.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.720
But if the noise level is good.

56:50.720 --> 56:51.200
Oh, yeah.

56:51.200 --> 56:54.000
I would describe the vast majority of my usage with it

56:54.000 --> 56:55.320
as absolutely silent.

56:55.320 --> 57:01.080
The only downside that I have with the X Carbon, X1 Carbon,

57:01.080 --> 57:02.400
is the price point.

57:02.400 --> 57:07.160
Because yeah, the money you pour in at the beginning,

57:07.160 --> 57:08.640
you get back in the years.

57:08.640 --> 57:11.480
But not everyone has that kind of money

57:11.480 --> 57:14.080
for a start of the laptop.

57:14.080 --> 57:17.200
I hope I can upgrade the disk because I

57:17.200 --> 57:18.400
know it's cheap, really.

57:18.400 --> 57:19.200
It's soldered in.

57:19.200 --> 57:22.280
Yeah, what I did find is that all Lenovo platforms have

57:22.280 --> 57:23.760
soldered storage and RAM.

57:23.760 --> 57:24.880
Is there any openings on it?

57:24.880 --> 57:26.040
I hope there's something I can do.

57:26.040 --> 57:26.520
Jeez.

57:26.520 --> 57:32.560
Well, the nice thing is that with one specific model

57:32.560 --> 57:37.520
of the Tongfang that has a Ryzen 4000 in it,

57:37.520 --> 57:43.520
and they advertised the battery for up to 14 hours,

57:43.520 --> 57:47.160
and the whole unit is 1.5 kilograms.

57:47.160 --> 57:53.680
It is a 15-inch unit, but with 14 hours battery time,

57:53.680 --> 58:00.800
and with an AMD 4000 in it, with an M.2 PCIe or SATA SSD.

58:00.800 --> 58:02.080
It's an amazing thing.

58:02.080 --> 58:06.440
And the starting price is from 835 euros.

58:06.440 --> 58:07.600
That's a great price.

58:07.600 --> 58:08.120
It is.

58:08.120 --> 58:09.160
It's fantastic.

58:09.160 --> 58:13.840
I did hear from one manufacturer building on top of that

58:13.840 --> 58:18.440
platform that it basically is super buggy with anything

58:18.440 --> 58:23.280
older than Linux 5.10, or sorry, not 5.10, 5.9,

58:23.280 --> 58:29.880
which is not a great place to be when basically no hardware

58:29.880 --> 58:31.760
that manufacturer, no PC manufacturer

58:31.760 --> 58:34.840
is shipping Fedora 33 out of the box, for example.

58:34.840 --> 58:36.680
Nobody's doing that.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.720
And I know of one that has basically,

58:39.720 --> 58:42.080
they disabled their Linux offering

58:42.080 --> 58:44.760
until they work with all the distros

58:44.760 --> 58:47.920
that they were working with to be able to get that working.

58:47.920 --> 58:51.040
Because it was doing things like random CPU lockups,

58:51.040 --> 58:55.520
bad battery life things, random fan speed ups and shutdowns.

58:55.520 --> 58:59.360
Jeez, not what you want on your dedicated Linux laptop, right?

58:59.360 --> 59:02.440
Yeah, and they were a dedicated Linux laptop vendor,

59:02.440 --> 59:04.040
and this was bad for them.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.640
And the problem was that they were

59:05.640 --> 59:07.400
trying to work with the Linux distro vendors

59:07.400 --> 59:09.960
and with the exception of a couple, which, you know,

59:09.960 --> 59:11.800
you can guess Fedora being one of them.

59:11.800 --> 59:14.200
But with the exception of a couple, basically all of them

59:14.200 --> 59:17.560
said, well, you're just going to have to wait until next year.

59:17.560 --> 59:19.080
So they pulled it.

59:19.080 --> 59:20.800
Fedora being pre-installed on this thing

59:20.800 --> 59:22.920
was definitely for me like, it's a perk.

59:22.920 --> 59:26.880
Because not only does it mark the first computer

59:26.880 --> 59:29.440
in my lifetime I've ever bought with Fedora loaded on it.

59:29.440 --> 59:33.040
So that's like for me, it's a nice milestone

59:33.040 --> 59:35.080
as a longtime desktop Linux user.

59:35.080 --> 59:36.840
But additionally, it was a signal to me

59:36.840 --> 59:40.440
that I could put anything I want on it.

59:40.440 --> 59:43.040
Because I recently had an experience with a laptop where

59:43.040 --> 59:45.240
when I installed anything but the stock image,

59:45.240 --> 59:46.720
I didn't have a sound card.

59:46.720 --> 59:49.720
And I just didn't like that restriction at all.

59:49.720 --> 59:51.480
And so by just having Fedora on there,

59:51.480 --> 59:53.360
sort of a vanilla Fedora at that,

59:53.360 --> 59:54.920
it just sent a signal to me that this

59:54.920 --> 59:56.680
was a machine that was safe enough to run

59:56.680 --> 59:58.360
any Linux I wanted on it.

59:58.360 --> 59:59.560
And I liked that too.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.800
And then there was just that kind of personal milestone

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.880
of, wow, now I've bought a computer with Fedora on it.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.320
I mean, I remember when Fedora was announced, right?

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.320
So it's cool.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.080
It's really cool.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.760
It's a connection back to it, yeah.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.920
It's very meaningful to me at this point.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.860
It's been 18 years since the Fedora project was announced.

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.600
It's been 17 years since the first release of Fedora.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.440
And we're on computers.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.280
Yeah.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.280
Well, what I noticed is when I went to buy one,

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.960
it said that the Linux version was like five weeks.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.280
And it said like the Windows version would

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.280
take way less time to come.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.320
So I just ended up buying one and grabbing a USB stick.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.160
And that took, yeah.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.680
I mean, I've done that before too.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.520
That's how I got my-

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.320
Yeah, but it's because the Windows and Linux versions

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.640
are actually different hardware.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.480
Oh, really?

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.720
They make some changes to facilitate all the upstreaming

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.000
and stuff like that?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:54.840
Yep, so there's-

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.920
Oh, because I'm like, I'm running my X1 here.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.040
Oh, it'll work with Fedora because Fedora is awesome.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.920
It'll work with Fedora because Fedora is awesome.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.400
But there were specific hardware changes made to the device

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:13.400
so that it would be more optimal for running on Linux.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.720
So certain hardware features were stripped out

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.600
or replaced with different components,

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:21.880
like the choice of Wi-Fi modules is more restricted,

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:23.900
things like that.

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.320
There were specific changes made to the Linux version

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.000
so that it would actually,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.680
you would have the experience that you had, Chris.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.280
Because I'm on ArcoLinux and Arch derivative

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.520
and it works just fine.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.320
Did you just get an arch by the way in?

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.640
Is that what just happened?

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.160
Come on, kid.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.160
Anyway, so in all fairness and in practice,

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.360
regardless of the Windows or Linux platform

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.440
for the ThinkPad that you are buying,

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.720
it both will work perfectly fine with Fedora.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.200
The reason why the Linux version of the ThinkPad hardware

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.960
is different is not for Fedora,

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.480
but for the other Linux distributions.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.820
All the hardware enablement has already been done

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.640
for even the main platform as far as I'm aware

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.080
with the exception of the Nvidia card,

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.320
but that's because nobody could do anything about that.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.320
But the only thing where I'm always annoyed by

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.240
is the horrible IO placement of some laptops.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.360
Like you don't place one of the most prominent

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.480
USB connections on the right,

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.800
almost on the front of the laptop.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.160
That's where my mouse goes.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:35.040
Explain to me why there are two USB-C ports on one side

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.600
and none on the other for the X1 Carbon.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.760
You can't explain that.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.600
It's brain dead is basically what it is.

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.400
I have an X1 Carbon Extreme and it's even worse.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:45.920
I want to charge my computer on both sides of the thing.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.320
I have an X1 Carbon Extreme and it's worse

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.320
because all the ports are still on the left

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.920
and there's more ports.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.520
You'll have to allow me to interrupt

01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:00.020
because as you probably recall,

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.060
we have just done a ZFS update

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:04.040
and Wes has rebooted the server.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.640
And it is still down at this time.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.480
Looks like it.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.300
Yeah, you should get a ping going.

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.140
Do you have one up already?

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.000
Yeah, I got one going and it's not coming back.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:12.840
Oh, geez.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.680
It does take a while.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.760
I don't remember how long it took

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.400
because we were distracted doing the show.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.720
ZFS takes a while to build

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.240
and get started the first go around,

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.440
especially since you did an upgrade,

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.820
which means it's going to update the pool automatically.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.600
It's going to reset its settings.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.800
It's going to reload the configuration.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.200
Like there's a bunch of stuff that it does

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.560
the first time after you do a ZFS upgrade.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.040
And see, this is how you know I work with ZFS.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.100
That's right.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.640
These super micro boxes take forever to reboot anyways.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.480
They really do.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.440
They're just slow too.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.480
Yeah, and super micro is a pain.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.960
Like it's, last time I had to reboot a super micro box,

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960
which admittedly wasn't that long ago.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.400
It was like a week or so ago.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.600
It took like a minute and a half

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.600
to get through all of the firmwares

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.160
before it got to the operating system boot.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.300
It's stupid.

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.160
Wes, the host is back up.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.680
It's responding to pings.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.440
Okay, so now we'll see if it,

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.760
how the actual boot goes.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.400
Do you want me to jump in or do you want to do it?

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.780
No, you can do it.

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:03.620
Okay.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:04.440
It'll take a little bit.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.280
My VPN's got to get reestablished.

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.160
Yeah, I am logging in right now.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.040
Hitting mount.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.880
Huh.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.720
Oh, here we go.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.400
I think the Docker containers are just starting up.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.360
Yeah, it looks like,

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.920
because I just saw a whole bunch of that start up.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.600
Yes, I see the ZFS mount points.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.120
Wes Payne.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.000
Boom!

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.320
Wes Payne?

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.480
Oh!

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.360
You know what else I love about this is,

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.560
in what is not a good idea,

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:34.200
my VPN connection to the studio is through this box.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.320
Yes.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.360
So I'm caught off if it,

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.980
I mean, Chris is there as a backup, of course,

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:41.280
but I love that WireGuard just comes back up.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.840
Like I don't have to fiddle with anything.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.660
I don't have to change anything.

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:44.500
It's like an interface.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.320
I can keep my ping going.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.980
It just, and once it's back up, I can SSH.

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.960
Wes, this seems like a bad plan.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.520
We've got SSH tunnels and other things set up.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.560
Well, there you go.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.400
This soap box is getting a lot of use today,

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.400
because look what our arch server just did!

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:27.400
Look what that arch server just did!
