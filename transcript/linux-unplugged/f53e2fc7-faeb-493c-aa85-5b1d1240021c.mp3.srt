1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Did I miss all the media server discussions the last couple of weeks completely?

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,360
We have had some on and off.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,560
It's sort of like a project I have been working on because I want to do a review for the Linux

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,400
action show and I've been kind of going through Open Media Vault, Rock Filer, of course FreeNAS

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,840
I'm familiar with, so I kind of just, I'm bringing some of that into it without actually

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,240
currently, I mean I currently use FreeNAS but I'm not currently installing it, and Open

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
Filer I believe.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,240
Did I say Open Filer?

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,200
That's what we agreed you weren't going to look at.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,160
Which has all been whittled down to Open Media Vault just simply based on looking at either

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,320
the fact that what their technology stack is or how long they've been since they've

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,360
been updated or what Wimpy's been poking me about that's gotten me excited, you know all

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
those things factoring.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,040
But actually legitimately looking at it all it seems like Open Media Vault has the best

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,960
trajectory and long term sustainability for a project like this which is exactly what

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
I want for my file server and I like the folks behind it and I like the whole stack and I

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,600
like the community so Open Media Vault is the winner so now that's the one I'm going

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
to focus on for the review.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,360
And I have a basic, basic setup on a NUC right now, an i7 older generation NUC but

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:20,520
it does have USB 3 attached to a 3TB RAID 1 disk setup over USB 3.0 and that's also

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:29,600
connected to a, what are those called, a UPS which I'm hoping to test like Open Media Vault

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,200
support for that which I haven't gotten to yet, I haven't actually hooked it all up.

23
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,080
It supports that, that's how I run it.

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,400
Yeah and I want to just test that all and then I also plan to test how much power it

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,520
draws and all of that stuff.

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:51,080
This is Linux Unplugged episode 159 for August 23rd, 2016.

27
00:01:51,080 --> 00:02:01,480
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux podcast that's broadcasting from all over

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,000
the world right here, right now.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My name is Chris.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And I'm Angela.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello Angela.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hello.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's great to have you in studio.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
A couple of people will be joining us this week to keep us grounded, to give us the new

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,520
user's perspective but fear not, Mr. Payne's reporting in from the field on location.

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Hello Wes.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,800
Hello everyone, it's good to be here.

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Hello hello.

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,120
So we have a great show lined up today.

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,480
We got some big open source project updates to give you, of course, Linux cons going on,

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,720
there's a bit of interesting tidbits that came out of that.

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,320
A couple of gentlemen from the elementary OS project have stopped by to tell us what

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,080
they've got cooking.

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,200
Later on in the show, I'll tell you about some of my woes.

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,040
I know I love myself the rolling release, but I think I finally got bit this morning

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,280
in the worst way possible.

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,400
I'll tell you about that coming up in the show.

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,320
Then later on, LibreVault, it promises to replace BitTorrent Sync and Syncthing, bring

49
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,400
the best of both of them to one GPL3 based project.

50
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,840
What is it and why do we keep talking about it and is it actually feasible?

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,080
LibreVault gets a little test today and will give you our report.

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,400
And then later on in the show, the new version of Android is out, Marshmallow?

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
No more.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,200
It's all about that nougat now.

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
I've got it loaded.

56
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,440
I'll give you my first thoughts and why I think it's damn near time I switch to Ubuntu

57
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Touch.

58
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
That's right.

59
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
That's right.

60
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,280
I'm actually, you know, the thing is every now and then you got to reassess and that's

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
the phase I'm at.

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
So I'll share that with you guys.

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,200
But first, we got to bring in our virtual lug.

64
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,400
Some appropriate greetings, MumbleRoom.

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,680
Oh my gosh.

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Powerful stuff today.

67
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Oh, I feel kind of violated almost.

68
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,320
You all right, Ange?

69
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
That is a room.

70
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
That is a room.

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
All right.

72
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,120
So you guys have all heard the big news today.

73
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,400
Microsoft's got you scratching your heads with the announcement of PowerShell coming

74
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
to Linux.

75
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,040
GNU slash Linux is now the home of PowerShell.

76
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,160
First it started with.NET and then of course the next domino to fall was the.NET base.

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,080
PowerShell.

78
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,560
Microsoft obviously reaching out to system administrators that have to manage Windows

79
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,560
boxes from Linux boxes and as your enthusiast, but I have to tell you, every time Microsoft

80
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,080
makes a move like this, I kind of sit here and go, what's next?

81
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
What is next?

82
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,880
It started really with.NET and then Visual Studio Code and now this.

83
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,440
And I thought for a second here and I thought, holy, holy crap.

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,480
Did Microsoft just become one of the biggest proprietary companies in the world to figure

85
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,280
out how to make money on open source?

86
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,720
Oh, that's a thought.

87
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Kind of.

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Right.

89
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,920
We always talk about how do you make money on open source.

90
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,760
Meanwhile, Microsoft comes along and they figure out how to actually sell software as

91
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,840
a service via Azure and then how to use open source as sort of its backup dancers to bring

92
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,280
people into its platform and generate revenue.

93
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
Who would have thought?

94
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
Microsoft.

95
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,000
It's fascinating to watch them do this.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,560
Wes, have you messed at all with PowerShell?

97
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,880
I've written some things back in the dark days when I had Windows machines to support.

98
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Thankfully not anymore.

99
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,120
It's kind of an interesting environment.

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,080
You get all the.NET goodness.

101
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,080
A lot of people talk about how cool it is to pass objects around in the pipeline.

102
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,960
It's kind of got a neat, you get class-based things.

103
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,400
You have all the access to the.NET stuff and at the same time, you have what you might

104
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,920
call function composition where you can pass things to each other.

105
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,560
You don't have to parse text.

106
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,640
You can just get properties of objects.

107
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,560
That's neat, but personally, I'm kind of more interested in Python or other things like

108
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
that.

109
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,720
I don't see that much of a need, but for interoperability and working with Windows tools, definitely

110
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,360
it's far better than the Windows command line.

111
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,720
Mr. Tonell there has to…

112
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,240
I totally agree with Wes.

113
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
What's the point?

114
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Python exists.

115
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Bash exists.

116
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,720
As a system admin, I don't need PowerShell.

117
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,880
I think Ange could tell you.

118
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,240
So Ange, picture this.

119
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Here it's me.

120
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,240
We were just talking on the pre-show back in the bad old days when I had to use Outlook

121
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,280
under Crossover Office.

122
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,240
I would do whatever it took to be able to manage the Windows systems I was responsible

123
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,680
for from a Linux desktop.

124
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,840
And for me, if I could have had a Linux-compatible Windows automation tool where I could have

125
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,720
wrote scripts for Windows systems from my Linux box, I totally would have jumped on

126
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,000
that.

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,280
And so I think that's who it's for.

128
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
I kind of agree.

129
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Go ahead.

130
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Ansible?

131
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Yeah, I know.

132
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Right.

133
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,760
And I think that's where, I think that's why this move is necessary for them to keep

134
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
this tool relevant.

135
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Great.

136
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,280
So it's doing what Microsoft have always done, it's reacting.

137
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,640
It's not being this trailblazer that you make them out to be, it's reacting.

138
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,800
I don't know if I mean to make them out to be a trailblazer so much as I am sort of

139
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,840
in awe of the fact that they keep doing this and I just don't know where it's going

140
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
to end.

141
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
That's fair.

142
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,360
That's the story that fascinates me about it.

143
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,840
I think you have to acknowledge that this is without a doubt about revenue for them

144
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,720
and they wouldn't be doing it without it, without that motivation.

145
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,120
They're not doing it for – they're not doing it for RMS purposes, right Mr. Tunnell?

146
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,920
Yeah, they're selectively listening to RMS.

147
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:17,140
So like showing that you could give away the software and use the services to make money

148
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:22,720
like RMS has said for years but then you know, also proprietary and everything else.

149
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Yeah.

150
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,960
So – but you know what?

151
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:33,680
In some weird kind of way, I think it's actually better for a company like Microsoft

152
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,160
that it's the bottom line that's forcing them to do this and not some moral rationale

153
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,840
because leadership as we've seen at Microsoft changes.

154
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,600
Board members can make things move around.

155
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,400
There's corporate restructuring that's happened.

156
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,640
There's many layoffs that happen at Microsoft.

157
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,520
CEOs even come and go over time at Microsoft.

158
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,560
If it's a moral sort of community imperative that's driving them, that could easily change

159
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,120
with the next CEO or the next board or –

160
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,840
You can't argue with the bottom line though.

161
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Exactly.

162
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Very well said.

163
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,760
Yeah, it keeps a company like Microsoft in the game because their livelihood depends

164
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
on it.

165
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,080
It's also a good example of showing how the open source system – like the open source

166
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,380
software works in a way that a lot of people say it doesn't because you can't make

167
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,420
money off giving away stuff and like when –

168
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,080
A lot of people – you mean like Microsoft has said, like Microsoft has said for a long

169
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
time.

170
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Right.

171
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
That's true.

172
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Yeah.

173
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,160
Well, I was referencing like people who were like regurgitating what Microsoft says but

174
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,160
the fact that Microsoft is changing their tune is maybe a way to show that everybody

175
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,840
else that – there is a reason why open source works.

176
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
I don't know –

177
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,400
Chris, I kind of think this relates to my prediction that I made a long ago about Microsoft

178
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,720
and Canonical and that because if you think about it –

179
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,920
Are you foreseeing a merger here, a marriage of two companies?

180
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:05,440
Yeah, especially after the release of Ubuntu 17.04 which will be the last in alphabetical

181
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,480
order and that will be Z.

182
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,840
And then after that, because Mark's run out of letters, he's going to call it good?

183
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Yeah, pretty much.

184
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
You know what?

185
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
It's just a double A.

186
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Yeah.

187
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
You're right, Mr. Lou.

188
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
Maybe you're right.

189
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
I've heard crazier theories.

190
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,880
There's still A and C which haven't been filmed yet so there's a couple more releases

191
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,520
to go.

192
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,200
This week is the 25th birthday of Linux.

193
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Happy birthday, Linux.

194
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,360
I'd play the jingle but it would get us pulled down.

195
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,720
I know the Linux Foundation as they do likes to note the occasion and they've noted a

196
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,500
couple of things that are interesting, 13,500 developers from more than 1300 companies have

197
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,080
contributed to the Linux kernel since the adoption of Git made detailed tracking possible.

198
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
Now that is something else.

199
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,600
5,000 developers from 400 companies have contributed to the kernel.

200
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,920
Nearly half these developers contributed for the first time.

201
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,760
The top 10 organizations sponsoring Linux kernel development since the last report include

202
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:09,000
Intel, Red Hat, Lenoir, Samsung, SUSE, IBM, Google, AMD, Texas Instruments, and you guessed

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
it, ARM.

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,440
Oh, I didn't hear Microsoft in there.

205
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,680
You know they actually did show up on the radar for one year.

206
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Really?

207
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,800
Yeah, they did.

208
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,340
They were contributing to making the drivers for Hyper-V. The rate of Linux development

209
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,880
continues to increase as does the number of developers and companies involved in the process.

210
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,400
The average number of changes except in the Linux kernel per hour is point or 7.8 which

211
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,880
is up from 7.71 in the last report.

212
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,320
What is kind of not really said here but is fascinating is and I guess I'd kind of be

213
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,600
curious to get the Mumble Room's take on this, predominantly the contribution to Linux

214
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,440
kernel is corporate sponsors, companies.

215
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,680
Does anybody have any qualms about the fact that predominantly all of Linux is developed

216
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,080
by commercial companies trying to make money off Linux?

217
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:01,600
Chris, this is kind of not really but in order to say happy birthday to Linux, I only have

218
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,520
one thing to say and I say it in the chat room a lot whenever he's brought up.

219
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,840
All hail King Linus!

220
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,280
And the value of this is negative.

221
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,000
So okay, go ahead Mr. Bitton.

222
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,600
And to celebrate the Sphinx Linux Foundation told on their keynotes on Thursday people

223
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,120
are going to have a black tie or a penguin or a Linux related shirt.

224
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
I wish we could have gone.

225
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,440
Toronto though kind of made it unfeasible for us to go but yeah, they've been doing

226
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
the keynotes.

227
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,520
There is a live stream and you've been watching it.

228
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,760
Yeah, at least one or two hours.

229
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,280
I've been busy with work but I watched the first ones at least.

230
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,360
And anything jump out at you?

231
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,640
Any kind of impressions you took away?

232
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,640
I haven't really think that much about it.

233
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,840
Yeah, I guess that's what struck you, huh?

234
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,400
I only had time to watch an hour, I was too busy and stuff.

235
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,040
Yeah it was just a little expensive for us to go but I would have liked to have attended.

236
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,680
It's always fun to be able to go to those events.

237
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,280
I did make it last year when they had it in Seattle.

238
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
That was good.

239
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,040
It wasn't just too long ago.

240
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,720
All right, so we are going to chat with the gentleman from Elementary OS here in just

241
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
a moment.

242
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,320
They've got something pretty cool they're working on and you may have seen it go by

243
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,880
if you've been watching the Twitters or the Reddits and we're going to talk to him about

244
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
it.

245
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,840
But first, I want to talk to you about my mobile service provider and that's Ting.

246
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:29,240
Go to linux.ting.com to get a $25 discount off your first device or if you bring a device,

247
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,680
you'll get $25 in service credit.

248
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,480
Now you could probably scrounge up a device because they support CDMA and GSM.

249
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,960
You just go to their BYOD page and find out which ones are supported.

250
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,200
They're on a mission to really make mobile simple.

251
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,000
It's just your minutes, your messages and your megabytes.

252
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,120
You just pay for them individually.

253
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,320
What you use is what you pay for at $6 for the line plus Uncle Sam's dirty take like

254
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
he always does.

255
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,520
He's got his hand in your pocket, that Uncle Sam and it's really straightforward.

256
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,560
Your customer service is amazing.

257
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,240
They've got regular human beings that are geeks that you get to talk to.

258
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,640
You've got an incredible control panel and Ange, did you hear about the big news for

259
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
Ting?

260
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
There's big news afoot, Ange.

261
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,080
They've dropped their data prices on Ting.

262
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Did you hear about this?

263
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Oh, that's great.

264
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Yeah, check it out.

265
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
It's kind of a big deal.

266
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,200
So they've now gotten competitive across the board with just about damn near anybody.

267
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,400
Pay for what you use wireless is a great model.

268
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,000
No gimmicks, no leather jackets required.

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,280
Data is now cheaper on Ting.

270
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,440
From now on, prices look like this.

271
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Need more?

272
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
It's just $10 a gig.

273
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,440
That's what new customers pay, that's what current customers pay.

274
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,440
It's simple.

275
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
We like simple.

276
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,360
See for yourself at ting.com slash rates.

277
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,720
So they're doing $10 per gigabyte beyond the one gigabyte level.

278
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,080
Really simple to understand.

279
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,000
Ting's data pricing is obvious and if you want to know more, they have a great blog

280
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,160
post about it.

281
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,840
Start by going to linux.ting.com, check out any of their devices.

282
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Feature phones all the way up to real nice Cadillac devices.

283
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,240
In fact, if I recall, they're doing a giveaway of, yeah, the Galaxy S7 Edge.

284
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Oh man.

285
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,960
Oh man, 3600 milliamp battery, Arduino 430 GPU, four gigabytes of RAM, 5.5 inch quad

286
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,800
HD display, and they're giving it away for free.

287
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
You just got to subscribe.

288
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Making me drool, Chris.

289
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
I know.

290
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Making me drool.

291
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Wes, it's like the Cadillac.

292
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
It's the Cadillac, Wes.

293
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,680
You got to subscribe to their Ting account on YouTube.

294
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,680
Simple, simple, simple.

295
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,800
And then comment on their unboxing video and do that in the next three days.

296
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
So think about that.

297
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,760
You subscribe to their channel, you comment on the video, and by the 26th, you could get

298
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,900
a free S7.

299
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,720
They do this a lot too, so it's worth doing if you want a free phone because that's not

300
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,440
going to be a huge group.

301
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,880
And this is going out to a lot of folks that could act on that, so I would jump in.

302
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,120
See if you could get that free phone and then let me know.

303
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,240
I would, oh man, I'd be so jelly.

304
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,080
Free S7 on Ting, there's nothing better.

305
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,400
You take some of the best phones, you put them on the Ting network, it's a match made

306
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
in heaven.

307
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Pay for what you use.

308
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
They don't get in the way of the updates.

309
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,840
I've got the Nexus 6P and guess what?

310
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,960
I'm already running Android N. Ting doesn't play that game where they get in the way of

311
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
your updates.

312
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,160
They get you basically a dumb pipe.

313
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,720
If you want to use it for data, go ahead.

314
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,320
You want to use it to make calls, Ting don't care.

315
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,440
They're Honey Badger and that's what I love about it.

316
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,880
They just get you connected.

317
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,040
Linux.Ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring your unplugged program and

318
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,400
thanks to all of you guys out there for visiting.

319
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,600
That's what keeps us on the air.

320
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,040
Linux.Ting.com and then maybe go get yourself an S7 and then make me totes jelly.

321
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,120
I would love that.

322
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,240
So Lewis and Fabian are joining us today from Elementary OS and they're going to talk

323
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,080
to us about a little hack fest they're trying to put together in Paris.

324
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,440
In fact they've raised an IndieGoGo page to try to get some funding going to make this

325
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
thing possible.

326
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,840
So gentlemen, welcome to the show and I don't know if you guys want to fight it out between

327
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,400
you maybe to the death Kirk and Spock style and tell me which one of you wants to start

328
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,040
with why an IndieGoGo page for a hack fest.

329
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,960
Yeah I think I'll take that one.

330
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,880
Go ahead.

331
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:09,200
We currently raise funds on our website and that mainly goes to the elementary employees

332
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,640
and those funds are pretty tied up with paying the employees.

333
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:23,220
So we thought it would be a good idea to raise the money for the hack fest separately.

334
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,280
So we don't cut into the money we need for the employees.

335
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,440
And Fabian you're located in Paris right?

336
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:40,760
No I'm actually located in Switzerland but because the event is in Paris we put that

337
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
as a place there.

338
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,560
And so what's going to take place at a hack fest like this?

339
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,400
Is this sort of the kick off for the next version of elementary OS sort of get everybody

340
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,960
together in one room and brainstorm and begin writing code?

341
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,940
Yeah that's the idea here.

342
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:06,200
We want to brainstorm what we want to do for the next release but also look at a few things

343
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:14,560
we already have on our bug tracker maybe and maybe do a little bit of finishing work on

344
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Loki.

345
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Okay.

346
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
It depends.

347
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
We have to see.

348
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,680
Do you plan to have any kind of like report or summary or anything interesting for people

349
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,800
who do support you to see what awesome things come out of this hack fest?

350
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,160
Yeah we are planning to do a blog post on it at least.

351
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,560
Not sure what will be in it yet but.

352
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Well right.

353
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Great.

354
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,440
So you're raising funds for this hack fest but is attendance free?

355
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,760
Or will there be a sign up page where a fee is paid?

356
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,040
Actually I think that's a clear point to make to kind of for people to understand it's not

357
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
necessarily for people to attend.

358
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,800
It's not like a like a fest or an event is it?

359
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,640
It's not necessarily something that's closed but it's something where currently there's

360
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,800
just a gist that people are commenting on and it's just sort of getting people organized

361
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
who are going to pop in.

362
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,880
But this is a four day thing so the people that are staying over are just elementary

363
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,200
people who have been pre-organized.

364
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,740
So you're right that it's not totally open as such.

365
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,480
It is sort of you need to ask to attend.

366
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,880
Man I wish we had somebody we could send.

367
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,680
So I know maybe if we want to give Lewis a chance to jump in.

368
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,060
You know I've read some of the comments guys and like on some subreddits and things like

369
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:41,280
that and people just don't seem to grok the value in you guys doing this.

370
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,200
Why not do a Google hangout?

371
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,020
I guess you know and I'm looking at it right now.

372
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,560
You guys launched it yesterday and you're already doing pretty good.

373
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,840
You've got 26 backers.

374
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,560
That's $493 U.S. have been raised and you have a real reasonable goal of $1800.

375
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,520
I'm almost surprised to see you haven't popped it yet and I kind of wanted to give you guys

376
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,960
a chance to sort of explain why sort of a in-person meeting is actually important to

377
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
the process.

378
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,680
Lewis do you want to jump on that one?

379
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Sure.

380
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:18,240
Well historically we haven't sort of had much of meetings going on in the European community.

381
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,360
I think there was some things that have been attended in Germany but that was a case of

382
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,360
people who are actually employees of elementary being flown over from America.

383
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,240
So this will be the first time that that sort of group of people have actually met each

384
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
other.

385
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,000
Obviously we think that when the sort of American siblings of that community have got together

386
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
they've got a ridiculous amount of work and some very long-standing stuff sorted out over

387
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,600
the course of a few days just because it's so much faster to be talking in person and

388
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,080
you can just show someone your screen instead of needing to screenshot it and upload it

389
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,560
somewhere and post it and have a discussion about that.

390
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:06,320
It's so much quicker to do that in person than it is to do that online as you do normally.

391
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,040
Even when there's only two or three people meeting up we've seen just there'll just

392
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,120
be a flood of stuff suddenly get fixed and you can just tell it's all just coming off

393
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,600
of them typically.

394
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,920
And there's that.

395
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,160
There's like the actual code that gets created or the documentation or the project outline

396
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,840
but Wimby I kind of want to throw it to you just for a moment because I think you'll

397
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,080
agree with me.

398
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,360
There's also an energy or an enthusiasm that sort of gets created and then shared amongst

399
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,800
the team when you have an in-person meeting that translates to actual productive work.

400
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Do you agree?

401
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,840
Yeah I do.

402
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:51,120
So I haven't met Fabian or Lewis but I did meet three of their colleagues at the Snappy

403
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,040
Sprint a few weeks ago and that was Daniel, Kortan and Cody.

404
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,800
And prior to that I'd got a passing sort of more or less developer acquaintance with Cody

405
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,400
and I kind of knew of Daniel but didn't really know him and through the course of that week

406
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:19,400
although we were focused on Snappy stuff during the day out of the Sprint you develop some

407
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,000
personal relationships and some friendships and some understanding as to who these people

408
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,280
are that you're trying to communicate with that outlives that brief period of you being

409
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,840
in the same room together and now means that we have a much easier way of communicating

410
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,120
with each other over the internet having spent some time in person.

411
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,760
Yeah it makes those text chats easier to parse because you have a personality model to apply

412
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
it to.

413
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,680
Yeah and I absolutely see the value in elementary crowdfunding a get together like this because

414
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,560
actually getting people in the same place together isn't only productive but it builds

415
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,520
those relationships those working relationships and those personal understandings that really

416
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:13,600
bind a project together so I'm all in favor of what elementary are doing here and I think

417
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:20,800
that crowdfunding not just these kind of activities but crowdfunding in general is the financing

418
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,920
model for independent open source projects for the 21st century.

419
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,340
Why do you think that?

420
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:34,080
Because it works you don't have to ask for lots of down payment and investment from individuals

421
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,480
what you're looking for is small affordable amounts of money from lots of people and and

422
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,360
you can do an awful lot with that and I think that that model works very well there's certainly

423
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:54,400
a place for corporate sponsorship and corporate led you know projects and governance and things

424
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,320
like that but for the independent projects I think crowdsourcing is you know it's still

425
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,200
fairly new and in its infancy and I think people are still finding their way with the

426
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:10,560
blend and how to do things but different people need to explore the options and find out where

427
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,780
it works where it's unsuccessful and then refine that and reproduce it in the future.

428
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:23,260
So and perhaps Fabian or Lewis if you guys I'm noticing something you're doing and Wimpy

429
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,120
just totally touched on it perfectly that blending of funding for open source projects

430
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,200
so the best model I have is Jupiter broadcast and we have sponsors like you just heard from

431
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,600
and we have Patreon and we blend the two to sort of balance out not only multiple revenue

432
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,260
streams so if one dies we don't die as a company but two so we can sort of leverage one to

433
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:50,000
build projects up like for example we have something coming soon that we're relying on

434
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,960
the crowd funding to actually finance the creation of this thing to make it viable so

435
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,320
that and which is really great because there's no outside influence on creating this new

436
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,880
thing but it's not it's not just one or the other and I think it was Fabian who said one

437
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,360
of the things they're doing here ooh a little ambiance there I like that one of the things

438
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,120
Fabian said they're doing here is we use the traditional funding model we have to pay full

439
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,920
time employees and because this is something sort of above and beyond what we normally

440
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:22,220
do we're going back to our user base and saying please help us here do you guys want to touch

441
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:29,320
on at all why why break it out like this is it is it is it mainly down to things are pretty

442
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,760
tight and it's hard to raise funds so when you want to do something big like this are

443
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:38,240
you going to the user base hoping that they'll do the same people who may already be funding

444
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,840
it will go above and beyond or are you hoping that new folks will come into the fold Fabian

445
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:51,560
do you want to take that yeah the reasons for this are probably both and we do want

446
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:59,600
new users to contribute who maybe didn't complete contribute when they first got elementary

447
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:10,280
hours they've been impressed by now yeah or also get the users that are using it and liking

448
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:19,280
it to directly impact changes now because getting together like that will certainly

449
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:27,840
help push the next release out faster so I just want to vote I guess vote with my own

450
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,760
wallet here by the way Ange I backed it today I threw in some just a little bit of money

451
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,880
this this they so they have the indiegogo indiegogo campaign which we will link in the

452
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,600
show notes the elementary hack fest in Paris I threw some money just because on my own

453
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,160
professional experience I can tell you absolutely that first of all eight hundred dollars is

454
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,080
a ridiculously low amount for what you guys are doing and and what the value of what you're

455
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:59,240
doing is is easily ten thousand twenty thousand dollars because it's not just about getting

456
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,800
there if you guys if you guys literally did nothing but bullshit and hang out the entire

457
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,520
time and didn't write a line of code the value for the end users of having a tighter knit

458
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,880
team that likes each other more that has more passion compassion for each other and understanding

459
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,840
of each other will translate to a distribution that is supported by that team for longer

460
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,560
that has a higher level of passion that goes into creating the software that has better

461
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,880
communication understanding amongst the team members that is likely easier to resolve issues

462
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,800
amongst the team members it is so super fundamentally value for valuable for the long term viability

463
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,400
of this distribution that it just I don't personally run it but our son runs elementary

464
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,640
OS and for me it was a no brainer to back this because he's gotten more than a year

465
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,760
of use out of the last version of elementary OS I can't wait to upgrade into the next version

466
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,600
of elementary OS and for it for that for that alone it's worth investing in that team to

467
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,780
just keep making great stuff and even if I only use it on one of the many computers in

468
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,000
all of the computers that I take care of it's absolutely valuable and if you're an elementary

469
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,520
OS user where you kind of grok what they're going it's maybe worth throwing a few bucks

470
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:12,640
because they have a flexible goal and they've reached 27 percent and I got I would love

471
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,640
to see them get five thousand dollars because eighteen hundred dollars is not enough for

472
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,080
what they're doing you know and it's kind of our way some of the people you know elementary

473
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,800
has got got a great desktop experience that's something Linux you know we're really fighting

474
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,200
for and the other companies out there that are you know making these competing products

475
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,280
you're they're absolutely paying for team lunches and outings and going to conferences

476
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,400
so if this is a small way the open source community can contribute back and get the

477
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,060
same kind of experience I think that's great mm-hmm so guys anything else you want to touch

478
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,760
on before we wrap up and you know best of luck to you we'll have a link in the show

479
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:51,480
notes people want to lazy web it not really but thanks for your contribution yeah yes

480
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,920
no problem I'm I'm glad to back and I hope you guys can pull it off and if I if anything

481
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,200
if anything I would love to hear an update from you folks down the road because you're

482
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,200
always welcome to join us in the mumble room and let us know how it's going especially

483
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,600
because one of the things we try to do here on the unplugged show is give every major

484
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,600
viewpoint a good chance and platform to voice it and I don't think elementary OS is the

485
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,720
distro for everyone but for the folks that love it I think they are super happy to have

486
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,200
it and I think it's incredibly important that there is a team out there that is looking

487
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,960
with such a critical eye at how to build a great desktop environment for Linux users

488
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,920
and how to really make a product that is that is whole from beginning to end and that's

489
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,680
something that's desperately needed in the open source community and so that alone I

490
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,320
think makes the project valuable even if I'm not a daily driver of it and so best of luck

491
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,120
to you guys and I hope people out there even if they're not a daily driver of it see some

492
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,560
of the value there so good luck and hopefully we'll hear a report of how it went in Paris

493
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:58,600
if all goes well okay I got to talk about something if you if you're a patron you might

494
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,660
already know about this but if if you're a Linux user if you like Linux unplugged and

495
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:10,720
Linux action show that I may have something that pertains to your interests tomorrow actually

496
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,360
as you listen to this it should be available I was just gonna say we have a new show that's

497
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:20,200
launching on the Jupiter Broadcasting Network what I know I know I'm super excited about

498
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,400
it I'm really really stoked we're trying out a bunch of new technology on the back end

499
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:33,040
so it's incredibly fun from that standpoint it is really something that we have been kind

500
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,840
of percolating for I don't know two years and it just sort of is all kind of finally

501
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,420
come together in a really really really slick I really enjoyed it and the response has been

502
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,920
super super good and by response he means from the patrons that have subscribed and

503
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,240
got to see it and know about it what a week ago yeah I released it early last late last

504
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,200
week to the patrons and so yeah the show is gonna be called are you ready for this I'm

505
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:08,640
gonna reveal it for the first time music soundboard something something okay no wow no not that

506
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:17,440
one no was that the wrong one sorry okay how about this breaking news on the Jupiter Broadcasting

507
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,640
Network we are about to reveal the new show sources familiar with the matter tell us it's

508
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:30,440
gonna be called get ready dun dun dun dun dun dun user air user air and it is something

509
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,120
that is near and dear to my heart think of it like this everyone makes mistakes we're

510
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,040
just gonna make great show content out of them insightful it's gonna be a little bit

511
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,760
it's not gonna take itself too seriously so I'll be a little relevant irreverent I guess

512
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,680
and we'll take sort of the weekly issues from the community as Linux users ourselves mistakes

513
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:56,280
we've made and also just things we're doing throughout the week it is a relaxed enjoyable

514
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:05,040
talk show the first episode is out it is Noah myself and making his network debut the beer

515
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:14,080
Mr. Rekai as their host yep yeah it's true and it's great and it starts out good and

516
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,640
it stays strong the entire episode and I really enjoyed recording it we're using a bunch of

517
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:24,600
new technology to do it not only on the on the recording aspect of it but also on the

518
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,520
publishing end of it and it's all Linux based and so episode one you can go check it out

519
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,480
at Jupiter broadcasting.com user air one we talk about kind of a smattering of things

520
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:42,160
my experience with Linux on the MacBook and getting no man's sky working but also we talk

521
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,640
quite a bit about tiling window managers and Noah's attempt to get into that whole space

522
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,520
and sort of my issues about it we finally give you a tiling window manager review which

523
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,860
I think turned out really great new features that are coming to JBOT and some of the code

524
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:00,800
that we've been writing to make that possible and Noah has recently got into development

525
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,440
and we talk about that we talk about developing Python and Ruby so the whole show it's about

526
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,920
an hour long and it just was turned out great so you can check it out at Jupiter broadcasting.com

527
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:15,720
brand new show for you Linux users it's called user air and I'm really happy with the way

528
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,280
it turned out so on last are we going to be expecting to see exponent yeah right actually

529
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,820
I think you have to watch you have to listen to the episode or watch it but I think he

530
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:31,800
ended up going with awesome and he's very nice yeah yeah it is review was really interesting

531
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:38,080
kind of got me my interest peaked so yeah there you go I'm excited and yeah the patrons

532
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,080
the patrons have got it and we've gotten a hundred percent positive feedback on it so

533
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,880
far what an exciting thing it's like you know once in a every few years thing a new JB show

534
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,040
yeah yeah and it's super fun for us to do a whole new tech to do it there if there was

535
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:00,560
no Mac no Mac touch the entire process which is really fun and we used some some back end

536
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:06,480
scripts that we're hoping we can work with the folks they really great team over at pod

537
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,480
publish to integrate some of the cool things that we're working on with we'll see so yeah

538
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:20,040
it is it is slick and if you're a commuter or if you if you consume this via YouTube

539
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,920
it's out right now there's RSS feeds you can subscribe to it if all of its published it's

540
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,560
an iTunes is in the Google Play Store it's all ready to go we got everything ready and

541
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,920
loaded to go although we do need to get Aaron to update the drop down menu and the show

542
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:40,120
menu thing okay but yeah so I'm very excited I listened to the pilot episode let me I was

543
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,640
actually there for it yeah yeah you the secret life the secret yeah the sneaky live stream

544
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:54,400
yeah I do have a suggestion no considering it's more of a you know a loose conversation

545
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,400
may show why don't you include the mumble room in honor maybe one day maybe one day

546
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,840
I'll tell you what the audio quality of the show is like nothing else we've ever done

547
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,160
I mean it is it is far and beyond anything we've ever recorded before it like I said

548
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,880
like I was saying earlier the new audio the new one some new technology we're using is

549
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:21,760
also a technology stack that automates double-ended recording which for if you if you know what

550
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,200
that means that's kind of a big deal for us and that kind of makes it harder to do mumble

551
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,360
but we do appreciate a good technical challenge so it's it's not with it's not outside the

552
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,560
realm of possibility I don't know if this would work to give you a sample in the show

553
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,760
that might be kind of weird but I will give you and I'll give you a little sample of the

554
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:47,480
audit quality is here ideas if you take a more skeptical approach then when in a couple

555
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,720
months you end up running a tiling window manager I'll just have more fun saying I was

556
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,660
right so as somebody that's a run a tiling window manager in the past I'm gonna say that's

557
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:04,880
not true that I want more fun no that that Chris is not going to end up liking it it

558
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:12,380
just doesn't suit the the style of desktop that he is used to tell tell me okay let's

559
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,600
start with this in the same way that I both gave you both credit for being able to evaluate

560
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:21,800
an operating system from a completely neutral no bias standpoint let's try and do that with

561
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,640
with desktop environments and for everyone out there that's there I can I'll stop it

562
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,560
there I'll tell you one of the things that also I really like about this show is I'll

563
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,600
just say now I don't know if I've all really ever mentioned in the show so you only really

564
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,400
know if you ever listen to 159 of Linux unplugged probably but a secret of this show is I'm

565
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,800
going to edit it a bit so with most of our shows they're all live to tape if you can

566
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,760
call it that lives disk and what you get is what you get but we don't generally edit these

567
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:58,400
at all and that's how I've done it for a decade now that's going to change with with user

568
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,360
error from time to time I will cut it down I will make it more refined I will take the

569
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,200
more insightful and intelligent things we say and focus on those and sort of cut out

570
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,400
some of the extra I haven't done it's not heavy-handed so the original episode of user

571
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:21,320
error episode one was an hour and 14 minutes long the raw recording the published versions

572
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,400
like an hour and three minutes it is that is that right yeah there you go so it kind

573
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,560
of gives you a sense of I took some stuff I just tightened it up I made it I made it

574
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,600
so that way hopefully we keep your intention your attention and everything we say in there

575
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,560
has a good intention behind it and so that's the that's the idea with user error is it's

576
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:50,240
got a little different feel it's a little more relaxed a little bit more intentional

577
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,600
and it's it's definitely one of those shows where we're going to sometimes go down a rabbit

578
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,880
hole we're going to sort of let give ourselves license to just let people who are passionate

579
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,560
about Linux and technology have the floor from time to time and and I'm really excited

580
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,800
about we're going to go with that because the combination of that freedom but yet tightening

581
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,200
it up and making what the end product is really something that's solid I think is going to

582
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,280
be incredible so that's user error episode one it's out right now you can subscribe to

583
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,400
it and I'm very excited about it it's gotten 100% positive feedback so far you can be the

584
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,440
first person to crap in my punch bowl if you like and a big thank you to Rekai for finally

585
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,000
after all of these I know it is how many it's been at least six or seven no more than that

586
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,800
more than that it's got a bit I think eight years now yeah and you know what he's brilliant

587
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,560
so I've been why I you know what I thought from the day we set up the studio I thought

588
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:54,240
one day I'll get that guy on Mike eventually I get everybody on Mike eventually everybody

589
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,360
that's in my daily life ends up on microphone or on camera it just seems to be the way it

590
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:04,000
goes so that's out now and thank you to our patrons who funded it to make it possible

591
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,280
for us to create a show and the first question that didn't come to our mind is how do we

592
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,600
make it sponsor but how do I sell this the question was what's the audience gonna want

593
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:17,080
to listen to I think that's huge what is it ang breaking news here yeah what do we all

594
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:25,320
mr. wimpy go ahead um so I just hit play and I noticed that you've got audio spectrum analysis

595
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:31,120
running yes against a still image is that produced using ffmpeg or something else so

596
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:37,840
yes and yes it is there's a and Rekai probably the guy to talk to about this but what we

597
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:45,120
what we found was there was a a python GTK application that uses fm ffmpeg and I think

598
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,520
AV convert or something on the back end it needed some updates because it was built for

599
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:57,040
like Ubuntu three four years ago and it uses like a boon to his old hello hello who is

600
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,640
that who is that mr. Mike yeah thank you it uses a boon to his old ffmpeg libraries and

601
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,000
stuff like that but Rekai made some changes to one of the main Python scripts and fired

602
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,760
right up and it gives me a GUI to input the file and the background and the text and then

603
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,720
generates the video file and what we want to do is integrate that eventually into pod

604
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,800
published I believe so they yeah so there you go wimpy Rekai just linked you the plug

605
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,160
in yep perfect and in Python that's just perfect isn't it that's and I that's I guess that's

606
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,600
the other thing to kind of touch on here is if everything goes swimmingly user air will

607
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:36,760
be hopefully helping make podcasting on Linux easier even more automated and a little visually

608
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,820
richer and that's one of our goals too so it's super fun to be working on a project

609
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,680
like that that also has some wider community and some yeah just pioneering it basically

610
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,520
yeah I mean I I was so happy when I found pod published and and then the fact that it's

611
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,740
a snap wimpy really was sort of the the final nail if you will because it meant that I could

612
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,720
produce the entire thing for my Apollo under arch so thank you for snapping that up and

613
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,560
and continuing that project now did you talk about how often it will be released so our

614
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,560
plan is Wednesday morning over at Jupiter broadcasting we'll see if that goes because

615
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:17,480
again it's since it's kind of experimental technology things could break but you know

616
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,260
we kind of have a hole as far as technical content on Wednesdays right now on filter

617
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,400
comes out Wednesday evenings BSD now gets recorded during the day but it doesn't get

618
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,520
released so we kind of have a hole there in the schedule if you are a Linux user wanting

619
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,440
some tech content and not politics there's nothing really there for you on Wednesdays

620
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,280
and so our plan is to release it Wednesday mornings if all works to to make it available

621
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,620
so that way on Sunday you'll have Linux action show Monday you have Kota radio and tech talk

622
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:47,560
today Tuesday you have Linux unplugged Wednesday you have user air Thursday you'll have text

623
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:53,680
now okay and so then for those that like joining live like the entire Linux unplugged audience

624
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,840
isn't listening right now and participating in the mumble room will it be ever recorded

625
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,840
live or is it all I think so it's you know it's interesting because there are two totally

626
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:07,520
different shows right oh absolutely yeah so I think so I we recorded the first one live

627
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,160
but don't count on it I guess if you're thinking oh I'm gonna catch a live one I think we'll

628
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,160
always do it live but I'm just you know it just I don't know if always do at the same

629
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,080
time because the whole concept behind the show is I really want all of us to be in a

630
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,520
chill mood when we record it sure I just want us to be able to sit back and talk about stuff

631
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,560
and not be stressed out and that might not be possible for three people but and I hope

632
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,920
in the future to have West join us and bring on yeah yeah and bring on different JB hosts

633
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,040
from time to time and so you'll be able to hear like your hosts from other shows sort

634
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,320
of get in on this show which with I'm hoping super high fidelity audio quality everybody

635
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:49,080
will have local recordings using Zen caster for that which automates and wimpy if you

636
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:53,080
guys I don't wimpy what are you what are you using for the Ubuntu podcast for local recordings

637
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:59,440
there's a utility called audio recorder which is available in a PPA and then mumble for

638
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,240
the real-time chat yes use mumble for the real-time chat and then the the sneaky feature

639
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:12,440
of audio recorder is that you can set a time at which the recording starts so because all

640
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:22,000
of our machines are NTP synced we agree we're going to start recording at 2032 and 04 seconds

641
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,680
and all of our local recordings start at the same time so I've been I've been talking to

642
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,480
Josh and he's the gentleman behind Zen caster with I think it's missing an e so it's sort

643
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,600
of web web 2.0 name yeah and I don't think I've had a chance to look at Zen caster it's

644
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:42,020
like a web RTC front end that does all it one of the things interesting in user error

645
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,440
is Noah was slightly delayed from Rekind I Rekind are sitting here in the studio talking

646
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,680
live Noah was in Grand Forks and he had about a half a second delay so the other thing we

647
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,600
do is we start the recording so audio recorder starts recording and then traditionally Mark

648
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:05,400
counts us in with a three two one and then when it would be zero all of us say biscuits

649
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:13,160
because of course because and and then when they do when we do the edit you just line

650
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:19,320
up everyone saying biscuits together and that accounts for those you know few hundred milliseconds

651
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,720
of of jitter and it's Mark that does the editing right it's either Mark or I I'd say Mark does

652
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,120
about 60 percent and I do about 40 percent well it varies week to week depending on who's

653
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:35,320
busiest if you ever get a wild hair doing the lamination now I think that was poppy

654
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:41,360
I think it was poppy that'll happen if poppy is chief laminator yeah if you ever get the

655
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:47,080
wild hair and you want to try Zen caster it will put you out of business because it manages

656
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:52,120
the time sync up and it handles all of it also does the VoIP aspects you don't have

657
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,120
to use mumble if you don't want but you can just toggle that and then it will post process

658
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:01,120
and level and gate all the individual tracks and produce one file for you at the oh it

659
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:06,480
does the gating as well it does yeah yeah so I it's not you know I so me because we

660
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,600
do all that in post that's what I do too and I'm still doing it that way but I'm beginning

661
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,680
to run two versions and I I ended up for the final published version of user error I went

662
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:23,600
with Zen casters version of the mix okay I still tweaked it a little bit marked and we'll

663
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,480
have a production also known as going out for a curry at the end of the year and we'll

664
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,960
discuss a a change in production methodology it's fun yeah I'll have the I'll have the

665
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,000
creator on a future show he's working on a big release right now and after he's done

666
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,080
I plan to have him on unplugged or last to talk about what he's doing so mr. Wes you

667
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:49,020
found that there was an update to a project we have covered in the past and we just touched

668
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,880
on it a little bit it's good I think it's it's good new GUIX is a package manager I

669
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:00,840
believe oh geeks is that okay thank you good new geeks a package manager that I think promises

670
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,480
reproducible builds with everything am I right can you remind me about what this is and why

671
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,000
it's important yeah good new geeks is kind of an issue they're they they're similar to

672
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,400
the Nix package manager slash distribution and both of them kind of promise a functional

673
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,600
programming like approach to package management and like so today we see a lot of stuff you

674
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:25,240
know with chef puppet ansible you want systems that are reproducible you want to have configuration

675
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,040
management where you have some sort of you know declarative style so that you can specify

676
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,320
I want these packages I want these sys controls changed you know I want to be able to rebuild

677
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,560
a host on on-command or spin up a new host in the cloud if you need one but they kind

678
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,880
of do it from a top-down approach where you know I can configure whatever on my Ubuntu

679
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,540
machine and then have chef run and if I don't have chef you know know about or specifically

680
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,960
managing resources then those may not get managed and they may be in a state that I

681
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,280
don't know it's very easy for kind of unknown things or weird state to creep in that way

682
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,120
so these programs at geeks in particular they kind of go from the ground up where you have

683
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,300
to specify in basically one config file all of the packages you want all the settings

684
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,960
you want and they provide it in a way where it's it's reproducible oh I like that it doesn't

685
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,200
have a lot of side effects doesn't store a lot of state so that you you basically it

686
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,800
runs it processes to this one file and end up with a configuration of a system and is

687
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,160
the advantage to that then it's super easy to replicate that to other systems yes and

688
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,360
so you get you know they have a lot of dependency management they pretty much for the way they

689
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,960
do it is kind of clever they use a lot of symlinks so that you can have one of the things

690
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,680
this enables is you can have multiple versions of you know what might cause conflicts and

691
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,840
other systems you can have multiple versions of the same package because when it builds

692
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,760
it it has a lot of temporary directories there are not temporary but they're based on a hash

693
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,480
of the file so that they're unique per build and if you've changed you know the dependencies

694
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,960
or you've changed the compiler flags and that will be in a different folder and so you you

695
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,080
really have to manually or not manually but you really have to specify all your dependencies

696
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,680
to get this right but once you do it means that you can have multiple versions it makes

697
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,600
it very easy to reproduce and it lets you know that you know once you've got it configured

698
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:03,160
you can move it wherever nothing will change it will always be in that state huh you know

699
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:10,520
so I got bit just this morning it was rough West I said I woke up early and I thought

700
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:16,200
I'm gonna sneak out it's it's it's it's a technique you learn when you have young children

701
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,160
and you wake up before them rarely and you're like I've got I've got an hour before they

702
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,840
wake up I used to do this all the time and so same thing happened this morning I woke

703
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,200
up an hour earlier than I expected I thought I just got a free hour so I walked out to

704
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:37,080
the living room fired up the laptop went to launch no man's sky bubkiss didn't start wouldn't

705
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:43,520
run and I thought to myself oh my what did I update yesterday that broke my game and

706
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,120
this is where I thought to myself gosh you know I'd really love to be able to just pin

707
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,880
the version of wine and just oh just or have have this version of wine installed just for

708
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,600
this application and I know there's exactly there are tools to manage that specifically

709
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,680
with wine but this is something at a package level I could achieve right yes and you know

710
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,020
because of the way it works you can even install it on top of your a lot of people use it just

711
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,440
you know you want the latest version of Emacs and you know now we have some things like

712
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,940
you know snap packages that sort of stuff but this kind of has a different approach

713
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,520
and you can install this whole kind of like a package source you can install this on top

714
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,640
of your existing Linux implementation I think even just all from user land without root

715
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,040
permissions and then come you know get all the packages that you might need built just

716
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,600
for your user oh wow wow so they've just updated here now they're working on getting you can

717
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,040
you can compile it from source that's where you get a lot of the power but they also have

718
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,480
binary packages available so they've been working now on one reproducible builds which

719
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,400
you know we've talked about before a lot of projects are working on you know too they're

720
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:43,600
working on their own because of the way it's because of the unique properties of this distribution

721
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,840
security updates are kind of hard so they've been working on the technique they call grafting

722
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,660
to keep this functional approach but allow you to have security updates easily applied

723
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:56,440
without having to rebuild all of your programs well I love that and just super quick reproducible

724
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:03,400
builds remind me why that's super important even though I know I'm asking for the audience

725
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,160
you know mostly you just want to make sure that the program that you're end up running

726
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,920
as a binary really was compiled from the sources that you can inspect right so if you're running

727
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,720
some eventually unless you're using something totally interpreted you're running a binary

728
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,520
at some point and it's all well and good to have access to the source code but if you

729
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,080
can't actually confirm that that source code would produce a bit for bit identical binary

730
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,520
then you really can't be sure that you're getting those advantages so it's all about

731
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,120
verifying that what you built on your system matches what the source code available for

732
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:33,560
that upstream project is or or whatever it is you're installing and that seems almost

733
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,360
vitally important like it almost seems like half the information you have to know in this

734
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,260
day and age and it certainly would be you know it's one of the benefits of having access

735
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,800
to the source and and free software and all the right talk about so why not leverage it

736
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,000
because we have we with an advantage we have built in exactly even though it you know it's

737
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,480
not app image it's not snaps but it's still technically extremely interesting and that's

738
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,120
why I think it's fun to talk about here on the show and they have a new release and it's

739
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,320
great because West has been kind of following it so I thank you West for bringing it to

740
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:06,200
our attention again and we have a link to the LWN post that go check it out and let

741
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,320
us know what you think and also like I was just saying a heads up to those of you that

742
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,680
are running on the development quote unquote branch of wine and you may be running on that

743
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,440
branch of wine and not even knowing it because for some distributions it's just the default

744
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:25,020
branch of wine they install the new version of wine 1.9.17 breaks No Man's Sky which

745
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:30,040
is in my opinion and I apparently the entire internet disagrees with me the best game in

746
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:37,560
the universe but it does work fine on versions 1.9.16 and 1.9.15 I've confirmed myself so

747
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,360
heads up if you are playing No Man's Sky under wine don't update like I did because

748
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:48,000
that ruined my morning I spent my entire morning fixing that the entire morning I thought you

749
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,040
know and it was West it's funny because my first thought was well maybe it's this MacBook

750
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:57,440
kernel AUR package maybe it updated you know no it wasn't that it wasn't the Nvidia driver

751
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,560
it was just damn wine and it wasn't until I was looking for news for this show that

752
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,120
I noticed that there was a new version of wine out that I went oh wait a minute that's

753
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,240
what it was it was in preparation for the show I discovered the problem just a quick

754
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,560
super quick update on the MacBook Linux thing I talked about it more in user error West

755
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:18,760
I've done a couple of kernel updates in the meantime flawless my friend that is awesome

756
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:25,840
I have I actually I actually clocked it three second boot time it's oh yeah it's it's about

757
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:33,340
seven seconds total because x11 and the Nvidia driver at about another three to four seconds

758
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:38,100
to it depending on the day but I don't know could you just could you just super quickly

759
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:43,040
could you talk about how it's not it's not using grub it's not using lilo we're not using

760
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:49,140
refine to boot on this MacBook we're using the firmware bootloader and frickin system

761
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,520
D can you talk about that at all yeah you know we just used to be called gummy boot

762
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,840
and then it got eaten up by system DS so many things do for better for worse you can talk

763
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:05,160
about that later but it's just a really simple bootloader for EFI systems and so the max

764
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,840
for a long time to kind of work on some of the first machines to have EFI enabled bios

765
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:15,040
is if you want to call them that firmwares and so because they already use that to boot

766
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,760
the Mac OS X operating system if you don't need a fancy menu to pick for them and if

767
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,960
you want Linux to be the default and then have the option to hold the option key to

768
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,240
boot into Mac OS X when you need to say for firmware updates exactly exactly what I want

769
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,400
yep then you can just install it right to the fact partition that already exists that

770
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:39,520
holds the EFI bootloaders or executables and then it just writes a simple configuration

771
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,640
file that sets it up for you and then the firmware will just hit that default boot file

772
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:50,080
it will load the kernel and in at RAMFS and away you go just a couple of other notes because

773
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,160
I've always been a huge doubter of Linux on the MacBook and I've always encouraged

774
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,520
the audience not to do it even though they constantly emailing about it I found two packages

775
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,680
in the AUR that were great one was like fan control D or I can't remember what Mac Mac

776
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,760
fan control D or anyways it's a background process yes it's a demon that runs in the

777
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:11,880
background and actually manages the thermal management on the MacBook so I'm not cooking

778
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,220
the MacBook into hell which was a problem yeah hugely nice West two other packages one

779
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:22,800
that manages the keyboard backlighting just uses the ambient light sensor in the MacBook

780
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:28,400
and automatically adjust the keyboard backlighting just as Mac OS X does and then the last one

781
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,640
that has been also great is the same thing using the ambient light sensor to manage the

782
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,440
brightness on the display just like Mac OS does and I a lot of usability wins right there

783
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,400
it really is and I I have to say if you have an old enough MacBook I don't know about a

784
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,600
new model I couldn't afford to people are like people said I cheated because I tried

785
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:54,880
on a 2013 MacBook instead of a the subreddit and I saw you did they wanted me to buy a

786
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:01,080
new MacBook to try this I gotta talk folks if I was gonna buy a new computer today I

787
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,320
would not be buying a MacBook I would be I would buy in a machine that just runs Linux

788
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,400
out of the box however buying a new MacBook which is actually a three-year-old MacBook

789
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,240
right yeah exactly and that's why yeah that's actually why I thought it was a valid experiment

790
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,840
was I think that MacBook the one that I have the 2013 is gonna come down to sub easily

791
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:22,440
sub thousand dollar prices in a month and I think when that happens you're gonna have

792
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,440
a lot more people looking at it for Linux when you can buy the machine that I have which

793
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:33,440
is honestly a very nice computer it is I've been really impressed with the trackpad with

794
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,140
the keyboard backlighting with the performance but honestly what what what shocks me every

795
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:43,320
time I open up the screen is that 15-inch retina display with gnome 3 beautiful I've

796
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:49,800
never seen a I've never ever in my life seen a GUI that looks that good even the XPS 13

797
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,280
which is my one of my favorite computers which has a high dpi display doesn't look as good

798
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,280
it really is amazing too small yeah it's exactly it yeah it looks great on 15 inch so there's

799
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,040
some reasons to run it but I would say if I was buying today I would probably buy a

800
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:07,760
computer from entryware or system 76 where it was preloaded designed with to run Linux

801
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,040
or even the Sputnik edition from Dell which is also you know meant to run Linux but if

802
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,440
you are in the position of coming across a pre-owned or you have an existing MacBook

803
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,800
and you've been thinking about it you've been on the fence and a gross with the Linux

804
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,320
MacBook kernel which is in the AUR which you have to build every time it updates and a

805
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,940
couple of those packages just search for MacBook and the AUR it really it really is a great

806
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,600
experience it's yeah I would totally I'll just add that the enter grows installer even

807
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,240
it will do the system D boot stuff for you so it'll handle it right there you just need

808
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,160
to make sure you have as we talked about you need to make sure you have the Wi-Fi drivers

809
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,680
or yes USB Ethernet adapter and for more details on that just listen to episode 158 of your

810
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,680
unplugged program.

811
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:52,480
All right well enough about that I want to talk to Wimpy about LibreVault which promises

812
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:59,980
to bring what I love about SyncThing and what I love about BitTorrent Sync to a GPL3 licensed

813
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,440
open source project and we've talked about a little bit Wes has done some kicking of

814
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,080
the tires and like a gentleman he even did a screencast of it so we could talk about

815
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:17,880
it recently and I chewed on it I debated it and then Wimpy convinced me I've installed

816
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:22,480
on my machines and we're going to talk about LibreVault why it actually matters why it

817
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,040
could fundamentally I think change distribution of open source projects and how it could enhance

818
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:33,200
the Jupiter Broadcasting Network and how it could replace Dropbox or insert name of sync

819
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,920
application for you it's really cool it's really competitive and in fact it worked perfect

820
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:43,680
on a DigitalOcean Droplet DigitalOcean.com use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED all one word

821
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,360
lowercase you know I've really boiled the pitch the pitch for DigitalOcean down to one

822
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:54,520
thing if you need a computer that doesn't have a monitor most of the time DigitalOcean.com

823
00:56:54,520 --> 00:57:00,480
really if you want to just accomplish something on a computer that is super fast has really

824
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,400
great disk I O because it's all SSD and it's connected to the best internet connection

825
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,040
possible DigitalOcean.com they use KVM for the virtualizer running on top of Linux they

826
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,400
got SSD drives for the disk I O and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED you get a $10 credit

827
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,340
you can start in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans $5 a month for 512 megabytes

828
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:26,840
of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU but actually yeah they break it down hourly if you want

829
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,840
to just experiment with something you can spin up I like like West for the show notes

830
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:34,080
is like here's Chris's wiki Chris's wiki Chris's wiki now that reminded me of the fact that

831
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:40,520
for just one day I wanted Chris's wiki you remember that and instead of installing all

832
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:45,560
of that crud and pulling down all of those dependencies on my laptop and and honestly

833
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,940
doing it over on my vi connection I just spun up a DigitalOcean droplet and within about

834
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:54,080
two minutes I decided no good destroyed the droplet I don't even know how I don't even

835
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:58,160
know what I paid for that because they charge at an incredible price when you do it hourly

836
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,800
if you've got something you want to host for yourself to be fast that is really not like

837
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,040
something you want to share with the world DigitalOcean has private networking where

838
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,480
your DigitalOcean droplets can talk amongst each other that isn't over the internet which

839
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,920
is a really nice feature they have data centers in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam

840
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:22,440
London Toronto Germany and India their interface though oh man back in the day when Angela

841
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,760
and I one of the things for the consulting company that we worked for was they did VMware

842
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:33,320
hosted machines remember like remember how we sold hosted solutions yes to manage that

843
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:40,200
I had to run a virtual machine that ran Windows that then ran the VMware ESX management consoles

844
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:46,200
just so I could manage the Linux machines inside our VMware infrastructure and it was

845
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,960
god-awful slow yeah very convoluted DigitalOcean changes all of it I mean it's not just a good

846
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:57,360
UI for a desktop application it's a freaking good UI period for a web app for a for a native

847
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,040
app don't matter DigitalOcean's got the best UI I've seen to manage this ever then you

848
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,800
combine that with a great straightforward API you can build applications around it or

849
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,160
you can take advantage of cool open source code already committed check it out it's really

850
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:16,680
straightforward DigitalOcean.com just use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED big thank you DigitalOcean

851

for sponsoring the unplug program and by the way check out their block storage that's the

852
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:25,400
hotness right now they've got the ability now to add storage as you need it at the block

853
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:33,360
level up to 16 terabytes all backed by SSDs wow yeah isn't that nice DigitalOcean.com

854
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:37,360

00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,320
get a ten dollar dollar dollar credit over at DigitalOcean.com thanks for sponsoring

856
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:49,680
the unplug program so LibreVault is promising to fill a very necessary hole in the open

857
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,000
source sync ecosystem and I kind of wanted to open it up to Wimpy to tell me about his

858
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,400
experiments with LibreVault because honestly you're the one that's really got me looking

859
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:06,080
at this again and again Wimpy okay well it's early days it is so in fact it's so early

860
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:12,720
days that I think it's only packaged for Arch and Ubuntu at this point right possibly it's

861
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:20,880
definitely packaged for Ubuntu I've seen it in the AUR I've seen some discussion about

862
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,920
the developer making static builds at some point so that we can run it wherever yeah

863
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:32,200
if you want to install from the AUR you first have to have qt5-tools installed and then

864
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:36,560
it'll build properly but yes it is an AUR so leave a comment in the AUR for the package

865
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:42,040
maintain this they can fix that that's that's what needs to be done there and the project

866
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:48,240
the project been cooking for about a year now but I only became aware of it about two

867
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:57,520
weeks or so ago and like you Chris I was really smitten with the bit sync workflow that key

868
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:04,160
exchange mechanism worked really well for what I wanted to do and I've never really

869
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:10,620
been satisfied with anything else that I've tried to replace bit sync with until this

870
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:17,440
so what I've got running at the moment is a very small setup but on one of my desktop

871
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:26,880
machines I have LibreVault with the GUI version running and I have a folder of stuff in a

872
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:34,120
synchronized folder and then I've got two Ubuntu servers that are in two different geographic

873
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:42,900
locations and I just have the LibreVault daemon installed on those and that comes with a system

874
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:51,240
D unit which you can run either at the global system level or you can allocate to an individual

875
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:57,960
user or many users so I'm using it on a per user basis oh nice and so and that's a so

876
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:05,560
you start the system D service as that specific user yes so in this case you just sudo system

877
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:15,880
CTL enable user at oh yeah yeah yeah and that was the business and then from the command

878
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:23,320
line there's a couple of utilities you can run LibreVault daemon gen config which builds

879
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:29,440
the boilerplate configuration file and pulls some details from your specific system like

880
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:37,940
hostname to give it the identifier for that node you can derive the C type key so those

881
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:44,860
read only keys or the shareable read write keys rather than just the master key using

882
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:53,120
gen key and then it just has a JSON file for the folder configuration so you can just copy

883
01:02:53,120 --> 01:03:03,040
paste your JSON folders.json from one box to the other and when you then start the daemon

884
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:08,680
running it just synchronizes and I've got those three machines running now and I've

885
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:14,400
just been poking at it and lobbing large files in and making lots of rapid changes to text

886
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,260
files in three locations at the same time to see how it handles conflicts and things

887
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:23,200
like that and so far so good.

888
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,700
I want to address a couple of things and maybe somebody in the audience might be listening

889
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:33,320
and thinking why does something like this matter so I want to touch on two things first

890
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,060
of all and I want to come back to this one with wimpy I think it could be the next open

891
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:44,760
source CDN but first of all when you have something like this working what you accomplish

892
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:50,000
is almost it's like a transparent network file system and once it's all set up and it's

893
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,440
in that set it and forget it mode you have any arbitrary folder that you choose on your

894
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:01,340
system synced across all your devices and that's huge you make a change in one directory

895
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:08,280
and it immediately is available on all your other machines and to give you this is a very

896
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:13,880
maybe off example but the current example for me is no man's sky the configuration folder

897
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:18,760
I just want that configuration folder synced across many machines in the Dropbox world

898
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:23,880
to accomplish that I do a sim link and I move the actual folder into my Dropbox and then

899
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:29,360
I sim link in the in the configuration folder that folder and then I had that I kind of

900
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:34,000
trick I trick no man's sky into thinking it's accessing the folder when in reality it's

901
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,960
hitting a sim link and going to my Dropbox but with things like LibreVault I could choose

902
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:44,500
any arbitrary directory on my file system to sync and that becomes to be that gets huge

903
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:48,200
that's just great for just one to one users you don't have to share it with them with

904
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:53,560
many people super handy and and also one of the other things before we get to the open

905
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:57,320
source CDN is one of the advantages has over something like Dropbox and I think this will

906
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:03,520
resonate with you Angela is there's no centralized storage it's just whatever space you have

907
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,440
on your hard drive so you don't have to worry about getting 20 gigs and 30 gigs or buying

908
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:13,120
the one terabyte package like we do with Dropbox you just everybody syncs and it's just synced

909
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,160
amongst your computers and whatever space you have that's the space you get there's

910
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:23,120
no limits that's extremely compelling especially for something like unfiltered which is ridiculous

911
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:28,640
but lastly it kind of and I don't know about LibreVault maybe wimpy you know better but

912
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:37,100
it sort of has it's sort of the bit torrent sync philosophy brought to a GPL 3 application

913
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:41,480
that's not going to get shut down it's not going to get put behind a paywall and it allows

914
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:47,600
the distribution of files in a way that is truly truly unique because like a torrent

915
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:52,280
everybody who participates in the sync also becomes part of the distribution network and

916
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:57,400
it is therefore its own built-in CDN and I'm wondering are you thinking about how to use

917
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:02,260
this in a way that because it's a GPL because that means a lot of Linux users might eventually

918
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:07,440
one day just have it in their damn repo could this be a way to distribute to distribute

919
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,760
project images or a large files to a user base what do you think absolutely and that's

920
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:18,800
one of the reasons why I'm looking at it so looking out into the future what I would like

921
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:28,120
to do is list LibreVault in the Ubuntu mate software boutique so it's a one-click install

922
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:34,960
yes and then provide so a new feature in the current build of LibreVault is links so it

923
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:43,640
understands that this URI construct is a link to a LibreVault key you can click on that

924
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:51,020
it will embed it in the application and that way you can then or I can then make available

925
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:57,960
images for Ubuntu mate for the various architectures available oh yeah people can just click on

926
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:04,160
those and sync them when a new version is available they automatically get the new version

927
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:14,400
and all of the people that are carrying that LibreVault key are part of the collective

928
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:19,480
that are synchronizing and sharing and part of the peer-to-peer network that is making

929
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:24,560
those images available and it is torrent under the hood if you actually go and look at the

930
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:33,200
LibreVault config file you will see well-known torrent trackers as the trackers that are

931
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:41,440
used to actually broker the connections between your installations very good you and because

932
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:47,220
it's torrent trackers of course you could run your own torrent tracker and just change

933
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:53,720
your config to point your own tracker and you could keep all of your tracking off the

934
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:58,080
public trackers as well you know you could just use your own torrent tracker.

935
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:02,780
So Wes you kind of been kicking the tires for us you've been our guinea pig I've also

936
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:06,780
installed on my machine and Rekai was the guy that had to fall on the sword and even

937
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:13,120
try installing on Windows Wes what were your take away from it?

938
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:16,640
You know I mean it is definitely early days but I was I was also impressed I do think

939
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,440
this you know the just be able to give it a link of a key and then especially having

940
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:26,040
the built-in you know write only read only that kind of access control yeah really easy

941
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:31,040
right there I'm excited to play more with it you know I haven't replaced my sync thing

942
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:36,040
needs yet but I'm thinking it's on the list of projects to see it's just so it seems so

943
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,120
easy to configure and it seems like a good scale very nicely.

944
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:43,560
I'll tell you a story that made me realize how important something like sync thing or

945
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:48,680
LibreVault is and I'm I'll be honest I'm a little more excited about LibreVault and

946
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:55,040
Janai you know we've got three kids and there's there's new movies that we discover individually

947
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,880
that the kids just absolutely love and if I wanted to back up one of those movies and

948
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,200
share it with her so that way when they're at home they could watch that same movie there's

949
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:10,640
no or I could yeah right don't forget about me yeah up there was there was actually recently

950
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:16,360
like when Zootopia came out that was exactly the situation and I had it I had backed it

951
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:20,120
up I had a copy of it but I had it sitting on a hard drive and when the kids went home

952
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:24,560
they couldn't watch Zootopia and it would be really really nice if there was a piece

953
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,800
of software I could use to just send you that file and didn't go through some corporate

954
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:34,600
server because a friend of ours you and I both know them you know there was a file they

955
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,480
wanted and so their friend put it up on a Dropbox account and sent them the link it's

956
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,600
it here go grab it and Dropbox shut down their whole account just completely terminated the

957
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:49,600
account shut it down you're banned wow wow yeah and and it's that's ridiculous that you

958
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,120
know if I go out and I buy Zootopia for 40 freaking bucks or 30 bucks or 20 bucks from

959
01:09:54,120 --> 01:10:01,640
Costco and I use make MKV to back it up and I and I that's my copy and I want my children

960
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,920
to be able to watch it I should have it there should be a way for me to be able to easily

961
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,800
share those files with you and that's what Lee I think even if you're just an individual

962
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:14,200
Lee Bravevault promises that but you know in the term for Jupiter broadcasting we distribute

963
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:19,400
the unfiltered show notes and all of the clips that we play via BitTorrent Sync right now

964
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,240
and this is I think absolutely where we're going to migrate to Lee Bravevault looks like

965
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:27,800
the perfect replacement for BitTorrent Sync for us and if you're not familiar with BitTorrent

966
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,400
Sync it's kind of it needs to be replaced it's it's kind of things have gone south

967
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:38,000
let's just put it that way both Wimby and I are we're done we're done so like for

968
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:45,360
your for your issue is Zootopia with something like a Plex or MB work yeah you know that's

969
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:51,020
generally what we use but of course on my end I'm connected to a MiFi yeah yeah so it's

970
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:55,600
not like the kids are gonna very easily stream it from from my hard drive so it'd really

971
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,080
be best for them to have a local copy that just showed up in the kids movie folder if

972
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:03,440
I could just have a if we just had on both our servers we had two kids movie directories

973
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,920
and every time I put a file in there it showed up on both our servers it's the perfect solution

974
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:13,760
so that's that's my hope eventually but that all of course Ionic Badger and I were talking

975
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,080
about it before the show all pulls into kind of pulls into like this ultimate multimedia

976
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,800
server setup Ionic I know you and I are both excited about a media service have you solved

977
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:29,160
this moving files between multiple houses problem by chance he's oh Ionic left ironic

978
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:33,000
oh ironic that's why probably because I called him wrong I called him by the wrong name that's

979
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
fine yeah our sink is also how we actually do it now so it's just manual and it's painful

980
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,720
and LibreSync I think eventually will replace Dropbox Pro for us as a company we have made

981
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:49,520
the financial decision to buy a Dropbox Pro every year and go ahead and do that again

982
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:58,520
okay fine turn the camera on she won't do it and we're not happy so so you've talked

983
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:04,360
about you know wanting to sort of fund open source I'm I'm putting you on the spot a little

984
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:09,800
bit here by the way I don't mind so good man you know look at look at what you're spending

985
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:18,560
on Dropbox Pro and turn that into monthly payments and consider contacting the author

986
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:28,440
of LibreVault and for a year making donations to the project and marking the issues because

987
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:34,440
he's right sort of the issues on his github are kind of a roadmap of improvements and

988
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:39,480
sort of direct him at the things you would most like to see implemented and see if you

989
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:48,320
can you know encourage the developer to focus his his efforts I think the first thing would

990
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:52,120
be to not limit it to five users you know at the base oh they don't have the LibreVault

991
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:57,080
doesn't have that yeah yeah that's huge that's an automatic yeah that by the way is a Dropbox

992
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:01,320
limitation so I think it's seven hundred eighty dollars a year to pay for Dropbox Pro is that

993
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:07,400
right yeah and so and from like an expensive standpoint how would we do that as a business

994
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:12,120
could we could we instead of paying for a service so when we pay for a service is that

995
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,560
a is that a type of write-off that's different than buying a physical good no so when we

996
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,120
pay eight hundred dollars for an internet service that's like buying eight hundred dollars

997
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:28,060
of something physical well well okay so if it's a if it's a physical thing there are

998
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:32,680
there's like an amortization right down process but right but they just raised it to like

999
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:38,480
fifteen hundred so no in the case of eight hundred it doesn't matter doesn't matter so

1000
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:43,120
could we as a business could we easily structure paying an open source project so it'd be about

1001
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:49,080
sixty five seventy bucks a month it'd be exactly sixty five dollars yeah I would rather pay

1002
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:54,000
monthly than get hit with this eight hundred dollars because we we we already have so many

1003
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,680
subscription services mm-hmm and it's just much easier to manage that especially like

1004
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:06,240
with cards that expire but so here's what I did is this is like what three weeks ago

1005
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:11,160
we renewed it and I think we we just we draw a line in the sand and say never again let

1006
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:14,920
me just let me just point out to that because yeah it's Dropbox professional we have five

1007
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:21,040
licenses I don't have access to my own company's Dropbox no it's because we need the producers

1008
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:27,200
in there dad I know so I am keeping all my all the artwork like for example I made the

1009
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:33,900
artwork for user error but just all the artwork for all the shows is stored in my Dropbox

1010
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:39,800
on my laptop right so all the assets all the assets and what we need to do is sort of reorganize

1011
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,960
all of it in some sort of Libre vault folder structure but the problem really has been

1012
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:49,160
in the past is own cloud and and sync thing have not been reliable we've tried them yeah

1013
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:53,040
we did I still have on cloud I need to get that off yeah well it's it's like it's there

1014
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:58,460
but it's only for a couple of things and the problem is is in a media production business

1015
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:02,920
you just end up with this crazy amount of data I tried I was gonna get a I was gonna

1016
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:10,320
get an estimate for the show again but the last time I checked we have over 600 gigabytes

1017
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:16,400
of files just for one show wow that we sync around so you know like you really got to

1018
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,640
have a bulletproof product to move all that stuff around and the one thing I will give

1019
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:26,380
Dropbox is in combination with their selective sync and their web client it has been very

1020
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:31,000
very very bulletproof and there are literally times where I make a change and then I walk

1021
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,200
downstairs and I need to put it on the air within 35 seconds and if it's not there it's

1022
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:42,900
that doesn't work for me that's just the reality of a live production and Dropbox always always

1023
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:48,160
meets that deadline so LibreVault is not going to testing yeah yeah it will need testing

1024
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:53,280
but of course the advantage of LibreVault is it's based on bit torrent technology so

1025
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:59,840
it's syncing blocks not files yeah it doesn't care about files it's just hashes and blocks

1026
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:05,680
and and that's important because because it handles all of the integrity checking for

1027
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:10,640
you and small changes at the block level could be synced instead of the entire file exactly

1028
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:16,920
so yeah yeah that's that is a great point Wimpy so you know I am really I'm really excited

1029
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,880
to see LibreVault when do you do you feel Wimpy it's worth addressing that the primary

1030
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:27,560
authors I almost even don't want to say this but I know I know some people listening will

1031
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:31,200
be concerned that the primary author is Russian do you does that concern you at all that your

1032
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:36,240
file syncing solution okay that doesn't bother me doesn't bother doesn't doesn't bother me

1033
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:40,920
in the slightest no some of the smartest people I've worked with in the past were from Russia

1034
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,920
so yep exactly the same for me and it's a good reason to have a you know open source

1035
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:54,000
encrypted supported file sharing great point great point and the the LibreVault blog is

1036
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,440
very instructional there's a couple of posts there about the detailed makeup of the config

1037
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:06,920
file so the skeleton config files it makes are really bare bones don't expose all of

1038
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:12,000
the configuration options but there are blog posts to describe all of that in great detail

1039
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:18,640
and there are also some blog posts there that talk about the the crypto libraries that are

1040
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:24,340
used and the other alternatives that might exist and you know talking about maybe changing

1041
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:30,160
some of the underlying technologies because they're more optimized so along with the code

1042
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:35,720
being open and you can go and look at it and inspect it there's also some open dialogue

1043
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:41,480
through the blog as well I like that a lot and I I feel at the end of the day I feel

1044
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:46,180
a little reassured this gpl3 it's not well we might one day open source it like bit torrent

1045
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:50,200
sync kind of insinuated at the beginning this is just legitimately at the very beginning

1046
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:56,720
gpl3 here it all is here's the goal yeah yeah and I think that is also very and there's

1047
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:00,680
about half a dozen other libraries that it's built on top of as well that are all open

1048
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:07,520
source and they're all linked in the github now repository um wimpy yeah if it blows

1049
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,760
up in your face and ruins everything will you come back and tell us about it I will

1050
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:17,040
at the moment I'm not moving anything around that's critical but what I'm working towards

1051
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:23,560
I've spoken about it before so I'll be brief I have this roaming profile that I have synchronized

1052
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:29,480
everywhere and I'm working to building up confidence in libre vault so it can take over

1053
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:34,840
that and that is critical to everything I do so when I build up enough confidence to

1054
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:41,320
make that switch it's passed some sort of credibility testing and then if it doesn't

1055
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:46,680
screw those things up then as far as I'm concerned it's good to go wow you know I'll let you

1056
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:52,320
know but I can't wait to hear that that's my dream that is my that is my dream that

1057
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:57,360
I I work on a machine here and I go home and everything's the same so that's yeah whoa

1058
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,560
and I have I have that now and I've had to change the sync solutions along the ways the

1059
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:10,400
best solution I had was bit sync and this is really a workflow drop in replacement for

1060
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:19,160
bit sync wow yeah exactly that's really oh boy I you know what after you've been running

1061
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:24,000
a libre vault I say I don't know I don't know what that I don't know what the threshold

1062
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,760
is wimpy but after you feel like it's like it's it's meet they this is working for me

1063
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:35,040
threshold I would love to hear I would love to hear your full setup on that okay all right

1064
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,760
well give me a few weeks because it's going to take a while for me to stress test it a

1065
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:42,960
bit and build up enough confidence that I want to make the switch to something I oh

1066
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:48,380
boy do I understand I think pretty soon you'll see us experimenting probably with the unfilter

1067
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:53,840
show on just because the unfilter audience it's a great it's a great platform because

1068
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,900
we have a backup copy of all the clips so if there was any huge data corruption we can

1069
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:02,200
recover and it's a huge amount of data and it's a bunch of people to sync so it's like

1070
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:07,760
this perfect scenario for testing so I bet yeah I bet you'll hear more so my plan is

1071
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:16,740
to switch over to handling my profile exclusively but then have a job on my main machine which

1072
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:25,920
makes an r-sync snapshot of my profile like every hour so if it totally screws it up I've

1073
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,280
got a recovery point you know so that's my that's my sort of harness that I've planned

1074
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:36,560
for this so I'm not going to just chuck all of my stuff at it and hope it works I do have

1075
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:42,680
a a recovery point as well yeah it's in my my plan is also to do a phased approach of

1076
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:46,720
more and more critical things starting with things that I absolutely have multiple copies

1077
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:53,560
of and then over time I will slowly move to that really precious data whatever that is

1078
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:58,480
so great I'm all in you convince me yeah really this little process of shaving revolution I

1079
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:04,360
would love to hear it not even a gradual let's just all in you know what mr. tunnel you are

1080
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:09,440
bold and I hope you come back and report to us because honestly I think it's going to

1081
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:14,760
be if we get there and it gets wide enough adoption it could be a real fantastic way

1082
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:20,800
for enthusiasts to get latest versions of ISO images or packages or whatever because

1083
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:27,020
it's not only not only are you the CDN by participating in LibreSync or LibreVault sorry

1084
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:32,920
but you are also you are also fundamentally part of the RSS feed part of the distribution

1085
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:37,300
swarm part of the notification network it's all of that built into one thing and I love

1086
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:42,880
it so LibreVault it's super early days you can hear from all of us here we're not really

1087
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,460
quite ready to trust our most important data to it but it's definitely something we're

1088
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:52,940
checking out and we'll be following up on future editions of the show now I got to tell

1089
01:21:52,940 --> 01:22:02,620
you about my experiences with Android N I believe it's pronounced new gay new gar do

1090
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:08,060
get new get Android N and I'll tell you how that's gone and why I think I need to switch

1091
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:12,340
to Ubuntu touch as soon as possible but first I'm gonna tell you about our friends at Linux

1092
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:18,060
Academy go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug take advantage of the Linux Academy shows

1093
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:23,200
continuing sponsorship by the Linux Academy LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug go there to

1094
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:28,620
register your vote for one more episode you want 160 you hear it's a big number LinuxAcademy.com

1095
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:32,200
slash unplug is one way to do it but also it's a great opportunity for you to learn

1096
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:37,740
more about the Linux Academy platform the place to go really if you have any kind of

1097
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:42,060
little rough spots around Linux the technology stack that's based around it or you want to

1098
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:47,500
just put yourself in front of current technologies we were talking in fact speaking of user error

1099
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:52,300
with Noah about learning Python and Ruby it's a great example of where Linux Academy can

1100
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:55,540
help you bring you up to speed anything that might make you more money get the attention

1101
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:59,660
of your employer make that client a little more inclined to go with you or just challenge

1102
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:04,460
yourself they have courseware on the entire Linux platform and all of the cool technologies

1103
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:10,540
built on top of it self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux topic or really DevOps

1104
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:15,540
topic to like this they really rest in there they got Azure OpenStack AWS as well learning

1105
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:19,700
paths which are a series of courses and content planned by instructors for specific types

1106
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:23,820
of career tasks which I find to be particularly valuable the hands-on experience if you're

1107
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:29,520
a little test anxious like I am I mean I got to tell you I've never been a good cert passer

1108
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:34,860
because I just get all worked up about these fake scenarios that's why hands-on experience

1109
01:23:34,860 --> 01:23:38,620
with the Linux Academy labs really gives me the experience to move forward like I'm ready

1110
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:44,740
I've done it I've actually pushed the buttons that's super nice they have practice exams

1111
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:48,380
and quizzes they have availability planners you can plug in how much time you have even

1112
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:52,980
if you're super busy you got three kids in a podcast network trust me you can find time

1113
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:57,740
at Linux Academy Linux Academy.com slash unplug with nuggets you can go into just deep dives

1114
01:23:57,740 --> 01:24:01,600
in specific areas they got search too if you want to go in for the search you just going

1115

01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:14,380
to help you whenever you need that mobile experience lab service that spin up on-demand

1118
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:19,340
and cert training that is above and beyond anything you've ever possibly thought of

1119
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:25,540
I really have to recommend Linux Academy at Linux Academy.com slash unplug go check them

1125
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:56,180
actually achieve it I can never spend the time I can break it down individually into

1126
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:59,780
chunks of time that I can wrap my head around and actually accomplish and that's what I

1127
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:08,920
love about it Linux Academy thanks for sponsoring alright so this week is the big week Android

1128
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:13,820
N hit our faces and of course everybody's got the write-up Android Authority Android

1129
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:18,860
police ours Technica everybody's got their write-up on Android N it's good everybody

1130
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:23,500
loves the new Doze features have been improved of course the multi window tasking all that

1131
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:28,720
stuff the notifications all good we talked about some of it on tech talk today and I've

1132
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,920
been running on the 6p I think it's it's it's definitely an improvement over and

1133
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:38,060
Marshmallow but I some of my primary issues that plagued me with Marshmallow continue

1134
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:46,860
to plague me with Android N and that is Doze kills Bluetooth audio I'm sitting there I'm

1135
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:56,180
driving I'm 30 I'm 20 minutes into my drive say all of a sudden I start get cut every

1136
01:25:56,180 --> 01:26:02,740
podcast what's that yeah Doze is the new Android feature they launched in Marshmallow and then

1137
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:08,820
doubled down in Nougat and that is depending on like if the phone's upside down face down

1138
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:14,140
or if you're walking or if it's like midnight there's all these conditions that Android

1139
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:18,980
is taking into account and if it thinks it's you're very unlikely to be using your phone

1140
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:25,660
at this time it goes down yeah yeah wow which has really improved the battery life you'd

1141
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:30,620
think they would have fine-tuned that for podcasting and audio and Pandora like if it

1142
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:35,940
sucks it just sucks because I'm sitting there listening actually you know it's funny it's

1143
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:41,100
it you know who it you know who it affects the most of everybody I know wimpy wimpy sitting

1144
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:45,260
there making a great point on the Ubuntu podcast and all of a sudden every other word he says

1145
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:50,660
starts getting dropped out and I'm not because because you know he speaks at a gentleman's

1146
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:55,380
pace like I don't like is he like abbreviating his speech like at first I'm like I start

1147
01:26:55,380 --> 01:27:01,020
losing track of the conversation and then I realize it's dropping every few words from

1148
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:06,180
the Ubuntu podcast this is just as I'm driving in today and I'm like what the hell is this

1149
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:10,780
and this is the same problem I have with marshmallows ever since does was introduced and I you know

1150
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:15,700
marshmallow seems to be good Nougat seems to be even better but I think it's just it's

1151
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:22,060
just time the Chris gets off of Android and so is there no way to disable it yeah I don't

1152
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:27,100
know like I think I could go in and say like whenever this application is running don't

1153
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:32,300
save battery life but Android has such crappy battery life I was gonna say is it even saving

1154
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:37,420
you that much battery no it does okay it is effective yeah yeah it does it mean I can

1155
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:42,260
I can now go like two days without charging my phone if I push it which is oh that's big

1156
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:48,940
whoa I heard of an Android I know but it kills the Bluetooth audio and so I have been from

1157
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:57,100
a distance looking at different options I won't lie iOS feels very attractive because

1158
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:02,600
I've been there before and I know that I get what I get and I don't complain you know you

1159
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:07,660
just get what you get let me ask you're saying you're specifically saying Bluetooth yeah

1160
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:13,380
if you had headphones plugged in that's what I do but then I lose all the controls well

1161
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:17,200
no I don't have that problem with headphone jack when I that's what I use I got a little

1162
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:21,820
like retractable headphone cable and I use the aux in but then I lose all of the controls

1163
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:26,860
on my steering wheel so I don't get like skip ahead like or any or skip back or falling

1164
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:31,580
I like I lose all of the controls on my steering wheel it which you know not a big deal so

1165
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:34,940
I just do the headphone jack and that's what I've been doing for months and months actually

1166
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:41,020
but it has kind of got me going through my head like I think I'm just I don't like the

1167
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:45,740
way it performs I don't really enjoy some of the interface elements and I don't really

1168
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:50,940
like the fact that they are tracking me like it is like a sensor in my pocket what about

1169
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:57,420
turning on like isn't there a way to make the screen not turn off there are a few apps

1170
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:03,900
I could use like force it to stay yeah I think I could actually like I think I could exclude

1171
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:09,300
pocket casts from all those power management but then at the same time I'm while I'm driving

1172
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:12,820
I'll be burning through my battery right I know yeah so it's not like does it does it

1173
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:18,260
happen when you charge in the car as well yeah the the the dropouts do yeah in fact

1174
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:24,700
West it almost seems like it happens faster which is oh wow yeah yeah so I'm not gonna

1175
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:29,560
lie I've been looking I've been looking at the MX4 I've been looking I've been looking

1176
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:34,820
at the one plus and there's this guy out there who's been giving me a hard time about it

1177
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:42,440
for weeks and weeks and I I won't name names but wimpy you've recently switched you've

1178
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:45,700
recently switched to Ubuntu touch I think you've been on for a couple of weeks and I

1179
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:50,620
know that podcasts are a big part of your workflow and and all that I'd be I would really

1180
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:54,540
love to hear thoughts because I know you and I have reflected on how Android doesn't quite

1181
01:29:54,540 --> 01:30:00,820
fit for us and we Ubuntu touch is sort of the perfect solution because every now and

1182
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:05,900
then we just want something a little extra we like the flexibility of the platform we

1183
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:10,500
know some of the folks behind it and it's an alternative to Android that is functional

1184
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,700
and I and you've been actually living in it for a couple of weeks you've got multiple

1185
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:18,540
devices I'd love to pick your head just go in there sort of like mind-meld style and

1186
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:25,580
tell me what's it like to live as wimpy with an Ubuntu touch device okay um it took some

1187
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:37,060
weeks of research to figure out what the apps on Ubuntu for devices were that could replace

1188
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:43,440
or be alternatives or equivalents to what I was used to on Android yeah I bet and by

1189
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:48,460
and large I've been able to find replacements for that and where it gets a little bit icky

1190
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:55,500
is things like there are four or five different versions of Google Plus for example for Ubuntu

1191
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:01,060
touch and are they all kind of repackaged versions of the web app and sort of kind of

1192
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:06,420
there that so what you're starting to see now is people that are starting to use more

1193
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:15,960
of the facilities of QML around the web wrapper to introduce more features into what is essentially

1194
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:21,860
a web wrapped version but also doing clever things like using different agent strings

1195
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:29,860
in that web wrapper to expose modern versions of the Google Plus UI right so what I've what

1196
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:34,540
I've been doing is as I've been trying out the several different versions of Google Plus

1197
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:42,140
for example is rating each of them based on my personal requirements so that the one that

1198
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:48,400
I think is best gets the most stars and the others get diminishing star levels with my

1199
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:53,660
rationale as to why they're not as good as the other option so I've gone through that

1200
01:31:53,660 --> 01:32:00,820
process and for things like Twitter and Facebook and Gmail and Google Plus and you know all

1201
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:05,300
of the stuff you need to do obviously I don't have a WhatsApp problem because all of my

1202
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:12,580
family are on Telegram so I don't have that big you know stopping block that is in front

1203
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:21,620
of many people I have a completely functional experience I've got a few gaps in what I need

1204
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:32,220
and I've I've decided at the outset I would find the apps that best met my requirements

1205
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:35,860
and for example where there where there's an app that isn't quite good enough instead

1206
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:43,300
of publishing a duplicate app I would reach out to the developer and work with them to

1207
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:49,020
improve the existing app that's in the store rather than create even more versions of the

1208
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:53,900
same thing because I don't think that's very helpful right so I've reached out to the author

1209
01:32:53,900 --> 01:33:00,260
of the Pocket Casts app and we're going to work together to make a slightly refined refined

1210
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:08,100
version of Pocket Casts for Ubuntu Touch now how how much is it actually targeted for Ubuntu

1211
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:17,000
Touch versus a modified repackage of the web version so the current version of Pocket Casts

1212
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:25,140
is just a wrapped version of the website which is not bad actually which is very good and

1213
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:32,060
the only drawback to that is that it was created about a year ago so it doesn't have the keep

1214
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:37,940
the screen on keep the player moving so as the screen blanks the podcast stops so I've

1215
01:33:37,940 --> 01:33:42,580
contacted the author and said these are the improvements I would like to make and we're

1216
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:48,060
going to work on that and produce a refined version that you know works properly and because

1217
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:57,500
I'm a Pocket Casts user at the moment it's easier for me to use that than try and move

1218
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:05,500
to Podbird which is a native podcasting app for Ubuntu for Devices and what I need to

1219
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:11,180
do there is send some feedback to the developers of Podbird to say these are the features that

1220
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:19,100
I feel need adding refining or improving in order for the native you know Podbird application

1221
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:26,500
to be you know viable because listening to podcasts on my phone is very important to

1222
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:32,340
me so full disclosure right now all of those things I said I can do on my MX4 the one thing

1223
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:39,260
I don't do is listen to podcasts I still have an Android phone which I keep in the car and

1224
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:45,940
I'm driving to and from work it is that device that is connecting over Bluetooth to the car

1225
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:53,100
audio system to play the podcasts and that's for two reasons one I've got a podcast player

1226
01:34:53,100 --> 01:35:00,660
that works and two it's got Bluetooth that compare with the car and I've only got one

1227
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:05,940
out of the many Ubuntu touch devices I've got there is only one that compare with the

1228
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:12,380
car and what's curious about that is a few months ago they could all pair with the car

1229
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:16,580
and now only one of them can so there's been some sort of regression there and I haven't

1230
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:23,060
had the opportunity to dig around and identify what's going on but you know there are rough

1231
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:31,480
edges but I don't have Android running anymore about my person on a day to day basis that's

1232
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:38,780
very cool and I'm able to do all of the things that I could do before with a few caveats

1233
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:44,020
so I'm going to one of the little projects I want to work on is write an app for buffer

1234
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:49,660
because that's something I used to use quite extensively on Android and I think that that

1235
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:57,060
can be neatly created using the Ubuntu framework it shouldn't be too complicated and it should

1236
01:35:57,060 --> 01:36:03,780
provide a totally analog experience cool you know I I think this is this is the perfect

1237
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:10,720
moment because and she's here and she has without equivocation it rejected basically

1238
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:15,620
everything iCloud she still plugs her phone in over a USB cable to sync all the stuff

1239
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:19,260
over her photos her music and it's a huge part of her workflow and it's she doesn't

1240
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:23,800
you know she doesn't want to auto update or auto upload her photos to iCloud she doesn't

1241
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:28,420
want to sync her music through Apple music nope and and you're looking at this and you're

1242
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:34,300
like I be honest do you feel like you're like on borrowed time with that platform to do

1243
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:39,340
you yeah and and when when I hear wimpy talk about it I what I think about for somebody

1244
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:44,300
like you is even if like everything else doesn't apply about the freedom or the or the platform

1245
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:49,480
or or how they design it the fact that you could maybe find a workflow that you feel

1246
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:55,560
comfortable with when the other platforms are kind of forcing yeah it's kind of appealing

1247
01:36:55,560 --> 01:37:01,100
right yeah and it's early days still but uh you know I'll uh I'll uh I'll let you know

1248
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:06,340
when when it's ready to switch yeah there's some fixes coming in OTA 13 that I think are

1249
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:13,180
really really interesting so there seems to be a lot of focus on refining what's there

1250
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:20,860
at the moment and the last since OTA 10 it's really come on a long way so OTA 9 I still

1251
01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:28,140
wasn't convinced I could actually use it as a day-to-day device from OTA 10 I could because

1252
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:34,140
in OTA 10 I could copy and paste between applications for example so you know that was three or

1253
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:39,040
four months ago not being able to do that prior to then was really a I can't use this

1254
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:44,220
day-to-day so that was that was what you might call a game changer yeah so you know I've

1255
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:49,020
got two apps in the Ubuntu touch store at the moment and one of which is um last pass

1256
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:56,720
mobile it's by no means as comprehensive as the last pass application on android but it

1257
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:02,700
does mean that when I need to log into things I can open up last pass bring up the password

1258
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:07,060
highlight it copy it and then paste it into the thing that I want to authenticate with

1259
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:12,980
right which I couldn't do four months ago so you know the fact that that's possible

1260
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:18,120
it is just that that was really that was the moment where I thought right I really need

1261
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:22,960
to investigate this more seriously because I could make this work for me now I've I've

1262
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:29,220
always felt like the place that would be the most successful for me would be on the tablet

1263
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:34,500
first and then the phone so I want to get to that I also want to mention mini max he

1264
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:39,140
has a question for you wimpy all of that but first before we go any further I got to say

1265
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:43,080
thank you to Ange for stopping by she's got to run to go pick up the kiddos but Ange thank

1266
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:47,980
you for stopping by yeah thanks for having me keeping us grounded wonderful to have you

1267
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:51,500
and all the love I know and you can hear more from Ange in tech talk today go listen to

1268
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:55,500
this week's episode or boy this week we had a Kickstarter of the week that is gonna sit

1269
01:38:55,500 --> 01:39:00,500
with me for a while it's gonna sit with me I get it get it yeah yeah all right wow thank

1270
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:06,300
you for being here Ange yep all right so wimpy it's it's not just the phone I mean I know

1271
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:10,900
the MX4 is your daily driver correct but you're also trying the tablet experience have you

1272
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:19,300
noticed be honest wimpy does it work better as a tablet um does it work better as a tablet

1273
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:24,720
it feels like the it feels like that interface that the whole unity 8 interface is begging

1274
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:29,860
for a tablet UI it just it you know a little extra real estate but still mobile seems like

1275
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:36,580
the perfect combo like maybe something on the BQ no I don't know I mean I I use I have

1276
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:41,480
used you know when I was using Android I used the phone and the tablets differently and

1277
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:48,780
I continue to use the phone and the tablet differently so I've got a BQM 10 tablet and

1278
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:57,560
I also have a Nexus 7 that's also running ok Ubuntu touch the BQM 10 I'm mostly experimenting

1279
01:39:57,560 --> 01:40:06,700
with that as I could this be a laptop replacement yeah exactly and the recent advancements with

1280
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:13,900
Libertine make that very plausible now because it's now possible if you've got a little bit

1281
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:22,500
of knowledge about how to you know exercise come up the command line utilities you can

1282
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:29,940
create containers of your favorite legacy X application and run them containers on my

1283
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:36,900
tablet yeah so and there's a there's a nice guide that somebody wrote recently I'll get

1284
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:44,180
a link in a moment that explains how Libertine is used to create containers of your app so

1285
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:53,260
for example creating a container of mumble is very straightforward or audacity or gimp

1286
01:40:53,260 --> 01:41:01,020
or whatever it might be that you want to run on your tablet so that you can have a more

1287
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:08,860
desktop like productivity experience actually create something on on your tablet oh yeah

1288
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:13,220
it will it will effectively make the container that runs that app with a launcher so you

1289
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:21,780
can just start gimp or audacity or mumble or whatever with icons you know that so that's

1290
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:27,540
that's really very interesting the Nexus 7 is kind of my device that I use just for sort

1291
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:32,700
of browsing and looking at stuff casually in the evenings so you know when I'm sitting

1292
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:38,860
in the front room or cooking sure that's that's the device that I have to hand because it's

1293
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:47,420
more convenient to use than a phone and it's easier to you know look at and yeah for for

1294
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:53,180
that sort of stuff you know looking at YouTube catching up on podcasts dealing with email

1295
01:41:53,180 --> 01:42:00,060
and telegrams and all of the rest of it it all works just fine on the tablet and and

1296
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:06,660
phone it certainly works better the MX4 is a slightly bigger screen than the Nexus 4

1297
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:13,780
which I was using before and the bqe5 and certainly having a bigger screen is favorable

1298
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:20,540
it's certainly much easier to use with a larger screen sure huh you know I I know it's just

1299
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:25,460
I can't help but think of myself but I picture a day when I could actually publish something

1300
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:30,360
like user error completely from the tablet that would be awesome right now Wes what would

1301
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,600
it take for you to be able to use something for work like something that could actually

1302
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:39,260
get your day-to-day job done what do you need from a tablet and do you have a tablet today

1303
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:43,920
you know not really there there is a iPad I think it's like a couple generations old

1304
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,900
by now that kind of floats around the house purely for consumption but it really doesn't

1305
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:53,100
see very much use I think for work you know that that Liberty and stuff that would go

1306
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:57,740
a long way sure I think also that you know last week we're talking about the improvements

1307
01:42:57,740 --> 01:43:01,940
to the terminal I think that would also go a long way if I could have a reasonable you

1308
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:07,660
know a reasonable experience using thumb desktop apps and having you know SSH and just a friendly

1309
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:11,460
Linux environment right by my side I'd be willing to cut it some slack in other yeah

1310
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:18,220
me too me too exactly and I and I don't think that is it is I mean we can't deny this that's

1311
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:27,000
a niche that's an that is absolutely but it is an industry now and there is a lot of us

1312
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,860
men and women and in the hundreds of thousands that need to do that you think about every

1313
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:37,460
small business that has more than a hundred employees they have somebody that could qualify

1314
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:42,220
think of every large corporation I mean that is a massive massive amount of users that

1315
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:47,740
is absolutely worth targeting and it could just grow from there I you know I tried to

1316
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:55,660
buy the the BQ m10 when it went for sale I couldn't get it that the page was all kinds

1317
01:43:55,660 --> 01:44:01,700
of errors and it was just impossible and today I sit here with the Android and sick or I'm

1318
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:08,060
sorry the 6p and I think to myself I would love to be able to take what I would love

1319
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:13,140
to have the maybe it's maybe this is a 2018 thing but what I would love to have happen

1320
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:17,740
is sort of like I can download ISOs now for general PC hardware I would love for Ubuntu

1321
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:24,060
touch for a large range of great Android devices to be available and I and I realize that would

1322
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:30,660
take a bunch of community commitment and interaction and work but God dang it would it be cool

1323
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:37,500
if I could just go get the greatest and latest Nexus device and have a have a good solid

1324
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:43,540
you know bet that within two to three months of the next Nexus 2016 device coming out I

1325
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:47,700
could probably get an Ubuntu touch image for it and for the life of that device I could

1326
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:52,980
run it right and then that's all I really think it would take for me or and wimpy I

1327
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:57,540
know how you feel about this if I could get my hands on that MX5 hardware something that's

1328
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:02,420
a real flagship device how's performance Chris is stringent stand because I am a bit of a

1329
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:07,780
performance bigot wimpy so and you're on the MX4 I don't really know but my my rough understanding

1330
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:12,140
is it's somewhat equivalent to the Nexus 4 and that seems like it would be ancient no

1331
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:20,940
no no so I've got a Nexus 4 and the bqe5 okay this this MX4 is head and shoulders above

1332
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:25,540
those in terms of performance when that is running Ubuntu touch but yeah is that is that

1333
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:31,060
Ubuntu touch or is that is that the hardware because I might be basing my hardware requirements

1334
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:39,860
on potentially bloated and Android requirements okay so definitely so it's the hardware basically

1335
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:48,860
that makes it better there there are definitely improvements that could be made to Ubuntu

1336
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:58,300
touch to improve the performance and perceived responsiveness of some of the UI and I think

1337
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:03,580
talking to poppy you know there are some wet well understood things that need to happen

1338
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:08,060
and there are some technical challenges as to why they have been addressed yet so I think

1339
01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:13,260
that will come in due course but the better the hardware gets the better the experience

1340
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:19,480
get and the MX4 is significantly better than the Nexus 4 and the e5 and my understanding

1341
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:25,980
is that that this pales in comparison to the pro 5 which is rarer than hen's teeth now

1342
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:34,100
yeah and I I I really I was wanting to get and went on holiday around the time they were

1343
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:39,060
released and thought I'll get one when I get back and they were all sold out yeah and now

1344
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:43,420
you can't find them for that no money yeah yeah and if you want to load Android on that

1345
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:48,060
I mean if you want to get the one that has Android loaded on it it looks like that probably

1346
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:53,260
works for loading the initial image but there could be over-the-air update issues potentially

1347
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:57,660
so as best as I've been able to determine reading some of the guides that are available

1348
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:05,140
for that you can buy a pro 5 with the international firmware version of Android which is required

1349
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:10,020
because the Chinese versions you can't unlock the bootloader but the international versions

1350
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:19,580
you can so you have to have one with the international firmware you can then flash Ubuntu onto that

1351
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:25,260
pro 5 but so far what I've read and I have haven't researched it very carefully there

1352
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:31,880
seems to be some difficulty in flashing the Ubuntu recovery image onto that device which

1353
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:37,500
then means that the over-the-air updates right won't apply automatically you have to go

1354
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:43,580
into the recovery and extract those manually that kind of kills the fun so that's why you

1355
01:47:43,580 --> 01:47:50,220
haven't gone that route at the moment unless because it's they're quite expensive and I'm

1356
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:57,080
not prepared to risk that unless I'm fairly sure of some success yeah it's kind of how

1357
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:01,940
I feel too I just want to buy with Ubuntu pre-loaded and you were talking about you

1358
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:08,980
know other devices there's a website called ubports.com yeah it's one of the community

1359
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:16,060
members runs that site and that's crowdfunded and there's a list of devices there that can

1360
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:25,680
run Ubuntu touch at various stages of completion and if you want to see Ubuntu come to one

1361
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:31,580
of those devices then you come back the development effort for those devices and that's where

1362
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:36,340
he will focus his attention and most of the nexus I think all of the nexus devices are

1363
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:43,560
in there and some LG devices and the one plus one plus x one plus two so there's all sorts

1364
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:48,340
in there oh I should talk to that guy because that sounds exactly like what I just got to

1365
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:53,460
figure out which nexus device is well supported like the 5x would make a great great Ubuntu

1366
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:59,220
touch device I would think yeah so it's in that it's in on the list hasn't actually started

1367
01:48:59,220 --> 01:49:05,460
yet but it's at priority three and the nexus 6p is also in the list as well hasn't hasn't

1368
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:10,900
actually started yet so you know but there's someone there who's and he's been sponsored

1369
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:16,340
by digital ocean I see as well there you go you know I will mention too just as we kind

1370
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:22,300
of wrap up here I guess ZTE made the mistake of asking people what they want oof never

1371
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:26,820
do that and now they've heard it and they've even suspected that there was some sort of

1372
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:32,120
fraud involved so I encourage you not to do yeah I encourage you not to fraudulate this

1373
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:39,260
but there is a poll going right now over on ZTE which if you've ever looked at new egg

1374
01:49:39,260 --> 01:49:44,220
for example some really nice ZTE devices are out there and and they're asking for input

1375
01:49:44,220 --> 01:49:47,880
from their community about maybe what can next generation projects they should work

1376
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:53,540
on etc etc and OMG Ubuntu has generated some attention towards this initiative and I think

1377
01:49:53,540 --> 01:49:59,340
that's why they got so many votes and they're looking for possible ideas for 2017 that are

1378
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:04,860
quote-unquote reasonable and I just want to give a shout out to this community effort

1379
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:13,080
here because holy smoking crap did this write-up not only is it totally rocking the ZTE voting

1380
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:20,980
right now with 88 upvotes but I two thousands who created this post did a true legitimate

1381
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:30,420
like fortune 500 level proposal on why ZTE should create an Ubuntu touch device it's

1382
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:34,580
really impressive yeah yeah you saw this I mean he goes to the breakdown different scenarios

1383
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:41,220
different options for them to consider it's yeah yeah yeah and it I would I would I would

1384
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:44,480
buy the shit out of this device if ZTE to this because I've looked at some of their

1385
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:49,080
devices on new egg that are unlocked and been kind of tempted by them because they got front-facing

1386
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:55,100
speakers they've seemed to have reasonable packaging for the price ZTE has consistently

1387
01:50:55,100 --> 01:51:00,380
caught my eye but not quite crossed that threshold for something that actually willing to spend

1388
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:05,540
my money on but if they shipped a Ubuntu touch device a hands-down would buy one and if you

1389
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:09,740
want to kind of just vote in that general direction I'll have a link in the show notes

1390
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:14,700
for you to go voice your opinion I just think this is super important he says a brief summary

1391
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:18,860
of the idea is ZTE should provide the following options people to choose when selling a phone

1392
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:23,480
model pre-installed Ubuntu touch is the primary OS pre-installed Ubuntu touch is a secondary

1393
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:28,760
OS alongside maybe something like Android or new Ubuntu or no Ubuntu touch installed

1394
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:32,940
and only something like Android installed he talks about also including something like

1395
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:37,900
a USB type-c connector and the advantages and the advantages of conversions and all

1396
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:43,500
of it and I think it's a it's a brilliant post and ZTE would be a fantastic manufacturer

1397
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:48,760
and I've heard I don't know wimpy if you've heard these things but I've heard some rumors

1398
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:53,700
that perhaps BQ might not be doing another Ubuntu touch device have you heard that wimpy

1399
01:51:53,700 --> 01:52:01,060
I've seen it on Twitter I don't know what the authenticity of those claims are so I

1400
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:05,100
don't either and it seems like it seems like they've sold as many as they can manufacture

1401
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:09,700
of the Ubuntu devices so I don't I don't know about that either but maybe we'll see yeah

1402
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:15,260
it's a bummer because at the moment you can't buy an Ubuntu phone anywhere no in fact unless

1403
01:52:15,260 --> 01:52:23,340
unless you go to eBay if if if today the MX5 Pro were available for purchase I think just

1404
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:27,200
for Linux unplugged Linux action show alone it'd be worth me picking one up just to try

1405
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:35,260
it but every time I go to their site they're sold out yeah yeah they they had a run and

1406
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:40,700
I my understanding was they had an allotted production run and once they were sold out

1407
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:46,420
they were gone so sounds like I see one of those experiment type things I mean Mac you

1408
01:52:46,420 --> 01:52:51,660
had a question go ahead yeah my question to wimpy would be what about multitasking do

1409
01:52:51,660 --> 01:52:56,300
they face the problems they had before for example when I was listening to music on the

1410
01:52:56,300 --> 01:53:01,980
Ubuntu touch I tested it on a Nexus 5 and then wanted to open the browser music stopped

1411
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:08,940
so multitasking at the time I tested this but not really at a good level so that specific

1412
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:16,820
example of audio playing there are facilities in the SDK now to continue playing in the

1413
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:24,420
background good and I know pod bird the podcasting client supports that and there's another app

1414
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:30,900
called cloud player they both continue to play audio when you switch away from them

1415
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:37,700
and go and do other things so so long as the app has been updated to support those facilities

1416
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:44,820
yes it can be done and my second question would be are the Ubuntu touch images all based

1417
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:53,380
on the same Android base or does it depend on the different devices they run on I'm a

1418
01:53:53,380 --> 01:54:03,820
little bit not sure but my understanding is each device has got a slightly different Android

1419
01:54:03,820 --> 01:54:12,620
base origin so this is why some of the devices can support the Miracast wireless display

1420
01:54:12,620 --> 01:54:20,340
and some can't for example and why some can do fingerprint authentication and some can't

1421
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:26,940
so I believe there is a correlation between the device and the Android version that it

1422
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:33,100
can support and therefore what the functionality that it can expose is but next time Popeys

1423
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:39,740
I'll ask him that question I know he's much more up to speed on that than me I've noticed

1424
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:44,300
that I can say sorry what I can say Chris the Nexus 5 and I think you've got one of

1425
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:50,980
these the Nexus 5 is normally a good device to test some of these images I run Sailfish

1426
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:58,860
OS for example for the Nexus 5 and now it's based on Lollipop and this was a huge advantage

1427
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:04,660
for Sailfish OS and so I guess if they port if they have a Lollipop base now for Ubuntu

1428
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:10,740
touch it would run rather good you know I think this is more poignant than ever we started

1429
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:16,380
this segment with the release of Android N and it's a pretty solid release you know

1430
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:22,020
if you like Android it's just Android even better but if you don't like Android it's

1431
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:26,420
everything you don't like even worse but at also at the same time if you're a Nexus

1432
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:32,260
5 user Wes then you just you just got dropped from support where Ubuntu touch has come along

1433
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:38,100
and they're kind of you know just picking up momentum how do you feel about that yeah

1434
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:42,020
you know I can understand it but it is a little disappointing I mean there's lots of ROMs

1435
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:47,260
to try I am kind of just holding out on this phone until the next Nexus line drops we'll

1436
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:52,140
see when that is but yeah it does make me way more incentivized to try something else

1437
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:57,580
and I played with Ubuntu touch on here probably like a year ago and I haven't visited back

1438
01:55:57,580 --> 01:56:01,940
so maybe I'll give that a flash here as soon and see what it's like so I just posted a

1439
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:09,840
link in the chat room which is to the UB ports Nexus 5 build they've got green ticks in everything

1440
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:15,020
except for Bluetooth support so the Nexus 5 version can support everything except for

1441
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:21,900
Bluetooth so it is very close and when I got my first Ubuntu touch device it was about

1442
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:29,340
14-15 months ago and things have improved massively since then yeah you know isn't it

1443
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:33,260
when you come from Android wimpy isn't it kind of novel all of a sudden just see constant

1444
01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:39,500
improvements to your OS like on a reoccurring schedule it is and you know that's that's

1445
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:48,660
kind of tainted because you you look at Ubuntu touch having and I've been using Android since

1446
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:55,780
2010 2011 so you know that's a lot you know Google have got massive resources they've

1447
01:56:55,780 --> 01:57:00,660
been able to throw an Android and make it this dominant platform so you look at Ubuntu

1448
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:06,140
and you think oh you know there is there is these little paper cut type issues but then

1449
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:14,540
when you go and look what the upcoming releases are in the next OTA you see so many of these

1450
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:21,820
paper cuts being addressed now that's exhilarating in a sense it is and you know part of me wanting

1451
01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:29,260
to do this wasn't so much about running Ubuntu touch but it was to really capture some of

1452
01:57:29,260 --> 01:57:37,180
that spirit and enthusiasm I had for Linux way way back when I first discovered Linux

1453
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:44,780
in the in the mid to late 1990s and that sort of pioneering spirit and it's not perfect

1454
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:50,860
yet but it could be and you can be part of the solution even if all you do is run it

1455
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:56,400
and tell the developers yeah it could be better if you did this right that's part of the reason

1456
01:57:56,400 --> 01:58:01,260
why I'm doing doesn't it doesn't it and I okay I want to say two things first of all

1457
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:05,180
before we go much further here it's not like I'm all of a sudden drinking the Kool-Aid

1458
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:12,620
but as I have become more comfortable with Antigros and Ubuntu Mate and Fedora as as

1459
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:20,260
my go-to desktops I'm it is freeing me up conceptually to just let go of the Ubuntu

1460
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:25,540
default desktop and let them focus on mobile because it doesn't affect me anymore and I

1461
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:31,140
don't have a horse in this race and so I can now look at the Ubuntu touch project from

1462
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:39,860
a more dispassionate perspective because in the past I carried my baggage I carried the

1463
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:45,460
baggage of you sons of bitches are working on this mobile project instead of my desktop

1464
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:52,100
how dare you and I came with that bias towards Ubuntu touch but now and and wimpy I'm not

1465
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:56,140
just saying this to blow smoke up your proper butthole it is generally because of projects

1466
01:58:56,140 --> 01:59:01,420
like Ubuntu Mate and honestly the gnome desktop that I just don't give a shit what happens

1467
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:06,460
to unity really personally that I have been able to step back and just watch this new

1468
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:11,000
effort of theirs from a completely new perspective and I look at this and it is totally exciting

1469
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:15,900
for me and so that is number one I just want to I just want to mention that's kind of

1470
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:24,100
my perspective on on this overall but number two we all we all have concerns I think to

1471
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:30,020
some degree about the privacy of using an Android device or an Apple device we all have

1472
01:59:30,020 --> 01:59:36,580
concerns to some degree about how to install applications on our device outside the channels

1473
01:59:36,580 --> 01:59:40,740
that are pushed by the platform and we all have concerns about being able to modify our

1474
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:46,580
device in a way that suits us and so in that regard as a technology enthusiast Ubuntu touch

1475
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:52,660
has always managed to check those boxes for me and I now I sit back and I really think

1476
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:56,060
it's boy it's a matter of hardware for sure and I'm still waiting for the perfect

1477
01:59:56,060 --> 02:00:01,980
hardware but once that comes along for me be it the 5x or you know I'm looking right

1478
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:08,120
now over at UBports and it appears that if if I were to donate Bitcoin in the equivalent

1479
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:12,660
of five hundred and ten dollars which for me would be less than one Bitcoin right now

1480
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:18,020
it would all of a sudden the Nexus 6p would become a priority for them that's less than

1481
02:00:18,020 --> 02:00:23,120
the next smartphone if I were to buy it unlocked for me if I could take my Nexus 6p and donate

1482
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:27,660
five hundred ten dollars equivalent of Bitcoin to this project and have a and maybe one day

1483
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:33,320
have a have a version for the Nexus 6p then I could just continue to use my current hardware

1484
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:38,100
until that comes out but yeah but aside from from all of that I think the point that you

1485
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:46,420
made wimpy is what excites me the most and that is it feels like the early two thousands

1486
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:52,780
the late late nineties where it's not ready for everybody but if you're willing to sort

1487
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:57,620
of get in and get in the mud a little bit you can make this a viable platform one day

1488
02:00:57,620 --> 02:01:02,780
for everybody else by banging on the rough edges commenting giving feedback maybe even

1489
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:08,900
making bug fixes is sort of what drew me to Linux a decade ago and do you find that to

1490
02:01:08,900 --> 02:01:13,280
be sort of the position you find yourself in now with Ubuntu touch wimpy absolutely

1491
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:18,480
and I'm by no means a pioneer here because there are people that have been running these

1492
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:27,140
devices as their main phones for 18 months or more now who are far more advanced in how

1493
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:31,300
they're putting apps together and there's some quite sophisticated apps available now

1494
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:40,300
so there's one called rockworks which is available from the open store and I have complete support

1495
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:48,180
for both my pebble watches with Ubuntu touch using and the experience on my pebble watch

1496
02:01:48,180 --> 02:01:56,880
is exactly as I had it on Android with no no shortcomings whatsoever so you know there

1497
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:03,100
are there are not many but they're the ones that exist the native apps are getting very

1498
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:10,860
very good now and are solving real problems and it feels like it's really got momentum

1499
02:02:10,860 --> 02:02:15,940
and there's there's some talented people behind it and but yeah there's still some good work

1500
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:21,900
to be done that you can have maybe yeah some influence in right absolutely I mean like

1501
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:28,580
I said even if it's just commenting on the apps in the App Store to say this Twitter

1502
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:35,140
app is better than that Twitter app because you know and up rate the ones that are good

1503
02:02:35,140 --> 02:02:40,460
so that other people don't have this dilemma as to well which of the several Twitter apps

1504
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:50,300
should I install but also I think there are a few proprietary applications for Ubuntu

1505
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:57,980
touch but most are open source so there are issue trackers that you can go and find and

1506
02:02:57,980 --> 02:03:02,420
you can actually have dialogue with the developers directly which of course is difficult to do

1507
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:10,300
on some of the other platforms so just just by sharing your ideas you can have some involvement

1508
02:03:10,300 --> 02:03:18,060
in shaping individual apps and and the device as a whole that is you know for those of us

1509
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:24,980
who are enthusiasts that's sort of a delightful era for a new platform and it's rare because

1510
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:30,220
once the platform becomes established and lots of users it sort of passes and you know

1511
02:03:30,220 --> 02:03:36,580
it's your chance to be sort of a hipster before it's famous but in a way that is empowering

1512
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:41,780
for those of us that want to move away from the Google platform and you know privacy concerns

1513
02:03:41,780 --> 02:03:47,520
and you know pioneering spirit aside obviously the main reason I've done this is because

1514
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:53,860
I want to be an Ubuntu touch hipster I don't believe you for a second but the other two

1515
02:03:53,860 --> 02:03:58,980
reasons I do believe yeah and I really am thankful that you've joined us again and give

1516
02:03:58,980 --> 02:04:04,340
us an update and it kind of makes me wimpy I tell you if there's a way to make it possible

1517
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:11,140
if the MX5 becomes available again I think I'm gonna jump on it is or or wait for a Nexus

1518
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:14,420
5 image to really kind of get Bluetooth ironed out and then jump on that and at least try

1519
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:22,580
it for a bit because it really is for me the perfect time to jump in I love this phase

1520
02:04:22,580 --> 02:04:28,100
of a new platform as long as it has just enough stuff yeah just enough stuff that I can get

1521
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:35,100
by day to day I I'll tell you I'll tell you something I I you know using Android N and

1522
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:43,240
iOS 9 shit ton of problems still tons of problems totally unbelievable the shit that doesn't

1523
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:47,420
work on these platforms this long into it I sit there and I think to myself how could

1524
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:52,820
they not have caught this and if I'm gonna feel that way anyways you know if I'm gonna

1525
02:04:52,820 --> 02:04:57,940
if I'm gonna say Aaron shake man go damn it Google why didn't you think of this problem

1526
02:04:57,940 --> 02:05:04,100
I might as well be using something where I can submit bugs I can have some kind of discourse

1527
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:08,780
in the evolution of the platform and I can at least be there when when there's a rational

1528
02:05:08,780 --> 02:05:12,920
explanation why some of these things don't work and I know that seems like a weird cognitive

1529
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:20,740
disconnect from but it generally it drives me crazy to use these more modern platforms

1530
02:05:20,740 --> 02:05:23,680
or feature complete platforms or whatever you want to call them and they still have

1531
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:27,320
some of these fundamental usability issues at the end of the day I just need certain

1532
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:32,780
base functionality and the rest is all gravy and so I just am waiting for the perfect hardware

1533
02:05:32,780 --> 02:05:38,780
device to come along and and maybe maybe I need to reassess my requirements because I'm

1534
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:42,360
looking at it from a perspective an Android user but I don't know wimpy you tell me do

1535
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:48,780
I is there a one-to-one performance ratio between Ubuntu touch and Android or can I

1536
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:54,280
get away with maybe a little less hardware using Ubuntu touch because maybe I'm not running

1537
02:05:54,280 --> 02:06:05,180
Java etc no not really like I said there are some interactions with Ubuntu touch the user

1538
02:06:05,180 --> 02:06:13,980
interface that are slower than the hardware is capable of so you want the best hardware

1539
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:20,340
if you if you if your Nexus 5 is spare definitely put the current image for the Nexus 5 on it

1540
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:28,480
it's a community port so it's not as robust as the officially blessed versions yeah but

1541
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:33,460
it does give you a flavor of where things are now and you know how your Nexus 5 performs

1542
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:43,540
with Android so you can make that comparison and some of the how do you characterize it

1543
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:49,300
it's it's just the way Ubuntu works at the moment and I'm sure this is going to get ironed

1544
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:54,180
out in the not too distant future but when it does you can so there are some apps that

1545
02:06:54,180 --> 02:07:01,620
are just C and they bypass some of the framework and those applications when you start them

1546
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:07,340
they launch instantly like there's your fingers not off the screen and they're running but

1547
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:11,700
a lot of the apps that are using the framework they have the little spinner that gets them

1548
02:07:11,700 --> 02:07:16,720
going when they get started up so you have to sort of go into it knowing you're not going

1549
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:23,140
to have this immediate snap snap snap type experience yeah I think on the pro 5 it's

1550
02:07:23,140 --> 02:07:29,220
much better because that's a super fast much beef beefier machine yeah yeah the hardware

1551
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:34,980
that's doing that yeah have you just kind of tangently related have you seen the announcement

1552
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:41,900
from the cute project of cute light I have only in passing not really in detail that

1553
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:46,460
might that might help with some of that because you know let's be honest if you're if you're

1554
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:49,900
using cute based applications there's a lot there and if there's something like cute

1555
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:53,300
light that could come along and sort of they're kind of they're focusing cute light more

1556
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:57,780
of the Internet of Things type devices but you could also see it working on something

1557
02:07:57,780 --> 02:08:04,420
like Ubuntu touch and perhaps think of think of cutie light as more of a minimal build

1558
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:10,700
from base up of cute functions whereas the traditional cute environment is huge it's

1559
02:08:10,700 --> 02:08:14,740
got everything you need to do everything you could possibly want including touch support

1560
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:18,580
which is extremely useful but it also means that when you load the applicant when you

1561
02:08:18,580 --> 02:08:22,080
load I would think I'm totally speculating here but when you load a cute application

1562
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:25,660
for the first time there's a lot of other things in the background you have to load

1563
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:32,100
to support that where cute light could sort of tighten that up a bit I don't know a lot

1564
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:36,520
about it but I was just reading about it today and it seems like it could be the perfect

1565
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:41,420
thing for Ubuntu touch and then you combine that with the fact that canonical has recently

1566
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:49,500
become a backer of KDE EV which is the commercial entity behind KDE yeah yeah and and you know

1567
02:08:49,500 --> 02:08:56,900
Ubuntu has also got support for Cordova yes react something or other another Java that's

1568
02:08:56,900 --> 02:09:04,100
the one yeah JavaScript you know libraries for making native apps so that word needs

1569
02:09:04,100 --> 02:09:08,900
to get propagated because there are lots of people that have created their apps using

1570
02:09:08,900 --> 02:09:15,380
those frameworks that could come over directly without any any messing about you know it's

1571
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:23,180
interesting we've talked about LibreVault and Ubuntu touch and they both have the big

1572
02:09:23,180 --> 02:09:31,580
huge you know marquee scrolling or HTML flashing tag warning that this is early days on both

1573
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:38,420
of these Ubuntu touch and LibreVault at the same time I think for our audience they're

1574
02:09:38,420 --> 02:09:42,740
both getting to the point where if you kind of have a pioneering spirit for this particular

1575
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:48,580
thing be it your file sync or your mobile device and fully acknowledging that both of

1576
02:09:48,580 --> 02:09:52,700
these things for some people are critical day-to-day devices that must be completely

1577
02:09:52,700 --> 02:09:56,860
flawless but if if some of you out there have that pioneering spirit for either one of these

1578
02:09:56,860 --> 02:10:02,940
types of technologies it's for both of them getting to be time for that type of person

1579
02:10:02,940 --> 02:10:08,700
to jump in and that is super exciting for somebody like me because that's exactly the

1580
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:12,900
type of person that I am and I think of a lot of our audience is to watch this stuff

1581
02:10:12,900 --> 02:10:16,860
from this part and go boy you know I'm really like for me wimpy I'll be completely honest

1582
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:20,180
I am thrilled that for the last couple of weeks you've been running Ubuntu touch because

1583
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:24,620
I get updates from you on how it's going and I can I can kind of project how would how

1584
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:29,300
that would translate for my experience and you're making you're giving me baited breath

1585
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:34,100
you're making my mouth water you're making me want to switch and I think it's super exciting

1586
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:38,460
and it's funny because I don't know if either one of you you or myself would recommend or

1587
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:42,060
probably West would recommend that people go deploy LibreVault or Ubuntu touch for their

1588
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:47,740
daily driver today but it definitely is ready for a certain class of us or a certain type

1589
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:54,340
of user and wimpy just to kind of wrap it all up would you kind of give us an idea of

1590
02:10:54,340 --> 02:10:57,940
the range of devices you're trying it just that we kind of a full picture of your experience

1591
02:10:57,940 --> 02:11:02,140
that way when it does blow up and I mean if it ever does blow up in your face we have

1592
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:05,740
an idea of what you test on because I was kind of impressed when you can share it with

1593
02:11:05,740 --> 02:11:19,500
me. Okay I've got a Nexus 4, a Nexus 7 tablet, a BQE5 HD phone, the Meizu MX4 and the BQM

1594
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:24,300
10 tablet. Damn son! Whoa! Yeah that's quite a lot of devices. You know if you if you do

1595
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:30,220
have that pioneering spirit and you want to experiment then consider getting yourself

1596
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:39,580
a Nexus 7 2013 or a Nexus 4 off eBay because they go quite cheap now and they are officially

1597
02:11:39,580 --> 02:11:45,300
supported devices for Ubuntu touch so they come direct from the canonical channels and

1598
02:11:45,300 --> 02:11:50,160
you can be involved in actually testing these things and trying them out you know that you

1599
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:54,860
don't have to make it your daily device you know I didn't for over a year I had a you

1600
02:11:54,860 --> 02:12:00,100
know one pound SIM in my Nexus 4 for months and months and months experimenting with it

1601
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:06,220
before I determined it was time to make the move but you know you can participate at that

1602
02:12:06,220 --> 02:12:13,260
level. Yeah well shoot you're making me want to try it especially on a tablet I know right

1603
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:18,620
I'm excited. Have you tried on any of your devices? Just the Nexus 5 but oh yeah that's

1604
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:22,980
right it was a while ago yeah yeah it was it'll probably be a much better experience.

1605
02:12:22,980 --> 02:12:26,540
Yeah maybe when the next Nexus device comes out and you got the 5 sitting around you could

1606
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:31,300
try it out and give us the unplugged take. I think I will. I like it. Well there you

1607
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:35,340
go that sort of brings us to the end of this week's discussion we have lots of links to

1608
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:39,100
all the stuff we talked about. Don't forget if you're like me and you'd love to see a

1609
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:47,020
Ubuntu touch on the Nexus 6P the ubports.com a devices.ubports.com specifically has a funding

1610
02:12:47,020 --> 02:12:51,460
page on it that'd be pretty damn cool and if you're getting finally to the end of this

1611
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:57,140
extremely long episode of the unplugged program and you want more go check out user air episode

1612
02:12:57,140 --> 02:13:02,980
one is over at jupitabroadcasting.com right now as we record this very episode. Wes thank

1613
02:13:02,980 --> 02:13:10,220
you for making it despite real life diversity. Hey thank you for I love being here. Absolutely

1614
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:15,320
absolutely and you know what if the folks at home wanted to join us it turns out we

1615
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:20,740
have a diabolical plan you could join us over at jblive.tv on a Tuesday. Oh what time

1616
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:27,980
you ask. Clever of you. Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar where we have robots that automatically

1617
02:13:27,980 --> 02:13:33,300
adjust it to your time zone in real time before the page even loads. Thank you robots. Thank

1618
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:37,260
you right. They don't and I think they probably run Ubuntu touch too. I haven't confirmed

1619
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:42,620
it yet. Definitely. I just got them on eBay. Also litxactionshow.reddit.com if you want

1620
02:13:42,620 --> 02:13:46,540
to give us some feedback for episode 159 or submit a topic and don't forget you can join

1621
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:50,220
us on our virtual lug get more information in our chatroom at jblive.tv and we'll see

1622
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:51,740
you right back here next week.

1623
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:44,860
All Wimpy's Vault. That's a good title. That's pretty good. That's good though. Oh yeah yeah

1624
02:14:44,860 --> 02:14:48,340
yeah boy look at that look at that text highlighting yeah thanks to Ange for stopping by she had

1625
02:14:48,340 --> 02:14:52,260
to go because we went so long but that was great that was a lot of fun sorry sorry about

1626
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:57,940
that no no it was a bit of an epic no no you know I love it you know I love it so now we

1627
02:14:57,940 --> 02:15:03,460
just we just have to name this thing over JBtitles.com with the new suggest with the

1628
02:15:03,460 --> 02:15:09,900
new fancy updated website thanks to Rekai and team the JBot has gotten some recent refreshes

1629
02:15:09,900 --> 02:15:16,400
actually and I can actually say this now we go into some quite some detail about the changes

1630
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:20,260
to JBot and how we do that and the code and the community members involved in user error

1631
02:15:20,260 --> 02:15:25,700
episode one it was really fun so I employ you you have multiple disks that you're going

1632
02:15:25,700 --> 02:15:31,780
to be pulling in and out and mismatched sizes and all that kind of stuff right I don't know

1633
02:15:31,780 --> 02:15:37,180
I probably just because the necessity of budget over time that'll have to be how it works

1634
02:15:37,180 --> 02:15:41,300
but I would like to start with a base and I think storage I think that's overlooked

1635
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:49,380
with ZFS sorry British ZFS because if there's like a hidden cost to an upgrade when you

1636
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:54,420
think right I've run out of storage you need to add a whole new pool or replace three four

1637
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:58,820
five drives all at once and you know I don't know about you but when I fill up a disk I

1638
02:15:58,820 --> 02:16:03,900
just want to buy another three terabyte drive whack it in there and call it good and to

1639
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:09,780
do that I use something called merger FS which presents all of the drives in my system under

1640
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:16,340
a single mount point using a fuse files them and I'm running in it on a see you 750 as

1641
02:16:16,340 --> 02:16:21,660
rock board yeah so it's a union file system that sort of brings them all in under one

1642
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:27,220
mount point huh yeah and all you do is you modify your mount point in FS tab sorry whoever

1643
02:16:27,220 --> 02:16:33,000
I talked over your mount point you modify your mount point with one line or you just

1644
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:39,340
do a mount command and it will add the drive that you've just plugged in into the the fuse

1645
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:46,780
where that is just a mount and I've been using it for I mean I tried MHDFS or whatever it's

1646
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:54,300
called I tried another union file system and then after about 18 months of lots of ghost

1647
02:16:54,300 --> 02:16:59,340
files and messing about I settled on merger FS about a year ago yeah and since then Chris

1648
02:16:59,340 --> 02:17:03,460
it's been absolutely perfect no performance penalties really or there must be some right

1649
02:17:03,460 --> 02:17:08,820
because this is a fuse it uses a bit of CPU yeah it uses a bit of CPU but I have a atom

1650
02:17:08,820 --> 02:17:13,220
cause and when I'm transcoding a couple of Plex streams around my house I don't notice

1651
02:17:13,220 --> 02:17:19,180
any difference whatsoever absolutely oh and to dovetail with that there are two plugins

1652
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:26,780
for open media vault that support those technologies so that you can grow your file system without

1653
02:17:26,780 --> 02:17:32,540
having to employ a traditional raid and you don't have to have matched size disks for

1654
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:38,620
growth I forgot the best bit merger FS doesn't stripe file systems across the drives yes

1655
02:17:38,620 --> 02:17:43,980
this drive has its own individually readable file system so even if you exceed your redundancy

1656
02:17:43,980 --> 02:17:48,140
level you only lose the data on the drives that failed in excess of that level and you

1657
02:17:48,140 --> 02:17:52,260
can still read you plug that drive into any other Linux box and just read the data you

1658
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:56,900
know that'd be a perfect way to like have some drives for TV shows that I don't really

1659
02:17:56,900 --> 02:18:01,120
care about on this disk that's not as redundant too because I've thought about doing like

1660
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:06,780
these are my cheaper disks these are my more important keepsakes on on open media vault

1661
02:18:06,780 --> 02:18:11,380
the plugins you want to look at our gray hole and snap raid they provide those facilities

1662
02:18:11,380 --> 02:18:18,780
that plus one I just just separate huh well this is good stuff yeah you need to set up

1663
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:24,520
you need to set up a cron job for the sink of the parity to run every night or something

1664
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:30,420
like that otherwise you're effectively running the data that day doesn't have any parity

1665
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:37,460
protection or you can force a sink if you like but I spent probably the best part of

1666
02:18:37,460 --> 02:18:42,900
three years getting down to this final docker snap raid and merger FS on top of Debian which

1667
02:18:42,900 --> 02:18:48,260
in my case I chose to roll myself but you know it will work on top of open media vault

1668
02:18:48,260 --> 02:18:52,420
just perfectly with plugins with a gooey I don't need any of that because I can just

1669
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:58,300
SSH from my phone into my server and it just don't you know I remember now that I'm looking

1670
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:03,220
at the gray hole website I have also looked at gray hole as potentially doing a segment

1671
02:19:03,220 --> 02:19:10,260
on last about it and I never even thought about setting it up for storage that is slick

1672
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:15,180
so snap it raid or snap raid or snap raid dot IT if you want to go to the site and gray

1673
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:19,980
hole dot net for gray hole which is an application that uses Samba to create a storage pool of

1674
02:19:19,980 --> 02:19:23,020
all your available hard drives and allows you to create redundant copies of the files

1675
02:19:23,020 --> 02:19:27,660
you store in order to prevent data loss when part of your hardware fails have you had any

1676
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:33,140
inclination at all to try out the not sure how you say it in LA s and one email client

1677
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:41,820
that has the hosted component and is electron ish I did try it when it was first announced

1678
02:19:41,820 --> 02:19:48,300
I created a gash Google account to hook it up to so I could but basically so I could

1679
02:19:48,300 --> 02:19:55,380
just see what the UI was like and use it and all the rest of it and every so often I kind

1680
02:19:55,380 --> 02:20:01,620
of update it and I haven't I haven't done what Wes has done which is host my own middleware

1681
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:05,740
for want of a better description you know that piece that does the brokering between

1682
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:10,580
the client and your back end servers I've just used their hosted platform because it

1683
02:20:10,580 --> 02:20:16,540
was a disposable account I'll tell you what I what I found what I what always draws me

1684
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:24,280
to Thunderbird is how how how much I like the enigma GPG plug-in and whenever I want

1685
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:31,000
to have a good secure emails setup it's such an attractive easy to use simple straightforward

1686
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:37,040
system that works well with my workflow and I think it's finally been beat by n1 simply

1687
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:42,140
also because it's been easier for the audience to find me on Keybase and so that tends to

1688
02:20:42,140 --> 02:20:47,540
be what they sign against and and one has one one check integration with Keybase and

1689
02:20:47,540 --> 02:20:52,780
it hit it is it has taken that ease of use to the next level and from what I can tell

1690
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:56,900
appears to be a pretty secure implementation and all that's being done locally in the composer

1691
02:20:56,900 --> 02:21:02,860
so so the the advantage of Keybase being easy discoverability of your keys yeah so you can

1692
02:21:02,860 --> 02:21:08,060
have seamless email exchanges well and you know I kind of like there they have an interesting

1693
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:12,360
approach to verifying who you are you know because one of the things that's really kind

1694
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:16,580
of the weak spot of GPG in reality is the web of trust works best when you can go to

1695
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:22,440
a con or a fest or a or a live event and you know everybody there can do a little key exchange

1696
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:27,200
and hi I'm so-and-so it's really me here's my key that works well but it doesn't work

1697
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:32,140
at scale and what Keybase allows you to do is connect to other online presence that are

1698
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:37,500
well established and trusted and then by building up several of them and also in some cases

1699
02:21:37,500 --> 02:21:41,660
I think in mine I'm using something Bitcoin related to like there's something there that's

1700
02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:46,100
it's pretty concrete it's like three or four for me different these are obviously really

1701
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:51,060
Chris Lass's account so it gives the audience some confidence now you have to have certain

1702
02:21:51,060 --> 02:21:55,720
faith in Keybase IO and assume they're setting it up right but those implementation details

1703
02:21:55,720 --> 02:22:02,940
to me seem to be interesting concepts mm-hmm okay yeah I it's just finding the time I'm

1704
02:22:02,940 --> 02:22:09,500
interested in Nihilus because I think it looks like a nice user in base yeah and I like their

1705
02:22:09,500 --> 02:22:14,200
ability to tag emails for follow-up so I can I can technically have read them and process

1706
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:17,940
them but I don't have to take action on it immediately I can come back another time and

1707
02:22:17,940 --> 02:22:22,140
that's also nice and then it has it has interesting and I didn't even realize it was because I

1708
02:22:22,140 --> 02:22:26,260
just I guess it's just turned on by default and some male clients support it is it does

1709
02:22:26,260 --> 02:22:30,980
read receipts by default and what's interesting about that is it's it's also integrated with

1710
02:22:30,980 --> 02:22:35,040
the desktop environment notification so I'm off doing something else and I just get a

1711
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:39,340
quick gnome notification that so-and-so has read the email I sent them and then it slides

1712
02:22:39,340 --> 02:22:44,200
away and I you would think that's it's actually kind of neat it makes email feel a little

1713
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:49,060
more 2016 first of all the fact I'm getting a gnome notification about it but also just

1714
02:22:49,060 --> 02:22:53,380
how seamless that was I didn't really have to do anything yeah that's a good point because

1715
02:22:53,380 --> 02:23:04,540
yeah I I always I emails that have got read receipts with deep suspicion yeah I agree

1716
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:09,060
I didn't realize it was on by default they also by default put a little a promo for the

1717
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:12,860
email client and the signature and it's a little tricky to get rid of it because when

1718
02:23:12,860 --> 02:23:16,360
you go to the signatures configuration it has nothing listed if you've never created

1719
02:23:16,360 --> 02:23:20,780
one and the only way to get rid of the default one that puts in there is by creating one

1720
02:23:20,780 --> 02:23:43,780
yeah I like okay very nice guys
