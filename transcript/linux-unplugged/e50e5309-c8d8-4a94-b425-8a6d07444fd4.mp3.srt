1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
We've been kind of scratching our heads like what is a great task match application because we've been trying to do this

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,820
but that's not open source and task warrior is

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,200
Complicated. I don't know why task warrior is disqualified and it just doesn't work to sort of manually sync paper notes between us all and matrix

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,320
Every morning like that's not gonna cut it. Yeah, but if there's like one

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,860
Universal law that seems to be just more and more true these days in free software. You're always

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,140
Three solutions away from next cloud, you know, it's like you start talking about a problem

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,420
two

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,940
Or three other applications get mentioned and then you always inevitably end up on next cloud

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,900
Of course, we were looking at next cloud tasks, which is one of their featured apps

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,180
And I'm kind of impressed if you look at it

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,340
It's got a great UI and then it supports caldev export

12
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:50,080
So when you schedule your tasks, you could you know evolution Thunderbird?

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,500
ICAO, I don't know what you use but anything that supports caldev. You could just import the dates

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,540
From your task app and next cloud into your calendar

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,540
That's kind of slick

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,200
but you know, I sort of feel like next cloud is going through this transition and I'm curious if you guys agree, but

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,760
next cloud just recently announced next cloud hub 3 and

18
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,780
It is like a collaboration suite to the extreme next cloud

19
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,260
Chat is more like slack now and you could share documents and preview widgets in there

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,380
It's like this whole team style collaboration that has its own file system behind it, too

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,580
And then they have these task systems with group collaboration

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,000
They have a new mail app a new mail 2.0 app. That is a lot more advanced for a mail application

23
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,540
It kind of feels like they're trying to build

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,740
The next version of exchange but the free software version like they're really going for a collaboration suite

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,120
I just found here in the apps library. There's a SharePoint back end. No

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, it's the SharePoint killer was

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
My name is Wes and my name is Brent

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,720
Hello boys back together again in the studio in the beautiful smoky Pacific Northwest

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,280
It's good to be here with you coming up on the show today

31
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,680
we're chatting about a few things going on in the world of Linux that caught our attention during the road trip that we just didn't

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
get a chance to talk about with the crazy schedule and

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,080
There's some doozies in there. So we'll get to that then we'll round it out with a few stories

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,640
From our friends and from the meetups out there

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,880
Plus, of course, we have some boosts and pics and a lot more so before I go any further

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,280
Let's say hello to that virtual log who's here every single Sunday. Hello. Mumble room time appropriate greetings. Hello

37
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:56,480
Hello, and hello Brent and hello everybody up there in the quiet listening we see you in the what would that be like the lobby?

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,080
Like a virtual lobby or uh, you know when they like at big events and they've got these like TV screens for the people

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,400
That can't be in that main theater or what if it's more like you're behind it's actually more like you're backstage watching the show

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,360
I'm true like our theater techs running everything. Yeah, they're back

41
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,240
They're listening as we're up on stage because we're in there as we're setting up the studio

42
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,400
You know as we're hitting your cousin and fart and stuff. They're listening to all of that

43
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,680
So they're kind of like really behind the scenes

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,380
I was gonna make it a little more glamorous if I could but yeah, that's that's basically you're gonna mention the cousin in the fartin

45
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,920
I try not to yeah, we yeah, right theater as a surprise

46
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,580
There's totally no cousin of fartin going on in the studio. Totally not happening

47
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:43,180
Well, we're back barely perhaps but we're back barely back and I want to start by saying good morning to our friends over at

48
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,500
Tailscale tailscale is a mesh VPN protected by wire guard

49
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,180
We used the absolute crap out of it all of us every single person at the Airbnb

50
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,580
Had tailscale going we were all getting access to our systems behind firewalls not

51
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:05,900
Open ports for us. No, go try it out at tailscale.com. Go say good morning. Tell him Linux unplugged sent you

52
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,860
tailscale.com

53
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,940
Man, oh man. Okay, so we got back in last night about oh, I don't know 12 hours ago

54
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,860
I think about maybe maybe so maybe 12 hours ago. We got back into town and

55
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,700
The great great part about the return trip so much fun is Wes

56
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,460
You came down to join us in Portland and you caravan back with us. Yeah, I got the full experience this time

57
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,760
And we even got the third walkie-talkie working

58
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,900
So and then you guys like disappeared for a while

59
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,900
But you had what the thing was is like as long as you stay together

60
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,180
We like when you stop to get gas right you stay together

61
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,820
The radio still work like, you know, our radio doesn't work

62
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,100
But you guys can continue to talk and then when you catch back up we can all talk again

63
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,700
That was it's pretty neat how that works. Yeah, it was fun

64
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,140
Like we could tell we're getting close again like oh, that's a dia

65
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:58,100
Yeah, also dupes is probably I would imagine pretty easy to spot when you're coming up on her. She's sort of

66
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,220
So I was realizing and I felt kind of dumb especially now after that. I've spent the night in dupes

67
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,340
I didn't really know what she looked like from the back

68
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,320
I was like and I could see that there'd be like, you know, especially on a weekend

69
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,940
There could be a lot of rigs on the road sometimes sure. Yeah, and when I first pulled up on you

70
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,720
There was someone kind of tailgating you right behind so that threw me too

71
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,180
I was like who would drive that close to a rig that they're not associated. Oh, they do turns out they love to draft

72
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,660
They draft in me and they get right up in there

73
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,700
And the thing they don't realize is that I can't see them in my mirrors unless they are to the one of the sides

74
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,160
But if they're perfectly centered, I actually can't see them when they're that close

75
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,060
Well, if they're close enough you have that rear facing camera. Yeah, I learned that yeah, but that's dangerous

76
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,700
Yeah, I like to hang out just right

77
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,380
That's how bring kids 50 miles to the gallon and gas

78
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:53,220
Economy, what if we get you a pie powered home assistant integrated like little like text billboard thing

79
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,780
You know like the programmatic like little text. I like this just back off whatever you want

80
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,740
Yeah, maybe you integrate it with like a little speech to text you so you can sort of shout at something and then just like

81
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,300
Puts it on the back. Oh, I like that

82
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,660
I mean you brought up the whole home assistant raspberry pie thing a little too soon. I'm still grieving but

83
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,860
Yeah, yeah, but I'm for grief. You've got systems to build man. Why are you grieving again? I didn't oh, come on

84
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,980
That's salt in the wound my server and you know now like, you know

85
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,140
Like back home the kids are over and I'm like I got it

86
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,260
I got to explain to the kids it's gonna get a little cold here tonight because there's no system running the heat

87
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,180
Sorry, like, you know, sorry about that everybody

88
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,220
It's embarrassing family fail. We're gonna work on that

89
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,900
We're ripping the whole system out tonight after the show and we're gonna replace it with my home assistant yellow and rebuild

90
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,420
And rebuild eventually, we'll let you know how it goes

91
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,460
So this came up right as we were leaving right as we were hitting the road

92
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,860
Word came down that fedora was dropping a video acceleration

93
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,740
for h264 h265 and VC one codecs due to a legal concern and

94
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,460
It seems that this will primarily affect AMD GPU users using open-source drivers

95
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,140
so if you have done the hard work of switching off in video and

96
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,580
buying AMD pure systems so that way you can have a

97
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,540
3d accelerated environment that is completely open source vote with your wallet. They say you're getting particularly screwed by this

98
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:30,580
Ironically if you install an NVIDIA graphics card and install their binary proprietary driver

99
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,300
You don't have this problem. You got nothing to worry about so it kind of actually incentivizes using the proprietary driver, which is

100
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:44,740
Funny how that works out. It also affects any user who uses like any other open-source graphics

101
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,540
Like oh, I don't know Intel graphics users. You also will no longer get

102
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
video accelerated decoding

103
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:59,380
There's been talk about maybe other distributions doing this or not and ultimately it comes down to legal concerns

104
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Red Hat legal is

105
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,060
concerned that they may be exposed to a lawsuit and

106
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,500
when a decision like this is made it actually exposes the real power structure behind fedora and

107
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,580
It's not that fedora isn't a community-run distribution. It absolutely is it's that when?

108
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:25,780
Red Hat legal gets heartburn about something fedora has to jump into action because if fedora were to become a legal liability for Red Hat

109
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:32,900
I would imagine the project status would become tenuous. And so the project's incentivized to

110
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:41,460
Over react to these concerns and as a result they fuck their end users over and over and over again

111
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,660
I was just looking it was like July or June of 2020 where Firefox

112
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
finally

113
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:55,860
Finally got hardware accelerated video playback in Wayland and it was celebrated at the time on fedora finally gets this and

114
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,540
Yet about a year later. Here we are. They now take us away and

115
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,460
Other distributions don't seem to be quite as worried about this

116
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:12,560
But they don't have this vulnerability that the fedora project has and it's a great project and it's primarily community-run

117
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,720
But this really shows us who's in charge, doesn't it? And I think it's a really kind of unfortunate thing because it's once again end

118
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
users that are getting

119
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:28,280
And it once again shows us why companies like Google have to come along and create a product like Chrome OS to actually make Linux

120
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,560
Usable for end users because we can't count on the distributions that are community-run to actually be able to do these things

121
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,280
It's an interesting time. We live in when Debian can vote to include

122
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,400
Proprietary firmware on their installer all of a sudden

123
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,920
But fedora can't decode that video. They were decoding for you yesterday

124
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,520
it just doesn't make a lot of sense, but in the end it's Linux users who always have to constantly navigate these changing rules and

125
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,800
Once again, it's fedora. That's making a change like this. I

126
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,280
Just find it really disappointing. I understand why they have to do it and you know realistically

127
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
We're all gonna be able to figure out how to work around it

128
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
It's not gonna be our problem. It's yeah

129
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,520
It's the sort of oh I wanted to give this a shot and I have no idea where to start with

130
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Understanding why this thing that just works. I don't ever have to think about on other systems doesn't over here

131
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,360
Yeah, that's the tragedy of it, and I just took a little look skis before the show

132
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,280
I'm sure this will change with time

133
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,720
But it'll take time

134
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,400
But I just a little look sees before the show and was looking up video acceleration for Firefox

135
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:35,960
And guess what all the wiki pages all the tutorials all the blog posts all the YouTube videos talk about it

136
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,560
Like it's a working feature

137
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,440
It's something you can do on fedora

138
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,960
so now imagine when you install the next version of fedora and it doesn't work and there just hasn't been enough time for Google and

139
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,480
Everything to re-index and so you go searching for it and all the guides and all the things just talk about it

140
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Like it actually works just fine out of the box

141
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,080
you're gonna get totally gas-lit like what a mind job and

142
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,600
if if all of a sudden could you imagine if all of a sudden

143
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Apple announced that macOS wasn't gonna be able to play back h.264 videos

144
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,240
And I realized fedora is no Apple and they're definitely not but

145
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,440
it does strike me as a decision that was user hostile and

146
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,440
You know, it's kind of unfortunate because fedora has a history of doing this and it's kind of changed my perspective a little bit

147
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,520
And I think it's just sort of the vulnerability that they have as a project and it's just sort of the compromise

148
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,080
We have to accept is that if Red Hat legal has a little bit of heartburn about some concern that might happen to them that

149
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,120
They could just shake off financially like it's no big deal or you know, I don't know. Here's a idea license it

150
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,960
They're rich they could license it but no no instead all users who help us beta test this thing that make our product that actually

151
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,200
Pays the bills

152
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,480
They're the ones that get screwed. It is sort of an interesting. I think maybe it highlights the unique maybe not unique but

153
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,500
Particular situation that have fedora is structured just thinking, you know, we're used to community run distros

154
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,480
No money to tangle in some of these legal things just because like what they they're not gonna pay legal bills or have a lawyer

155
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,480
they have limited funding to begin with and it reminds me of

156
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,120
economicals legal sort of being willing to step out on a limb or what some people thought of a limb with the adding the

157
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,220
CFS module compiled, you know

158
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,320
So in some circumstances having like a corporate sponsor when who's willing to take those risks

159
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,120
It can be something that you know those type of Linux distributions benefit from but that's not really the case

160
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,640
Even though there is somewhat attached it it falls more on that community side

161
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,480
Well, and that is assuming that they could buy a license, you know

162
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,360
What do you want to buy a perpetual license forever for an indefinite amount?

163
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,680
it may be one of these situations where they can't buy it and

164
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,160
It just as a that makes it even more complicated and it doesn't speak to

165
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,680
Linux's ability to compete as a commercial desktop platform

166
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,800
If we can't even get past hurdles like this and I acknowledge it's a tough spot and maybe and I think you might be familiar

167
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,840
with with because this happened a few weeks ago, so I'm starting to get fady on it, but

168
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,440
What happened was a change upstream in Mesa to kind of kick this entire thing off?

169
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,240
That's why all of this came up all of a sudden. That's why there's a change to begin with

170
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,480
I don't know do West you recall what some of those changes were upstream

171
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,560
Straight over a matrix has a nice little summary that before this stuff was kind of just included in Mesa

172
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,360
I guess some thought maybe as an oversight before or at least in the the way that it was getting pulled into fedora

173
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,080
Now you need a build up an explicit build option if you want these codecs

174
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,520
So the non free things can be cut out in a technical sense in a way that before May I think roughly

175
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,720
It was not necessarily easy to do so

176
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,520
I

177
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,960
So now there's a little more scrutiny and if you're gonna have to like when this update comes out you update that and now you have

178
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,360
To explicitly add build flags to enable these non free things that raises a lot of questions

179
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,960
So now you're making a proactive choice, right? You're making this kind of like rolled in with

180
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,800
Yeah, Carl points out to you. There's some trickiness and we can't I think we should talk about just the very unfortunate

181
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,400
This would all be so much easy in a world where we weren't trying to deal with these

182
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,280
You know the horribly licensed codecs like any license that Red Hat

183
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,400
Paid for could result in restrictions on fedora itself

184
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,600
Whereas like because there are restrictions right on these proprietary OS is they want to know when you're installing that you got to get it

185
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,200
From them, whereas we don't think about that in the open source sense

186
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,600
And I guess mpeg la is not really interested in granting unlimited licenses. Anyway. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah

187
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,400
See, that's just what I think

188
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,920
It's just like we're it's such a it's such a tough spot for like what we think of is this basic sort of human, right?

189
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,200
Of like you should have software that makes your machine fully operate

190
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,200
And that's not how a lot of the rest of the structures of society are set up to do

191
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,000
It's one of those things where I get now so a willful choice is being made and that is a legal thing

192
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,240
I get it, but it would be so much nicer if what we could do instead was

193
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,460
Wait for a letter that says hey, we think you're infringing before this change happens, you know before we just throw all these users under the bus or

194
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,600
Wait for a single person to get sued over this in this in this manner like

195
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,120
Not that I'm arguing for reactionary

196
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,280
but at the same time when you make a change like this is the equivalent of removing the ability to do mp3s and

197
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,520
kind of makes me sick that I've been doing this for 15 years and

198
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,000
This is what we were talking about 15 years ago. And here we are 15 effing years later

199
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,880
I mean, it's just yeah, I'm thinking about switching all next minute. I know right mp3s, man

200
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,320
I mean, that's why I meant was a thing right and so that's just sort of wild but I I understand what you're saying

201
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,120
But I'm not totally sure I'm convinced in the business incentives for

202
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:31,160
The h264 consortium to sue people for using h264 and playing back video because it only broadens their market share

203
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,640
It only increases their monopoly. It only strengthens their position in the market

204
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,920
So it doesn't seem like they're very incentivized to go after people that are using consuming

205
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,360
distributing h264

206
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,360
It seems like you know, probably they're going after set-top box manufacturers

207
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,640
cable providers

208
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,600
televisions

209
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,000
Blu-ray makers that's the kind of people that you know that they can get that they can extract millions out of

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,920
But going after somebody like the RIAA did back in the day for pirating mp3s

211
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,680
That's just not the world we live in anymore. It just doesn't make sense. They're never gonna make a dime at that

212
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,920
So I don't really know what the risk factor is. I guarantee that I can't just I know I understand

213
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,400
I can't come here and say guarantee. Well, they're not gonna sue I can't do that

214
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,880
So there so since the risk factor is you know, at least 1% or whatever

215
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:27,360
They're gonna respond this way and Carl sums it up nicely over in matrix. This whole thing is a mess. Yeah, it is it is

216
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,960
It just you know

217
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,400
and I think what's so upsetting about it at the core of it is it doesn't seem like there's a

218
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,760
right answer for the fedora project and

219
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,000
It seems like it's a tougher question for fedora than it is for every other Linux distribution

220
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,440
and I find that frustrating and then the other thing that I find frustrating is that there is a history of giving and taking a

221
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,120
little bit in features and I find that to be a

222
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,000
little bit aggravating and then it's like we just started to solve the Nvidia driver problem

223
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,840
We just started to get decent flat hub integration

224
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,880
We really started around the corner on codecs and being able to do all this stuff

225
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,120
Like it really was removing some friction and barriers of entry to fedora

226
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:13,000
And it was really truly making it possible to recommend one of the great distributions to everybody and now those barriers are

227
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,400
Starting to go back up. It is a form of free software gatekeeping and it's happening now at one of the I think most important

228
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
Distributions and I'm just sad about it

229
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,020
Yeah, there was kind of this era where like it felt like at least a lot of this sort of commentary layer would advise

230
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,840
You know like well if you're gonna go through you're probably gonna need something like rp infusion

231
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,440
Yeah, I'd have all these work around to that now

232
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,260
But and for a while it felt like we weren't like we'd really gotten to a point that you know for some esoteric use cases

233
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,360
Yeah, you got to figure out some stuff out

234
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:44,920
But for just normal using a computer stuff fedora had really gotten just installed and forget. Yeah, I agree

235
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,760
And I understand it too doesn't mean I'm not frustrated by it

236
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,620
I'm we're obviously still gonna use an install and love fedora, but yeah

237
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,160
Yeah, it's just now I'm gonna be getting that stuff from I don't know wherever I can get it

238
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,880
You know if I have to go down a shady alley on the internet

239
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,360
Oh, yeah, I've got a sketchily compiled copper that you might want to check out

240
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,020
Maybe fluendo is gonna get another 80 bucks out of me or something. I don't know. That's what I used to have to do

241
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,840
Back in the days to go buy my codecs and I'd put them in my folder so that way I could play my mp3s on

242
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,480
fedora

243
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:22,320
Alright, so there's another story going on on the internet right now that I thought we should talk about because we just haven't really gotten

244
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,440
a chance and

245
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:32,440
that is that the internet has discovered through some sleuthing that pop and the cosmic desktop is going to make use of a

246
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,920
rust based toolkit called iced

247
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,600
And they're doing this in place of GTK

248
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:53,320
So this is a replacement for a GTK and the news here is that cosmic was believed to be a GTK based desktop environment

249
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,080
but it seems that system 76 has evaluated their options and have picked the direction of

250
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,240
iced and

251
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,040
this was noticed by individuals on reddit and

252
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,040
Then a discussion kicked off from there and I thought before we got to the discussion

253
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,680
Maybe we talked a little bit about iced and kind of what it is and what the goals are

254
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,280
So simply as I understand it is a cross-platform

255
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:25,720
GUI library and it is as you may have noticed written in rust and it has a focus on simplicity and

256
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,240
type safety as many things in rust do and

257
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,700
And Wes you were mentioning that it's been inspired by something that maybe is a pretty good sign for this type of use case

258
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,660
Yeah, it's inspired by Elm

259
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:43,980
which is a front-end framework and and language but heavily inspired by functional reactive programming and functional programming in general and

260
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,740
it's a different model of how you think about modeling UIs and states and

261
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,300
Instead of sort of the older style that that GTK definitely is this promotes like you're separating

262
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:59,980
The things that implement how your stuff gets rendered from the data that describes the tree that you are rendering

263
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,580
And so you can kind of operate in a style where you describe what you want it

264
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,740
It's a it's a more declarative approach where you say like I need I want it to look like this and the underlying engine can

265
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,740
Figure out how do I take what we've got now and make it there instead of a much more

266
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,580
Imperative sort of procedural style that a lot of traditional UI programming has been right

267
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,860
But it would seem like the the mobile operating systems have been making a steady march towards declarative UI design and which

268
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,360
Accommodates a lot of different mobile use cases and size screen sizes and whatnot, right?

269
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:27,900
Well, I mean, yeah

270
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,460
You saw it in the front end and react has some of this at some of its underlying principles

271
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,620
Elm really defined the like that the data flow model in one way data flows and you sort of update your data and then that

272
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,340
Sort of can reactively cascade and then update the parts of the UI that need to get updated without you having to sort of

273
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,780
explicitly say that and

274
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,020
It turns out people like that approach or similar approaches

275
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,420
Especially if you can get the efficiency, right which seems like rust has a lot of opportunities to do that

276
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,020
But you've seen like Swift UI is an example of adopting some of that compared to the you know

277
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,100
the older objective C standards Swift UI is embracing some of the same thing, so I

278
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,460
Don't know how I've never used ice

279
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,740
I can't say how knife is experience it is but I think if you're trying to target developers who do

280
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,860
UI work in the modern world

281
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,060
They'll have heard about maybe they haven't used down

282
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:18,300
But this is a model that they're gonna be familiar with and I don't know. I still haven't really learned how to use GTK

283
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,780
And yeah, I mean GTK is certainly popular

284
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,800
But it doesn't seem like it's lit the world on fire and there's a lot of momentum around rust based of it

285
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,300
There's that element of it

286
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,400
And I don't know if I could really you know

287
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,780
Declare which one has more technical merits

288
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:38,300
But it seems the team at system 76 really likes what ice has to offer for what they want to build and obviously it seems

289
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,780
I mean, it's obviously new right system 76 as well. We'll get into here

290
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:47,740
There's gonna be need to be contributions to make iced fully functional GTK right is has a lot of functionality

291
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,540
I think no, we're not trying to say this could be directly comparable

292
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,940
Yeah, it's not feature to feature for sure

293
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,580
But there are some reasons why just used to GTK maybe isn't interesting to all developers

294
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,220
Do we know of any other projects using ice at this point or any projects we can look at to see maybe its capabilities?

295
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,260
We were taking a look earlier today at the iced toolkit

296
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,420
Which we will have a link to in the show notes

297
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,620
And so you might be able to from there figure out who else is using this they have a lot of examples

298
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,540
So I would like to try some software that's using this that might be something we tracked down

299
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,020
It is they do note on their github that it's currently experimental. So who knows things may change

300
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,860
I don't we'll get into this too, but it didn't seem like, you know system 76 weren't really coming out and

301
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,060
announcing a bunch of this

302
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:36,940
Maybe we should also view some of this as like exploring. Oh, hey, we're we know that they've heavily adopted rust internally

303
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,340
They've got people there who are comfortable using it like using it

304
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:44,260
And so if you did see like oh, there's a new approach to doing cross-platform GUI stuff

305
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,580
I wonder if this could work for some of our some of our software

306
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:47,900
Yeah

307
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,860
That was the sense I got is they were building widgets internally that kind of reached a point where like we got to decide and what?

308
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,600
We're gonna do here and ice just seemed like the way they wanted to go

309
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,260
they want to say this is our GUI toolkit for cosmic and

310
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,740
They said they deliberated about it a lot and decided to go with iced

311
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,100
and I I

312
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,300
Have seen the reaction to this and we'll get to that a moment

313
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,060
But my general take on this is that we'll see we'll see where they go

314
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,020
we'll see if they get the accessibility stuff added I think they've got the motivation and the determination to do it and

315
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,220
Pop is a reasonably sized distribution

316
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:28,580
But it isn't the largest player out there and it seems to me that it's in that in that almost perfect market position

317
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,240
To experiment with this kind of stuff where they'll get a good user base

318
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,420
They'll get a really good amount of varied feedback because they have a diverse user set they have feedback channels, right?

319
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,340
I mean they have they have short lines and sure it does seem like they have conversations with their user base to some extent

320
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,660
So yeah, they absolutely will get support tickets to when things don't work

321
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,280
There's that element because they're selling a product that runs this stuff too. So they get that channel

322
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,580
It's not getting thrown into the void. Really? That's what I'm trying to say

323
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:52,820
Yeah

324
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,020
I think that's probably a fair assessment and I think it's a good size to experiment and see how things go and

325
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,380
It's not like they're creating a bunch of proprietary code. That's only gonna work on cosmic

326
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:09,500
So if they build something that seems pretty reasonable, well, then maybe the folks over at mint can take a look at it

327
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,300
You know something something like that

328
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,980
So I feel like they're kind of in the perfect position to be an R&D lab for this type of endeavor

329
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,060
I think that's just fine because if it goes horribly wrong

330
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:27,020
It doesn't really hurt the rest of the Linux desktop in the upstream projects and if it goes tremendously well

331
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,260
Then that's free software that anybody can adapt and use if they want to

332
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,460
Will they that's the other question

333
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,620
the as they say bad blood here is

334
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,860
I think getting to an impasse and

335
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,800
This time around as Cassidy put it on Twitter

336
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,900
The annual flare-up was kicked off based on a comment

337
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,140
Made by a different system system 76 engineer in my opinion

338
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,740
It basically was just stating kind of matter of the fact why GTK wasn't working for them

339
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,900
and

340
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,860
I think you could argue the original iteration of the post wasn't

341
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:12,580
Probably as delicate as it could have been but it wasn't really necessarily hostile either. It was just matter of fact

342
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:19,380
And it essentially said that GTK just wasn't the best choice for the job and they preferred iced and kind of went to some reasons

343
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:26,180
But the way that GTK was described I think kicked off a whole new round of online battles

344
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:31,060
Just has been a mess since then. Mm-hmm, and it can be tough sometimes when you're looking, you know

345
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,500
And especially in various community forums. What's the scope?

346
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:39,820
Do you interpret this as a statement of fact from someone who's trying to assert a position or is it a more of a like?

347
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,500
An you know, IMO this is how I view this and think about it for my use cases. I don't know

348
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,660
you never say those things so they just sort of implicit in yeah, they're stated as an implicit statement and

349
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:55,420
We'll have links to all of some of this all of some of this in the show notes

350
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:00,020
It's kind of ridiculous for the most part a brief summary. I would describe it as I

351
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,380
think

352
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,100
the gnome team has been

353
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,460
sensitive about comments made by engineers at system 76 and

354
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,460
I think they've transitioned from being sensitive about those comments to being sensitive about the fact that

355
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:22,820
Something hasn't happened to those employees to penalize them for those statements or prevent them from making future statements

356
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,820
And so now it's kind of become

357
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,260
Gnome camp against system 76

358
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:34,500
which of course creates a hostile work environment and they throw shade back and forth at each other and

359
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:41,200
if you think that one side is has the moral high ground here, then you're probably not familiar with the argument because

360
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:48,000
there is I think a point on both sides and it's one of these things that I think also in my personal opinion is

361
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,840
Spurred on by the fact that there may be a bit of concern that iced once it's been properly

362
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,800
Contributed to and has enough features may be a genuine alternative to something like GTK and perhaps

363
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,280
It's created a little bit of defensiveness from the gnome side. Yeah, it may not be true

364
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
But that is how it's kind of coming across

365
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,040
Especially when you see the discussions that are going on in their matrix chat room, and I think we've all been in places

366
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,360
rightfully, or wrong only, you know when we see

367
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,200
ambitious or not new

368
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,520
Approaches in the Linux community. I think we're sensitive to like another one of those, you know

369
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,960
We have several cross-platform gooey toolkits like yeah, right or we have a package manager like that. I know you have your own ideas

370
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,960
I I don't think you know we get we're allowed to have those thoughts. We should be careful. Maybe how we articulate them because

371
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,720
That's always gonna happen. That's what happens in our free software world, right? Things things change new stuff. Get it opposite it wins

372
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:45,040
Contests either on merits or just on popularity. I the other part of this I found interesting though was

373
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,320
When cosmic was sort of first launched

374
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,960
We weren't sure what it was cuz it's kind of like a collection of plugins and is it like is it really just you know

375
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,160
Is it just you know? Yeah, so this to me signals like there might be a lot more interesting to watch in the cosmic space

376
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,040
Generally, right that's kind of how I see it. It's like, okay. Well now we all of a sudden have ourselves

377
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,920
A genuine new contribution here. That's actually based on some technologies that you know

378
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,480
If you're just looking at things from the surface level and you're like I I would like my

379
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,240
Desktop to be built with these tools or these tools

380
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,160
I would actually if I was just hitting the reset button, I would also probably pick iced

381
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,240
I mean look at it. It looks pretty great

382
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,200
And then Jeremy's got I mean the team does but I think Jeremy's been primarily updating it

383
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,240
He's got a checklist going which I have linked in the show notes about things that are going into iced for cosmic about accessibility

384
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,320
Features and font and issues and they have identified a lot of things that they want to contribute upstream and they have been I

385
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,320
Found at least three and there may be more but I found I think at least three

386
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,280
Contributions from the system 76 team to iced upstream

387
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:48,280
So there the work is going in and this is just beginning and I think you're right. Let them experiment. I feel like they need a summit

388
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,920
Like they need a Switzerland to come in and and a gnome system 76 summit

389
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:00,520
If I were Carl, I would be considering maybe flying out some of the gnome team to system 76 and just showing them what you're doing

390
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,920
Showing them your team meeting the team in person because that's always a different experience

391
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Taking them out treating them

392
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,760
thanking them for their contributions for what you can build on top of and

393
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,920
And recognizing that stuff and celebrating that stuff and seeing if that doesn't create some kind of bridge because when I watch the discourse

394
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
this time around I

395
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,560
Feel like the fouls may be on the gnome side and I grant that

396
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,600
Initial language could have been a little more diplomatic, but the reaction the plotting all of that

397
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
that's really on the gnome side and

398
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,840
Unfortunately, I still think it's on system 76 to fix it. You know the gnome sides volunteers

399
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,560
They're people scratching an itch system 76 side their employees people building a product

400
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Trying to make money. Maybe I don't want to make money

401
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Trying to make money. Maybe I have a stronger notion of a sort of collective representation that you know

402
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,200
Folks don't you know can be tough to interpret to like a speaking as a person in the project or just as a person in your

403
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,240
Own who has your own opinions about these things and the people involved and yeah

404
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,680
I don't think this situation gets better until some side just puts their hands up does the mea culpa and just

405
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:12,640
Bears and grins it and I think I mean, right? Yeah, I mean I respect really all the people involved

406
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,480
There's a lot of important work happening. I use all of this software and I want to continue to do so

407
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I hope I hope it gets worked out

408
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,840
I really do and

409
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,920
I'm also very interested to see what gets built and if any of any new ideas can get explored from this so stay tuned

410
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
We'll let you know

411
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,520
Linode comm slash unplugged go there to get a hundred dollars and 60-day credit on a new account

412
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,000
And what a great way to support the show because you try out something fantastic like Linode

413
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,760
And you support the show Linode makes cloud computing simple affordable and accessible

414
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,680
They're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the hyperscalers that want to lock you into their crazy platforms

415
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,800
They also have fantastic support and the thing you guys know, I always care about performance

416
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,200
In my opinion, it's the best and it's just not something I just randomly came to I tried them all

417
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,480
I've tried them all and nothing's as good as Linode. Let me tell you and I'm not the only one that says that

418
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,720
There are independent studies that verify that as well, you know, it's it's kind of a simple math

419
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,200
Really they started about 19 years ago

420
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:21,680
they had to be really good to survive especially when businesses that started as bookstores came along and realized they had a bunch of

421
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,640
Extra infrastructure they could sell and make even more money and then other cloud providers got in the game because they realized hey

422
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,500
There's this cloud thing and we can call stuff whatever we want and charge whatever we want. It's great

423
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,000
It's just so great. And so they invested from their other products

424
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,320
Maybe their operating system market or their book sales or maybe some VC guys just can't work out

425
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,520
Just came in and just started dumping money in there

426
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Linode had to compete with all of that

427
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,560
While just building a good product to do it. So that means they've got fantastic dedicated support

428
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:57,640
That means they have the best performance. They've got 11 data centers today. That's fantastic and they are their own ISP, but coming soon

429
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,300
There's gonna be more than a dozen new Linode data centers

430
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
They're turning it up past 11

431
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,200
2023 is gonna be such a great year for Linode and that's kind of the point

432
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:15,420
I think I would just want to leave with you when I'm deploying infrastructure. I want something I can just leave running for three five

433
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,840
Maybe even longer, you know years. I'd love to have something that's up there eight years

434
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
You know if we could keep it up to date maintain it. I

435
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,120
Don't want to have to rebuild and move this stuff

436
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,720
So that's one of the big calculus is that goes into who I pick as my cloud infrastructure provider

437
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,320
And that's why when I just look at all of the things it's Linode every single time

438
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,240
And that's why they're willing to give you $100 so you can try it yourself

439
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,760
You can form a complete opinion because $100 at their pricing means you can really try things out

440
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,400
So go support the show and grab that $100 and try out Linode. It's Linode.com slash unplugged you go there

441
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,860
You support the show. It's a great way to thank them for supporting our road trip

442
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:01,240
Making the West Coast tour possible as well as checking out their service and kicking the tires Linode.com slash

443
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,240
unplugged

444
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,960
We do have some things to chat about here in the housekeeping

445
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,720
I want to give a big old plug skis for the matrix room any of them Jupiter broadcasting.com slash matrix join our decentralized chat

446
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,080
It's pretty simple to go create yourself a matrix.org account or set up a home server

447
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,400
Not as simple that way but you can do that as well

448
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,320
You come in here and you join us

449
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,120
we're gonna keep our West Coast crew room going because we're gonna have future West Coast trips and as we

450
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,480
Expand out and do our next future thing. We'll set up chat rooms

451
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:41,200
In fact, there's a petition going around around right now to create a Portland specific chat room. Yeah, I may may have made some promises and

452
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,560
Actually, I'm I guess I'm making promises for you Chris because you're the one who ultimately makes the room

453
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,920
So I guess I couldn't I forgot about that. I thought West had to do all things like that

454
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
But it turns out I do have the power

455
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,440
Yeah, and I also I want to just put on your radar for all things open coming up

456
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,560
I know Alex from self-hosted is gonna be there

457
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,040
There's gonna be some other community members that are making it to all things open

458
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,040
But we don't have any current meetups to plug. That's it for right now. We'll find out about future events pretty soon

459
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,440
But doesn't that feel kind of weird? I've got a few in the works that I yeah

460
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,720
May not have well, you know shower thoughts, but Wes and I may have one coming up

461
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,760
But we don't quite want to announce it just wow

462
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,480
So you guys are gonna just hold your own little private meetup without me. Is that what's happening?

463
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Oh

464
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,880
My god audience Chris's are fine audience right right just not this one. Yeah, cuz I got you

465
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,320
Well, you'll be busy with some other things that we're cooking up. This is a interesting

466
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:44,320
We do have some baller boosts to get to we like to feature the high amount boosts that came into the show to really support

467
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,360
the production each episode and the first one this week came Zins from

468
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,740
What what came Zin it came Zins from sir lurks a lot

469
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:02,520
52,118 sets the truth is you bought him because you like them. They have value to you. That's what matters

470
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,240
He says I listened to the double live stream on my last day off and these stats reflect the duration five hours

471
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,700
21 minutes and 18 seconds. That's crazy. That was a long one. I'll be crazy including user lurks a lot

472
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,720
No wonder why we are exhausted when we hit the road

473
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,600
This is I hope you enjoy the sats as much as I enjoyed the show now boo CLI does not support the raw

474
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,520
Linux unplugged RSS feed. Oh, it's like if you just go to our website, really? Yeah, that's embarrassing

475
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,160
Well, it's because we don't generate that. Yeah, it keeps coming up, doesn't it? Yeah, that's the thing for the future

476
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,920
Talk about that in the future

477
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,840
But if you do grab the feed from podcast index, you can put you can point you can point you can point

478
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:48,400
Boo see like that. I can barely talk. You're trying to get some boost the first place to start podcast index

479
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,200
But so when boo CLI fails it gives you a broken heart emoji as the error message

480
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:00,740
If that's not a reason to get boo CLI installed. What is lurks a lot came in though with pod verse and Albie to the rescue

481
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,720
He says you sure did tout boo CLI as the leap man's boost a gram which got me to figure it out

482
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,940
It worked for office hours. Okay good it is I honestly if you get boost a gram working

483
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,840
It's sort of like a Littman's test of just like a certain level of technical excellence that you must hold

484
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:22,640
Yeah, boo CLI requires a domain of knowledge multiple domains of knowledge

485
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,640
So I feel like if you get boo CLI going well, then I we should be sending use it. Yeah, really?

486
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,040
Yeah

487
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,960
we should maybe that's something we should think about actually if people include like a lightning address or something or an invoice and their boost or

488
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:43,560
Like they're boost for boost lightning URL. We should boost them back some sats if they use boo CLI and thus declare them the master of their

489
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,560
own domain

490
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,440
John a comes in again, is this is this six is this might be six? This is insane

491
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,240
I wonder how long can this be kept up? We need a counter John a says well now I'm just trying to keep my streak alive

492
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:07,940
Maybe we can get like a JB website subdomain like, you know, yeah a John a streaks

493
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:13,120
Is it is it broken yet sort of thing, right? That's an interesting idea is John a still a baller.com

494
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,040
Then we just need a little way on github where we can just flip it yes

495
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,000
No, and then the action made that stuff, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I love it. I love it

496
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,400
Thank you, John a for your support also sir looks a lot

497
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,360
We have some more boosts that will be in the show in just a little bit

498
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:35,480
We really appreciate you guys for supporting us ask not what your podcast can boost for you

499
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,960
But what you can boost for your podcast?

500
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,240
So since we got together last week, we had one last meetup

501
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:51,140
We had a few things we wanted to chat about but we also have major breaking news on the show

502
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:56,140
The Pasadena geocache has been located brum brum brum

503
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,500
Tell us Brent. What are the details live on the scene in the studio? What are you learning Brent?

504
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,180
I'm here on locations a little rainy

505
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:11,500
But I did discover an email this morning that suggested that listener JD found the geocache

506
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:18,380
They write as luck would have it. I was at a nearby doctor's appointment while listening to Linux. I plugged on Monday morning

507
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:25,620
Amazing, which is literally the morning it aired the advantages to listening when it's just been published. That's right

508
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:31,700
I went to the park immediately after and honestly found it in the very first tree. I searched. Okay, that's great

509
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,500
There are a lot of trees in that park. Yeah, and it took you guys

510
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,140
Forever to find it. They give a little bit more information just for our sakes

511
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,380
I'm a recent listener having just started sometime after the JPL signups. Whoa, that's great

512
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,740
Otherwise, I would have loved to have put my name in the hat. I'm new to Linux in general last year

513
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:56,580
I installed Ubuntu then docker just to run a minecraft server for my son and his friends. Oh, yeah

514
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,660
I've also just started testing paperless NGX. Oh

515
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,500
Thanks for all that you do and feel free to leave more caches in Pasadena

516
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,620
Yeah, we'd had a good time doing that

517
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,620
I think that's something we could do more often because

518
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,260
We could come up with like a perpetual cache to one that's like designed to like have a note

519
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,740
You leave something take something. We could have a special

520
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,100
Matrix room for people who found the cache, you know with the URL

521
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:28,460
Oh, that's a fun idea see what when you can build your own rooms at willy-nilly styles

522
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,380
You can do all kinds of things. That's great. I am so glad that they found that if you found we have another geocache

523
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,180
we have one in Sacramento and

524
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:43,900
And there's another oh, yeah, the near grants pass near great in grants pass southern, Oregon area

525
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:52,220
We also failed to drop one near Portland. I think we meant to yesterday and we had a lot of things

526
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:58,740
So I may just grab it on my way home and drop it off somewhere in the mountains. Yeah, so we're up there in, Canada

527
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,800
Well, it could be in the US version. We'll see. Oh, no, I say do, Canada

528
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,980
All right, if you can that makes it a cross-border. Oh, I guess the problem is there's nobody up there

529
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,180
Well, the 16 of us can go searching for yeah, it might take a while. Let's get a sealant and syrup

530
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,980
It's a whole thing. Yeah. Yeah, you got it like bait them in. That's how it works

531
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,680
So since our last show we had the Portland meetup, which was our last meetup on our way north

532
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:27,420
We had we just have never stopped in Portland for a meetup because we're always blasting through to get home and we felt like we owed

533
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,060
this audience

534
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:34,300
You know a little bit of a get-together, you know for how much we talk about Seattle Portland's a special place

535
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,900
And you know, we gotta treat it right and it's not that far away. So Wes came down like a legend

536
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,460
He showed up during just just like, you know, like like like a like a total boss

537
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,940
He shows up about a half hour after it started. So of course, he has a grand entrance

538
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,380
Every everybody's sitting down. So when Wes comes in

539
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,180
And that was really great

540
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,900
I thought it was a highlight of the night that you made it down and it made it so much fun and then afterwards

541
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,020
um

542
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:10,620
You got to carpool with or I guess caravan with us for a bit and stay in lady jupes

543
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,620
You got your first night and lady. I know I mean, how long have I known you?

544
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:17,780
Yeah, and this is my first time I couldn't believe that was your first time. I mean, I've stayed there

545
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,780
What like 40 nights or something?

546
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,140
I'm sorry, you had to be there when the automation systems were down. I just felt very embarrassed about that

547
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,020
It's kind of nice actually because I think the next time you know next time I stay a night there

548
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:36,540
It's gonna be all the slides will be working. It'll be top-notch. That's true. I have a modern ZigBee setup. You're right

549
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,580
I'll be able yeah. Yeah, that's a good point. I'll be able to top the current one

550
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:45,180
Whereas if everything was working it would have peaked. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna see a huge improvement

551
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,400
I'm excited for right at least now the pressures on a plus you got a little time with Levi

552
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,220
Oh, yeah, I got some morning snuggles with that cute dog. Yeah, he's a good boy about that

553
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,900
these were great meetups that we went to and the

554
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
amazing thing is

555
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,780
every single

556
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:08,820
location was sourced and ID'd by our audience by our listeners like

557
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,520
Micah, I'm wearing a NASA t-shirt in honor of the occasion the road trip

558
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:20,780
Very very thoughtful and did you come up with this place if I remember correctly? I did suggest it

559
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,500
I've eaten here before I live about ten blocks away. So

560
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,100
So you just wanted it to be convenient for you. Is that it? Well, it worked, didn't it?

561
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,940
And I noticed you grabbed a bunch of swag and stuff

562
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,980
Is it nice to hang out with a bunch of like-minded people here?

563
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,860
Yeah, it's great because you know, my wife is a very intelligent person

564
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,380
But her eyes glaze over when I start talking about Linux and she wishes I would change the subject

565
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,220
So it's fun to be around people who are interested in this stuff

566
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,100
And is this your first JB meetup?

567
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:56,540
It is not. I went to Chris's birthday bash in January.

568
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,260
I wanted to be there, but I couldn't be there. How was it? It was great

569
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:05,780
I thought I was gonna have the record for coming the farthest

570
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:12,140
But there was actually a listener there from Puerto Rico who happened to be in town on business. So I lost that contest

571
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,500
Of course, well you were second best that's good enough

572
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:22,700
Yes, it's funny how at these meetups like there's always the okay who came the furthest. Yeah, it's always shocking

573
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:29,020
It's shocking how far people come for these meetups. You know, that was listener Jose who showed up both in, Colorado

574
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:34,300
Do you remember that? Yeah, of course here at the studio and I was half expecting him to also show up at one of our meetups

575
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,700
I know I always do now. I always think about Jose. You're always welcome

576
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:44,060
Yeah, he's always welcome. They're really all great. The Portland one felt really easy

577
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,380
it just felt like just clicking and talking to old friends and there was such a a

578
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,820
broad range of topics at the entire table and

579
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,180
It was a long table. They they gave us basically one end of the building

580
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,500
Which was great because we needed that space and they were very accommodating

581
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:07,140
All of these breweries were so super chill and so accommodating. Yeah, that's what's nice

582
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,380
It's like you can have a kind of a really mixed group. It's not super crowded. There's a lot of nice space

583
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:16,300
There's you know, there's non-alcoholic drinks alcoholic drinks different types. There's stuff Brent can have

584
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,820
There's usually a pretty good food menu

585
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,580
Yeah, and just the general general vibe is you know come as you are and hang out for as long as you want

586
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:26,180
yeah, and just you know make for great conversation and

587
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:32,060
Listener Nick and listener Joel put some of the best things about these meetups into their own words. That's been great

588
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:37,140
we've had some wonderful cold beer here from migration brewing and

589
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:42,580
a lot of good people fun people and it's just good to sit and talk with people about

590
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,820
self-hosting and

591
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,580
Linux and and you know, yeah not get the glossed over stairs

592
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:55,660
And and so a lot of really good conversation tonight and was that your experience as well?

593
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,980
Yeah, the meetup has been a lot of fun

594
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:02,740
we've been able to talk about all kinds of topics from Linux related to

595
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:07,460
You know jogging or running or TV shows or

596
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,100
every everybody's

597
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:15,220
Familiar with ads and ad blockers and so that's been a common topic as well

598
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:20,700
For techies and non techies alike. So yeah, there's plenty to talk about. It's been wonderful

599
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:27,140
Yeah, I agree and at our end of the table we were talking about like no-till farming and all sorts of things

600
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,140
so it's like amazing to me the

601
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:35,220
breadth of topics that we can just connect on really easily and that's what I find about these meetups is it's just

602
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,900
Great fun and people that you could just become friends with really easily. So thank you both for being here

603
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,480
Yeah, thanks for having us and putting all this together

604
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:48,100
it's it's been great and it's great to put faces to your guys's voices and and

605
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:54,260
Get some great swag here from Linode and thank you as well. Thank you

606
00:45:54,260 --> 00:46:00,860
Yeah, it's been great to chat with people all kinds of interesting conversation and like you said putting names to faces. It's been great

607
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:06,820
Thank you. You know, the real trick is once they see our faces do they keep listening? Yeah, that is we'll find out, right?

608
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,820
I think we have a good shot because

609
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,860
Several of these meetups that we went to

610
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,220
Afterwards there's talk about they want to organize their own event

611
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,980
They want to keep it going even if the JB crew can't be there. They want to be there big meetup energy

612
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,460
Yeah, there is a lot of big meetup energy and I always think man

613
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,180
I just wish we had a website we could tell them to go to and self organize

614
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:31,780
I want to build a self-hosted meetup site that the audience can use to self-organize. I think they'd use that

615
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,020
I will said there's some cool energy at the meetups as well

616
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:42,020
Like SUCD at the Portland meetup just gave us some gifts like some weird 3d printed. What would you call them Chris?

617
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,360
Fidget spinners kind of I mean they were really neat though. We sure fidgeted with them

618
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,420
Yeah, the kids are fidgeting with them right now. Yeah, that was really great

619
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:54,580
And other folks brought other gifts at the other meetups. So everyone who gave us all sorts of things. Thank you very much

620
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,460
Yeah, very nice audience. So generous. So nice. So too good too good

621
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,900
We should probably just fold in fold the cards close up shop and it right now

622
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,780
Ended on a high note because I mean just always so nice when you go see these people

623
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,780
How could it ever be any better? How could you ask for anything more when you're doing these shows?

624
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:15,120
I was chatting with someone at the Portland meetup and they put they put a nice contrast on it

625
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,000
This gentleman went to a fair number of regular sort of tech meetups

626
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,680
I think you know did sort of DevOps things professionally which many, you know

627
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,460
Many of our audience or developers or do full-time tech stuff

628
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:32,880
But that's really all you get at those sort of tech, you know, right focused meetups and a lot of these JB meetups

629
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,060
It's it's just such a nice mix of people who do it for work. Yeah, but

630
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,440
Not the people who only do it for work occasionally, but it's it's enthusiast, right?

631
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,480
And it can be like you're just doing home automation at home a lot of self strong self-hosted showing

632
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,320
I think in Portland or you know

633
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,320
You just like this stuff at work and you want to learn you you're so interested like I think you know

634
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,520
We have been that you just want more of it

635
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,280
So it's an interesting thing because you know Brent had a chance to chat with a few people and I was listening back to the audio

636
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,660
This morning and just based on the conversations I had had to

637
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,720
Yeah, not everybody is doing Linux as their day job that comes to these meetups and some of them

638
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,200
They're just people who like to geek out and go deep into topics and Linux is one of the topics

639
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,600
They're going deep into and I think they're just looking for content

640
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,480
That has you know high production standards that they want to listen to that digs into this kind of stuff

641
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,480
and so they begin to build a

642
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:29,320
whole set of knowledge around this topic by listening to the show and then by checking out the things we talked about because they're

643
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,240
Just intellectually curious and then they take it to the next level and actually go to these meetups

644
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,520
And I think these people are better than me because I just don't think I'd ever take it to that next level

645
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,640
But they do two things. I love about that is one. Yeah, right that they can take it to levels

646
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:48,440
I don't have because I think there's a there's an enthusiasm that sometimes you know the professionals you get a bit tired and jaded

647
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,960
Stuff when you gotta make it work and you have to get up at 9 a.m. And like do the thing

648
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,920
But like when it's when it's the when it's your release when it's a something you're genuinely excited about

649
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,200
It's good to have that energy. Yeah, and then the other part is once you've got the Linux bridge

650
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,960
Yeah, like for folks with so many different backgrounds. It's a chance for us to really learn a lot

651
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:13,400
Although I got to say some of my favorite conversations are the jaded professionals that have like, you know what I'm talking about

652
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,920
Those are great conversations. We always we always have a good chuckle with those ones too because yeah, we know we've been there

653
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
We feel we're part of that set. Yeah, I

654
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:28,660
Think it's probably also important to note that West the only reason you and I are here from from a bunch of JB meetups

655
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,760
It's right. Oh weird, right

656
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:38,760
Yeah, the meetups are us and we are in the meetups. Whoa, we are made on the meetups the drop. Yeah, it's crazy

657
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,800
Thank you to Linode too. If you're thinking about getting some hosting seriously, check out Linode, you know

658
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,880
They they invest in these kind of meetups so that way our community can connect

659
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:54,180
Professionals can talk to other professionals. They can network. I overheard people, you know exchanging details for jobs for you know

660
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,880
Contact us for getting a job like that kind of stuff was going down Linode, you know

661
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:05,280
They're investing long-term in the community and that I think is a particularly keen insight into how they think about this stuff

662
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,560
and how they try to support it at a real like

663
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:14,720
Grassroots level so Linode comm slash unplugged. Yeah, we had plenty of tech failures, but none of that was Linode's fault

664
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,720
I don't know the stuff we hosted on the node that just works

665
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,680
Bit warden comm slash Linux bit warden is my password manager

666
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:30,960
It's West's password manager and they have been just going at full speed. They recently announced fast mail email alias integration

667
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:38,320
They have great new features for your vault a browser extension that has been turned up to I'm gonna say 13 not even 11 and

668
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,480
They've even been giving love to their command-line interface. Yeah bit warden

669
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,540
I don't talk about it, but they have a command-line interface as well

670
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,040
They have a flat pack app too

671
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:52,660
Which is like the first thing I install now on my genome desktop and bit warden wants to remind everyone that October is cyber security

672
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:59,860
Awareness month. So this is something just as a moment as just say, you know, if you've been trying to bring up that conversation

673
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,340
This is something you can do to kind of put your foot in the door

674
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:07,780
It's cyber security awareness month and using a strong password is like number one with a bullet

675
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,780
Which you can do to protect yourself online and bit warden can generate and store strong passwords for you

676
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:17,460
it's easy to enable multi-factor authentication. It's also recommended you keep your software up to date and

677
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:23,000
Honestly, you should be aware if your passwords are being used online and watch out for phishing as well

678
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,100
These are all things along with a great password

679
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:30,060
Keeping your credentials unique across your websites and your services. You can do to really protect yourself online

680
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:37,340
As bit warden would like to tell you and I would like to remind you there's really nothing better you can do than just having

681
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:42,700
A great place to store your secrets and share them privately and securely because these are things you're gonna have to have

682
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,300
You're gonna have logins. You're gonna have two-factor codes

683
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:51,780
You're gonna have secret information like passphrases or maybe bank account information those types of things for families

684
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,200
Bit warden can be the place to store that you're gonna have that kind of information just happens. It's life

685
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:02,540
And multi-factor authentication is a great way to add a little extra security to your accounts there, too

686
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:06,340
And enabling two-step login on bit warden improves the security of your password vault

687
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:11,220
You've got options like verification through email or authenticator app or Fido to our Yubikey

688
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:18,660
You could also do that and premium subscribers can also have bit warden generate time-based one-time password authentication codes for your accounts

689
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,380
Which adds a little bit of strength there, doesn't it?

690
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:26,120
All of this added together makes bit warden a fantastic and incredible maybe even the best I'd say tool

691
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:32,700
To protect yourself online bit warden support security for all with fully featured free accounts available to everyone as well

692
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:40,360
So this cyber security awareness month protect yourself and help protect the loved ones around you your friends your family by educating them on password security

693
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:46,120
They probably already think of you as the tech person. They know this is a great opportunity to use that influence for good

694
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,480
And send them to bit warden.com

695
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:56,520
Slash Linux go get started with a free trial for teams or an individual plan right now at bit warden.com slash Linux

696
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,600
As always we got some great feedback

697
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:07,380
Thank you everyone for sending that in Paul wrote in and writes I want to thank you for introducing me to silver blue

698
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:13,280
For the first time I don't want to throw my ancient HP stream laptop into the trash every time I use it

699
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:18,400
This distro seems to run crazy fast compared to kabuntu running on the exact same system

700
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,980
And it's not nearly as glitchy with the suspend and resume

701
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:28,260
It's the first time I've used redhat and fedora anything and so far. I gotta say I'm impressed

702
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:33,280
hmm, you know, I didn't say which version of kabuntu he was

703
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:39,080
Switching from but some of this I don't know. What do you think West but couldn't some of this just be explained by a new

704
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,000
colonel

705
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,760
Well a new colonel is always a nice upgrade. Yeah, I mean especially you're talking like like a big jump

706
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:50,400
Yeah performance improvements sleep suspend improvements. There also could be something about Wayland

707
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,860
I notice a general smoothness with Wayland that I don't get on x11

708
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:00,680
So if you're coming from kabuntu using X you go over to your silver blues using the Wayland's

709
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,000
It's gonna be a smooth experience there, too

710
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,820
And I don't even know if we need a dissect it

711
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,880
I think we can just be happy like people live in that silver blue lifestyle

712
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,920
Like it's true right like silver blue works for people. It's not a you might expect sort of the reverse, right?

713
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,560
You're like, oh, well, I did silver blue it all of these weird exceptions. I had to figure out

714
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,240
That's not what Paul's writing it about. No, you know what the kids say. They say glow on

715
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,680
Glow on and they're really into a mutability

716
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,480
Ian has a pretty close to home request here for meetups

717
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:35,360
Ian writes when is JB coming to the East Coast like East Coast of Canada surely, you know

718
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:42,440
There's a big audience here in Toronto a big audience in Toronto. You say well, I believe that leads us right in teleboosts

719
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,760
And now it is time for the boost Sam's quanch boosts in with

720
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,760
16,180

721
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,320
You guys ever plan to come up to BC for stuff

722
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,480
I mean Vancouver and Victoria are pretty large tech communities these days

723
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,040
Thanks and keep up the great work. Also Sam's quanch here reveals that

724
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,840
16180 first five digits of the golden ratio nice

725
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,480
But I think here we have to defer to our local Canadian, right I think we should well

726
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,440
I think one thing that's fascinating about where we're sitting exactly right now geographically is

727
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,760
Sam's quanch here says when you're coming up to Victoria and it turns out it's kind of at the same latitude

728
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,360
I think so that's a fascinating thing about Canada. There's one tip for you

729
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,480
Mention maple syrup. Yeah, I would actually love to see a Canadian road trip

730
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,840
Although I feel like that's maybe a little bit more of a dedication than what we just did on the west coast here

731
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:51,800
But certainly there are a few locations that would be great to do a small little thing Chris

732
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:57,680
Vancouver's not even that far for you. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely want to make it up there gosh

733
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,920
I mean

734
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,960
It's hard to talk about it right now when I'm feeling like I never want to do another road trip for the rest of my life

735
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,200
And I live in an RV. So that really tells you how hard it was

736
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,800
Earlier you said you didn't want to do an American road trip. Oh

737
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,640
Right. No, actually I really would like to do it. I wonder I know

738
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,040
There is a season of life that I am in now

739
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:24,520
where it is really hard to travel and so I just kind of like cram it in there like a maniac and then just sort

740
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,760
of like

741
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:32,100
Chaos ensues hate yourself a little. Yeah, but I feel like there will be a season of life

742
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:38,920
Where dad is not as interesting and then maybe dad will travel more, you know, I'm saying I'm not saying I'm your dad

743
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,600
I'm saying I'm literally my kid's dad, you know get right you get where I'm going with this

744
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,800
And so maybe I'll travel more, but I don't want to wait that long at the same time. So

745
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,480
Well, I'll just you know what?

746
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,240
This is just the booster is listening now

747
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:56,940
So I'll get into it if you are in a city that has a venue that would be willing to host a couple of crazy

748
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,520
Podcasters and host, you know 30 40 60 of our closest friends

749
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:08,160
Get in contact with us if we could start finding venues in these areas where when we get there we can produce a show

750
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,360
because I'll tell you what happens friends is

751
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:16,600
We kill ourselves get into these places holding these meetups doing the driving and then we don't have any show afterwards

752
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,880
We don't actually record a show there and then you didn't because you're driving

753
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,300
It's hard to find the time to do the work to figure out the plan the show

754
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,220
Yeah, we're doing seven-hour drive days. Then we're prepping for a show

755
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,000
Then I'm waking up at six in the morning four in the morning

756
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,840
Whatever it is to drive or do a show and I'm either driving or I'm doing a show and I just realized that's crazy

757
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:41,040
So instead let's go to a location. We'll do a show there. We'll do it live and you know

758
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,860
Maybe moderate like ticket something cheap something that's affordable

759
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,640
But maybe we could pay for our tickets to fly in or something like that

760
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,540
So if you're in an area like Vancouver or I don't care, Ohio

761
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:58,440
I don't care if you got a venue they got food I can eat and they can host some of our friends and the three

762
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:04,600
Of us they're willing to watch some buffoons make a podcast in real time. Let us know Chris at Jupiter broadcasting calm

763
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,320
We're better yet. If you really want me to see it boost it in. Oh

764
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:12,480
Speaking of boosts a young dookie boosts in with four thousand and forty eight sets

765
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,720
I wanted to point out three projects that helped me mapping location searches on

766
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,520
Android I use an app called a castus photon

767
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:28,280
Which you can use to search for points of interest and then it lets you open the result in whatever your map or navigation tool

768
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:33,120
Of choice by default it uses the photon project public instance

769
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:39,040
But can be self-hosted. Ah, alternatively you can use the polis project polis.io

770
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,280
Which which can also be self-hosted via g code earth safe travels

771
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:51,640
So the mapping situation on Android is an interesting one. I've been running graphing since the road trip was like a

772
00:58:52,760 --> 00:59:00,080
Weekend to the road trip. I started using graphing and I quickly realized that I still was I kind of ended up needing to use

773
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:04,880
Google Maps, but this is not a lot of great mapping options when you really are like

774
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,480
Really depending on this thing

775
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,480
like I need because I also I

776
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,920
Need satellite images to check out gas stations to see if they can fit tubes to make sure I can get in and out

777
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,960
And man Google makes that really crazy easy. And if you don't have Apple Maps

778
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:24,480
Which I didn't done graph, you know us I kind of ended up falling back to Google Maps, which kind of stunk

779
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,280
I'm sure I could figure out a better solution. I'd love to hear what people do for like the satellite images

780
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,000
I don't necessarily need it for navigation, but I needed to review an area

781
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,560
I need to be able to plug in an address or GPS coordinates, you know to me

782
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,160
Let me know Michael B. Boos in with 3000 cents

783
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:47,880
Chris I would love to hear which of the GNOME workflows you learned

784
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:51,440
GNOME workflows have been a very popular topic on

785
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,480
Like just I don't know every

786
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:59,320
Morning or every like constantly Brenner talking about this because he's been trying out pop OS

787
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,840
You're trying to get him to fundamentally change how he uses a computer. That's true. And

788
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,720
So workflows have been coming up a lot

789
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,000
I'll tell you here's a real quick rundown of how I've used GNOME and I found it really effective

790
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,520
It's very first thing I did around the GNOME 312 era

791
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:18,640
But I think you could do it anytime is I just decided to spend a month each day

792
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,880
Or each week or whatever I needed at the time learning the GNOME way of doing things

793
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,600
So I just decided well if GNOME doesn't want me to use minimize and maximize

794
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,760
I'll try without that for a bit

795
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,120
I didn't always stick with it like that one I I didn't stick with

796
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,000
but some of them I did and one of the things I adopted that I find to be pretty effective on GNOME especially now with

797
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,800
Horizontal or workspaces on laptops is I full screen a couple of apps

798
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,680
But I do that thing where I put two apps together

799
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,440
So maybe like one screen will be element

800
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:54,120
It'll be big and wide and then I'll have like a small version of telegram on that same desktop

801
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,280
And that is always desktop too. And then I I use an extension

802
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,600
I think it's called like auto window or something like that or there's an extension that will automatically

803
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:09,200
We'll find it for the show notes right Wes. Oh surely. Yeah, sure that automatically opens applications on specific workspaces

804
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:15,360
So desktop one is always my web browsers desktop two is always my primary chat applications

805
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:21,520
desktop three is gonna be steam and desktop four is usually just like a catch-all where I just put all kinds of stuff on there and

806
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:27,200
The console kind of just floats between the desktops where I need a console. I also have a drop-down console

807
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,000
I think it's called D term

808
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,840
But there's a few options that I like a lot and I combine all of that

809
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,600
Along with a couple of essential extensions like I like to see a workspace indicator

810
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:42,080
I like to have a few more system tray icons than you get by default. So I combine all that together

811
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:47,640
Auto move windows you already found it and it is in the show notes and that will automatically put

812
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,760
Certain windows and certain virtual desktop spaces and I find that to be an essential way to use

813
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,120
GNOME and Chris do you use a different workflow depending on whether you have three monitors or not?

814
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:04,160
More or less mostly with GNOME if I have a if I have multiple monitors I leave

815
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:11,020
The external monitors on a static workspace and I just switch the main monitor workspace most the time

816
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,020
not always

817
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,780
most of the time

818
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:16,780
We got a boost in from user

819
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,900
6475 just 64 humble sets

820
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:26,020
B-o-o-s-t coming in with my little fountain FM boost. I wanted to say thank you and keep up the great show

821
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:27,180
I'm curious though

822
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:34,100
Are there fewer emails to read on the show because people have moved to boosting or have those been getting put to the side?

823
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,780
Podcasting to know seems like a great way to support creators

824
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:42,340
But I don't want to see those who haven't come over being left behind kind of like the boosts

825
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:45,860
and we do the same thing with emails where we select for content and

826
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,660
There's definitely been less emails now that there's more boosts

827
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:57,500
But you also get more boosts because the lengths are shorter than probably 80% of the emails that we get

828
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,060
Yeah

829
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:00,220
It makes them very easy to select them because they're already

830
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,860
Essentially cut for the show and so you can get to more of them as well

831
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:09,780
But there has been a shift which has been interesting also seeing that on Kota radio not a huge shift not like a ginormous

832
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,900
shift but a noticeable difference as

833
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:17,500
And that's fine in a lot of ways. These are easy to process too. So that works for us

834
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:24,300
What I've noticed is actually the emails tend to be the long-form ideas that are sort of deep dives

835
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:30,860
if you will and the boost seems to be the place where all the the quick ideas or the just quick questions come in and

836
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:36,220
They're not lesser either way, but they've just evolved. I think yeah different things

837
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,300
And kind of what but each is best for I suppose

838
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:47,540
Cyprus boosted in with 1200 sats. Hey guys, have you thought of doing an osint? I guess that's like a

839
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:56,580
Open source intelligence episode. I've only just discovered a Loki net which looks like Tor but seems to use blockchain behind it

840
01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:01,340
So I went and looked at Loki net have either one of you guys seen this? No. Oh, man

841
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:04,340
I don't know if this is anything actually worth totally trusting

842
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:09,780
But they sure make a cool-looking website totally like know their demo is

843
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:16,220
Oh, I better check that but when you scroll down look at that black hole animation they have on there

844
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:21,220
That's how you know, it must be high-quality software. It's got a black hole animation. You see that? Okay

845
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:27,420
It is it does seem to be GPL 3. Yeah, I actually I mean I joke but here's what they pitch

846
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:34,700
Decentralized network onion routed traffic and no IP address looking at hides your IP that you're connecting from and to

847
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:41,980
Your location and identity are unknown. All traffic is onion routed. Your browsing is private secure and anonymous

848
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:48,940
L-ok I net org if you want to check it out. Yeah, they do seem to have a fairly extensive FAQ there

849
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:54,580
I kind of I kind of minute. I actually kind of interested you started talking blockchain for this kind of thing

850
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,780
And I'm a little skeptical

851
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:02,780
Blockchain hasn't been great for much other than as a distributed ledger for Bitcoin

852
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:08,780
Maybe we'll see something else. I'm kind of impressed by hive. So maybe they're on to something

853
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:14,140
We shall see if you guys want to check it out. I'd be down if anybody actually let's start with this

854
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:21,740
If you've tried Loki net let us know give us your first impressions your thoughts and if you get us interested

855
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:24,780
Maybe we'll check it out. Yeah. Why is it worth spending time on? Yeah

856
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,340
Why that over tour because tour seems like it's got the network effect, but maybe I'm wrong on this kind of thing

857
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:33,340
But I don't have cool graphics. Oh, yeah tour doesn't have a black hole do they Wes?

858
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:39,140
I'm not that not last I checked I hadn't checked today. So yeah, we'll have to check back. Maybe they will

859
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:43,780
So true grits boosts in with the traditional Trek boost

860
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,580
So I had been asking

861
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:50,980
just to get an update on how far behind people tend to fall from time to time and then they're

862
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:56,300
They've been boosting in to let us know and true grit says I got about a month behind on all the podcast

863
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:01,260
But I'm glad to say I'm officially caught up now and thanks for the exclusive member feed bonus last week

864
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:04,460
Well, you're welcome. Yeah, we didn't have a traditional live show

865
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:11,260
but we had something we want to turn around for the audience because you know what we love our members and so we wanted to

866
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:17,420
Get them something even if we weren't live and we have a boost from bronzewing this week 9001 sats over 9000

867
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:27,380
Okay, so this is really awesome we mentioned that JPL used to use Solaris well bronzewing writes in

868
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:34,380
that the shadow UAV the drone that the US Army uses is currently in its second version and

869
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:43,380
The first version didn't use rail use Solaris, but the second version of the shadow UAV is running rail

870
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:49,380
They run rail on the stations to control it and they run Red Hat Enterprise Linux on the actual drone

871
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:53,380
Wow that the US Army uses that's pretty wild

872
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:59,380
Also bronze we wanted to say that fountain FM now has carplay support nice update

873
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:04,380
And so he can now earn sats while he drives glad you guys had a great time at JPL

874
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:09,380
Hoping maybe you guys can swing by Boise sometime. Thanks for the show boost you later

875
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:15,380
Yeah, we got to get to Eastern Washington. We got to get to Boise little Spokane Boise. Yeah, that'd be fun

876
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:17,380
Yeah, I'm not taking the RV though

877
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,380
Parking that thing

878
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:25,380
Never do another road trip again. Oh, yeah, just a car caravan this time. Yeah, why not? Why not? It's a race you say

879
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,380
I love a race. So let's go

880
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,380
But I mean that sounds a lot of fun. But no actually one day we'll road trip again

881
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:35,380
But in the meantime, I'm taking a break

882
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,380
Soltros boosted in with 11,000 sets

883
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,380
The coolest thing about stadia was its portability

884
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:50,380
I have a really nice gaming rig with Ryzen 5600 X a ton of RAM and an RTX 3060

885
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:56,380
But I also enjoyed gaming like destiny 2 on my phone. Oh destiny 2 is a great game

886
01:07:56,380 --> 01:08:03,380
I know it had its issues, but it was just so ahead technologically compared to things like Amazon Luna Xbox xCloud

887
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:08,380
Etc. It's a shame to see it go. I agree. It was technically better

888
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:13,380
So for example, the NVIDIA GeForce streaming stuff is pretty great for a Linux user

889
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,380
Because you can import your Steam library

890
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:21,380
So if you bought a game on Steam, you can stream it on GeForce. Now stadia didn't get that stadia

891
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:24,380
You had to buy the game, but it was like a headless game

892
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:30,380
You would hit play and it would launch you like way into the game into like the menu of the game

893
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:33,380
But on things like GeForce now

894
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:41,380
You actually like remote desktoping into a Windows virtual desktop is renting yourself like a temporary Windows VM to game on and then it starts

895
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:46,380
Steam.exe and you sign into your Steam account including like you got to go do the two-factor stuff

896
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:52,380
And then like it's got to like super fast download the game which works pretty good because they got fast internet connections

897
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:56,380
But it downloads the game and installs it on the Windows VM then launches the game

898
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:59,380
And then you're playing the game and you go through the first time setup for all the game stuff

899
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:03,380
And while it detects your hardware right stadia didn't have any of that. I

900
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,380
Talk about like it's already gone

901
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:10,380
Marcel wrote in with 3000 sets

902
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,380
stadia is a self-fulfilling prophecy

903
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:21,380
Everyone knew Google would cancel it at some point just like they cancel everything. So nobody used it. So Google had to cancel it

904
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:25,380
It can't be Linux's fault alone the stadia failed

905
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:31,380
It's the old-school thinking of game publishers even a Windows VM would trip up anti-cheat

906
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:39,380
They were referring to Marcel's referring to the verge kind of pin some of this on the fact that you had to target Linux and Vulcan

907
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:43,380
Which is funny because I'm sure the same verge would be happy to run a piece about what a hit the deck is

908
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:48,380
Just so backwards for 12 Linux boosted in with

909
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:59,380
What do you call that two megs of sats?

910
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:01,380
Thanks for the shootout last week

911
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:07,380
I didn't purchase a stadia because I didn't trust Google to keep the service operational and leave me hung up to dry

912
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:11,380
When money is tight, it's hard to gamble on these types of devices

913
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:15,380
Perhaps if they stayed at launch they would keep it operational for a certain number of years

914
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:20,380
The reception would have been a bit better. Thanks for the quality content and great job everyone

915
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:23,380
So this makes me wonder I have a question for both of you

916
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:28,380
What does Google have to do in the future now to get you to think their next product? They're going to launch

917
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:34,380
Maybe it has a subscription. Maybe it doesn't what do they have to do to convince you to actually try it would something

918
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:41,380
Like a minimum years like 412 Linux is suggesting like we guarantee this will exist for five years

919
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:48,380
Would that get you to try it or is that ship sailed because of the privacy concerns like what?

920
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:53,380
What does Google have to do comprehensively to get you to trust their next product boy?

921
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:58,380
I mean on the face of it that sort of guarantee sounds nice, but can you really trust that guarantee?

922
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:02,380
You know like there's the question of that because like four years in they're just like wow

923
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:07,380
I know we said that we're gonna do the same thing where we refund you so we're not really like breaking our promise in that way

924
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:15,380
Yeah, I think I'd need to hear you know, I mean if they just had a product that legitimately went well and that I wasn't interested in

925
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:19,380
But there was like, you know, I would could get over that hump to the next phase that could do it barring that

926
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:25,380
I feel like I I would want to either understand how it was connected to their sort of core ad business

927
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:31,380
That could maybe justify like okay if I can understand how this is like directly in that bottom line then like a type of transparency almost

928
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:37,380
Yeah, maybe I could understand like do they have strong incentives to keep it working because it is part of their business

929
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:44,380
Otherwise, I think I'd want to hear more from ex Googlers or like some more of the culture

930
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:50,380
Because we just hear so much about like how segmented everything is sometimes internally how there's this sort of like

931
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:57,380
Launch a product to get promoted and then you know, you move off that team and go do some other things until that changes

932
01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:02,380
Are there some kind of inkling that they have more of an overall holistic organizational focus?

933
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:07,380
I don't be hard to trust anything Brett. What if they guaranteed that?

934
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:15,380
Everything they do for this product if they ever shut it down will be GPL. Does that change the calculus for you?

935
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:22,380
This is such a hard question. I think I think that would at least get me really looking but then it becomes almost like

936
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:29,380
Very different than everything else they've done. So is it just a new business is interesting question. I feel like

937
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:37,380
Surely there are certainly some wonderfully intelligent people working there who are just like us and like the people who showed up at our meetups

938
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:43,380
And I want to get to know those people but Google as a huge massive business

939
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:49,380
Has always tripped me up and I've I don't I actually don't think they can really do anything

940
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:56,380
Get me signed up. I wonder if that's how I'm wondering if that's that's how most the audience is feeling to let us know what you think out there

941
01:12:56,380 --> 01:13:00,380
What would Google have to do or could they do anything to convince you?

942
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,380
And I mean think about it

943
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:09,380
Like if there was some sort of transparency approach like Wes is talking about and some sort of commitment to a time and maybe a release of code

944
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:12,380
Maybe transparency on privacy. What would it take?

945
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:18,380
Let us know boostin or linuxunplug.com slash contact because I'm wondering if it's just they're too far gone as a brand

946
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:22,380
Could you imagine if they released stadia's source code just be like, oh we're shutting it down

947
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:26,380
But you guys can well the issue is and I'm wondering I'd like to hear somebody address this is

948
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:29,380
How do you solve the infrastructure aspect of something like that?

949
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:35,380
I like I mean the only way I can think of it is if they had some sort of portable self-hostable version of stadia that they let you download or something as a talker container

950
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:39,380
But the pie can't do it. Yeah, right

951
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:46,380
I mean, that's just I'm wondering I'd love to hear the audience feedback on that one. We got a thousand stats from happy listener

952
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:53,380
I thought y'all should get a boost for recognizing the fact that you maintained a really high audio quality standard even went on the road

953
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:58,380
I'm impressed. Oh, you should see what we had to do to make that possible

954
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:05,380
I don't know. We want to admit on air. We might get in trouble by Airbnb, but we had to make modifications temporary modifications

955
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:08,380
But I'll just say this turns out beds

956
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:14,380
Mattresses sheets blankets. They all make for good temporary sound 60 pillows too is yeah

957
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:18,380
What are you more useful for podcast any of what you usually use it for?

958
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:20,380
I wanted to say to happy listener

959
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:23,380
Thank you for recognizing that kind of value and then returning that value to the show

960
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:26,380
That's exactly the kind of value for value exchange

961
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:29,380
We're talking about or like how listeners that helped us source great locations

962
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:33,380
For breweries or listeners that show up to the mumble room or participate in the community

963
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:36,380
Those are types of a value for value exchange that we also really appreciate

964
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:40,380
So when you recognize something you appreciate we appreciate about the shows and you boost in to recognize it

965
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:45,380
It means a lot to us. Also. I think we should give a special shout out to our editor drew

966
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,380
Who did extra work to make sure that we sounded as best as possible?

967
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:52,380
No matter what we throw at him. Yeah, and also when we had technical difficulties

968
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:58,380
That meant that we recorded what like three hours later than we were expecting right still got through it, right?

969
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:02,380
That is very true. That really was pretty flexible and pretty awesome of drew

970
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:08,380
So thank you to drew for making it sound as good as it possibly could too and then last boost of the show goes to

971
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:10,380
Mr. Rustic cast of Versa

972
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,380
Comes in with a thousand sats

973
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:22,380
I've been a listener of JB for a decade. You spoiled my ears with amazing audio quality. Stop it you guys. Oh my gosh

974
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:26,380
JB is the best in the biz when it comes to high quality consistent audio

975
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:32,380
I hope to try out RoboSats soon the reason I actually included this boost right here. I hope to try out RoboSats soon

976
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:37,380
And I hope to have time to spend in the matrix channel and have someone hold my hand as well

977
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:40,380
lol RoboSats is a great way to get

978
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:46,380
Anonymous Bitcoin really simply through a system that I think is a great experience and

979
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:51,380
See, I was hoping I could buy robots with sats. You could probably one day probably

980
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,380
I mean, I don't know how you do us could try it

981
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:57,380
And I do have a few thank yous out there

982
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:02,380
We got 2600 sats from grounded grid suggesting that we try out software to find radio

983
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:05,380
We heard that at the meetups too. So something will be playing around with

984
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:11,380
10,000 sats from Deleted who is testing out his new breeze install because he don't want to switch podcast apps

985
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:14,380
We got a 500 sats from DM Marowski

986
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:21,380
Not sure about that. I don't think so the Marowski. All right with their first boost and a shout out to real maple syrup

987
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:27,380
Yeah, one of your brethren. Uh-huh one of 16 good and we got a thousand sats from couch Fox

988
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:33,380
Which is a great username who is a member and also boosted in and would like to have the member feed boostable

989
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:38,380
We do have member feed upgrade scheduled as one of our next projects and then bend

990
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:44,380
I boosted in with leet sat saying they're also looking forward to those member feed upgrades. Okay, okay got we got it

991
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:50,380
We got no bad coder or nomadic order five boosted in 557 sats. Just great to see you guys in Pasadena

992
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:53,380
Cheers, sir. That was so much fun

993
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,380
It was yeah

994
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:59,380
If you'd like to support the show get a new podcast app and get all the new podcasting features like chapters

995
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:07,380
Host info sat streaming search and boosts. Well, then you need a new podcast app new podcast apps comm go get a podcasting

996
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:11,380
2.0 compatible app or if you want to nerd out and go with boost CLI

997
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:18,380
You absolutely can and if you don't want to switch apps Albee alby something worth checking out and so is breeze

998
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,380
be our easy

999
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:25,380
Technology if you're interested in more of our back that behind the scenes adventures

1000
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:31,380
Office hours this week is gonna have some pretty juicy content. I think we ran into let's just say a

1001
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:38,380
Few little issues and so stay tuned for that one office hours 14 coming up and also

1002
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:43,380
we'd love to hear from you if you have any ideas on how we might have done the trip a little differently or

1003
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:46,380
Ideas on maybe a pic since we're missing one this week

1004
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:53,380
Please hit us up Linux unplug comm slash contact. Yes, and it's a pics. Let's get some audience pics coming in

1005
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:58,380
I like that. Remember if it's a certain language then it gets a standpoint clip

1006
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:03,380
You're invited to hang out with us for the live stream as well. We do it every single Sunday

1007
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:08,380
We and we don't have technical issues at Jupiter tube at noon Pacific 3 p.m

1008
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:14,380
Eastern generally, but we'll convert it to your local time at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar

1009
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,380
if you're in the industry

1010
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:19,380
you owe it to yourself to check out Linux action news or if you just want to

1011
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:25,380
Stay apprised of all the things going on in the world of Linux and open source that really impact the industry Linux action news

1012
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:31,380
Comm it's really a companion to this show wouldn't you say? Oh, yeah, I would say I mean we're on it

1013
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:35,380
So we might be biased. No, I think so, too. Yeah. Okay Brent's not on the show

1014
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:41,380
We can't fit all the news in this show because we have like, you know stuff to talk about projects to update

1015
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,380
Ridiculous servers to update live on the show

1016
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:50,880
The news goes in the section is that's right links to everything we talked about today. Well, that's over at Linux unplugged comm slash

1017
01:18:50,880 --> 01:19:17,880
479 thanks for joining us. We'll see you right back here next Sunday

1018
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,880
I

1019
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:38,080
Have a little update that I think I should probably share well ain't honest

1020
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,720
Well, as you know Chris intimately, I've been using the dev one the whole trip

1021
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,080
Yeah

1022
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:47,640
And we decided to leave my x250 here at the studio a big moment

1023
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,120
The trusty ThinkPad was left behind for the newly deployed

1024
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,880
dev one with

1025
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,280
Cosmic not with plasma and I you know

1026
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,320
Despite some listeners at some of the meetups trying to convince me

1027
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:06,880
Otherwise I did stick with cosmic the whole time you did I did and I even resisted adding

1028
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,640
13 extensions to make it look like Chris's setups

1029
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,840
Yeah, I kept trying to tempt you

1030
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:20,120
but I'm curious did you stick with it because you were committed to sticking with cosmic or did you stick with it because

1031
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:27,760
The schedule was so unrelenting. We didn't even get five minutes to install packages. Let alone switch a desktop environment

1032
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:29,160
Yeah, you know I

1033
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:33,200
It's both. I certainly haven't updated since we left the studio

1034
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,360
So I feel like yeah

1035
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:42,840
The schedule was tricky in the sense that we were just moving constantly at every hour of the day

1036
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,280
But now that we're stead now that we're staying put now that we're now that we're in the studio

1037
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:51,280
What happens next this plasma go on there? Well, I don't know

1038
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:55,000
I feel like maybe you know, we've got what an hour before our dinners ready

1039
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I feel like we can come up with something more adventurous

1040
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:05,880
And I just want to take a nap
