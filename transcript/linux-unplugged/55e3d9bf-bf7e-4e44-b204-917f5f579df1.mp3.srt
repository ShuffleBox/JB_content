00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 24 for January 21st, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,520
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's reporting

3
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,400
from the trenches of the Init System Wars.

4
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
And my name is Matt.

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Hey there, Matt.

7
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,880
You know what this is right here?

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
What?

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
This is episode 24.

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Already?

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,640
And that's a special number because it does one of two things for me.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,560
Number 24 always reminds me that we are really just getting started, right?

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,520
We've got a long ways to go still.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,580
But it also always makes me think of Jack Bauer, who was, well I spent some time loving

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,580
on Jack Bauer for a while.

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,480
Now I'm over 24.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,300
But in this episode it's a little bit like 24, this TV series, because there is a war

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,800
against Upstart.

19
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,160
There is a full-fledged assault against Upstart as Debian is nearing their vote.

20
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,040
Now in the Linux action show, we said it looked like it was maybe going towards System D for

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
Debian's choice.

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:31,400
However, it is now four to four, four for Upstart and four for System D. It's head to

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,840
head match and so commentators are taking to the web, opinion makers as it were, are

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,480
going to the web and posting their for or against it for Upstart.

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,680
It's been actually a fascinating conversation, but on top of that, if we still have enough

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,240
time after that, and we might not because there's a lot to cover there, if we have enough

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,880
time, I want to talk also about, I want to respond, might be a better way to put it,

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,160
but I want to respond to some of this FUD that you're seeing crop up as new Linux users

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,120
come over to Linux to try out Steam.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,760
And there has been a lot of jabs thrown at Microsoft, Paul Thrott and among others reported

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:10,520
last week that internally at Microsoft, they consider Windows 8 the new Vista.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,040
That's what they call it, the new Vista.

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,040
And that has got some Windows users in a tiff.

34
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,440
And so they are responding to the people switching to Linux with a lot of FUD.

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,600
So here we are in episode 24 of Unplugged.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
We'll get into some of that.

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,840
But Matt, you know what we should start with?

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
What's that?

39
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Probably our feedback.

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,480
That'd be a good place to start, don't you think?

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,560
I think it's an excellent place to start.

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
I know.

43
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
And you know what?

44
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
I think it's wasted effort.

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
Oh, who let him in here?

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Oh my goodness.

47
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,680
I thought we kept him in a cage somewhere or like in the back room or whatever, right?

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Oh man.

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,400
He's kind of like a, you know, we bring him out when things get really serious and we need

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,520
some backup, we unleash Richard.

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
That's right.

52
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Get it out of here.

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
As he always says.

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
All right.

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,080
Well, first I want to just cover a little bit of feedback.

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,240
So Jimmy wrote in to the Linux Unplugged show and he says, I've been a JV viewer for a

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
little over a year and I love the show.

58
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,080
I look forward to seeing it weekly and enjoy participating when time permits.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,680
I recently bought a hobby laptop that I'm using to experiment with different distros

60
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
and desktops.

61
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,000
I've been a KDE fanboy for some time and really love the interface customization and

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,320
capabilities of the built-in widgets and apps that get the job done.

63
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,000
However, I've become bored and frustrated so I took the arch challenge via Antegoros.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Antegoros.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,680
I'm sorry, it's just ain't for me.

66
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,280
I won't dig into the topic here and I'm not banging on the distro or arch concept.

67
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,280
I just didn't like it and I was missing a couple of odd packages I needed for work stuff.

68
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,440
So I moved to another distro with no fewer than 12 on this laptop in succession.

69
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,040
He says, I want to give a quick plug for Solid K. It's well put together.

70
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,440
So I've landed on the right distro base, Debian, but now it's the desktops turn.

71
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,760
I've tried out several, which include elementary, Cinnamon, KDE, Xfce.

72
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,360
What the heck's going on in our community?

73
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,320
Honestly, I don't feel compelled and I hate having to use that word by any of them.

74
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,920
I know how to tweak KDE to make it look awesome, but dang, I just want something different

75
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,360
and nice to look at.

76
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,960
I think elementary is close, but it lacks some innate features that I like, e.g. a

77
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
trash can and minimizing customization.

78
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,360
Cinnamon's looking pretty good and I thought I had found a new home, but it kept freezing

79
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,360
up.

80
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
So adios.

81
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,320
I don't like mate, and I just don't like the Windows, the Window Managers, WMs.

82
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,160
So I thought, what do I have left?

83
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Unity.

84
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,000
If I had more customization and Canonica would decide to make Ubuntu a rolling release, it

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,760
might do it, but then, for now, I'll have to pass.

86
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
So what have I got left?

87
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,800
If there's anything the community should focus on for 2014, I'd vote for improving

88
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
the desktop environment.

89
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Think about it.

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,260
What's the first thing a new user sees when he installs Linux, besides grub?

91
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,360
The entire experience can be tied down to how well the desktop environment handles a

92
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,080
user's input right now, and they suck.

93
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,880
So that might be being a little harsh, but I feel kind of jaded.

94
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,080
If only there were a way to tie together the awesomeness of KDE and the simplicity of GNOME,

95
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,300
make it fast, lean, and fully customizable, and put a stinking trashcan on the taskbar,

96
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,580
and minimize.

97
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,080
Make it different and modern, and no more cartoony icons.

98
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,880
I wish I knew how to do it because I can see it plainly in my mind.

99
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,460
Anyways, he says thanks for letting me rant.

100
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Thanks again.

101
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,460
Jimmy.

102
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,600
You know, I honestly would say probably what he's going to want to do is revisit XFCE.

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,100
Not because out of the box it's butt ugly, I'm not going to argue that, but actually

104
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,400
spend a good 30 minutes or so really hunting down a good level of customization that really

105
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
meets his needs.

106
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,940
I think he might be surprised and actually get that sweet spot he's looking for.

107
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,360
It's not an automatic fix, but I think it's definitely something to consider until GNOME

108
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,440
and KDE are able to do what he needs.

109
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:31,260
Yeah, I agree, and also sometimes it's a really hard thing because sometimes you cannot like

110
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,060
something because it's just so different, and it's hard to recognize that's what's actually

111
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,060
going on.

112
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,640
Or it might be interfering with his workflow too, and I mean I can understand that too.

113
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Well, that's why you won't like it, right?

114
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,680
Because if something's different and it interrupts your workflow, it slows you down, it makes

115
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,720
you less efficient, it makes you have to constantly rethink what you're supposed to do.

116
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,480
However, I was just talking about this on the pre-show, but one of the things I've done

117
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,280
since our In Defense of GNOME episode that we did on last a few weeks ago is I forced

118
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:01,100
myself to just keep using GNOME because a lot of times I jump around, and I become an

119
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,300
expert in all but a master in none when I do that.

120
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,440
And so I said, okay, no, Chris, you're going to use GNOME for at least a month, if not

121
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,680
more, and every day you have to teach yourself a new GNOME way of doing things.

122
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,520
Whatever the GNOME philosophy is, and I've been reading a lot of the GNOME tricks and

123
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,120
shortcuts and how-tos and watching some YouTube videos on the way people use GNOME, sort of

124
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,800
retraining my brain.

125
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,840
And now I'm kind of getting to the point where I'm not just kind of liking it, but I'm loving

126
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
it.

127
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
I want to become a GNOME advocate.

128
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm like, this is great.

129
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,760
And if you spend the time to relearn how to ride the bike and then ride the bike in the

130
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,380
right way, it is incredibly rewarding.

131
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,840
But the process of getting there requires that level of dedication, which nobody really

132
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,080
has the time to do in the real world.

133
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,360
People aren't podcasters who actually need to have perspectives on these kind of things

134
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,980
and so have the luxury of forcing themselves to do this.

135
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,260
People have work to get done.

136
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,440
So I totally understand where he's coming from here, but it is one of these hard things

137
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,400
where sometimes you're never going to be happy until you train yourself to live in the way

138
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,980
that desktop operates.

139
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,720
And I think you can do that with anything.

140
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
You can do it with XFCE.

141
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
You can do it with KDE.

142
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,800
You can do it with GNOME.

143
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Those I think require it the most.

144
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,840
And then of course you have your tiling window managers and things like that.

145
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:17,400
And I think what sometimes people want is they want really sane defaults that look new

146
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,560
and have new ideas around them, but aren't really all that different.

147
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,600
Sort of what elementary OS tries to do.

148
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,560
And I also think they're coming from a way of doing things to where they were trapped

149
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,680
in a user experience to where if it doesn't come out of the box that way, you're kind

150
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,040
of stuck, not really taking the time to say, oh hey, I can theme this or oh hey, I can

151
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,600
maybe take a dock, slide it up this direction, move this bar over there, tweak these icons.

152
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,720
Actually look at the way things are flowing as far as, there's so much customization that

153
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,240
can be done.

154
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
But I think you're right.

155
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,380
I think they are victims of a default mentality.

156
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,520
So Friar Tuck wrote it.

157
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
How about that one?

158
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
How do you like it?

159
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
I like it.

160
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
This is a new one.

161
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
And check this out.

162
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,120
So this is why every now and then as the music's playing us off the show, I'm like, hey, could

163
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,760
you please go over to iTunes and give us a rating and a comment?

164
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,560
It helps people find us and that helps them switch to Linux.

165
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
It actually is true.

166
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Here's Friar Tuck.

167
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,240
He writes and he says, first off, thanks for all the great shows.

168
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,400
I discovered Jupiter broadcasting in an iTunes store when I was searching for the Linux podcast.

169
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,080
I was curious and I wanted to learn more about Linux.

170
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,680
Linux Unplugged was the first show I found.

171
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,320
Now see the timing works out because that was back when the show was new and we were

172
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,020
asking people to go comment and rate a lot back then.

173
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,640
And so for a while we were staying very high in the iTunes charts.

174
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,120
Thing is is it requires kind of continuous maintenance from the audience to leave comments

175
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
and rate.

176
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,440
So if you are an iTunes user, please consider doing that because it does help people find

177
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,480
the show and then they switch to Linux.

178
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,480
He says, in this week's Linux Unplugged, you spent a fair bit of time talking about Google's

179
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,640
purchase of Nest Labs.

180
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,800
I think this article touches on a very real reason why Google purchased Nest.

181
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,780
And he links it and I'll talk about that in a second.

182
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,980
The article talks about Nest Labs' robotics divisions.

183
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,320
Google is already heavy into robotics research.

184
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,320
They may have purchased Nest as an investment in futuristic business models rather than

185
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,280
a thin attempt to break into Nest's current business model.

186
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,720
Thanks for all you do and good luck with the new space and keep up the good work.

187
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,160
So this article that he linked us to, and I'll have the full article in the show notes,

188
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,160
they talk about, I didn't even know this about Nest because I didn't really follow them that

189
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,040
closely, but Nest has always thought of itself, according to this piece that was written,

190
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,760
Nest has always considered itself a robotics company.

191
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,240
They say the robot is just hidden inside a sleek Apple-ish case.

192
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,920
They said, look who the company brought in as its VP of technology.

193
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,040
Volke Muskoka, I'm probably saying that wrong, but she is a roboticist and an artificial

194
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,000
intelligence expert from the University of Washington.

195
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,360
They hired to bring her in as the VP of technology and in this article they have a shot of her

196
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,360
right here working with a robot arm at Nest.

197
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,360
And so...

198
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Oh wow.

199
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,520
So apparently, Nest also was very heavily into robotics and we also know that Google

200
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,360
just bought the guys that, who, who, who, ah, ah, shoot, I'm totally forgetting the

201
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
name of that company.

202
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,880
That's a crazy looking arm.

203
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,360
Hey Mumble, what was the name of that robotics company that Google just bought that has all

204
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
the Pentagon contracts?

205
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
What was that?

206
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
What was it?

207
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Boston Robotics or something?

208
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
Boston Dynamics, right?

209
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Yeah, okay.

210
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Yeah, okay, thanks.

211
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,520
Yeah, so Boston Dynamics, they just recently, plus like they bought like eight other robotics

212
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,000
companies last year.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,160
But Google is getting big time into the Rosie the robot role here.

214
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,080
They're going to, they're going to integrate Google now and Rosie the robot.

215
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
I'm a man.

216
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,720
If they have somebody that wants to do my dishes, I think I would be perfectly okay

217
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
though.

218
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Although I can probably do without the maid thing.

219
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,520
I think we could do, we could talk about a trade there, Google, but that's a, that's

220
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,440
an interesting perspective and makes it even a little creepier to be honest with you.

221
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,720
So thanks Friar Tuck.

222
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Thanks for writing in.

223
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
All right.

224
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,760
Well, so we, I have the results of our innovative little guy survey where last week we asked

225
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,840
folks to send in the distribution that is a little, it's small, you know, in, in terms

226
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,920
of distro sizes, doesn't get much attention, but does something really interesting and

227
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
unique.

228
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,680
And we had a form in the show notes for last week's episode and we asked you guys to submit

229
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,520
the name of the distro and why you felt it was innovative and what was innovative about

230
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
it.

231
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
And I've got the results from that.

232
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,440
I guess you could almost call it a survey.

233
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,720
So first, before we get to that, I want to thank Ting.com Ting is mobile that makes sense.

234
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,560
My mobile service provider and you guessed it, also Matt's mobile service provider.

235
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Absolutely.

236
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,140
Ting has no early, no early termination fees and no contracts because honestly Ting is

237
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,640
focused on the customer relationship and on the service for the customer.

238
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,800
And so a lot of the things they've set up are really to that end and Ting has been the

239
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
pioneer at this.

240
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,880
They've been the first doing it and they're doing it the best because it's really their

241
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,280
core business focus.

242
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,200
The people behind Ting is two cows.

243
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,680
Now if you're familiar with two cows, they've done a lot of things on the web for a long

244
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,280
time and one of their missions has always been go into a market that is ripe for disruption,

245
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,560
that needs to be corrected and go in there and offer the service the way it should be

246
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,720
and just gain market share by doing that.

247
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,400
Not by dirty tactics, not by copying your competitors business strategies, but by actually

248
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,040
innovating in that space.

249
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,240
That's what I love about Ting and that's what you would love about Ting too if you go over

250
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
there and try it out.

251
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,200
Not only that, but Ting is an exceedingly transparent company and that is a very refreshing

252
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,960
thing for a wireless company.

253
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,960
They just had a blog post kind of poking some fun at CEO for trying to copy some of the

254
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,400
Ting Mojo and of course falling a little flat on that.

255
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,640
They also have a lot of great things over on the Ting blog like great apps you can check

256
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,880
out, new service updates, roll outs of their tri-band LTE.

257
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,040
When they had the Nexus 5 coming over the Ting network, they were keeping people posted

258
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
over there.

259
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,800
So as a long time Ting customer now, I really appreciate that blog.

260
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,280
I also really appreciate the Ting dashboard.

261
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,280
It really strikes a balance between simple and easy to use, but incredibly powerful.

262
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,760
They combine that with the Ting app and the two work hand in hand so brilliantly.

263
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,880
I can have alerts and push notifications sent to my phone if I need to.

264
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,400
One of the great things about Ting is it's only pay for what you use and the dashboard's

265
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,480
UI makes this incredibly easy to monitor and manage.

266
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,720
They have this really simple dial system that tell you exactly where you're at, sort of

267
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,320
like a gas gauge, and it just clicks with you immediately when you see it.

268
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,400
You totally know where you're at.

269
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,600
You don't have to sit there and dig through all these line items and they're not sneaking

270
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
anything in there.

271
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,400
A Ting plan includes hotspot, it includes tethering, voicemail, caller ID, picture messaging,

272
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
all of that's included.

273
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,440
Ting just takes your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, they add them up at the

274
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,120
end of the month, whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay.

275
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,880
It's $6 a month for the flat line and then it's just your usage on top of that.

276
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
It's extremely straightforward, it's super simple, and Ting has a whole bunch of great

277
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
devices.

278
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Here's how you get started.

279
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Go to linux.ting.com.

280
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,960
That'll take $25 off your first device.

281
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,480
If you've got a Sprint compatible phone, that'll give you $25 off your first month of service

282
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
if you want to bring that device.

283
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,880
They've got a BYOD page you can check out.

284
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,600
Ting is mobile, it makes sense, and Ting is my mobile service provider for a reason.

285
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,560
Also Ting will help you get out of your early termination relief up to 25% per line.

286
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,840
You can go to ting.com slash ETF to find out more about that.

287
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,040
So go to linux.ting.com to get started.

288
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,440
Go check them out, try out their savings calculator, and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring

289
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,800
Linux Unplugged.

290
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,280
Totally love the Ting.

291
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Ting.

292
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Ting.

293
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,040
So I have these results from the survey here that we, well survey, whatever you want to

294
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:20,120
call it, and Angela calculated these using her Computatron 2000, and we got a bunch of,

295
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,000
we got about 60 individual submissions, which is pretty good for a poll that we mentioned

296
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
at the end of the episode.

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh yeah.

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,280
It was spread across a whole bunch of different distros, but there was a few that really stood

299
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,080
out in here.

300
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,960
PerOS came in a couple of times, Bowdai Linux came in once, got a couple of mentions for

301
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,240
Gentoo, but really what, the number one, the number one distro was Manjaro.

302
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Interesting.

303
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,760
Now I feel like, I mean Manjaro is a small distro, I don't, you know, but I also kind

304
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,280
of feel like it might be too big for what I was thinking.

305
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,920
It's, first of all, it's not even like a main release.

306
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,120
I mean, I definitely agree with you.

307
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,080
It's kind of on that cusp and I can't really, boy, you know, when I first started using

308
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,720
it I would say it was probably small enough, but now it's kind of, it's growing so quickly.

309
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
It's kind of hard to say.

310
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,760
PerOS got a submission.

311
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,560
Of course, PerOS has shut down now.

312
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,240
It would almost be interesting to look at PerOS and just say, oh, it's like a goodbye.

313
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Like here's what it was.

314
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,340
Here's what it did great.

315
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,340
So long.

316
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,340
Thanks for all the hard work.

317
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,340
I mean, maybe Crunchbang.

318
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,340
I mean, I don't know.

319
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,280
I mean, but then again, Manjaro was rated highest.

320
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,080
I mean, so this, the other one that came in, the other one that came in second to Manjaro

321
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,640
that I was, I've been, I've never looked at, but we just actually, it was just mentioned

322
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,640
in an email.

323
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Solid XK.

324
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,160
I don't know how you say it.

325
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,160
Solid X.

326
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,480
It is S O L Y D X K.

327
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,640
I believe it's based on Debian and it has a couple of neat features.

328
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,080
And so I think that might be a solid one to check out.

329
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,800
S O L Y D X K.

330
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,440
And it's one that I've heard mentioned by our audience is not one I've checked out myself.

331
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,240
And so this, so not only was it the second most submitted, but it's one that I personally

332
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
would like to check out because I haven't yet.

333
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,160
It's kind of in my blind spot.

334
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,160
So I'm kind of thinking we'll do a review of Solid X K.

335
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,200
Yeah.

336
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
And these are great.

337
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,680
Netrunner OS got in here, Jolly, DSL, a whole bunch of them got in there.

338
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,160
I'll have a link in the show notes if you guys want to see which ones are submitted.

339
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,360
But yeah, it's based on Debian testing, says Art of Music in our IRC room.

340
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
So that could be really cool.

341
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,800
Because you know, a lot of people out there are thinking about Debian testing as a potential

342
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
desktop.

343
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,760
So if they've conjured that into something that's quite nice to use, that could be interesting.

344
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,880
So stay tuned on a future Linux action show where we will have that review coming soon.

345
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,440
I got some other stuff in the pipeline, but that'll be coming fairly soon.

346
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
Okay.

347
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,120
Well, I wanted to talk about something that's, I don't know if you guys have been noticing

348
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:54,760
this, but seems like there's a bit of a war against Upstart these days.

349
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,440
You know, obviously this Debian decision is looming and it's got people coming out of

350
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,000
the woodwork talking about Upstart, talking about the CLA, all these kinds of things.

351
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,560
And so I have a couple of, before we jump into this, I got a couple of recent posts

352
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,760
that just happened in the last couple of days.

353
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,160
Linus Torvalds took to Google Plus and commented in a thread over there.

354
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:24,320
He said, and this was a response to a post that I believe Matthew Garrett had started

355
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,360
about the CLA, and Linus said that, to be fair, people just like to hate on canonical.

356
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,320
But any, in his overall premises, any CLA is fundamentally broken.

357
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,720
The FSF and the Apache Foundation CLA's are pretty much equally broken, and they may not

358
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,800
have been broken because of any, oh, he says, but because of copyright assignment, paperwork

359
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,520
ends up basically killing a community.

360
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,960
Basically with a CLA, you don't get the kind of long tail that the kernel has of random

361
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
drive-by patches.

362
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,520
And since that's how a lot of people try the waters, any CLA at all, like changing a license

363
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,680
or not, even if it doesn't have a license changing provision, is fundamentally broken.

364
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,840
Matthew Garrett went on to say that not all CLA's are created equal.

365
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,640
He said, why do people object so much to canonical when they do it?

366
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,080
He says, I've written about this before in the context of Mirror, but it's worth expanding

367
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,200
upon.

368
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,400
For example, the SFS copyright assignment ensures that contributions to the GPLed software

369
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,000
will only be distributed under a GPL-style license, whereas the Apache CLA permits the

370
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
ASF to re-license a contribution under a proprietary license, but the Apache license already allows

371
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,840
you to do that anyways.

372
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,720
In contrast, canonical ships software under the GPL-3 family of licenses, but requires

373
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,640
the contributor sign an agreement that permits Canonical to re-license their contributions

374
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
under a proprietary license.

375
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,360
This is fundamentally a different situation to almost all widely accepted CLA's, and is

376
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,040
disingenuous of Canonical to defend their CLA by pointing out the broad community uptake,

377
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,160
for instance, of the Apache CLA.

378
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,480
So this is sort of an interesting one-two approach.

379
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,720
So you've got some folks that are going after the CLA and trying to expose what they foresee

380
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,000
as problems that the CLA presents.

381
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,920
And then on the other hand, you have folks who are going after Upstart on a technical

382
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,200
level, like Lenart Potteran, creator of SystemD.

383
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
He took to G+.

384
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,800
A couple of times recently, last night, he wrote, shutting down is hard.

385
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,040
I'm sorry for piling on, but there's an interesting aspect of Upstart I'd like to shed some light

386
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,040
on.

387
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,480
Not necessarily because it's hard to fix, but simply because it's quite interesting.

388
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,360
As it stands now, Upstart will eat your file system.

389
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,600
And then he goes on to kind of explain how in some use case scenarios, if something is

390
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,360
reading a file and it doesn't get shut down properly and your system powers off, it could

391
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,780
potentially damage the file system.

392
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,500
And another post, he says, it appears the Debian Technical Committee is in discussions

393
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,500
right now.

394
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,840
And he goes on to talk about how they're not necessarily talking about technical limitations

395
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
of Upstart.

396
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,800
He says, for example, Upstart doesn't mount file systems properly at boot.

397
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:08,120
The existence of mountall in Upstart and the non-integration of etcfstab into the Upstart rule set results

398
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,480
in a lot of additional shortcomings.

399
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,920
Mountall is a one-time thing for a boot process.

400
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,360
All context of file system devices and mounts is lost.

401
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,400
After it ran, the file system state is henceforth assumed static, which of course is not how

402
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,920
systems work these days.

403
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,720
This design flaw is one of the things we noticed when we looked into Upstart in detail before

404
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,480
we decided to start SystemD four years later.

405
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Nothing has changed.

406
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,120
The Upstart design still cannot cover this.

407
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,280
And he goes on to list a lot of other shortcomings with Upstart.

408
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,480
And this is also all linked in further detail, which you can read yourself on G+.

409
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
He's a very long post.

410
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,560
I'm not going to read all of them.

411
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:51,040
And so this to me clearly is happening at this time because of this looming Debian decision.

412
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,640
It's absolutely vested in trying to kind of sway a position.

413
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,320
And there's no question that undoubtedly there's a lot of truth in it.

414
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,160
But at the end of the day, I do feel it's kind of disingenuous to – for them to release

415
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,920
it like – it's kind of like voting one way or the other because you're about to

416
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
get reelected.

417
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Yeah.

418
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
It's that kind of thing.

419
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
It's very political.

420
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
And that's a turnoff for me.

421
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,160
So you have this worthwhile information, potentially worthwhile information.

422
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,320
I know nothing of it as far as its authenticity.

423
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm not into that sort of thing.

424
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,560
But I do know that – yeah, the timing kind of rubs me the wrong way.

425
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,440
So it's very probable.

426
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,040
I would actually prefer evidence versus just somebody that makes a claim that I've – again,

427
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,840
I would need to see more evidence to that fact or some examples or hell, even a YouTube

428
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
video showing it happened.

429
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
That would be cool.

430
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Just something to kind of push me in that direction.

431
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,440
But yeah, the timing is a real turnoff for me.

432
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm just not cool with it.

433
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Yeah.

434
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,640
You mean in terms of like it actually eating the file system like –

435
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Yeah.

436
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,960
There's so much FUD on the internet that there's the truth and then there's FUD.

437
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,900
And trying to distinguish between the two, it's – honestly, it's convoluted.

438
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,840
And you've got to be very careful of mob mentality.

439
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,560
I think in this particular case, he's probably correct.

440
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,440
I don't see – and it's way too elaborate to be nonsense and I think he's probably

441
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
right.

442
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,980
But again, the timing stinks and I found that to be a real turnoff.

443
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,440
So Mumble, I'm curious what you guys think here in the room because here we are, a bunch

444
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
of Linux users.

445
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,720
A lot of us have been around for a while.

446
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,920
Some of us are new.

447
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,760
But we are very clearly watching not a war but a clear –

448
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
It's a pissing contest.

449
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,080
Yeah, a clear – very much so.

450
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,800
Like a back and forth trying to – this is obviously how an open community tries to

451
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,600
influence each other and push a new technology forward.

452
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,280
A lot of people have a lot riding on this.

453
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,840
I'm kind of curious in the Mumble room if anybody has any observations on the situation

454
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,520
or kind of any thoughts along – if some of this is maybe ill-timed or if it's maybe

455
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,820
just the right time.

456
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,820
Anybody have any thoughts?

457
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:45,080
Yeah, actually, just – I really do – like the way Matt said, it really does seem like

458
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,740
a pissing contest at this point.

459
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,820
Both sides seem to be going and pushing and saying, oh, well, in this situation, this

460
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,820
can happen.

461
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,120
I'm monolithic and I'm not.

462
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,100
They're both going and just saying these rather silly ideas that – one is so much

463
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
better than the other.

464
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,880
I think it really comes down to – if you use both, both work quite well.

465
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,120
The only thing that really comes down to is the CLA, unfortunately.

466
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,000
That's why I think why they're talking about the CLA and not the other stuff because

467
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,240
the other stuff is really rather simple.

468
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,800
I seem to have missed the back and forth.

469
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:25,160
I seem to have only seen Leonard and Kay posting on Google+.

470
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:32,040
I haven't seen anyone from Upstart posting rebuttals back the other way at all.

471
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Right.

472
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,000
There's been a few in the comments on these threads.

473
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,560
One of the original Upstart developers did take to his Google Plus feed and had a couple

474
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,440
of comments to say about the CLA and things like that.

475
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,840
You're right, it has been a lot of campaigning from one side, definitely more so, and then

476
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,000
more of a response on the other side.

477
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,600
I think maybe that's – maybe because some of the pro conversations for Upstart are all

478
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,880
happening on the Debian mailing list itself, whereas the folks – where these folks don't

479
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,280
really have an in there as much, so they're kind of using their other avenues to reach

480
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,280
out.

481
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
It's an open mailing.

482
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
It's an open mailing list.

483
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:13,080
Surely they could – if they wanted to lobby, that would be the right place to do it rather

484
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,560
than on a social network.

485
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
You're right.

486
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:21,760
I can see that it is sort of seen as a pissing contest and whatnot, but I think if there's

487
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,760
any time to do it, it might as well be now.

488
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,960
So I don't see that as necessarily a bad thing.

489
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,920
I actually think it has a lot – I think there's a lot on the line here.

490
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,800
And I don't know why, because honestly, the more rational aspect of me also knows

491
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,600
that it doesn't matter if Debian goes with OpenRC or Upstart or SystemD, it'll all

492
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,160
be normalized out in the end.

493
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
It'll all work out.

494
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Sure.

495
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,720
But it does seem like now, to me, I agree that it's a little dirty on the timing,

496
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,080
and Popey brings up a good point too, that there are actually other avenues to have this

497
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,200
conversation other than the most public of those avenues.

498
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,320
But I also kind of feel like at the same time, the stakes are high enough that it almost

499
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:06,440
justifies it, because I'll tell you, I have no – Upstart's fine.

500
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,440
I've used it for years.

501
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,880
But SystemD is really quite good for a server.

502
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,080
It has resource controls that are actually kind of absolutely essential for a server,

503
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,640
and then it also has the capability of capturing daemon core dumps and providing those to the

504
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,800
admin through the logging system, and also then restarting those daemons after they crash

505
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,280
and being very intelligent about how it does that.

506
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,680
And on top of that, it also can auto-resolve dependencies.

507
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,100
So if several things fail, it can actually have – it actually has the intelligence

508
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,800
to resolve the dependencies to get everything back up and running.

509
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,280
Oh, and hey, here's your notification of what happened and what we did.

510
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,080
And then you combine that with cgroups.

511
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,520
You combine that with – it is honestly also a lot better at managing file system mounts.

512
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,120
And when you live in a world of Wi-Fi and USB thumb drives, having a much more dynamic

513
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,120
methodology of handling your file system mounts and something that's intelligent about that,

514
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,280
and also something that's also dependency aware again.

515
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,080
So like before it tries to mount NFS, it starts up the networking stack.

516
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,080
Those kinds of features, it almost would seem – and I know we can solve those problems

517
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,880
with other tools, but it seems a little silly.

518
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,280
Like it seems like we should – all of our – all Linuxes should be able to do those

519
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
things.

520
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,080
Well, and I think a really nice collaborative effort that both parties could do is to simply

521
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,320
work together on a flowchart on what each of their individual camps offer.

522
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Simple.

523
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Simple politics.

524
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Just keep it simple.

525
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,320
I think that's –

526
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,280
Because I think that'd be awesome.

527
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:44,000
What's interesting there is Scott James Remnant, who was the original maintainer of Upstart,

528
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,280
the creator of Upstart, some years back commented on – I think on Matt Garrett's post and

529
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:56,560
talked about how he did have conversations with Kay and Lennart about system D.

530
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,760
And what surprised me was most recently in the last week or so that Kay and Lennart have

531
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,600
talked all about the CLA and how that was a big sticking point for system D, yet none

532
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:16,640
of that was mentioned years ago when everyone told us that canonical were kings of not invented

533
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,320
here and kings of fork it, when in fact they were – Kay and Lennart were talking to Scott

534
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,960
about helping maintain –

535
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
A fork.

536
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Upstart.

537
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,760
And then they went away and –

538
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
They discussed a fork, too.

539
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
They made something else.

540
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Yeah, well, they also discussed forking Upstart.

541
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,200
I mean, there was a – yeah.

542
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,200
So I guess you're saying that you're thinking maybe the CLA is a little bit more of a ruse

543
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,920
now that it wasn't as big of an issue back then?

544
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,240
I think it's a good bandwagon to jump on this week, yeah.

545
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,640
Yeah, and I think what you point out is interesting because it definitely points out that the

546
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,200
timing, like you said, it's really recent, the timing with all the deviant stuff, it

547
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,040
does seem like they're kind of pulling that out of their bag of dirty tricks, which –

548
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:02,800
But I kind of feel like the community as a whole, now that Linus has jumped in on the

549
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,520
whole CLA thing, too, that shit, I think it's sailed, right?

550
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,640
I mean, now Linus has come out against CLA's, and of course, I mean, not that surprising,

551
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,880
but that seems like a battle that – it just seems like something canonical that is not

552
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,480
going to be able to change public opinion on that.

553
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,320
I don't necessarily think canonical CLA – I'm not going to say whether canonical

554
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,480
CLA is either good or bad, but I think in the case of Debian, it might be a hurdle for

555
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,600
them even adopting something like Upstart.

556
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
They would have to do –

557
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,880
Right, and I think that is – it is a problem.

558
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
Go ahead, Bobbie.

559
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that.

560
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,240
They even said that the reason why they wrote Upstart – sorry, System D is because of

561
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,680
the CLA on Upstart.

562
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,040
That's what they're saying, but Popeye's kind of –

563
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:49,320
I'm sure – sorry, I don't know whether there's satellite delay here to the UK or

564
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
not.

565
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,720
I can see how there are technical arguments for why System D is better, and I can see

566
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,320
how there are arguments for why Upstart is better, but what surprises me that it's been

567
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,800
left this late to come up with, oh, yeah, and what about the CLA?

568
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:13,640
I mean, this stuff is all well-documented on the Debian Wiki of rationale pro and con

569
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:21,160
for both products, and I would just like the Debian technical committee to get on and make

570
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
a decision.

571
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,200
I'd rather this was resolved somewhat.

572
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
I agree, too.

573
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,360
You don't go to Debian and start preaching to them about licenses and agreements.

574
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,560
I mean, these guys, before they even got this far, are well aware of the CLA, what it means,

575
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
and all of that.

576
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,320
So it is a little odd to bring it up at this stage because it's – to me, it kind of

577
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,120
feels like, all right, all cards out, Matt, you focus on the CLA, Lennart, you focus on

578
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
the technical stuff.

579
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,840
Now, I'm not saying there's even collusion or anything like that, but it just really

580
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,320
seems like, all right, everybody's going to put it all out there.

581
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,800
It gets as much noise about this as we can right now while we can.

582
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,640
It sounds kind of like the Upstart side is more like a dog that's just kind of chilling

583
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:08,200
out sleeping, and then the System D side is like the Jack Russell that just never shuts

584
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
up.

585
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
But it's really different.

586
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,280
We have been talking about this – like, if you go back to the episode, we discussed

587
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,380
this a while ago.

588
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,240
We discussed the CLA then and how it was a big deal.

589
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,400
I don't think it just happened overnight.

590
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,320
It's just – this isn't – it's popped up again.

591
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,160
Just different aspects of it are popping up again and again, and the CLA just seems to

592
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,400
be a very strong sticking point, and everyone's kind of sticking to it and whether they like

593
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
it or not.

594
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Right, and this time, too –

595
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
And I can see why it is.

596
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,360
I can see the rationale why a developer might say, or more accurately, their employer might

597
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:46,840
not want them to contribute to a product where there is an asymmetrical relationship with

598
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,560
them and the maintainer.

599
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,120
I can understand that, and Debian have got to figure that one out.

600
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,680
That's for them to figure out.

601
00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:00,520
I think, too, part of it is we are – there are a lot of engineers and technical people

602
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:08,400
in the community, obviously, and when something is potentially technically superior, there's

603
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,820
like this extra urgency to become an advocate of it, right, because – but this is technically

604
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,760
the right thing to do.

605
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,960
And of course, it's never always black and white like that, but that's just how people

606
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
are.

607
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,320
Like, well, how could you not implement this?

608
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,520
This is the better, obvious way to go.

609
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,520
So – and I think partially, too, the debate has flared back up around the CLA because

610
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,360
there's been a pivot in the conversation.

611
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,120
There was a bit of a, well, but look, even the FSF has a CLA, and also Apache, they have

612
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
a CLA.

613
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,340
So look, it's not that bad.

614
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,080
And so then there was this wave of response to that claim saying, well, those don't try

615
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,800
to relicense, or they already permit relicensing, so the CLA allowing relicensing isn't a big

616
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,000
deal.

617
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,560
And people are also coming out and calling it a community limiting agreement.

618
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,400
The CLA is a community limiting agreement saying that it doesn't allow – line is saying

619
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,520
that it doesn't allow for drive-by community growth.

620
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,900
It's an interesting time, and it's an interesting spot, and I think there's a lot of people

621
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,240
out there right now that are honestly just kind of like – Bobi says, like, just hurry

622
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
up and vote.

623
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,840
Let's just make a decision here.

624
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,900
Because a lot of these things, once they blow over, are not that big of a deal.

625
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,900
So I completely agree.

626
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,920
It's almost like – it's almost like they need to foot the corner or something to get

627
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
it over with.

628
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Right?

629
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
No kidding.

630
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,680
Well, and you know, Debian's been floating like a lot of different proposals.

631
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:29,440
Like, one is, all right, default on Linux is systemd, but if you go with, like, Herd

632
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,440
or something like that, we'll use openrc, or k-freebsd, we'll use openrc, or whatever,

633
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,440
right?

634
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,280
There's, like, all these different ideas they're proposing right now for – or different

635
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
scenarios.

636
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,080
And it – I don't know, it's one of these things where – and we're about to shift

637
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,120
gears into the FUD busting, and I'll just leave it at this, and then we can move on.

638
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:55,200
What I personally would like to see on the Versus-based installer, maybe an option somewhere

639
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,200
along the lines, like, do you want to use systemd or openrc?

640
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Or something like that.

641
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
That's what they need to do.

642
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Yeah, maybe.

643
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:10,520
Well, that would be kind of hard to do, as packages would have to be all configurable

644
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:18,120
to use either or, and generally that makes building for that – building packages for

645
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
the distro a lot more complex.

646
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,120
See, that's my question, though.

647
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
I can test it out.

648
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:28,040
Wouldn't – if Debian went with systemd, wouldn't Ubuntu have to repackage everything

649
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,880
for systemd, even though they use Upstart?

650
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,600
I don't think they would have to, because Ubuntu already, like, does all their own configuration

651
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,440
for Upstart, because that is different to Debian at the moment.

652
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,040
Anyway, Debian uses it, and they use Upstart.

653
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Yeah.

654
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,400
And given we're three months away from – well, less than three months away from an LTS release,

655
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,840
I can't see us switching between now and then.

656
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
No, of course not.

657
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
No.

658
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,960
So this is – we're almost certainly going to have Upstart for the long term.

659
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,120
For five years from now, there will still be machines – millions of machines around

660
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,760
the world running Upstart, as there are right now.

661
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Yeah.

662
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,840
And even more so, because more people will deploy the new LTS.

663
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,520
And there's Chromebooks selling, like, Bazingas right now, so they're pumping those things

664
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,280
out like nuts, and those are all running Upstart.

665
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,600
That's why it's not a huge, huge deal.

666
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,440
I'll just leave it at this before we get to the FUD-busting aspect of it, and that

667
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,880
is there are elements of diversity in Linux.

668
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,820
We always say choice is great, and I would hate to ever see those go away.

669
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:36,080
There's also, you know, this loud mantra that Linux is fractured, it's fragmented,

670
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,660
it's too hard to develop for because it's all over the place, and the more we can kind

671
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,520
of standardize on areas that make sense, the less we – or the more, I should say, we

672
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,220
nullify those arguments.

673
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,720
So there is some rationale there, but that's all down the road.

674
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,920
That's all down the road, sir.

675
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,400
And the great thing is, like we always say, you do have choice.

676
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,800
Hell, you could even run System D on Debian right now if you wanted to.

677
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,080
It is actually possible.

678
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,520
OpenRCE taking kind of a beating in some of these discussions.

679
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
I'll just put that out there.

680
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Yeah, it really is, isn't it?

681
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
Yeah.

682
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,800
Speaking of the FUD busting, I want to thank DigitalOcean.

683
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,760
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

684
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,200
to spin up a cloud server.

685
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,920
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds.

686
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
Now I'm not trying to brag.

687
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,360
I think I got that down to 47 seconds.

688
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
What's up?

689
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:27,120
And pricing plans start at only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

690
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,120
and one CPU with a terabyte of transfer.

691
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,320
I love that part right there.

692
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,400
A terabyte of transfer is nuts.

693
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
First of all.

694
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,480
And the other nice thing, as opposed to some of the other services that you spin up at

695
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,200
Amazon or Rackspace or some of these other guys, you don't have a quantified cost there.

696
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:50,120
I know every single month my DigitalOcean bill is $5 a month.

697
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,200
And that's if I use 500 megabytes or I use a terabyte.

698
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,620
I don't have that surprise bill on my credit card that burns you eventually with a lot

699
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,620
of these other services.

700
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:03,320
Not only that, but this is a full virtual machine that you get to operate with root

701
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
access.

702
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,160
You can use Ubuntu machines, Arch machines, Fedora machines, you can deploy machines with

703
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,840
Docker instances already set up and good to go, LAMP stacks, whatever you need to get

704
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,520
up and running super fast.

705
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,520
Not only that, but DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco and Amsterdam.

706
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,240
Their interface is simple with an intuitive control panel which power users can replicate

707
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,240
on a large scale with their straightforward API, which is awesome.

708
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,440
They have image solutions where if you want to create a machine and image it and you can

709
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,120
redeploy that machine, you can do a backup snapshot before you make big changes.

710
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,600
It's so great for testing something on the fly to have a lot of people pound on it.

711
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,580
If you're developing a project or an app and you want to give a lot of people access

712
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,760
to it, you want to just have somebody use it in a public space, sometimes you got to

713
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,360
get things out on the web to really test it.

714
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,400
DigitalOcean is perfect for that or if you want to set up a YASI search engine or in

715
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,200
my case a BitTorrent Sync distribution server, it's great for that too.

716
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,460
DigitalOcean also offers a vast collection of tutorials in their community section on

717
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,640
their site.

718
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,920
Furthermore, users who submit articles to the community can get paid $50 per published

719
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
piece.

720
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,920
So here's what I want you to do.

721
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,400
Go to DigitalOcean.com and get a $10 credit.

722
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,680
If you use the $5 rig like I've been using, that'll get it for you two months.

723
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,520
You can just try it out and see what you can do if you use the promo code LinuxUnpluggedJanuary.

724
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,040
LinuxUnpluggedJanuary will get you a $10 credit, boom!

725
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,920
Try out DigitalOcean for two months and see what I've been talking about.

726
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,760
I love it and you will love it too.

727
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,560
So go to DigitalOcean.com and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux

728
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,200
Unplugged.

729
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,960
So many cool things you can do when you have your own cloud server.

730
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
Oh, no kidding.

731
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,860
I mean, because you're really unleashed at that point.

732
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,000
You no longer have to worry about any potential downtime or anything on your local system.

733
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,520
You can get creative and try completely awful stuff.

734
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,200
With that crazy great control panel with super simple straightforward imaging and snapshotting,

735
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,480
it is so easy.

736
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,120
If you're worried you're going to do something wrong, you'd make a backup of it first.

737
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,880
You can redeploy if you made a mistake.

738
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
It's really great.

739
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,120
There are so many cool options too.

740
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,340
You can play with arch boxes.

741
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,880
That's what I've been running for months now.

742
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
It's great.

743
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,960
It's been crazy, but it's actually been great.

744
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
So check it out.

745
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
DigitalOcean.com.

746
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,080
So before we go too much further, also I want to mention really quick.

747
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,760
It's one of our last call outs.

748
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,000
We have an Instagram account, a Jupiter Broadcasting Instagram account, Instagram.com slash Jupiter

749
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,400
Broadcasting, where right now we are collecting photos of folks who are sporting their Jupiter

750
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,240
Broadcasting shirts.

751
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,840
A lot of good looking individuals there.

752
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,780
Some with copious amounts of facial hair.

753
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,680
Or is that real facial hair?

754
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,600
You know, I let things grow out a little bit and I thought I would try the whole beard

755
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,400
thing and yeah, that happened.

756
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,200
Well hey, it's a good look for you.

757
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
It's a good look for you.

758
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Oh my God.

759
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Yeah, right?

760
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Yeah, I totally took a selfie and that was me without my beard braid.

761
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,000
There's somebody in a data center closet with a BSD logo in the background there and it

762
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,760
looks like a homemade disk chassis there too.

763
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,880
There's a lot of really cool ones.

764
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Very Blues Brothers.

765
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
I love it.

766
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,800
Wherever you want to post it, or if you want to email it to Angela at JupiterBroadcasting.com

767
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,600
or post it on G Plus and tag plus Angela Fisher or at A-N-G-E-R-Z on Twitter, let her see

768
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,160
it and she'll add it to our Instagram feed.

769
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:13,240
We're going to take these and there's a service that will allow you to create framed art.

770
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,960
So you feed it your Instagram account and they create you art that you can hang on your

771
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,160
wall and we're going to decorate the new studio with pictures of folks wearing their shirts.

772
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,440
So if you'd like to hang on the wall in our new studio, get your picture submitted and

773
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,680
you can check out everyone's pictures over at Instagram.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

774
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,600
It's really cool seeing everybody's face in there.

775
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,160
And some of the images are just fantastic.

776
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,240
Super funny.

777
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Super super funny.

778
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,120
Okay, so we got to bust some FUD bit by bit here.

779
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,320
Now I'm going to pick on this guy, but he totally deserves it.

780
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
His name is FM87.

781
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:57,040
You might have saw his comment on Reddit recently when the link to Microsoft employees reportedly

782
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,280
calling Windows 8 the new Vista hit Reddit.

783
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,760
A lot of Windows fanboys got pretty upset by this post and of course the conversation

784
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,400
quickly turned to bashing Linux and pushing on a bunch of old buttons.

785
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,880
This guy got gold five times over for this post.

786
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,120
He got 1,800 karma points for it and the reason why I'm picking on this one is because it's

787
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:24,040
a great summary of a lot of the different ones, a lot of different FUD points, talking

788
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
points I've seen.

789
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:32,800
First, he likes to pick on the fragmentation and with a lot of profanity he links to the

790
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,240
GNU Linux distribution timeline and says, what the actual F. Look at this and points

791
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,560
to this and points how this is a serious sign of absolutely horrible fragmentation.

792
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,900
Look at all of these distros that are all branched off each other.

793
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:53,240
This is a developer's nightmare he goes on to say and he says, near 95% of games will

794
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,280
not run under Linux and wine is garbage.

795
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,840
Try running anything that requires DirectX 10 or 11.

796
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,820
It makes extensive use of things such as hardware cursors and you'll find that they simply do

797
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,960
not run save for very rare occurrences.

798
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,320
Even if they do run, it usually runs with a multitude of graphical or audio glitches

799
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,960
and bugs and even interfering with gameplay.

800
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,800
Okay, so this is one of my favorite Linux FUD things where you take an application,

801
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,760
any kind, could be a game, could be a desktop office application, written for another operating

802
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,320
system and you run it on Linux and it doesn't run perfectly and you blame Linux.

803
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,000
In no other operating system would this ever happen.

804
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,720
You would not take an application only written for Linux or only written for the Mac and

805
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,040
use some sort of API translation layer on Windows 7 and when it doesn't work correctly

806
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,400
blame Windows.

807
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
That wouldn't happen.

808
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Never happens.

809
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Never happens.

810
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,360
The biggest issue is the fact they tried to underline it because it's adding an extra

811
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:53,800
layer that eats up resources that the game could be using.

812
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,400
And the developers who make stuff work on, like Cygwin for example, that makes it work

813
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,240
on Windows, they actually made it work correctly so you don't have to worry about that.

814
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:09,400
A lot of it on games too is if you're using DirectX 9 it needs DirectX 10 or 11.

815
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,560
Linux is terrible so that's why.

816
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:17,520
A better example would be like what if I were to blame Microsoft for Apple's terrible port

817
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
of Safari.

818
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,520
Or iTunes.

819
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,520
Right?

820
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,520
Yeah.

821
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,320
Here's the simplest way to look at it in the universe and completely nukes this entire

822
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,440
first point.

823
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,720
Is it designed to run natively?

824
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
No?

825
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,720
Then go home.

826
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
End of discussion.

827
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,720
That's the simplest.

828
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:35,840
That's another point which is a lot of people think that they can just switch to Linux and

829
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:43,840
it's just an operating system designed for them to run their Windows software and a lot

830
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:50,520
of people have that opinion for some reason just because there are ways to do it available.

831
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:58,240
Or there are people who think this is an operating system where they can do everything the same

832
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,360
as they did in Windows which is simply not true and some of your old habits will have

833
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,320
to change if you are going to change operating systems.

834
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,720
That's when I point out and say oh that's fantastic so let's take a copy of let's say

835
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,640
Publisher made for Windows and we're going to go ahead and drop that in the Mac and we're

836
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,880
just going to go ahead and get started with that.

837
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,240
Oh that's right it doesn't work.

838
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Why?

839
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,240
Because it didn't run native.

840
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,360
You can nullify his argument really quickly just by putting it out.

841
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,360
Oh yeah.

842
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,360
Alright so what do you think of this one?

843
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
Oh go ahead.

844
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,280
If I could just butt in I was just reading through that comment you made about wine being

845
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,280
garbage.

846
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,280
I have a personal experience relating to that where a friend of mine, the guy I was talking

847
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,120
about before the show plays World of Warcraft, he uses Linux to play World of Warcraft on

848
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:45,120
wine because wine now has a patch that you can compile into it which makes World of Warcraft

849
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:54,160
run about 40 to 50 percent faster on Linux than what it does on Windows because they've

850
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,640
managed to multi-thread a whole bunch of stuff that Windows can't do because Windows CPU

851
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,560
scheduler is garbage and Linux is one.

852
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:05,240
And I think that wine is a lot like a VM is that it's what you see is what you get.

853
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
It may or may not work.

854
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,000
I mean obviously there's databases and what not to make sure and in a lot of games cases

855
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
that's actually the case.

856
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,240
I've actually seen other games that have run actually quicker but I think that at the end

857
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,480
of the day it is not a guarantee that it's going to run and people going into wine need

858
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,480
to understand that.

859
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,480
That's not even an argument.

860
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,360
When someone actually is able to run an application under wine it's like complaining that your

861
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:32,800
engine or diesel engine can actually run on corn oil or water.

862
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,000
There's a reason why I run a different operating system on my different machines.

863
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,100
My laptop is purely Linux but my desktop I'm going to run Windows on it because I want

864
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:45,440
access to those DirectX games or I want to use multimedia services like Netflix because

865
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,960
it's my main entertainment.

866
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,560
And I think the other policy he has here is he starts out his thread and I'm going to

867
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,560
get to another point here.

868
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:57,320
He says Linux is not a replacement for 99.999% of users and then he mentions this 95% of

869
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,280
games won't work under wine and it's like hold on.

870
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,560
Not all users need that.

871
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,120
So here you're making an argument that it won't work for 99% of people then you're assuming

872
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,920
99% of people need to play wine games.

873
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,320
He also goes on to say despite what most Linux users would lead everyone to believe most

874
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,760
users just want to start up and set up and go OS.

875
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,520
Linux is not this.

876
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,920
Yes, Windows needs to push updates and restart but so does Linux.

877
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,920
The difference is Linux will not tell you it needs to restart to update kernel files

878
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,600
leaving those vulnerable until you do so or simply causing a kernel panic or lock up.

879
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,760
The amount of setup required and tinkering needed to get things like sound and network

880
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,360
drivers working properly after initial setup is mind boggling.

881
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,740
Even on easy distros like Ubuntu, Kubuntu or Mint.

882
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:45,280
So on the first point he's factually completely and utterly and totally wrong because as soon

883
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,800
as you install updates, if it does require a reboot in Ubuntu, wait for it, it does tell

884
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,800
you.

885
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,320
Secondly, as far as coming out of the box, my mom who collects social security and is

886
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:02,000
like old as dirt, she installed her own Ubuntu installation so boom there it is.

887
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It was really tough.

888
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,560
She put the disk in, went and made lunch, came back, clicked next a few times and she

889
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,560
was done.

890
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,040
It wasn't real hard so his entire point is just completely flawed.

891
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,040
It's not accurate.

892
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,160
My first point is 105% of statistics are made up on the spot.

893
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:25,480
It's worth noting that on Ubuntu we've actually re-implemented the Windows dialog that prevents

894
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:32,960
you from dismissing it and you have to, you know, what do you want, you know?

895
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,960
You must restart.

896
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,360
Ubuntu is way easier to setup than Windows 8 is because you don't have to make a million

897
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:45,560
Microsoft accounts per se and as soon as you log in, it'll say the upstart menu.

898
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,560
Right.

899
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,960
And you know what real users hate is when you go to shut down your computer and then

900
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,400
it installs the updates.

901
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,880
Real users actually hate that.

902
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,880
Yeah, it sucks, right?

903
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,880
And especially when you're on a laptop.

904
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,440
When you just flick your machine on because you need to use it for two minutes and all

905
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,000
of a sudden you've got to wait half an hour for it to turn on because it decided to do

906
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
some updates.

907
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I hate that.

908
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,760
So Popey, somebody brought up the point of Microsoft accounts.

909
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,320
They're not going to require canonical accounts, are they?

910
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,600
You can already sign into Ubuntu One during your install.

911
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,600
No, it's a convenience.

912
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,560
Yeah, it's a total choice.

913
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,280
It's not mandatory by any stretch of the word.

914
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,880
I got a couple of points where he is right.

915
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,800
So synergy with other devices such as network file sharing has always been an issue with

916
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,160
Linux where Windows's small office can simply turn on file sharing, the procedure for doing

917
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,960
this with Linux is long and tedious.

918
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,040
Now I think this is a fair point.

919
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:47,600
New users that want to share files between two Linux desktops have no idea where to do

920
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,920
that and they always just end up emailing each other in attachment or use Dropbox.

921
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,920
Yeah, but so do Windows users.

922
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
I mean, honestly.

923
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,360
Actually, that's a good point.

924
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:01,240
Every office I've ever worked in, the ability to turn on file sharing has been an excellent

925
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,000
vector for installing viruses on every other machine on the network.

926
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It's brilliant.

927
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Okay.

928
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,320
What about locking down the OS?

929
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,120
He says in an enterprise environment, you can never be done that.

930
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,120
Check out this.

931
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,960
It can never be done due to how the FOSS community behaves and thinks everything should be out

932
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,960
in the open.

933
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,160
This is a huge problem, he says.

934
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,240
That's utter bull crap.

935
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:30,340
That's like saying I don't want to see how this thing works so that no one else can see

936
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,560
how it works, even though it might be just like a feather holding the safe closed.

937
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,400
It's like that's just silly.

938
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,240
You don't know if it's a feather holding the safe closed.

939
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,400
You don't know if it's a steel bar.

940
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,240
You don't know how it's built.

941
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,720
How can you rely on it at all?

942
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,320
I think he's talking like group policy and stuff like that.

943
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,320
But okay.

944
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,320
All right.

945
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,320
Here's a soft spot.

946
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,320
All right.

947
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,320
Now, come on.

948
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
Be honest with this one, you guys.

949
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,000
He says, despite what most Linux users say, the command line is still required to use

950
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,120
for a lot of common tasks.

951
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,920
This is a huge problem in all caps.

952
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,160
No one gives an S about memorizing 100 different commands to do simple things.

953
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,880
The average user needs a simple GUI with everything laid out for them and Linux simply does not

954
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,120
offer that.

955
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,360
The average person will have to use command line eventually.

956
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,360
But that's not true.

957
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:20,040
I've, again, going back to my mom who maintains her own computer, believe it or not, with

958
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,040
the exception of router issues, that's not related to Ubuntu.

959
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,880
But factually speaking, I would challenge most common users will use the command line

960
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,600
like maybe never unless they know what to do with it.

961
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,880
The entire argument kind of kills itself right off the bat just because it's like, okay,

962
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,320
so you're relying on the command line, yet you're new to Linux and you don't know what

963
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,680
commands you're going to be using anyway, so then you're going to go Google for it.

964
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:43,680
That doesn't really hold water.

965
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,080
Here's a perfect example.

966
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:50,440
Back in 2006 when I first ran Ubuntu, I had to use a terminal to get things like my wireless

967
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,440
working.

968
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,440
Oh, yeah.

969
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,440
Back then.

970
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,440
Absolutely.

971
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:59,640
Here in 2014, for me to use a terminal, that's my choice because I prefer to use some of

972
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,800
those tools over the GUI tools.

973
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:12,840
I would like to add to what Matt said that I actually like helping people who use Linux

974
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:21,600
over the phone or over Skype because I don't care where they move their icons or where

975
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,880
their start menu is.

976
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,200
I don't have to wait until they click on something.

977
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:34,720
Whether they themselves use terminal commands or not is irrelevant, but if I need to help

978
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,840
them fix something, I can just tell them, open the terminal, type this in, and it makes

979
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,840
helping others so much easier.

980
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:48,800
I think one of the misconceptions that Windows advocates have when they throw mud at Linux

981
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:54,060
is they set it to a different standard and they say, well, on Linux you need the command

982
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:59,840
line, and part of the reason for that is the perception that someone who uses Linux has

983
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,840
to be an expert.

984
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,000
My mom's been using Linux for three years and she's never, ever opened a command line

985
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,720
because she knows someone who can do it for her, and that's exactly the same on Windows.

986
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,040
If my mom ran Windows, she'd phone me.

987
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,040
I think you've nailed it.

988
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,000
To bring up a point about even this Linux kernel being used in different places, I just

989
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,920
throw at them, okay, do you use the terminal on your phone, on your Android device?

990
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:31,040
I want to point out too, I think that it is just about as difficult for a new Linux user

991
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,040
to use the command line.

992
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,560
I know this is going to sound crazy, but think about it.

993
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,560
I think it's true.

994
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,320
It's just as hard for a new Linux user to use the command line as it is an absolute

995
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:45,720
noob to go hunt down a printer driver, download it from the, select the right type, download

996
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,240
it from the manufacturer's website, install that printer driver.

997
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,880
Linux users don't have to worry about any of that kind of thing, whereas on Windows,

998
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,560
when you get a new device or a new machine, that is a very common task that they immediately

999
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,200
get stuck at.

1000
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,840
Installing printers is surprisingly difficult, or installing new devices when you have to

1001
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,660
go get the driver that doesn't install from Windows Update, that might as well just not

1002
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,840
work at all for a lot of new users, and that's, of course, never criticized.

1003
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,880
Well, if I can give a recent example of that, just recently I got a new computer, it was

1004
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,800
just a cheap one, just to throw in the lounge, the living room, just to run Netflix, that's

1005
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:25,000
all it does because flatmates watch Netflix, and I had a Wi-Fi dongle that I was going

1006
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,240
to plug into it and just use that because I couldn't be bothered with running the cable,

1007
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,480
and I had the Wi-Fi dongle and the CD that the drivers came on, and I installed Windows,

1008
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,600
I plugged in the Wi-Fi dongle, popped the CD in, it didn't work, I went into the CD,

1009
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,080
I went through, I mean, I've been using Windows for 15 years now, I know how to install a

1010
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:47,680
driver, and eventually after about an hour of messing around with the driver, I popped

1011
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:53,920
an Ubuntu USB stick in, plugged the Wi-Fi in, it worked instantly, downloaded Pipelight,

1012
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,080
and she's now watching Netflix on Ubuntu, I meant to put Windows on because she knows

1013
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,200
how to use Windows, she doesn't know how to use Linux, and I just thought it would be

1014
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,440
easier and smoother and everything, and honestly, it took me an hour, and I gave up, and I used

1015
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,600
Linux because it worked, so in terms of installing drivers and such and having to use the command

1016
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:15,800
line like you save, I mean, I'm not even a new Windows user, but having to dig around

1017
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:20,440
in the Windows driver options and reboot into insecure mode and all that stuff just to get

1018
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,160
a driver installed in Linux, there wasn't a problem.

1019
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,120
Well, Linux is very weird and different when it comes to Windows, and a lot of people don't

1020
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,640
actually understand this.

1021
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:33,120
The kernel is all hardware abstraction, and the user land is all user-facing tools.

1022
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:38,200
When you upgrade your kernel, that upgrades all hardware support.

1023
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:43,240
That's why all of our hardware product plays so instant and beautiful and modern.

1024
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,960
Okay, Crash Bandit, could I have one question about your pipeline setup on that?

1025
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,120
How well does hardware acceleration for HD video work?

1026
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,800
I don't have hardware acceleration work.

1027
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,280
My driver doesn't support it.

1028
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,280
All right.

1029
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
Yeah, that is...

1030
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,600
I was curious about that, too.

1031
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,600
I wanted...

1032
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,000
That would be for our GPU.

1033
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,120
One last thing I wanted to bring up as far as we were talking about Wi-Fi earlier, because

1034
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:10,620
that's one thing that Linux users kind of skate over and always point to various tools

1035
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:13,040
to kind of work around Windows drivers and whatnot.

1036
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,240
At the end of the day, if you look at your laptop, you open up the clamshell and you

1037
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,400
look really closely at the sticker on it, what does it say it's made for?

1038
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,440
It says it's made for Windows.

1039
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,300
Going into it, you understand that the chipset and the sound and all those things are potentially

1040
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,240
designed for the Windows operating system.

1041
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,280
That usually means you're probably working with a Broadcom chipset when it comes to wireless.

1042
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,280
Sometimes that works.

1043
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,180
Sometimes you're looking at going and having to connect to a hard line and get it the otherwise.

1044
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:40,600
The simplest approach is either buy Linux preinstalled or accept the fact that if you

1045
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,120
want to have a good time, get yourself an integrated Intel wireless setup.

1046
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,200
Or if you need to go dongle wise, you can kind of crap roll it and go with a Theros

1047
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,200
or a Rawlink.

1048
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,200
It's true.

1049
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,000
There are methods to avoid some of these problems too.

1050
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,120
You know, BlueGuy in the chat room says, if you log into Windows Server 2012 and it decides

1051
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,500
to shut down your entire company in 10 minutes for updates, trust me, you'll be using the

1052
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,500
command line.

1053
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,040
This is an interesting thing is Microsoft is actually very heavily pushing PowerShell

1054
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:12,560
and a lot of the new ways to administer Active Directory, everything you can do through the

1055
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,280
GUI, you can do at the command line.

1056
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,560
And a lot of it's around scripting and PowerShell for managing updates and things like that.

1057
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,240
So in fact, then look at Windows Server Core.

1058
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,320
That's also sort of addressing this.

1059
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,200
You know, a server doesn't necessarily need this GUI aspect.

1060
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,700
So I think there's, I think it's a little funny to push the command line thing because

1061
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,600
really a lot of times I've had to drop to CMD on Windows 7.

1062
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,600
Oh yeah.

1063
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,600
That's what I do.

1064
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,400
Pigret Dull would like to share a story about his friend with GUI versus Terminal.

1065
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,880
All right.

1066
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,880
Okay.

1067
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,240
I had a friend who got fed up with Windows.

1068
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,760
He got a virus and said, I'm done.

1069
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,600
And so I pointed him towards Linux Mint just as a new user.

1070
00:55:54,600 --> 00:56:00,360
And he actually prefers the Terminal over the GUI, at least with installing software

1071
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,600
because he says it's a lot easier.

1072
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,600
Oh, it definitely is.

1073
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:08,400
If you're on Pacman or something, or even an app, it's so much faster than having to

1074
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,040
go through the software center.

1075
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,040
Yeah.

1076
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,040
That sounds pretty geeky though.

1077
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,040
But I mean, I agree.

1078
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,840
And I also, you know, maybe it's funny because users used to use DOS, right?

1079
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,200
So it's not like they can't be taught to use the command line.

1080
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,200
All right.

1081
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,320
Here's the soft spot that he goes for.

1082
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,520
This is the one I've been talking about.

1083
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,440
He says, distros are largely fragmented and the popular ones will come with random issues

1084
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,840
depending on what you are using and what you are installing on it.

1085
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,160
So always has issues with newer audio devices.

1086
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,920
Ubuntu and Mint tend to go ape shit if the display resolution or gamma is not set properly.

1087
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,960
And Arch almost always has had networking device problems.

1088
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,440
Soos seems to randomly play nice with USB mice and then ignore them as if they don't

1089
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,440
exist.

1090
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,400
And this is just the list off the top of my head.

1091
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,400
Easy answer to that one.

1092
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,400
Very, very simple.

1093
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,720
He basically installed all these distributions on one set of hardware.

1094
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,920
He had bad experiences because everything he named off very, very clearly tells me that

1095
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,800
he did not try this on multiple machines.

1096
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,040
He tried it on one piece of hardware, had a bad time, said Linux sucks, you know.

1097
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,040
Yeah, exactly.

1098
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:10,560
I honestly, I think he's just straight up lying when he says some of that stuff because

1099
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:15,080
I don't know how he can say Fedora always has issues with newer audio.

1100
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,800
Fedora always has the newest kernel and so it always has the best new hardware support.

1101
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,240
He's picking on the Pulse Audio issue from years ago.

1102
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,360
He's picking on Pulse Audio because if you're trying to connect to a USB situation, it gets

1103
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,360
a little funky.

1104
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,040
I think Fedora, I mean, I haven't really tried it myself, but I've heard Fedora has gotten

1105
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:34,080
a lot better lately, especially since they include the newer Radeon drivers by default

1106
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:38,160
and those have improved drastically because that was my biggest issue back in like 2008.

1107
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,480
Well, and remember, we just talked about on the, so this fragmentation thing comes up

1108
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,480
all the time.

1109
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:49,120
This is like sort of the common, you know, against all of the FUD talkers, the distro

1110
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:55,680
fragmentation is always brought up all the time, but we just talked about this presentation

1111
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:05,800
at the Valve Dev, Steam Dev Days and in there, Ikyulys said that, hey, look, honestly, this

1112
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:11,440
fragmentation issue amongst distros is BS and this guy has been porting games from Windows

1113
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:19,200
to Linux for 15 years and he says, you know, OpenGL and SDL, they essentially normalize

1114
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,200
things out.

1115
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,200
It really doesn't matter.

1116
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,720
He called it, I'm looking for the word, I think he called it a myth.

1117
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,560
His presentation is linked in this week's episode of Linux Action Show.

1118
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,560
Myth busting.

1119
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,560
Yeah, he called it a myth.

1120
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,040
He said, the truth about distro fragmentation, I've shipped dozens of games over 15 years,

1121
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,320
never did anything but generic Linux builds for any game.

1122
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,320
It's always worked.

1123
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,800
SDL handles most of the differences for you and the rest is largely avoidable and unimportant

1124
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,800
anyhow.

1125
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,760
So there you go, right?

1126
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,400
That's from somebody who's been converting games for 15 years from Windows.

1127
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,760
And just to point out, it's like he's going and he's saying, all these Linux distros are

1128
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,760
just awful.

1129
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:02,200
I would challenge him that if you go and take Windows 7, Windows 8, whatever you want, go

1130
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,460
and put it on multiple different hardware configurations, you are going to have an absolutely

1131
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:11,840
awful time on certain hardware configurations and there's, you know, he says, oh, this always

1132
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,840
has this problem.

1133
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,480
Well, Windows, I could argue Windows 8 always has a problem with going and dealing with

1134
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,320
Wi-Fi drivers because at the start it had an awful time with most Wi-Fi drivers that

1135
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,320
I found.

1136
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,320
Yeah.

1137
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,640
It's like, um, my, uh, brightness controls actually don't work on Windows 8.

1138
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,640
Yeah.

1139
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,640
Just say that.

1140
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,760
The other thing is that Linux tends to improve and then improve beyond Windows.

1141
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,560
Like I recall the days when Wi-Fi was a problem on Linux and it wasn't on Windows and like

1142
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:42,280
I just described earlier, it's now gotten to the point where Linux is better with Wi-Fi

1143
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,280
than Windows.

1144
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,280
Printers were another thing.

1145
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,280
Terrible with printers.

1146
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,280
Now it's better.

1147
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,400
Do you think maybe that's because there's no big, big releases?

1148
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:54,160
Like there's big a window up there, boom, Windows 8, boom, Windows 8.1, boom, Windows

1149
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,160
9.

1150
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,040
And so the public consciously says, okay, this is one better.

1151
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,160
They've now improved stuff.

1152
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,280
Whereas Linux, there's no like splash major marketing push, new features in Linux, new

1153
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,280
hardware support.

1154
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,280
It's awesome.

1155
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,280
It's just this continual improvement that people don't rock.

1156
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:14,960
I think the biggest advantage Linux has is the kernel is its own team or system D is

1157
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,840
its own team or Wayland and Xorg are their own teams.

1158
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,520
They can work on improving their stuff.

1159
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,520
They can still communicate with each other and get those updates, but they can still

1160
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:29,800
work individually so they can still help standardize things.

1161
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,880
It's too broad.

1162
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,200
There's too much general knowledge being spread out among all the different professions.

1163
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,720
For us in Linux, we have very special masters of their domain.

1164
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,480
And they evolve at different rates, right?

1165
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,680
And so it doesn't look like holistic improvement where individual components are improving

1166
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,760
at different time rates.

1167
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,800
And so it really takes a multi-year perspective to see the whole picture of improvement.

1168
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:56,240
And everything gets better all as their own little team and very specific and specialized

1169
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,240
ways.

1170
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,840
The special release thing is covered by distros.

1171
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,960
They release parties, you get those.

1172
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,840
And I think like Fedora, let's take Fedora, for example.

1173
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:13,960
Fedora has upon their release, whenever they did their freeze, that snapshot of the kernel,

1174
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:21,080
that snapshot of, let's say, Xorg and Wayland and SystemD and all that stuff, or Gnome KDE.

1175
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,080
Awesome.

1176
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:29,560
Look how far the kernel has gone in not a very long time, like a year and a half.

1177
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,280
We have different systems actually trying to compete to win, unlike the Windows world,

1178
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,680
which has one team which will only have that team dedicated to it and does not have any

1179
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,680
competition.

1180
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,680
Right.

1181
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,600
And if there's no general market advantage to improving the feature that's under the

1182
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:47,720
hood, doesn't make a bullet point on the box, there's really not a lot of political backing

1183
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,520
in the company to make it better.

1184
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,080
It's like the Bowser wars.

1185
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,840
There's competition, so they all get better collectively, thus all our subsystems get

1186
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,840
better collectively.

1187
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,040
Yeah, everybody loves to give the Mac a handjob and talk about how great it is, but their

1188
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:04,360
file system is literally a disgrace.

1189
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:09,040
HFS Plus is the most disgraceful file system that is still shipping on a major operating

1190
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:14,920
system, but Apple can't make a sexy bullet point on a keynote presentation about improving

1191
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:20,520
the file system, so they continue to add new features like bounce scrolling and full screen

1192
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:25,640
operations and individual spaces or whatever, but they don't fix their absolute train wreck

1193
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,640
of a file system.

1194
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,800
But they don't have to because they know marketing.

1195
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,800
That's where Linux fails.

1196
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,800
Right, but I'm glad...

1197
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,840
Linux is adorable and grassroots, kind of.

1198
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:37,200
They did market ZFS as their time capsule though once, because time capsule is ZFS,

1199
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,200
doesn't it?

1200
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,960
No, it's all HFS Plus.

1201
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,520
I believe even the iOS file system is HFS Plus.

1202
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,520
I think it is, yeah.

1203
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,960
And I agree that it's not a sexy feature that they can sell, and that's why I'm thankful

1204
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,240
that the Linux system works.

1205
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:53,400
We continue to get things like file systems worked on, even when it's not a sexy feature.

1206
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,400
Thank goodness.

1207
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,080
Yeah, things like people like Linus can focus on the core, and people like Aaron Saigo and

1208
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,320
Mark Shuttleworth can focus on the pretty stuff.

1209
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:05,160
Also, look how far the kernel itself has gone.

1210
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:10,080
Even just like a year and a half ago, like when 3.0 was out and everything, of how bad

1211
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:13,440
power management was and overheating, and everybody was complaining about that.

1212
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,760
Two, three, four months, they fixed that, and now it's focused on graphics.

1213
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,640
Look how far Intel graphics has come, and now they're working on Radeon graphics.

1214
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:27,080
It's just getting better so fast, it's actually kind of blowing my mind a little bit.

1215
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,080
I know, yeah.

1216
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,240
It is really awesome.

1217
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,360
This post on Reddit, I don't know if you remember, Chris, remember there was a blog

1218
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:38,360
post a couple of years back where the guy, he reviewed Linux as a server operating system,

1219
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:43,120
and remember he said it was terrible because he tried to install apps on Fedora or something

1220
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,120
like that.

1221
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,400
That's what this post reminds me of.

1222
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:51,080
All this stuff that this guy's mentioning, it's completely wrong.

1223
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:56,120
It's sort of like he's Googled a bunch of stuff, and then read complaints that people

1224
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,360
have made, and then just made a post from it.

1225
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,200
None of it actually seems like he's experienced it.

1226
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,920
He kind of talks a little bit in there like, well, I have to keep up to date, and I follow

1227
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,360
all of this for my job, and I don't know, he doesn't say what his job is, and that's

1228
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,600
kind of a vague explanation, but yeah.

1229
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,600
Intel's admin.

1230
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:15,240
Yeah, or yeah, like I run it in some VMs, I mean it sounds like a really loose association

1231
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:19,740
with, and he obviously has followed some of the issues, and the only thing is, is like

1232
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:23,260
all of these things, this guy just did a really good job, and I got this whole thing, we only

1233
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:27,740
read like 40% of it, I got the whole thing linked in the show notes, this guy just did

1234
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:32,200
a really good job, but basically taking all the biggest ones you hear, maybe one talking

1235
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:36,360
point is put into a response, and this guy just kind of put them all together, and I

1236
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:44,080
think as Steam OS starts to sort of lure people away from Windows a little bit, you're going

1237
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,200
to have, I mean I think this is already starting to happen, you have people looking into it,

1238
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,120
you got people that are deploying, we just talked about people that are deploying, it

1239
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,760
was Ubuntu at that high school because they didn't want to go to XP, it's going to happen

1240
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,760
more and more.

1241
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,600
And so I think this is just something maybe we'll just keep an eye on, because I grabbed

1242
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,160
this article here that I think I found in this, somebody linked in our subreddit, where

1243
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:10,000
it said you can blame Linux FUD for Microsoft's dominance in schools, and in fact there was

1244
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,360
this parent who went in to talk to the staff and said look, your class requirements say

1245
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:20,000
that I have to have Microsoft Office at home for my student to go and enroll in this class,

1246
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,520
and he said let me tell you about LibreOffice, and she starts writing stuff down, and then

1247
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,280
when she realized he was talking about replacing Microsoft, she stops him and she says, you

1248
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:33,080
know it might even be illegal for us to remove Microsoft Office or Windows from previously

1249
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:37,320
purchased computers due to the vendor agreement that the school district has signed with Microsoft.

1250
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:41,600
And I know I've told this story a lot, but it bears repeating, and I'll go into some

1251
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,240
detail, I don't think I've ever gotten into as much detail as I will today, is I worked

1252
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:50,280
for the school district of Arlington when I was a high school student, and I remember

1253
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:55,920
being in their IT department, and we had this, we were deploying wireless links between the

1254
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,920
schools because we were paying tons and tons of money to have T1 direct connections between

1255
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:04,840
each school, and Arlington's actually one of the larger school districts in our state,

1256
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:09,720
and so this was costing the school district tens and tens of thousands of dollars, and

1257
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,720
back then T1s were just outrageously expensive.

1258
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,560
They were the fastest connection you could get, and you paid for it.

1259
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:22,520
And so they decided, well, let's do this one-time investment, they even took out a big loan

1260
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:28,760
to pay for it, let's get these wireless point-to-point links, there's this new protocol called 802.11b,

1261
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,920
and it'll do two megabits, and we'll link all of these schools up over this two megabit

1262
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:33,920
link.

1263
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:40,240
Now you got a bunch of school district employees who are, in this case, his full-time job was

1264
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:45,480
actually a teacher, he wasn't necessarily a network engineer, and this is TCPIP's even

1265
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:50,640
still kind of new-ish, you know, NetBooey, IPX, and AppleTalk were still the dominant

1266
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,080
protocols on the network, so IP segmentation wasn't really something people knew really

1267
01:06:55,080 --> 01:07:01,280
to think about, and so they accidentally deployed across the entire school district one flat

1268
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:08,480
255.255.00 LAN, just this one massive LAN, and it was all interlinked by these two megabit

1269
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,600
wireless connections that were spotty to begin with.

1270
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:17,480
And of course, the router, so if you had a printer that was on a different IP network,

1271
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,700
the router was back at the school district head office, and so to send a print job, every

1272
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,840
time a student printed, so you can imagine at the end of class when the three computer

1273
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,880
labs were all printing out their results, all of this printer traffic would go down

1274
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,980
over the wireless network to the router and then send it back up the wireless network

1275
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:38,060
to the printer that was sitting right next to us all, and it absolutely just destroyed

1276
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:41,180
the entire network and it made the computer systems unusable.

1277
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:45,600
So we knew immediately that we needed to change this up and put routers in front of each wireless

1278
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,280
access point and create a local network where everything could talk on its own local LAN,

1279
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,840
wouldn't have to go down to the school district office.

1280
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,960
I was pretty proud of myself for figuring this out as a high school student.

1281
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:58,280
We got it all styled in and we said, okay, well, NT is this thing, NT5, wasn't called

1282
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,560
Windows 2000, NT5 is this thing that's in active development, and they have this proxy

1283
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,560
server on there.

1284
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,480
No, no, we're not going to use beta software.

1285
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,460
Okay, fair enough, fair enough, well there is a way to do it on NT4, it's called Microsoft

1286
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:14,320
Proxy Server 2.0 or something like that, and it will do some routing and it will do some

1287
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,600
caching because we also wanted web caching, and then eventually be able to, it's a school,

1288
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,320
we wanted to be able to apply filters.

1289
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:23,400
So we put this NT4 box into production on a pretty decent machine and it immediately

1290
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,820
could not handle the traffic.

1291
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:27,140
It was absolutely just not even an option.

1292
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:30,600
And again, we didn't necessarily want to go with beta software, so somebody in one of

1293
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,840
the computer classes says, well, what about this Red Hat?

1294
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,840
What about this?

1295
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,040
And we looked at it, oh, that's interesting, but you know, we didn't have the CDs.

1296
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,480
Well, okay, well we could download this Debian and write it to these floppy disks, and it's

1297
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:45,760
like this whole series of floppy disks, and so we download this Debian thing and we install

1298
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,120
it on the same computer that we had NT4 on previously.

1299
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,600
We put it in there, we find this thing called Squid, we install Squid, right, this is all

1300
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,000
just brand new to us.

1301
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,360
We set up a basic routing table because thankfully one of the teachers there had experience on

1302
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,840
a BSD in the past and knew kind of how to do some of this stuff.

1303
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:06,320
And we put that box in and it was a night and day situation.

1304
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:10,000
Like the network came back, performance was back, printing happened instantly.

1305
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
It was amazing.

1306
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,560
And we all just kind of sat back and went, wow, and that's free?

1307
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,560
We just did that for free?

1308
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,640
Well then pretty soon, because we were in a pilot program with Microsoft, one of the

1309
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,240
parents who was working at Microsoft found out what we had done because the kid went

1310
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:28,120
home from the computer class and told his dad, well, dad worked at Microsoft and dad

1311
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:32,160
wasn't very happy about that because the school district had an agreement with Microsoft.

1312
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:36,600
The deal was the school district got free Microsoft training books, Microsoft Office

1313
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:42,280
and Windows licenses, and the students even got vouchers to turn in to get Microsoft certified

1314
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,280
engineer certificates.

1315
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:47,840
So it was like this really sweetheart deal and they were piloting this program at the

1316
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:51,540
school district because the parent was the one leading it and he used to be a former

1317
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:53,360
student at the school.

1318
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,160
And so when they came in, they said, here's the deal.

1319
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:00,240
If you don't pull that Linux box out and put a Windows NT5 box in its place, we'll pull

1320
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,160
our entire program.

1321
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:08,000
And this is, I mean, to say it's a value of maybe $200,000 might be a low ball because

1322
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,100
it's all of the licenses for all of the Windows boxes in the school district, thousands and

1323
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:15,880
thousands of computers, all of the Office licenses, the voucher program for students

1324
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:20,120
to get certified as a Microsoft certified engineer for free, we're going to pull all

1325
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,680
of that and you will owe us for these machines.

1326
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,660
You will have to cut us a check next year for all of these licenses if you keep this

1327
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:28,520
one Linux box as your router.

1328
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,440
This is one Linux box at one school that we had up for a couple of days.

1329
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:36,440
Like we put it in on a Friday and this is the conversation we're having on a Tuesday.

1330
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,360
It was like that fast that it happened.

1331
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:46,400
And I was so impressed to see my teacher and the technology director of the school district,

1332
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,880
you know, they met with the guy, they thought about it for about a week, which I totally

1333
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,920
understand and at the end of that week they said, we're not going to do it.

1334
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,900
We're not going to pull this Linux box out.

1335
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,440
You can take your funding.

1336
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,840
And I was, and you know what, the school district like had a major problem.

1337
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,460
They had some levy funds that they were using to replace equipment.

1338
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:10,500
They had to take those levy funds and essentially reappropriate them somehow to buy licenses.

1339
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,040
I mean, it was this massive thing.

1340
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,900
And eventually the computer programs died off because of it because they just could

1341
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,220
not fund them anymore.

1342
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:19,780
And now they have like one computer program when they used to have three full time computer

1343
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:23,840
labs with three like all day long computer classes going.

1344
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,800
And so I watched sort of how this first, it was the first approach, the first wave was

1345
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,460
like, well look, Linux isn't going to run for a long time and you know, we're really

1346
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:33,760
working on some great stuff.

1347
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,200
You're going to want to have some filtering at first.

1348
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,380
It was their first pass when they first found out about it was an email that was sort of,

1349
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,640
well here's all the reasons why Linux isn't going to work for you guys.

1350
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,820
You don't want to use this.

1351
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:48,480
And when we rejected those, they immediately escalated to, we're going to pull everything.

1352
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,640
That's unbelievable.

1353
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,640
Not surprising.

1354
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,000
I've, I've heard similar stories, not, not to that severity, but I've heard that that's

1355
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,840
back in those days, especially they could get away with stuff like that.

1356
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,560
They knew that in order to maintain their top of the mountain that they, and then indoctrination

1357
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,560
early was important.

1358
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,560
This might've been even before.

1359
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,560
I don't get how that does not violate antitrust.

1360
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,840
Well, I was just going to say this might've been even before the whole antitrust thing

1361
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,840
happened.

1362
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,840
It probably was.

1363
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,200
Because Internet Explorer was brand, brand new.

1364
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,640
It was like version four.

1365
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:19,920
It was like, Internet Explorer was not bundled with the operating system at this time.

1366
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,760
That antitrust laws are adorable if anyone thinks they're really adhered to.

1367
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,600
I mean, it's all about who, which lobbyists, you know, worked with whomever.

1368
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,600
In the US it's, it's, it's crap.

1369
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,200
This Linux FUD goes all the way back to then because that was their first pass.

1370
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:38,360
That was pass number one was we'll, we'll throw some bull crap at you about this, this

1371
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:43,080
like they, they, they even, they even took issue with the proxy software we use.

1372
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,160
It's called Squid.

1373
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,160
Are you kidding me?

1374
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,160
Right?

1375
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:47,160
Like, like everything.

1376
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,160
They tried everything.

1377
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:53,000
Well, in fairness, Squid is the universal symbol for evil, evil people, you know, the,

1378
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
the, you know, like supervillains, they always have a Squid thing going on.

1379
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
That's true.

1380
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Good point.

1381
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Yeah, that is true.

1382
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And maybe they are.

1383
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,840
Maybe it's, maybe the Squid project is just taking the, the long burn approach to their

1384
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,840
evil plans.

1385
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,840
Anyways, I got a link in the show notes that talks about blaming, blame the Linux FUD for

1386
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,040
Microsoft dominance in schools.

1387
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,120
If you guys want to read more about that now, we'd like to have you join us live.

1388
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,400
We got this virtual lug here in our mumble room.

1389
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,400
You can hang out.

1390
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,480
We have these shows on Tuesdays at 2pm Pacific.

1391
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:24,120
You can get that in your local time over at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar.

1392
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,500
We also want your feedback.

1393
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:29,640
You can email us, go over to Jupiter broadcasting.com and pop the contact link and choose Linux

1394
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,120
unplugged from that dropdown.

1395
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,120
Do that.

1396
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:35,720
Sometimes you set you guys, sometimes you choose general comments.

1397
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:40,160
I don't read those too often, but I read the Linux unplugged ones every Tuesday.

1398
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,160
So there you go.

1399
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,160
All right, Matt.

1400
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:45,480
Well, we got a how to coming up on this week's episode of the Linux action show.

1401
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,480
Nice.

1402
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,560
We got some security stuff in the works too, we'll be talking about very soon.

1403
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,040
And then we also have that little guy distro review we'll be doing.

1404
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,800
So we got a lot of stuff coming up.

1405
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:54,800
Good stuff.

1406
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,800
All right, everybody.

1407
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,360
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux unplugged.

1408
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,440
Go over to iTunes and rate and comment if you haven't yet.

1409
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,440
That helps discovery.

1410
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:17,080
And we hope to see you right back here next week.
