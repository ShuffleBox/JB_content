00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,680
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 300 in Lucky 33 for December 24th, 2019.

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,220
Hello friends and welcome into a special holiday edition of your Unplugged program.

3
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,220
My name is Chris.

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,220
My name is Wes.

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,220
Hello Wes.

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,220
Hello.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,960
I'm impressed that you dressed up even though this is an audio podcast.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,040
Yeah, I mean this is not a comfortable suit.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,040
You gotta be warm right now.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,320
For the holidays.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,040
You are such a trooper.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,520
And look at this beard.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,440
Also wearing a pretty hat, it's Alex and Cheese.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
Hello gentlemen.

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
Hello.

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
Ho, ho, ho.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Is that one hat?

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
They're sharing the hat.

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,800
Yeah, I'm impressed.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,400
You guys both fit in that really well and the audio still sounds good.

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Pros.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,960
And then of course here to help us celebrate this special event, it's our virtual log time

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
appropriate.

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
Greetings mumble room.

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,960
Hello.

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Hello everybody.

27
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,880
You know, I'm, I just got to say as a special holiday, welcome to Ace Nomad, Ben, Mr. Big

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:18,520
Daddy Linux, AKA Rocco, Brent, Byte, Cubicle, Nate, Jill, Minimac, and the Silent Drifter.

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Happy holidays.

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,120
Thank you for joining us live today guys.

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,820
It's nice to have you here.

32
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,840
Now we're going to do something sort of special this episode.

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,200
We're going to look back at the last decade of how open source has changed the world and

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,720
a couple of key moments that bent the universe that led to the eventual takeover.

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,960
I think it's indisputable.

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,740
Open source has won the technology sector to the point where every major company you

37
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,100
can announce has some skin in the game.

38
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,680
It's on most people's handsets.

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,120
It runs the cloud and here we are not 13 years later, still podcasting about the very topic.

40
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,720
And when you look back over the decade, there's a few monumental moments, just a few, just

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
massive things that changed everything.

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,960
And we're going to look at those, but then because we like to always kick things up a

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,160
notch here on the old unplugged cooking program, we're going to ask, what would the world be

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,280
like if that never happened?

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,240
And we'll use our future casters to kind of talk about what things would be like if some

46
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,480
of those wins and successes had never happened.

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
I think that's going to be a lot of fun.

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,760
I'm a little scared for a world we come up with, but I'm comforted that we live here.

49
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:39,000
I know it's funny because so often, you know, we think about how there is just awful consequences

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,760
of these platforms or those platforms or this is a lock-in or that's a lock-down.

51
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,760
All the limitations of proprietary tech that's out there.

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,960
But we take for granted some of the wins that we really should celebrate.

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,140
Yeah, you get where I'm at.

54
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,320
You get where I'm coming from.

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,200
So we just have a couple of community items I wanted to cover before we get into that.

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,480
A couple of them actually must just be the time of the year are also looking back at

57
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,960
the last 10 years for Tails and looking back at the last 10 years at GNOME.

58
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,160
But let's start with something that's a little more modern.

59
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,400
This is an accumulation of all the stuff we're about to talk about.

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,680
And Alex really found a great article over at the Linux server IO blog.

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,680
This sounds really cool because it's got a couple of words in the headline, Alex, that

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
I like.

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
And that's all it really takes these days.

64
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
That's how you get in the show.

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
Tell me about it.

66
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,280
Well, it's nothing new, really.

67
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,640
You last covered this on last 400 back in January 2016.

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,160
And this is netboot.xyz.

69
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,560
And what this lets you do is network boot over pixie boot any server, really.

70
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,560
So rather than having to download an ISO and flash a thumb drive and yada, yada, yada,

71
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,800
you can just netboot off of this pixie server.

72
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,780
So it's very useful for those of us that like to distro hop or whatever.

73
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,320
And now thanks to the team over at Linux server, you can run it out of a Docker container.

74
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,360
So are pixie booting containers now?

75
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Not quite.

76
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:05,400
It still lets you pixie boot ISOs effectively to boot into Debian, Ubuntu, Zorin OS, like

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,800
any.

78
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,080
To be honest, you can actually have a BSD installer in there, a Windows installer, as

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
well as any Linux ISO.

80
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,120
So it seems like it's sort of streamlined that from somewhat from the somewhat arcane

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,920
sort of set up a pixie server somewhere, go find and source all the images, get them set

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
up the right way.

83
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,460
If I can just do that all that with one container, right.

84
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,880
And then when you're done, unless I'm unless you don't have a network bootable system,

85
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,560
but pretty much every systems network bootable, you could kind of be all done with using thumb

86
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,700
drives and burning ISOs to sticks like just use this on your network.

87
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,400
That's that's pretty slick.

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,680
And you plug it in with the nginx let's encrypt container that they offer as well.

89
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,880
And you can host any image you want locally.

90
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,480
There's no cloud required.

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,080
Wes, this is this is how we could sort of do like a parachute approach for the arch

92
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
server.

93
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,000
So we've got the snapshots and then this as like a backup.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,640
You don't remember when you were saying if you could have it any way you would have it

95
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,960
where we would deploy images.

96
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,680
So we would just do the updates as an image.

97
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Yeah.

98
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,680
What if we use pixie boot?

99
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Yeah.

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Okay.

101
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
And we use this right?

102
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Right.

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,400
I think you're trying to find some ways to make this setup go horribly wrong.

104
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
But I'm it.

105
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Oh, you crazy guy.

106
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,400
You're supposed to tell me now just imagine a net bootable mem test or a net bootable

107
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,400
G party or something, you know, it's useful, right?

108
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
So you add a container to one of your systems that does that host this thing.

109
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,840
And then I guess you'd have to update your DHCP config to to point to that container.

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Correct.

111
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,280
Yeah, they go over the full details in the article.

112
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,680
But you can download there's a web interface built in and you download the ISOs that way.

113
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,760
Oh, it's got so cool.

114
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,520
Look at that.

115
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
That's pretty cool.

116
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,160
But the friendliest way to set up pixie I've ever seen.

117
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Wow.

118
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
No kidding.

119
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
That is all right.

120
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,440
That is pretty great.

121
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
Hmm.

122
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,200
Linux home plug calm slash three three three if you want to get a link to this.

123
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,080
I mean, I've had that before, you know, like an arch ISO ready to go and it can be nice

124
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,760
you have your you know, you have someone over need to do tech support, you just plug it

125
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,120
in, you've got your environment ready to go and you can start inspecting their device.

126
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,280
Anybody here ever use Norton ghost and like did like the whole ghosting of a whole lab

127
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
or anything like that?

128
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,800
This is the sound of me sheepishly raising my hand.

129
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Yeah.

130
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Yeah.

131
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
I mean, we're talking about the proprietary stuff.

132
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
That was boom.

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Norton ghost.

134
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,760
I can't remember like that some sort of like ghost cast can't remember the name multicast

135
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,440
where you would broadcast the image to all the stations at once.

136
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
It was pretty slick.

137
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,320
Yeah, it was kind of cool.

138
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,720
It's just that it was just a hell of a thing to have to manage.

139
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,280
It was too much.

140
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,920
But this is way cooler.

141
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,720
So check out a link to that in the show notes.

142
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,800
Now let's talk about tales celebrating 10 years of well, itself.

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
10 years of tales.

144
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
What kind of a legacy really?

145
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,840
I mean, the first release of tales was really called amnesia back in 2009.

146
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,200
Since then, they've released 98 versions of tales and remember tales is this secure live

147
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,380
environment you can go into, you know, do all your private Bitcoin and whatnot.

148
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,380
It's very handy.

149
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,520
I'm glad it exists.

150
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,040
And to their credit, they also call out some of the projects that sort of inspired and

151
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,760
helped them when they got started way back in the 2000s.

152
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,280
And one of those stood out.

153
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
That was Knoppix.

154
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Remember Knoppix Chris?

155
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,480
Oh, yes, I remember Knoppix.

156
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,920
Knoppix was the first live CD and what's incredible about Knoppix and you can check this out for

157
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
yourself.

158
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Go to knoppix.org.

159
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,920
K-N-O-P-P-I-X.org.

160
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,520
I swear to Linus that looks just like it did back in 2000.

161
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
I don't think it has changed.

162
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,800
It really hasn't changed at all.

163
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,720
But it was the first live CD that kind of gained wide adoption.

164
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,760
And Jill, you remember this had like the little hardware scanning progress thing when Knoppix

165
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
would boot up?

166
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
Oh, yeah.

167
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Oh, definitely.

168
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
That was cool.

169
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,220
It would felt like, oh, man, Linux can detect anything like it can just adapt and boot on

170
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,220
any system.

171
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,360
That's what Knoppix felt like to me.

172
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Yeah.

173
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Yeah, definitely.

174
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,200
In fact, I still have it installed on an old Penny and Pro 200.

175
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
That's awesome.

176
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,520
Well, I remember thinking it was one of those things that sort of stood out to Linux, even

177
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,720
if you weren't yet into some of the, you know, the philosophy underlying it.

178
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
It was like, here's this thing that your other operating systems can't do.

179
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,640
What a demo.

180
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
What a demo.

181
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Yeah.

182
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,080
And now that's how we install every distro basically.

183
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,920
Well, not every distro, but you know what I mean.

184
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,640
And we still call them live CDs.

185
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, it's so funny.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,240
I saw recently the Fedora project was discussing like if they actually want to make CD compatibility

187
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,480
like a blocker for the release or not, and they're like, yeah, maybe we should drop this.

188
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,740
There's a lot of complicated stuff that goes in there, you know, to make these images that

189
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,420
work on CDs and USBs, I'd be, I'm all for simpler.

190
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,480
So here we are now, started as Amnesia, but now it's known as Tails.

191
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:45,080
Now, of course, they've got the installer, which is forked from the Fedora live USB creator.

192
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,800
They have persistence mode if you want to stay in Tails all the time, automatic updatings,

193
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,480
back spoofing, the Tails greeter, which helps you get through some of the initial stuff,

194
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,600
the metadata anonymization toolkit, which they've been using since 2011, as part of

195
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,240
it started as a Google Summer of Code thing, like, so much legacy now.

196
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Yes.

197
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,080
One thing that I really like about this post at the end is one of their section titles

198
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,340
2015 to 2019, sort of the era we've been in now, and the section title is maturity, user

199
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,440
experience in automation.

200
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,280
And I think that just sums up a lot of what has happened in the entire Linux ecosystem.

201
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,320
Really, seriously.

202
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,680
We just really have seen a lot of that from automated testing to automated continuous

203
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,760
building and deployments to all of it.

204
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
It's really...

205
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,160
I mean, we're still here to gripe about the edges that are not yet polished.

206
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,960
We have to hunt pretty hard to find them.

207
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,800
Not hard enough.

208
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,160
And then over on Feronix, Michael Arbel has a 10 years past Gnomes 10 by 10 goal.

209
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,440
The Linux desktop is still far from having 10% market share.

210
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,240
I think he woke up on the wrong side of the bed one morning and he wrote this piece because

211
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,240
he's just...

212
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,280
Maybe his Gnome shell crashed.

213
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
I know.

214
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,920
He's just kind of having an unnecessary go at Gnome.

215
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,760
We all know this happened, but he writes way back in 2005, the Gnome 10 by 10 goal was

216
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,100
formed to, quote, own 10% of the global desktop market by 2010.

217
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,000
Now approaching 10 years past that failed goal, Gnome or even the broader Linux desktop

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,400
market share is still well off from seeing a 10% market share.

219
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
All right.

220
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
This is relevant for our episode today.

221
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Let's talk about this.

222
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Yeah.

223
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,760
He does note that that very ambitious goal is still documented on the Gnome wiki.

224
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,520
Yeah, it's still there.

225
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,320
The year of the Linux desktop is another cliche and all of that.

226
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,320
It's something that Rocco and I got into in my Linux spotlight actually was what is really

227
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,300
the year of the Linux desktop?

228
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,040
And you've probably asked that question Rocco in a few different ways and you must get various

229
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,840
different answers on that.

230
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,480
Everybody has a different take on it.

231
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,560
And one of my favorites is actually Cubicle Nate's take on it where he said that the year

232
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,080
of the Linux desktop is the year you found Linux.

233
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
Right.

234
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
That's what I thought.

235
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,760
He's kind of, you know, like larbles kind of having a shot here.

236
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,520
It's like, well, haven't we all gotten past this mentality?

237
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,100
We're kind of over this.

238
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,320
And I think to those of us who really see people's choice of an operating system is

239
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,520
a very personal thing and you know, you choose what works for you.

240
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,760
I have found what works for me.

241
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,360
I pass no judgment if something else works better for you.

242
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
We have a lot of things going on in life.

243
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,120
This is something I'm passionate about.

244
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
You don't have to be.

245
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,120
Right.

246
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
I'd love for you to be passionate about it.

247
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
I'd love to share it with you.

248
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Very willing to tell you why it's great.

249
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,120
But yeah, people, you know, you got to make the choices that work for you at the end of

250
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
the day.

251
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Here, listen to my podcast.

252
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Listen to my podcast.

253
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Only one?

254
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Okay.

255
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Listen to all of them.

256
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,760
But no, really, I genuinely do try to practice in real life.

257
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,120
When I meet somebody, I try to be accepting of what operating system they use.

258
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,920
And I think we've all, well, I shouldn't say that, but a lot of us have kind of come to

259
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,400
that way of thinking.

260
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:57,560
Ten years in, we're really kind of looking at like, by most metrics, it seems to be somewhere

261
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,120
around 2% market share.

262
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,980
I wonder, too, how much of this is, you know, we're in a different position.

263
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,840
We talk a lot about the Microsoft's new position in terms of open source and Linux.

264
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,480
So I think us being so vitriolic about the fight to convince everyone, it makes less

265
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,360
sense when there's less parties that we're fighting against.

266
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Hmm.

267
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Yeah.

268
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,880
And I think, too, the type of user can matter a lot.

269
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:29,160
It can be 2% of a very particular type of user that can matter a lot to a large industry.

270
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,000
I think the Sputnik program is an often cited example of that.

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,160
But you look at the desktop strategy of Ubuntu in general, and I think it is an indicator

272
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,880
that that 2% is something that corporations are still interested in catering to.

273
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,120
2.1, I think, was the latest net market share report.

274
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Something around there.

275
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
You look at the valve stats.

276
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
You look at different stuff.

277
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Right.

278
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,280
And it also doesn't tell the story of, you know, like what the support actually looks

279
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
like.

280
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,240
We've seen a lot more, at least just with the advance of web technologies in general,

281
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,840
we're in a lot better place now than we were for the software you might need for everyday

282
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,560
life actually running on Linux, despite relatively no change in market share.

283
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Unquestionably.

284
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,280
Just so much better now.

285
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,160
So much better off with, I mean, there's so many things that we do for work now that are

286
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,960
web based or online that in the past required Windows to do basic things at work like submitting

287
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
for time off.

288
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,440
I mean, I remember having a complicated virtual box set up to run Outlook so that it would

289
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,400
pop up in its own little window.

290
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
So glad I don't have to do that.

291
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Heck yeah.

292
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
I totally rock one of those.

293
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Yeah.

294
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,640
I made a lot of sacrifices back in the day to make Linux happen.

295
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,720
I was one of those individuals running Xandros.

296
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
You remember Xandros?

297
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Yeah, Xandros.

298
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,760
If you bought the pro edition or whatever it was, came with crossover office out of

299
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,360
the box and during the first user set up would allow you to join to a Windows domain.

300
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Really?

301
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Yeah.

302
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,760
So I could log in to my Xandros KDE4 desktop using my Active Directory or NT4.

303
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,720
I can't remember how long ago this was, credentials, both worked eventually.

304
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,020
And I would even be able to set like file permission ownerships based on the usernames

305
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,280
and groups from the NT domain.

306
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
That is nice.

307
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Yeah.

308
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,640
Although still that we don't have to do that.

309
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
I know.

310
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,800
And this was like a special commercial version of Linux that I personally paid for.

311
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,540
And then like, on the low key installed on my work computer.

312
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,200
It's funny, you know, we had to have those fights.

313
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,000
But it was made easier by the fact that Linux is so flexible and that you can actually do

314
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
things like that.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, really.

316
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,640
It really, it really was, it was, it was incredible what the operating system could do.

317
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,840
And 10 years ago, plus I felt like I was trying to show everyone the light.

318
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,600
Like I had found out and discovered about this new promised land that nobody believed

319
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
in.

320
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Right.

321
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,640
And we were all staying in this place where there wasn't enough water and there wasn't

322
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,560
enough food and everybody was miserable.

323
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,280
It's just over this Windows XP Hill.

324
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,040
Yeah.

325
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,780
And now that is clearly not the position we're in anymore.

326
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,120
There are so many voices advocating and there are so many reasons to run free and open source

327
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,240
software or to build products around it that it advocates for itself really.

328
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,600
I mean, the momentum of it.

329
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Right.

330
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
I mean, and people who are in that space, you know, they don't use it.

331
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,080
I mean, you know, business people, everyone knows at least that it's involved or it's

332
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,600
a name in the space.

333
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:31,000
So every year I go on this annual shopping trip since I've been 21 with my dad and his

334
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,160
two lifelong buddies.

335
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,440
And every year it's my opportunity to kind of check in with where they're at, you know,

336
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,840
on the technological curve.

337
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,920
How they observe what's happening in the tech space.

338
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,960
And you know, gone now are the questions of what, what is Linux?

339
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,160
What is this Linux thing?

340
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,960
And it's, oh yeah, that's what's the cloud runs on there, right?

341
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,640
Linux run, that's what the cloud runs on.

342
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm like, yeah, and your phone.

343
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Yeah.

344
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
Yeah.

345
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,040
And your phone and your bank and, you know, everything.

346
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,560
But it's interesting that they actually are aware that it's a thing, even though there's

347
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,840
nothing they connect to on a daily basis that says the word Linux, nothing they interact

348
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,120
with that says Linux, none of their jobs.

349
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,720
I mean, mostly they're in the telco industry, the construction industry, yeah, and the construction

350
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,880
industry and like, there's nothing really in there that has anything to do with technology.

351
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,720
So it's always fascinating to see what the sort of perception level is.

352
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,760
And they, they get it.

353
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,360
They get that services are a thing.

354
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,520
They might not quite understand the scope of responsibility, all the privacy implications,

355
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,840
but they get the idea that there's these third party services.

356
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,400
And they, one of the things they were discussing is, well, how can I back up my photos when

357
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,400
I take them on my phone, but not put them on the cloud?

358
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,160
Like I want to transfer them to like a thumb drive if I can.

359
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,760
And how can I do that, Christopher?

360
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,640
Cause they'll, they'll, all three of them call me Christopher.

361
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,720
And of course I'm walking through all the different scenarios and asking about their

362
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,720
dumb little Android devices that are horrible and all these kinds of things.

363
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,520
And oh, and then of course my dad's got the iPhone, so I'm like, yeah, well, listen, dad,

364
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
here's what you got to do.

365
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,320
You got to go through this whole rigmarole because otherwise you're going to be using

366
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,280
iCloud and it's just this whole process, but they get the questions now.

367
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,120
And I didn't introduce them to these things.

368
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Yeah.

369
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Yeah.

370
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,480
Amongst their buddies on their various excursions.

371
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,480
So it's been fascinating to watch that trend, but we got a lot to get into.

372
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
You ready to do this?

373
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,640
A decade of Linux West.

374
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,540
So we do have a couple of probably just, let's say last week we had a big housekeeping.

375
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,120
This week we have a short housekeeping.

376
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,680
So just a couple of things right off the top.

377
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,620
Great chance to get caught up on Linux headlines.

378
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,640
It will be taking a holiday break.

379
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,800
All of that's in there.

380
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,780
So go check that out if you haven't yet.

381
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,800
If you, if you haven't, it's fine.

382
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
It's totally fine.

383
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,200
It won't take you long to catch up.

384
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,160
Just three minutes or less.

385
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,280
I mean, last week you were so hard on people, Wes, about not listening to headlines and

386
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
I just want to say it's fine.

387
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
You're right.

388
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
I was wrong.

389
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,320
I don't want to be a big man and say that.

390
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,960
And if you'd like to get all your content with YouTube DL, you know, I do Jupiter extras

391
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,080
is on YouTube now so you can go get that.

392
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,760
Go subscribe to so we can name it.

393
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
Have we gotten enough?

394
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Let's go look Wes.

395
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,640
Have we gotten enough subscribers to name our, uh, extra show?

396
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
139.

397
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
I think that might be enough.

398
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
Right?

399
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,640
Oh, probably.

400
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Was it a thousand?

401
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
We need it.

402
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
I can't remember.

403
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
Better go subscribe.

404
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
You bet.

405
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
You better go over there and subscribe.

406
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Cause I can't remember.

407
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
And you'll get some extra notifications about, you know, when there's a new extra.

408
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,320
Now I know over the holidays you're missing us.

409
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
We're not live.

410
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,680
We're not around.

411
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,180
You want a little more West pain.

412
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,760
Don't we all Jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram.

413
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
Keep the conversation going in our telegram group.

414
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
We're chatting over there all the time.

415
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,760
I try to pop in a couple of times a day.

416
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,600
Most of us are in there in and out throughout the day over there.

417
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,520
Check it out at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram.

418
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Yeah.

419
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
I promised you it was a short one.

420
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Didn't I?

421
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Boom.

422
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,640
It's just a couple of things to mention.

423
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Now last week we talked about brunch with Brent and Jason.

424
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
Help me with the Brent.

425
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
Help me with it.

426
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
You got this.

427
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
You got this.

428
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
All right.

429
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
Spezac.

430
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
Spezac.

431
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Spezac.

432
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Spezac.

433
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Spezac.

434
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
I wrote it down.

435
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
You did write it down and then crossed it out for some reason.

436
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
Cause I nailed it.

437
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
So then I cried.

438
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
I don't need that anymore.

439
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Four thoughts.

440
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,900
Just going to throw this away.

441
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,280
We got a great brunch and part two is out now and it made me really kind of think about

442
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,840
this topic we're about to get into this decade.

443
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,720
And Jason makes a fantastic point from a great perspective of years past.

444
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,520
And we look here now where open source is ruling the world and we're joking about Android

445
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,720
on their phones and yucking about how it runs the cloud.

446
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Ha ha ha.

447
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
Look at us.

448
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
The champions.

449
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,440
We are the champions.

450
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,560
But it didn't actually have to go down this way.

451
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,560
Maybe if the antitrust case hadn't gone the way it had or the right deals have been made

452
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,400
or the right person offered Linus the right job maybe maybe we wouldn't have had these

453
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,220
victories and in Brent's chat with Jason he really got me thinking so I want to play this

454
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,160
clip it's just a couple of minutes long.

455
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,720
It'll set the stage for the rest of our conversation.

456
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,660
It was my first experience with the idea that you have all the source code.

457
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:16,680
You're not beholden to a corporate entity to run your computer to license the software

458
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,280
and if you make a change and you improve the software if you have an idea it can be contributed

459
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:28,880
back to the greater whole for everybody so to me it was a micro example of human knowledge.

460
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,000
Patents are not.

461
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,360
He's talking just to set this up a little bit about Linux and open source and free software

462
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
in general.

463
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,640
He's talking about how the difference between something being available for free and something

464
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,060
being locked behind a patent is the difference between all of humanity knowing something

465
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,240
and a select few.

466
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,480
millennia you know thousands of centuries when a human gets an idea he shares it with

467
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,640
another human and then she shares it with somebody else and then she gives it to her

468
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,680
kids and then he shares it to his kids and then you basically have the volume of human

469
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:09,540
knowledge accelerated our ability to enforce our will upon nature at such a pace because

470
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,200
of the interconnections and sharing.

471
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,640
That's why we are the dominant species on the planet not just luck but our ability to

472
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,000
communicate and share ideas and then share knowledge because of that allows us to get

473
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,860
solve problems that there's just no way you could solve them if your your knowledge died

474
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:33,900
with the last person that knew a certain thing you know fast forward centuries into the future

475
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,360
and here we are.

476
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:43,920
That's why Linux has such a snowball rolling downhill effect when it comes to software

477
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,960
for computer and then Mike the ecosystem around it is because it's basically a representation

478
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,280
of what's happens with human knowledge without any restrictions.

479
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,940
If you don't have patents and if you don't have arbitrary lines between you know boundaries

480
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,580
between countries or whatever you know we share ideas with each other and just to make

481
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,520
the sum total of that knowledge better for everyone.

482
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,600
Well that's why it works that's why it works and that bit me in the leg.

483
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm like okay this is awesome.

484
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,420
So it's the embodiment of what human knowledge and sharing is normally in software which

485
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:23,560
part of this point hadn't been and it was digital freedom or what I call digital independence

486
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,360
and that's huge because I could see the future developing around me that the internet would

487
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,440
soon be everything fax machines were just on their way out.

488
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,320
And I was like okay if everything happens inside the computer and wires that connect

489
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,160
us he who controls the wires and the computer controls everything will control the knowledge

490
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
of the world.

491
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,640
So we can't let that be a company especially not Microsoft.

492
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,760
They were awful awful from a business practice perspective not just a convicted monopolist

493
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,960
but good night.

494
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,840
So that's a bit of the framework I want to work from as we discuss through some of this

495
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,360
is let's appreciate the success we have seen so far even if we don't have 10 percent of

496
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,560
the desktop market share like we thought we would 10 years ago.

497
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,620
We still have some incredible wins and maybe we're not at that 10 percent because in some

498
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,280
areas things didn't go super well.

499
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:23,760
I think a lot of us remember the day when Ubuntu shipped Gnome 2 and then there was

500
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,600
the day when they no longer shipped Gnome 2.

501
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,720
Well I mean just to think that at the start of this decade Gnome 2 was still quite relevant.

502
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Yeah.

503
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Yeah.

504
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,760
Gnome Shell became the default.

505
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,960
Gnome Shell 3 became the default I should say in April of 2011.

506
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,640
That's how long ago it was.

507
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,520
Ubuntu 11.04 shipped with Unity.

508
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,720
Mate first released in August of 2011.

509
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,160
Are you seeing how close these are together?

510
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:00,320
Razer Cute and LXDE merged in July of 2013.

511
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,280
Once that announcement was made about Gnome Shell 3 we just kind of went off in a bunch

512
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,540
of different pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, we just went off in all these

513
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
different directions.

514
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,880
We just we really fractured as a community.

515
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,840
You can really see it in the desktop there and of course that also was around the Vista

516
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:25,920
and Windows 8 timelines where we had our own missteps and very cunningly Apple picked up

517
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,240
a bunch of the DevOps sysadmin type terminal workers that also wanted a reliable stable

518
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,480
GUI.

519
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,240
Their OS was beginning to mature, their Mac OS, next based OS was beginning to mature

520
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,240
at that time.

521
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,320
They had time to iterate there on that.

522
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,600
So it's not a huge win.

523
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,920
It probably depends on your perspective though.

524
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,360
I think we often get too distracted by the miss on the desktop and we don't focus on

525
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,880
all of the other wins.

526
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,280
It's like wins everywhere else.

527
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,800
It's this one area and I personally, and I think I speak for you too, I'm very happy

528
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
with my Linux desktop.

529
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Right.

530
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
So that's it.

531
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,880
I mean it depends on what we've defined as success because in some ways if you were using

532
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,200
one of these desktops that emerged from that tough period you're probably ecstatic, right?

533
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,680
We have Montair, we have the very different direction that Gnome has ended up going.

534
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,120
We're on the other side in some sense.

535
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,520
Yeah, and now looking back at it, it seems almost necessary, like we had to work through

536
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
it.

537
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,440
It also sort of speaks to what is different about the software we're using and the Linux

538
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
desktop communities, right?

539
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,720
Like it has cost us.

540
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
There were costs to pay.

541
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,680
We missed up on some adoption, drove some users away for a while, but at the same time

542
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,360
it happened because it can happen in our ecosystem because there is this free sharing of ideas

543
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
and code.

544
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
Hmm.

545
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
True.

546
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
True.

547
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:49,640
So it was Ubuntu 11.04 that shipped Unity and then it was Ubuntu 17.10 that went back

548
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,800
to Gnome.

549
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Some years in there.

550
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Yes.

551
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,000
I mean I remember I was one of the ones that was like, oh like Unity, no.

552
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,840
That's when I first started playing with XFCE, so that's one thing that hasn't changed too

553
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
much.

554
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,480
Isn't that the UI they made for netbooks?

555
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,400
Unity, that was my reaction.

556
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,720
Unity, that's the netbook UI.

557
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,200
And now you know there's people listening that are still running it.

558
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,480
It ended up being a great desktop.

559
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,800
So let's talk about where we're clearly doing really well, and that's on the server side.

560
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,560
And there's been a few key technologies over the years.

561
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,720
I think it's without a shadow of a doubt, in part due to the accessibility of Linux,

562
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,120
the cost of getting them started, the way you can run on your own systems to test development,

563
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,960
and you can move something that you built on your own system up to the cloud and run

564
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,040
it in production, and it's just as reliable with thousands of users using it.

565
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,200
I mean this decade was the cloud decade, right?

566
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,080
It was one of the biggest transitions we've seen, and Linux was ready for it.

567
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,400
It wasn't absolutely necessarily clear though, and this is one of the areas I'd like us to

568
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,960
reflect on if things hadn't gone right.

569
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,360
I want to take you back to, when was it Wes?

570
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,760
Go back in the time machine.

571
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,760
September 9th, 2013.

572
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Doodly-doot, doodly-doot.

573
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,520
So we're going back to September 9th, 2013.

574
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:21,720
Before Docker was a thing, it had just recently been open sourced, and it wasn't clear really

575
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,200
what the point was and how big it was going to be.

576
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:33,240
And so a couple of dudes from DocCloud joined Mike and I to talk about this new Docker project

577
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,840
that they open sourced recently.

578
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Right.

579
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,280
So we were running a platform as a service company, and platform as a service basically

580
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,040
makes it easier for developers to get their ideas up and running in production.

581
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:53,800
And the thing that we noticed as we were running this platform as a service company is that

582
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,720
developers were, even with a great service like ours, were still spending far too much

583
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,480
time worrying about whether their code would run in-house, whether it would run on different

584
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
clouds.

585
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:12,160
And so in 2013, it was hard to appreciate that you were hearing what these developers

586
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,760
were solving.

587
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,100
They were solving a problem they had for their own software as a service platform, and in

588
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,440
doing so, they created this thing called Docker.

589
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,980
And then they thought, well, if it's useful for us, maybe it'd be useful for other people.

590
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,940
And that's when it caught our attention.

591
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,880
And so they're worried about how the code is going to run rather than worrying about

592
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,120
creating awesome code.

593
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,000
And so we took a lot of the core technology that we had in running our platform as a service

594
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,060
and released it as open source, and that's the Docker project.

595
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:49,560
And Docker really basically lets you, as a developer, take any application and its dependencies

596
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,160
and package it up in a lightweight virtual container that will run almost anywhere.

597
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,840
It will run on any Linux server, so it can be in-house, it can be at Amazon, it can be

598
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,600
at Rackspace, it can be at any other of the cloud providers.

599
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,440
And you know that what works on your laptop as a developer will work in cast and production,

600
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
et cetera.

601
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,640
What a trip to hear that now.

602
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:17,960
The co-founders of Docker coming on our humble little podcast, Coder Radio Episode 66, to

603
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,040
talk about this new thing they'd started called Docker.

604
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:27,640
And now here we are many years later, and it has obviously led to the dominance in the

605
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
cloud.

606
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
It's interesting how it caught fire too, right?

607
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,600
I mean, cgroups emerged back in 2008, and LXC had been around roughly since then.

608
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,360
But Docker had the right pitch, it had the right explanation, and then the right interface

609
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,160
to get people excited about what containers could do.

610
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,200
And it's that classic open source story where they had a problem that they needed to solve

611
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,480
and they thought, hey, maybe somebody else could use this.

612
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,680
Real treat to talk to the co-founders before it was even a thing.

613
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,580
And if you follow Mike on social media, he's doing a Thaleo giveaway right now for students

614
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,580
I think.

615
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
I think it's students.

616
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,080
So check that out, because if you're a student and interested in getting a Thaleo, he's got

617
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,820
details on his social media.

618
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,280
So Episode 66, if you want to hear our full interview with the co-founders of Docker before

619
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,160
it was even really a thing, it's really a treat.

620
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:21,080
And the thing that I want to stress from that discussion is, in talking to them, we had

621
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,520
a sense this was going to go somewhere.

622
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,960
That's why we invited them on the show, obviously.

623
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,220
But you really had no idea the revolution it was going to lead to.

624
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,960
Because there had been what seemed like similar attempts to solve this problem.

625
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
Right.

626
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,760
Obviously, those sort of concepts weren't new.

627
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,360
But there was enough to push it over.

628
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,040
I mean, you've sort of just recently come around to having containers everywhere in

629
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
your life.

630
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
It took a little while to get there.

631
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,200
I got them at home and at work now.

632
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,960
But the tooling has advanced so that the tooling created to solve these scaling problems for

633
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,520
cloud providers can help you too.

634
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Yeah.

635
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,220
So, fast forward, we have a community around these things, like Linux server IO speaks

636
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,220
to that, Alex.

637
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,120
There's a huge community, billion plus users over there, or dead polls or whatever the

638
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
quote is.

639
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,200
But I mean, it's a huge group of folks all around open source software shipping using

640
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Docker.

641
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,600
6.4 billion image pools at the latest count.

642
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Holy smokes.

643
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
Yeah, I don't know that we would have seen that, right?

644
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,980
I mean, it made sense sort of from the developer side, you're working on it in the back end.

645
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,160
But it's also become an app distribution platform.

646
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,680
Well, there were other projects trying to solve this issue.

647
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,480
You know, HashiCorp had Vagrant trying to make developer images that were kind of shippable,

648
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
so to speak.

649
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
Right.

650
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,940
But where I saw Docker really win was in the enterprise.

651
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,400
And I think that bears out pretty well over the next five or six years of containers and

652
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,160
orchestration and that kind of thing.

653
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,960
Because it allowed software developers who were working on their laptop to have quote

654
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,480
unquote, the same environment as was in production for the first time.

655
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Yeah.

656
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,000
The Docker co-founders mentioned that too.

657
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,360
That was a thing that really mattered to developers.

658
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,040
That quality of life thing mattered.

659
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,560
More people were making code.

660
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,680
And you know, by 2015, they gained a bit of a reputation for moving too fast.

661
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,640
In 2016, things have sort of shifted.

662
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,520
Red Hat started getting more involved.

663
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,280
Then Red Hat actually shipped Docker in RHEL.

664
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,740
In 2018, Red Hat got Sirius and acquired CoreOS.

665
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,960
And it's really kind of just gone from there.

666
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,640
Now here we are in 2019, and Mantis has acquired the enterprise division of Docker.

667
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
Right.

668
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,840
I mean, it sort of popularized things, but as those ideas were proved out, somewhat been

669
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,240
undercut in the sense that all the tech was just packaged up essentially in the kernel

670
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,960
and other open source utilities, right?

671
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,680
So you've got other implementations of basically all the different features of Docker now.

672
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,040
I think there's a little bit of a question of what's the next decade going to look for

673
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
them.

674
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,640
Everyone has a container strategy.

675
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,440
You know, Amazon have EKS, Google have their Kubernetes offerings, and so does Azure as

676
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
well.

677
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,400
VMware acquired Pivotal, who were competing in that kind of container space as well.

678
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:13,280
So you know, if you don't have a container strategy at this point, you're not a player.

679
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,000
It is interesting to me to note how well Linux has continued to do in the sense that, you

680
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,260
know, you see Docker having somewhat of a troubled path, but Kubernetes has taken off

681
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:25,580
in that time and become a rising star based on a lot of the same technology because of

682
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,580
open source.

683
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,640
It's a little surprising in some sense that, you know, some of the technology underlying

684
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,080
Linux hasn't already been broken off to new tooling.

685
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,880
In fact, in a lot of ways, it's become the universal runtime.

686
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,880
Right.

687
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,800
I mean, that's why we have the WSL and Chromebooks can run Linux stuff now.

688
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,280
I mean, there's really not a reason besides maybe the adoption, the right timing, it could

689
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,600
have been a BSD, it could have been some proprietary OS.

690
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,920
Should we shift gears?

691
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:53,840
You want to talk about what would happen, what would the world look like if that hadn't

692
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,000
come along?

693
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,280
I think we would have been stuck in dependency hell.

694
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:05,040
What Docker truly solved was reliable shipping of software from how you designed it to how

695
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,120
you sold it to production.

696
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,460
Like we think about it in a different context than the way the market thinks about it.

697
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:17,620
The market thinks about it in I've created a product, I've promised the product as XYZ,

698
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,600
and I've created documentation on how to make it do XYZ, and I've sold it for tens of thousands

699
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,900
of dollars, and now I give it to client A. And they expect it to do exactly what the

700
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,280
box said it would do.

701
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,480
And you don't always get that until you can exactly reproduce the environment.

702
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:40,280
And that's what VMs allow for, but at a much higher overhead and not nearly as distributable.

703
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,800
Containers came along and solved Linux's packaging problem on the server in a big way.

704
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,320
The reality of it is, right, they made software more immutable, more portable.

705
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,360
Yeah, I mean, it's a nicely defined boundary that you have where you've got an inside and

706
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,520
an outside and communicate only through certain channels.

707
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,120
So if for the purposes of this discussion, we assume that particular problem hadn't been

708
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,360
solved, it would have meant shipping software on Linux would have been much more complicated.

709
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:12,760
I think it would have meant we would have had to consolidate more, even more so around

710
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,960
one or two leading distros.

711
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Right.

712
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,080
I mean, because if you think about things in the decade before, you know, you had virtualization,

713
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,640
but I think there was still a large era of, you know, sys admins sort of caring for their

714
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
pet servers.

715
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,520
And it worked well at the scales at the time, but clearly there were issues where that just

716
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,720
wasn't going to meet the new demand for all the services that were trying to be created.

717
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,920
Look at how many businesses can scale up because they're doing things in containers instead

718
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,660
of VMs or physical hardware, like I think of DigitalOcean and your GoDaddy's out there

719
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,320
that can sell 599 WordPress a month.

720
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,920
But yeah, back in the day you had cPanels, didn't you, that you had to log into and all

721
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,800
that kind of nonsense, which is just gone now.

722
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Right.

723
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,320
And that was all hocus pocus behind the scenes with Apache virtual hosts and whatnot.

724
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,480
I mean, that was, yeah.

725
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,840
I think what we did have is you'd have an even more consolidated Linux ecosystem.

726
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,100
You'd have maybe Red Hat and Ubuntu.

727
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,720
You wouldn't really have, you wouldn't hear much from any of the other distros in terms

728
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,320
of any kind of like software distribution.

729
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,640
It would really have limited the game.

730
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,560
Today we're able to run CrazyArch on a server and run the exact same software we ran when

731
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,960
it was Fedora because of containers.

732
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,800
And it just, the OS became an implementation detail up to the admin and sort of abstracted

733
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,040
away from the actual function of the application.

734
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,460
We wouldn't have that.

735
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,360
That would be gone in this scenario.

736
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,320
Your applications would still be very closely married to the operating system.

737
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,760
They might be in a VM, but they're still very closely managed.

738
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,080
The dependencies are spread out across the file system.

739
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Right.

740
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
You're shipping whole systems.

741
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
Yeah.

742
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,840
And the thing is now, you know, with a container that's properly packaged, you are leveraging

743
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:55,280
the expertise of people that know how to deploy applications properly.

744
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,680
It could be the developers of the application themselves, or it could be some third party

745
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,480
like Linux server or whatever.

746
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,560
Hopefully, hopefully they know what they're doing.

747
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,240
There is the other side of that coin too.

748
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,720
The hub is full of a bunch of, a bunch of stuff that isn't so great.

749
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,960
But you know, when I was getting into Linux to start with, Docker was kind of that gateway

750
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,480
drug that let me deploy stuff that was well ahead of where my understanding was at that

751
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,480
point.

752
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Yeah.

753
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,680
I could do Docker run Plex and suddenly I didn't have to install dependencies or anything.

754
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,680
It just worked.

755
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,680
It was magic.

756
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,800
I'm also grateful for some of the other technologies that fell out of that.

757
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,600
I was just talking with Brent the other day about network namespaces and just sort of

758
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,320
all the, you know, the things that needed to get invented to make containers work.

759
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,840
That's just made, you know, using Linux for other regular admin tasks way better.

760
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Yeah.

761
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,320
There's ways that stuff gets used now that is totally transparent, but very beneficial.

762
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Okay.

763
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
All right.

764
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
So that was fun.

765
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
Mobile Linux.

766
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
Not so fun here.

767
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
Mobile Linux time, guys.

768
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
I see how you're doing this.

769
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,320
It's been a day.

770
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
Yeah.

771
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
It's been a decade for mobile Linux.

772
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,080
Shuttleworth's grand vision for Ubuntu on phones launches in October, 2011.

773
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,840
It includes TVs, smart screens, tablets, and phones.

774
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
What a world that would have been.

775
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Ubuntu Touch.

776
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,400
I still kind of would like a bunch of TV.

777
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
That sounds fine to me.

778
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Yeah.

779
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Yeah.

780
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,200
Wes and I reviewed a bunch of clips for this to, you know, we thought we'd play a couple

781
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
different ones.

782
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,880
And we found one where Matt and I on the Linux Action Show were running Ubuntu Touch on a

783
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,880
tablet.

784
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,920
And it was kind of usable.

785
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,640
So that was around October, 2013.

786
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,200
Wow.

787
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,240
BQ launches their Ubuntu edition phone in April of 2015.

788
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,440
Those were exciting times.

789
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Yeah.

790
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,880
And then the Ubuntu phone project was killed by Canonical in April of 2017.

791
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:50,600
And of course, Ubiports took over and released their first stable OTA update in June of 2017.

792
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,720
That was a hard moment.

793
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,960
The Librem 5 crowdfunder kicked off in 2017 of August.

794
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,000
Yes, it's been that long.

795
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,440
And of course, the very first early devices shipped to backers, a handful of backers in

796
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
December of 2019.

797
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,220
And then the PinePhone was announced at Fosdom 2019.

798
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,980
And the Braveheart editions went on pre-order on November 2019.

799
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:20,080
And they are estimated to begin shipping on January 8, 2020.

800
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:26,640
In there, there's Firefox OS, there's WebOS, there's a lot of different tracks to go down.

801
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,000
But this is the one that I think when a lot of us that have been watching this for a while

802
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,960
look back, these are the ones that really stand out.

803
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,340
That mobile vision that grabbed Canonical, that convergence vision that grabbed them.

804
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:46,240
They really followed that with a passion for a very long time, from 2011 to 2017, without

805
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,280
ever realizing a profit on it.

806
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,680
I think it felt something like a failure, too.

807
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,340
We talk a lot about whenever the year of the Linux desktop, etc., but it's enough of a

808
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,100
nebulous effort that I don't think we've, we can't really succeed at, but we can't really

809
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,280
fail at the same time.

810
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,520
And I think when Canonical stopped pursuing this, it was just kind of a big, it was a

811
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
big failure.

812
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
Right?

813
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
Yeah.

814
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,360
I remember being so excited when these ideas initially started coming out, and the idea

815
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:18,480
of convergence, and having this one device to kind of rule them all.

816
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,520
And then I was really upset because I couldn't get a BQ phone here in the U.S.

817
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,400
Because the GSM radios were different or something like that, or they weren't licensed with the

818
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,760
FCC or something similar, I don't remember.

819
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,760
Still stings, actually.

820
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
Now that you bring it up.

821
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
It does.

822
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
Still stings.

823
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,240
Now, I'm in the mumble room, I'd like to flip this one around now.

824
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,600
So let's go the other way.

825
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,400
What if this had been a success?

826
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,240
What if Ubuntu Touch had been a hit?

827
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,040
What would 2019 look like?

828
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,440
I'd like to hear a couple of thoughts from the mumble room, and Brent, I'll go to you

829
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,960
first to let other people warm up.

830
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,840
Can you imagine a world where there was maybe a third option, or perhaps it was iPhone and

831
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
Ubuntu Touch?

832
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:04,120
Yeah, I feel like I've been dreaming of that for this last 10 years.

833
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,240
What would be different?

834
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,760
At least for those of us who are sitting in this virtual room right now, I feel like we

835
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,060
would be taking whole advantage of these technologies.

836
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:20,360
So we wouldn't be kind of handcuffed with some of the compromises that we're making.

837
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,200
I can easily say that all of us feel like we're making some compromises.

838
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,160
You've said that with some of your choices.

839
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,840
I know, certainly, I would love to be running something that matches my ideals a little

840
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,260
bit closer.

841
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,360
It feels like a real shame that we keep getting a little bit closer, you know, one step ahead

842
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,800
and then it feels like it falls back quite a bit.

843
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:47,900
But if we were there, man, I would be so much happier with my everyday interactions on these

844
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:53,880
little devices, because then it would be Linux on all of my devices, open source on all of

845
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,200
the devices I interact with on an hourly basis, really.

846
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Absolutely.

847
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,520
And that would feel like a true sign of success that we actually are there.

848
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,460
Do you think we would be able to appreciate it, though?

849
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,520
Would we fully be able to appreciate it if it just had happened?

850
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,100
Can we only think it'd be a big deal now because it didn't happen?

851
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,080
So the contrast seems amazing.

852
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,920
Well, I think you might still have that contrast because, you know, you could look 10 years

853
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,600
back and say, Oh, remember when we didn't have this?

854
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
And now here we are.

855
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,180
I mean, we can do the exact same.

856
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:31,400
You just did the exact same thing with probably we would have a world of a lot of sort of,

857
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,600
you know, mid range phones, maybe a few flagships, and there would still be Android.

858
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Yeah, for sure.

859
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:42,400
I just the thing that came to my mind is, and who knows, who knows what directions this

860
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,520
would have gone with the carriers, who knows what the product would have turned into.

861
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,160
So this is all just speculation, obviously.

862
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:56,520
But assuming Canonical could have walked the line, we may, as a general society, have a

863
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,520
much better privacy situation had the Ubuntu phone.

864
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
Yes.

865
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,620
One, because at the end of the day, they're not an advertising company.

866
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:11,480
But Minimac, you put your money on the line, if I recall, for the Ubuntu touch phone device.

867
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,600
And you were really hoping this thing would materialize.

868
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:20,920
Could you imagine when they started to get some money for the phone, that was a premium

869
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,920
device.

870
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,680
Hardware specs were gorgeous.

871
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,600
That was a really premium device.

872
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,120
And I was really ready to give my money.

873
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:38,560
It was like the same like the Librem 5, it was about $500, $600, if I remember well.

874
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:45,240
But it was packed really as a premium phone with a guarantee that it will be a long time

875
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,640
software update and anything.

876
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:53,740
And if I remember well, they got millions, millions of dollars from the backers.

877
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:57,120
But it was not enough to get it straight.

878
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:03,600
And the thing is, afterwards, I switched to Sailfish OS and there were a lot of people

879
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,960
from Nokia in it.

880
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,480
But they knew how hard the business of mobile will be.

881
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,320
So the mobile business is one of the hardest, I think, when it comes to hardware and software

882
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,960
that we see now.

883
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,960
And they knew how hard it is and they were struggling.

884
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,800
They are still there.

885
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,680
But to get some foot in the mobile business is one of the hardest things that you can

886
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
get.

887
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,400
I think we all learned that.

888
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,000
We watched Canonical publicly learn that lesson.

889
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And it's so sad.

890
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Imagine.

891
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
If that Ubuntu phone.

892
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
There were other tries.

893
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,920
You see that Mozilla tried it and Firefox OS and everything.

894
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,160
Firefox OS lifts on with KaiOS.

895
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,160
As do some of the other projects.

896
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,840
Like WebOS is considered one of the best smart TV platforms now, which is kind of funny.

897
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,040
You have Ubuntu OS that lifts on with UbiPorts.

898
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,640
It's a geek OS.

899
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,840
But they are getting lots of things done.

900
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,960
Sailfish OS is still there and they're getting better and better.

901
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,840
So yeah, but it's hard to get a foot in the mobile business.

902
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,840
Yeah.

903
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,680
Although one of the things I mean, I think we could look at this and say, yeah, OK, it

904
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,520
was a quote unquote failure.

905
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:19,520
But what's sort of beautiful about free software is the code lives on.

906
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,720
I think Cubicle, Nate, you could probably argue wasn't necessarily a failure at all.

907
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,820
Yeah, I really don't think that that Ubuntu Touch was a failure.

908
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:29,720
Maybe from a business standpoint, it turned out to be a failure.

909
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,840
But if you look at it, most things in the open source are a slow burn anyway.

910
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,960
I mean, Linux has been a slow burn and look at plasma.

911
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,000
Just a few years ago, everyone was harping on plasma saying, oh, it's so bloated and

912
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,560
slow and blah, blah, blah.

913
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,560
Now look at it.

914
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,780
It's actually it's great.

915
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,960
It's light on resources.

916
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,920
I think what UbiPorts is developing is going to be far greater than what Canonical even

917
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
conceived of.

918
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,560
You know, we're now with a PinePhone and also you can run on Raspberry Pis.

919
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,120
So it's a whole world of, I think, better devices or potential for better devices than

920
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,160
we could imagine.

921
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,680
It's a much more open and I look at it as an incredibly, incredibly positive outlook

922
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,760
on Linux in the mobile space.

923
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
Well said.

924
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,760
Absolutely well said.

925
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,160
And I hope you're right about UbiPorts.

926
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,300
I hope we're in a future down the road where we have a couple of different hardware devices

927
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,240
and I can load different mobile operating systems like I load different distros on a

928
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,240
laptop.

929
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,240
I want a dream.

930
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,240
Wouldn't that be?

931
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,300
And let's be realistic.

932
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,720
There's only a few efforts out there that are going to get us there.

933
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,720
And that's one of them.

934
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,720
And they're doing a great job.

935
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,720
Absolutely.

936
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,720
And they're just keeping at it.

937
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,280
And they're humble still to this day, even after years of work.

938
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,280
And they're doing they're literally doing the people's work.

939
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,760
So there's a few other things on this list.

940
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,200
We'll have some additional links in the show notes.

941
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,360
There's so much area we could talk about.

942
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:49,440
Like we have a section in here for universal packaging.

943
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,740
It's funny because it's kind of solved in a big way on the server with containers, but

944
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,040
not 100 percent.

945
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,840
It's not a perfect solution for everything.

946
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,240
And then, of course, the desktop sides all over the place still.

947
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,640
But taking advantage of some of the same, you know, the benefits of open source technology

948
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,360
is invented, pioneered by large cloud companies to secure their applications we can use on

949
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
the desktop to secure ours.

950
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,360
Isn't that funny?

951
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,360
That's so great.

952
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,200
Because we have the same kernel.

953
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,960
That's something Mac users just can't really appreciate.

954
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,040
And I don't mean to be disparaging when I say that.

955
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,800
I'm just simply saying on the desktop.

956
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,640
Yeah, Cubicle Nate said it perfectly.

957
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,840
It's a slow burn.

958
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:29,640
But when we are using something that's a contained or, quote unquote, sandboxed application,

959
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:36,020
it's using technologies that have been tested at a billion dollar scale.

960
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,720
And in Mac OS, like their container stuff is like kind of bolted on.

961
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,960
If you use the app store, like it's just kind of a mess, right?

962
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,280
And it's just simply the difference between an operating system that's made for a couple

963
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,600
of desktops and laptops and an operating system that runs the world's economy.

964
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,200
And that technology trickles down to the applications you're using in your desktop.

965
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,520
And I don't know how you pitch that to people when they're asking what the difference between

966
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,120
the Linux desktop is and every other desktop on the planet.

967
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:08,440
But about a trillion dollars is our many trillions is probably the answer.

968
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:16,160
So Chrome OS came around in July of 2009, became widely available when some of the first

969
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,560
Chromebooks arrived in June of 2011.

970
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,840
We got the first pixel book thingy or no phone, I guess.

971
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
No, book.

972
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,160
I can't remember what they called the first pixel Chromebook.

973
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,160
What did they call it?

974
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,160
Chromebook Pixel?

975
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,160
Okay.

976
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,160
Whatever that was called in 2013.

977
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:35,160
Not the phone, because this is confusing, but they called the 2013 laptop.

978
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,840
Yes, that it was called the Pixel and it came out in 2013.

979
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,400
It was kind of the first higher end Chromebook.

980
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,400
Very high end.

981
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
Yeah.

982
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,440
Many apps arrived on Chrome OS in 2014 and that's when we started taking it a little

983
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,440
more seriously.

984
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,440
Yeah.

985
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,240
You and I think both kind of like raised an eyebrow at that when we started doing the

986
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,920
coverage and luck for pretty much then on, because then you got network file support

987
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,320
in September of 2018.

988
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:02,800
Linux app betas arrived in October of 2018 and May 2019, it was announced that all new

989
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,680
Chromebooks would support Linux apps.

990
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,100
And then in Q4 of 2018, Chromebooks were reported making up 21 percent of all notebooks sold

991
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,240
in the US market and that was in 2018 of Q4.

992
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,600
And if that trend continues on, it's probably ticked up a few percentages since then.

993
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:29,880
And if that wasn't an interesting story all into itself, you then have the Raspberry Pi.

994
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:35,240
What a few years it has been and it has just been getting faster and every iteration has

995
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,240
gotten better.

996
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:42,480
In early 2012, the first 10 boards were put up for auction on eBay.

997
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,680
You remember that's how this went down, right?

998
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:51,600
The 10 boards with a total real price, retail price of two hundred and twenty funny monies

999
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,560
raised around sixteen thousand dollars total when all was done in auction.

1000
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,680
That's how they started.

1001
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:03,480
And now look at them in that something initial sales commenced in February of 2012.

1002
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,680
The Pi 2 came out in February of 2015.

1003
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:12,600
The Pi 0, I can't believe it was this long ago to tell you the truth, November 2015.

1004
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,840
Feels like it was a lot sooner.

1005
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,000
It's interesting, you know, it's another space where Linux was just like the right fit, ready

1006
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
to go, adaptable.

1007
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,380
I mean, you can get Windows on your Raspberry Pi, but why do you remember those attempts

1008
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,380
early on?

1009
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,200
Yeah, it took them a long time to get it right.

1010
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,480
It was bad.

1011
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,540
Pi 3 came out in February of 2016 and then the Pi 4.

1012
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:36,220
My personal favorite, glorious June of this year, 2019.

1013
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:43,160
As we reported in Linux headlines recently, as of December of 2019, the Raspberry Pi folks

1014
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:52,920
have sold 30 million boards and just crossed the one billion dollars in revenue.

1015
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,920
That's amazing.

1016
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,920
Fantastic.

1017
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,400
Selling thirty five dollar computer boards running Linux.

1018
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:06,360
That's 30 million Linux devices that are in the hands of kids, adults, enthusiasts, makers.

1019
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,560
Deployed in whole little corners all over the world.

1020
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,920
Like the best market possible.

1021
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,920
Like when you think of like, who would you like to get Linux in front of?

1022
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,520
It's all of the things I just said.

1023
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,800
Oh, God, it's so exciting.

1024
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:22,240
It's just genuinely thrilling to see some of these successes.

1025
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,480
And how critical do you think these are?

1026
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,840
So what if the Raspberry Pi hadn't happened?

1027
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,720
I think it was one of the best things that happened to Linux.

1028
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,080
On like the consumer side in a very, very, very long time.

1029
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,080
What do you think, Cheezy?

1030
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,640
Because I know this is an area of passion for you.

1031
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,640
Yeah.

1032
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:43,160
So for me, you know, I followed this project much like Ubuntu Touch originally, and I believe

1033
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,560
the first boards were actually based on a different CPU, the Amtel CPU or something

1034
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,560
like that.

1035
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,440
I don't remember the auction bit.

1036
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,680
But you know, I think obviously with 30 million boards out there now, that's an amazing number.

1037
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:05,280
And the real heart and soul behind this is that they wanted to basically replicate the

1038
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,800
BBC Micro.

1039
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:14,080
So they wanted a computer for kids that they could learn on.

1040
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,280
And you know, not only did the board and the hardware come out, which is amazing in itself

1041
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,740
and we're using it for so much stuff now.

1042
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,880
One thing that we didn't mention on there, too, is the compute module, which, you know,

1043
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,460
Raspberry Pis are used everywhere, like you said, in industry to now, it's really a widely

1044
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,520
adopted format.

1045
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,820
But all of the additional stuff that they've created around it.

1046
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:42,400
So if you were to go to Raspberry Pi dot org slash education and the time that they've

1047
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:50,520
spent to really cultivate that, I think it's going to bring up the next group of Linux

1048
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,520
users.

1049
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,640
You know, these kids are going to have had Linux experience when they were much younger,

1050
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,360
which I really wish I had had.

1051
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,360
Yeah, for sure.

1052
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,160
Oh, how fun would that have been?

1053
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,160
Yeah.

1054
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,940
And in four decades, where would I be if I had Linux when I was a kid, right?

1055
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:12,680
So you know, I think it's a really interesting project.

1056
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,720
Obviously it spawned several other hardware manufacturers that are doing similar things

1057
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,720
now, Pi being one of them.

1058
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:25,160
I think in part it was a result of the technology coming down, pressures from the mobile industry

1059
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,480
and other embedded industries that were bringing some of these costs down.

1060
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,680
So I think if the Raspberry Pi had never happened, you'd still have the small board computer

1061
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,680
market, right?

1062
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,680
Absolutely.

1063
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,680
You'd still have devices out there.

1064
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:42,840
But would you have that critical mass, would you have that 30 million number, that 1 billion

1065
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,840
revenue number?

1066
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:48,040
All the tutorials, all the introductions, you know, the ARM ramps that makes it really

1067
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,680
easy to get started with Linux and all this foreign world.

1068
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,040
I talk about my Pi 4 servers a lot on Self Hosted and people write in all the time, like

1069
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,160
Chris, don't you know there's more powerful boards out there that cost less or cost just

1070
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,800
a little bit more and do all these things?

1071
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,080
And I try to emphasize, yes, I know that.

1072
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,880
But the Raspberry Pi is, it's more than just the hardware.

1073
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,520
It's the foundation behind it, it's the commitment to iterate, it's the community, it's the pre-baked

1074
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,720
images, it's the network effect for support.

1075
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:21,500
All of these things come together to make it almost a product, like it's a complete

1076
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,240
entire product where you have a whole ecosystem of open source things that you just write

1077
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,880
to an SD card like it was a floppy disk and you put in the computer and boot like it's

1078
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:34,960
the old days and now you have a dedicated device to do something.

1079
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,200
Yeah, and like I said, they've really reached out into education and the foundation has

1080
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,200
done a lot there.

1081
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:48,400
They do their Raspberry Pi jam and all these additional tools and programs that they have

1082
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,680
set forth to really bring, I feel, the Linux desktop into education and I think you touched

1083
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,480
on it when you said we would probably still have single board computers.

1084
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:06,920
And 20 years ago we had microcontrollers that were running industry and now we have these

1085
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,980
other microcontrollers that are consumer level that we can use.

1086
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:15,600
But now we have a single board computer that can run a full-fledged desktop.

1087
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,280
While it's not always the best experience, it's still great.

1088
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:26,760
It's a great way, I think, for the next generation to get into Linux and I'm really excited

1089
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:33,040
about this most of all because I think what we all grew up with and over the last decade

1090
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:39,120
what we've seen in Linux is going to be so much more than what we ever expected in another

1091
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:45,720
decade and it's because of the Raspberry Pi Foundation and single board computers and

1092
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,840
bringing that forth to education.

1093
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,440
I think it's going to be another real push.

1094
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,640
Long-term knock-on effects.

1095
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,640
Absolutely.

1096
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,640
Yeah, preach it.

1097
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,120
I like that.

1098
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,880
Jill, you have another pitch for the Raspberry Pi.

1099
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,880
Yes.

1100
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:07,800
To me, I've always considered the Raspberry Pi as the Heath kit for the modern age.

1101
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,240
Okay, explain the Heath kit to me.

1102
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,240
Yeah.

1103
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:20,880
So back in the 50s, actually when it became very popular, the Heath kit was a radio that

1104
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,320
you could build with tubes, vacuum tubes.

1105
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:32,000
I had learned how to build one as a kid with my grandmother and grandfather who were both

1106
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
into radio.

1107
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,480
It just seems like the Raspberry Pi is that tool.

1108
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:45,760
The Heath kits became wildly popular in the 60s and 70s and up through the 80s.

1109
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,600
To me, the Raspberry Pi is the continuation of that development.

1110
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,120
That's a great way to put it in that term.

1111
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,640
That's exactly how I think of it with my kids.

1112
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,800
I've done a couple of projects with them now and one of them was, I can't remember, I think

1113
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,800
it was a Kano kit.

1114
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,040
It was a whole kit where we assembled a little computer using the Raspberry Pi.

1115
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,040
Oh, cool.

1116
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,320
Yes, it is particularly great.

1117
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:10,360
And Minimac, you make a great point that it's not just the educational aspect, but the software

1118
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:15,520
that runs on these has also enabled a whole other kind of, I would say, increasing quality

1119
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,260
of life.

1120
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,360
Increasing quality of life.

1121
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,360
That's a good point.

1122
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,360
Isn't it?

1123
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:24,960
In fact, a lot of people started buying Raspberry Pis to have some multimedia center.

1124
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,200
Yeah, some Kodi.

1125
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:33,840
So software like Kodi Plex started with that and have developed in a way that it's just

1126
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,840
great.

1127
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
Yeah.

1128
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:41,520
Imagine you have all these open source add-ons that you can use now in these media centers

1129
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,800
and imagine all these things were closed source and you wouldn't have this possibility.

1130
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,280
So there is a lot of development in that regard.

1131
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,280
Oh, gosh.

1132
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,760
I can remember having like an x86 with Windows Media Center on it or something.

1133
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,760
Oh, dark days.

1134
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,760
Oh, dark days.

1135
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,080
I tried so many things.

1136
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:03,160
I tried, I had boxy boxes, I had popcorn hours, which I thought were pretty good.

1137
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:09,000
I had Windows Media Extenders that were built by Logitech or Linksys or something.

1138
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,240
And I didn't, even back then, I wasn't a Windows user necessarily, but I was willing to use

1139
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,440
Media Center if it meant I could watch and pause stuff around my house.

1140
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,760
Let's not forget, XBMC is named after Xbox, right?

1141
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,920
Which I ran on hacked Xboxes back in the day.

1142
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,760
I actually ran XBMC.

1143
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,920
Until they closed down it for the patch.

1144
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:29,920
Yes.

1145
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,320
Well, that's why you don't get those Xboxes.

1146
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,200
You buy them on eBay without the patch.

1147
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:40,320
Yeah, you make a great point because the Media Center software that we have today genuinely

1148
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,440
does improve my quality of life because I have a limited amount of time where I can

1149
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,480
just sit down and hang out with the old wife skis on the couch and watch something.

1150
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,600
And if I'm sitting there fiddling with, that's why when you blokes out there tell me, oh,

1151
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:57,360
yeah, I just have my laptop hooked up to the TV and I just use VLC on the second monitor.

1152
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,360
It's no bigs.

1153
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:04,040
I'm like, bro, that's like a solid five minutes of setup that I don't want to spend that.

1154
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,960
I get my dinner and I like to watch me something while I eat.

1155
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:08,960
I don't know about you.

1156
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,960
Do you do this?

1157
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,960
That's nice.

1158
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,960
Yeah.

1159
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,960
I like to watch something every time I can.

1160
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,960
Breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

1161
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,280
I like to watch something while I eat.

1162
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,540
By the way, subreddit MealtimeVideos, it's a real thing.

1163
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:21,120
And so I like to just get right into it.

1164
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,920
I don't want to be munching around with anything.

1165
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:29,760
And so the fact that Kodi is just right there, or in my case, Plex and Kodi together, kumbaya,

1166
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,200
it's so reliable, it's so solid, it's so fast, and it's so well done that it makes everyone

1167
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:40,280
in my family comfortable using it, which means it's a solution that sticks.

1168
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,640
And that it's not just crazy dad likes to have his tech collection.

1169
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,720
It's actually something the entire family can use.

1170
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,720
Right.

1171
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,720
It's easy enough.

1172
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,320
It's worth the extra time that we're learning it.

1173
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,160
When we do get an opportunity to sit down and like watch a holiday movie or something

1174
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,480
like that.

1175
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:00,180
One of the most embarrassing like dad moments in my life has been when you hit the old play

1176
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,400
button and it doesn't work.

1177
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,520
And I haven't had that hand on wood table right here.

1178
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,980
I haven't had that in years thanks to the quality of media center software available

1179
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:11,980
on Linux now.

1180
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:19,680
You see, I have an IPTV service that I pay about $8 a month, and the implementation

1181
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,600
on Kodi is almost better than the software you get from the company.

1182
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,600
No, almost about it.

1183
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
It's really amazing.

1184
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,600
Yeah, it is.

1185
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,600
So you're right.

1186
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,440
If we didn't have that, I think we'd all be, you'd have to just have whatever the proprietary

1187
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,960
streaming service has available.

1188
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,000
And I do worry where this is going.

1189
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:46,840
I worry about when streaming is mainstream and I've got my Netflix box, right, and there's

1190
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:53,240
motivation perhaps to go after your jellyfins, your MBs and your plexes and Kodi's.

1191
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:57,320
There's maybe a little more motivation to shut down things that enable your own personal

1192
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,320
streaming.

1193
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:03,560
When the world's mentality shifts to streaming, and this could be a few years out, I just

1194
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,680
wonder if maybe there's going to be some doors that get knocked on.

1195
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:11,560
And if that isn't why you see Plex pushing their ad-supported streaming service now inside

1196
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:16,600
the Plex software, because simply put, if you look like you're enabling piracy, they're

1197
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,600
going to come for you.

1198
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,680
I mean, we're talking about Disney now.

1199
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,160
We're talking about Apple.

1200
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:26,360
We're talking about all of these major corporations that are in the media game now getting into

1201
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,360
streaming.

1202
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,780
And if they discover their software that makes it super easy to pirate their stuff, so this

1203
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:34,160
reality could happen.

1204
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,820
So I think it is really good that we have such well-developed, sophisticated, open-source,

1205
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:43,080
free software projects that if they want to play whack-a-mole.

1206
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,080
Yeah, that's it.

1207
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,080
Once it's open source.

1208
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,080
I mean, good luck.

1209
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,080
You can take that one.

1210
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,940
And if it hadn't gotten to this point, to Minimech's point, if it hadn't gotten to this

1211
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,560
point where it is now, and we were in this streaming revolution, we could really be screwed.

1212
01:01:54,560 --> 01:02:02,600
Well, and I think if you flip that, too, when you talk about going after the piracy aspect

1213
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:07,320
of some of these media players, or these streaming services, these streaming services wouldn't

1214
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,120
exist without Linux.

1215
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,320
Yeah, right?

1216
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,320
No kidding.

1217
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,280
How much of all of this is running on Linux boxes, and they're pulling all these files

1218
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,440
off of Linux file servers, and all the applications doing are running in VMs and containers.

1219
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,840
It's encoding the files in Linux.

1220
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,360
Yeah, that is very true.

1221
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,600
And we can watch them on Linux, which is nice.

1222
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:29,960
Yeah, actually, Disney Plus ratcheted their DRM one down, and so now...

1223
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,800
And think about all the hoops we used to go through just for Netflix.

1224
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,800
Oh, yeah.

1225
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,800
Speaking of Disney Plus, one of the authors of the Cloud Native Infrastructure book actually

1226
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,840
works on the Disney Plus infrastructure.

1227
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,840
I saw that.

1228
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,840
Yeah.

1229
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,120
The guy is really brilliant.

1230
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,840
Yeah, at Rothgar on Twitter, if you want to follow him.

1231
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,480
It turns out Disney didn't just slap together some streaming service.

1232
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:55,120
They really built something special, including their own custom accelerated optimized encoders

1233
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,500
and decoders and all kinds of stuff.

1234
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,560
They really went all out.

1235
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,560
That's what...

1236
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,240
I mean, who knows where the next 10 years are going?

1237
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,920
However, in all the categories we typically talk about, I feel like Linux is sitting pretty

1238
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:07,920
good.

1239
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,500
It's positioned pretty good in all of these.

1240
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,500
Even the desktop.

1241
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,160
We're looking pretty good.

1242
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:17,520
The slow burn effect, that slow burn, we're in that phase now where things are getting

1243
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,520
pretty good.

1244
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,280
And if that burn continues, by the time we get to the end of it, we're...

1245
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,000
I mean, geez, I'm happy.

1246
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,360
I'm already happy.

1247
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,360
So I'm really...

1248
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,920
I think the next decade is going to be really great.

1249
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,200
I don't think Linux is going anywhere other than up and up and up.

1250
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,200
What do you think?

1251
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,200
I agree.

1252
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,840
Well, Wes Payne, we have some very important feedback to cover before we leave.

1253
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:43,760
Stuff that really covers an issue that's been going on for a decade itself, really plagues

1254
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,160
the open source community.

1255
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,960
And honestly, I'm not sure if there's anything that can be done.

1256
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:48,960
It's a travesty.

1257
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,960
So let's go ahead and address it here on the program.

1258
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:50,960
Yeah.

1259
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,820
I mean, we've tried to fix it.

1260
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:56,520
Some severe regimens of torture and the like.

1261
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:01,360
Chris, I'm curious, what sort of drive do you have in that really nice computer upstairs

1262
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,360
again?

1263
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,360
My boot drive?

1264
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,360
It's an NVME drive.

1265
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,360
It's a, yeah.

1266
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,360
It's an NV...

1267
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,360
So we've got some excellent...

1268
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,360
NV drive.

1269
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,920
Excellent feedback that might just help here from our friend, Colonel Panic.

1270
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:19,160
Chris, please, it's NVME, not M-V-N-E.

1271
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,160
Every single time.

1272
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,160
I know.

1273
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,160
I know.

1274
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:26,120
And actually, just to really mess with him, last episode, I said it right once.

1275
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,120
Yeah, you did.

1276
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,120
You caught that?

1277
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,120
That's hilarious.

1278
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,640
Well, I could see you were clearly focusing intensely.

1279
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,640
Yeah, you could see it in my face.

1280
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,640
Yeah.

1281
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,640
Okay, Colonel Panic does have a tip for you.

1282
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,640
It's NVME.

1283
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,640
Yeah.

1284
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,880
Like NV My Fast Storage.

1285
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,880
That's funny.

1286
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,840
He also says, thanks for the coverage on Nebula.

1287
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:50,320
It seems like a fantastic product, which Nebula is that peer to peer VPN solution.

1288
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,040
Don't call it a VPN.

1289
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,040
Overlay network.

1290
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,320
Overlay network that Slack just released as open source that we talked about recently.

1291
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:01,120
If you haven't caught some of our recent episodes, do go catch up on the Unplugged catalog.

1292
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,680
But do not fear, even though we're not live over the holiday, we still have episodes planned

1293
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,520
over the next couple of weeks, including our predictions, our results, and more.

1294
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:17,400
So do go to linuxunplugged.com slash 333 for show notes and links to some of the things

1295
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,280
we talked about, including some of those stories with some quotes that are a little cringe-worthy

1296
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,760
these days.

1297
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,920
And I should also mention, oh yeah, we got holiday music.

1298
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,920
Whoa!

1299
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:29,920
I was like, where is that?

1300
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,280
What was that, Wes?

1301
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,080
I should also mention the all shows feed.

1302
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,080
Gotta give this a plug.

1303
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,480
Now is a great time to get subscribed to that.

1304
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,880
There's good stuff in there because that's where the extras land.

1305
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,440
That's where Choose Linux lands, or TechSnap, or UserAir, or all the other shows.

1306
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,200
Probably other ones like Linux Action News, probably.

1307
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:50,040
If you just want more Jupiter Broadcasting content, the one link.

1308
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,680
That's over at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

1309
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,560
Now when we are live again, great question.

1310
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,560
You are on the ball today.

1311
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,560
Look at our audience.

1312
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,560
Sometime next decade, right?

1313
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,560
Yeah.

1314
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,560
Wow.

1315
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:00,760
JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1316
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:01,760
Have a great holiday.

1317
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,760
Thank you for joining us, and we'll see you soon.

1318
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:22,760
Happy holidays!

1319
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:42,840
Two things that I'm glad that I don't have to deal with in Linux anymore.

1320
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,760
One is XF86 config and potentially blowing up your monitor.

1321
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,760
Yeah.

1322
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:48,760
Oh my gosh.

1323
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,760
I couldn't agree with that.

1324
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:56,080
And the other is FW cutter or the NDIS wrapper to get wireless working.

1325
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,440
Oh gosh, cheesy.

1326
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,120
Those are two really good ones.

1327
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:06,800
I also remember the era before CUPS printing and after CUPS printing.

1328
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,360
Printing is so much simpler now in Linux than it used to be.

1329
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,440
In fact, I think it's simpler on Linux than it is Windows.

1330
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,440
I completely agree.

1331
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:18,400
I have a bit of a controversial one, and for me it's System D.

1332
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,480
I like System D. You're not going to get any hate from me.

1333
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,040
Yeah, well before System D, you had to muck around with upstart scripts and all sorts

1334
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:31,080
of non-standard stuff between each distro, and now I can switch from Arch to Ubuntu to

1335
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:35,800
Red Hat to whatever, and it's all System D, and it's the same, and I just like that.

1336
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,520
I'm liking Linux Wayback Machine as a title, that's pretty good.

1337
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,520
That's fun.

1338
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,520
That's pretty good.

1339
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:45,800
When it comes to printers, we have that interesting fact that CUPS is now maintained by Apple,

1340
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,400
and that's changed a lot, I think.

1341
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:52,200
And it's been like that for a really long time now, and they haven't screwed it up apparently.

1342
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,200
Because they need it.

1343
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:59,560
Well, the fact is now I can just plug in a printer in any Linux distribution and the

1344
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:05,760
driver is just loaded, and it's just working, besides some HB printers that have scanners

1345
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,320
within, but nowadays, plug in a printer and it works.

1346
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,080
This is something I'm really surprised by, to be honest, because it's always been such

1347
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,080
a pain in the butt.

1348
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:18,600
I'm curious if anybody else in the old virtual lug there has a glad that they don't have

1349
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,240
to fight with us on Linux anymore story, because these are fun.

1350
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,720
I know you got one, Jill.

1351
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,720
Yeah.

1352
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:29,480
In some modding for sound card drivers, to get sound card drivers working.

1353
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,840
That was a thing.

1354
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,840
Oh, my gosh.

1355
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,080
Sound on Linux.

1356
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,100
And remember this one.

1357
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:42,520
Only one application could use the sound card at a time, back in the old also days.

1358
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,520
Yes.

1359
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,520
Awesome.

1360
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,520
Also, yes.

1361
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,520
You got to choose carefully.

1362
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,520
Yeah.

1363
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,520
Wow.

1364
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,520
I think I've got one.

1365
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,520
Yeah.

1366
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,520
What is that?

1367
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:56,760
I think one of the very first Linux experiences just getting squashed with dependency hell.

1368
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:02,000
And I don't really deal with that anymore, but just kind of all gets handled in the background.

1369
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,120
I did get on my universal packaging soapbox for a brief moment there.

1370
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:09,880
But in the back of my mind, I was thinking that it is so much easier to get software

1371
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,880
now.

1372
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:16,640
It really, if you take the time, if you take a day to educate yourself, problem solved.

1373
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,260
It's really all it takes.

1374
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,840
And is that a big ask?

1375
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,840
Yes.

1376
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,840
Is it an impossible ask?

1377
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,840
Nah.

1378
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:26,520
I mean, like half the time we have picks, I can end up during the episode cloning them

1379
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:30,280
down and I'm able to get them working, almost regardless of what language they are from

1380
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,600
a makefile or a Docker container or whatever.

1381
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,600
Yeah.

1382
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,600
You just boot into Kexec for those things, do you?

1383
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,600
I was going to make a Kexec one.

1384
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,040
Well, to keep it clean, you know.

1385
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,920
All right, Drift, I'd love to hear yours.

1386
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:44,160
So the one that I'm grateful for is stable updates.

1387
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,160
Much better than they were.

1388
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,160
Yeah.

1389
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,160
Oh, man.

1390
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:51,120
Yeah, we recently had a coworker that was having some weird grub air messages after

1391
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:55,000
an update, and it just totally took me back to a time where you had like these impossible

1392
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,840
questions that were asked by your package manager.

1393
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,240
Would you like to destroy your config or completely overwrite your config?

1394
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,240
What?

1395
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,240
Neither.

1396
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,240
Yes.

1397
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,600
What about you, Cubicle Nate?

1398
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,800
I don't have to worry about win modems anymore.

1399
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,800
Oh, good one.

1400
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,800
That's a good one.

1401
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,800
Yeah.

1402
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,280
Win modems were the worst.

1403
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,880
Oh, man.

1404
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:19,160
It took me like days of just tooling away and back on Mandrake Linux.

1405
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:24,120
And when I got it, when I finally got it, man, I was jumping up from office chair to

1406
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,120
office chair.

1407
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,120
I mean, I was so happy.

1408
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,880
Man, Cubicle Nate, I kid you not.

1409
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:35,160
I think win modems was the hardware that taught me it's worth paying a little more if it has

1410
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,880
Linux compatibility.

1411
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,960
And to this day, I just a few days ago, I ordered myself a steering wheel to play video

1412
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:46,920
games on Linux, and the first question I have is, which of these is actually compatible

1413
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,920
with Linux?

1414
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:48,920
That's where I start.

1415
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:52,680
And that was drilled into me because of win modems.

1416
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:57,920
I was going to say, I think my first incompatible purchase of hardware was a win modem.

1417
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,280
And then whenever I got it home and realized I had purchased the wrong piece of hardware,

1418
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:05,040
I was so incredibly upset.

1419
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:10,960
My first machine I really used was actually a laptop that put Linux on in 2003, late 2003.

1420
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:16,640
And getting all the different little pieces of it working, specifically the win modem,

1421
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,360
was just such an exercise in frustration.

1422
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:24,040
Rockwell, I'm curious, roughly how long have you been running desktop Linux?

1423
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,360
Probably the early 2000s.

1424
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,360
So it's not...

1425
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,960
That's a pretty long time.

1426
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:28,960
It is.

1427
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,600
Do you have a recollection of something you used to struggle with that no longer is an

1428
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,600
issue?

1429
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,960
Well, to be honest with you, I don't even have to go back that far to think about it.

1430
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,280
I mean, you think about the installers themselves, how far they've come, but just think about

1431
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:47,560
things like no mode set and having to edit the grub menu just to get into a Linux system

1432
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,800
where you don't have to do that anymore.

1433
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,440
I never thought I'd have a flicker-free desktop, honestly.

1434
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:53,440
Right.

1435
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,700
And remember, I kind of vaguely remember the time before the Intel graphics were just always

1436
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,400
baked into the kernel.

1437
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:03,440
There was a time where you didn't necessarily have a guaranteed video mode that was going

1438
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,440
to work.

1439
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,520
You did have to just essentially go say, all right, very basic graphic.

1440
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,920
Let's just get this thing off the ground and then fix it after you got it loaded.

1441
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,600
Yeah, that wasn't that long ago.

1442
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,480
No, and NVIDIA drivers have come a long way since then, so...

1443
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:20,000
I mean, even Fedora now makes it easy to install, right?

1444
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Or God forbid, the old Lilo.

1445
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Lilo.

1446
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Aw.

1447
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Aw, I miss Lilo.

1448
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I actually still use it.

1449
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Do you really?

1450
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I love Lilo.

1451
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I really do.

1452
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Yeah.

1453
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,560
Yes, me too.
