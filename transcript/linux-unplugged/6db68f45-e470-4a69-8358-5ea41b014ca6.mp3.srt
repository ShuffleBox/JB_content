1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
Samsung's quarterly earnings are out and their sales are falling flat. The S5 is not selling

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,640
very well, profits are down, shipments are down, like big too, like pretty big, like

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,640
pretty big drops. What do you think, Popey? Why is Samsung's sales falling through the

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,960
floor on their Samsung lines of phones?

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,000
Could it be that people now have, that we've reached a saturation point of smartphones

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,880
and there's nothing revolutionary in smartphones that they're making. All they're doing is

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,000
making them in different sizes.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,240
But look at the activation counts. The activation counts are still going up for every month.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,800
There's more Android activations than before.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:51,600
But people don't necessarily want gigantic, very expensive phones. They want a smartphone.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,680
And Samsung, do they have a range of low-end Android phones?

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,480
They also have the same phone coming out every single year now, it seems like.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,400
Yeah, yeah, that's true. People got a little bored maybe. And plus TouchWiz has gotten

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,600
a bad rap.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,480
And people still use their S4 and S3. They're still on contract too.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,720
I think it's cheaper Android phones. I think that's what it is. I think part of the problem

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,120
is the same problem that Windows PC manufacturers have had.

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,680
Cheaper on lock phones.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,660
Like if it's all kind of the same thing, then why don't I just buy the cheapest one? Especially

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,880
if I'm not savvy enough to know the difference between them.

21
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,560
Speaking of phones, did y'all hear about the signage in GitHub getting pulled down?

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,120
Yeah, what happened there?

23
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,560
It was something about the Broadcom drivers, wasn't it?

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,880
No, it was Qualcomm, wasn't it?

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,960
Yeah, Qualcomm. That's what it was. There you go. And Qualcomm released a statement

26
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,120
about that too, but I haven't read it yet.

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,120
They backed down and apologized.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,400
Well, it was like a huge pull-down too, right? Like it was a massive DMCA takedown they

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,080
did. So yeah, I'm looking at it right now in Ferronix. Qualcomm has reversed this takedown

30
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:07,120
notice and allowed the 100 plus Git repositories to reappear. Qualcomm came under pressure

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,200
and likely looked at the reported files to realize they weren't all that confidential.

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,940
In fact, they probably didn't have anything to do with them. Just all bits being like

33
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,840
Android kernel source files and things from Cyanogenmod.

34
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,600
It was weird too because the files that they wanted to pull down are open sourced ones,

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
wasn't it?

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Yeah.

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,880
Yeah, they all had the Linux Foundation comments up at the top.

38
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,160
Yeah. Yeah. That's the bogus thing about it. So did you also hear that now SoundCloud is

39
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,320
allowing EMC to do a content ID on SoundCloud files and issue essentially like the same

40
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,040
YouTube notice system on SoundCloud now?

41
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,920
Yeah. And if you protest it, you get told you're outlaw. And if you've got a pro account,

42
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
tough.

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,160
You've got GitHub that has to do DMCA takedowns for code. You've got YouTube and SoundCloud

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,120
that have to do takedowns for copyright. This is sucking.

45
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,120
SoundCloud has like mostly other people's audio on it. So it's kind of hard to not have,

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
you know.

47
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,680
Well, I mean, yeah.

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,320
It consists pretty much like almost the entire thing.

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,800
You could also see that if there's some d-bag who uploads like an entire CD to his SoundCloud

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,000
account or something like that. I mean, you could see there's a point there.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,280
Yeah, but you know, people also do remixing and stuff like that too.

52
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,960
Yeah. And I guess we're kind of more familiar with it in the content sense, but this to

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,440
me really seemed like here's a real world like GitHub code now is the same things happening

54
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:41,040
where it's probably the same way it works with content ID is there is some third party

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,920
that Qualcomm contracts with to go out and find violations of their intellectual property

56
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,400
online, right? And then they issue out, they do the whole thing. They probably have legal

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,360
representation status. They issue the letter on behalf of Qualcomm. And it's like there's

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,920
a whole industry around this now. And now it applies to code too, I guess.

59
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,920
An open source by itself.

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Yeah. Yeah. It's probably an open source Python script doing the scanning. Damn it. Yeah.

61
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,800
Dang it. And they're doing it from the Chromebooks. Okay. Okay. Now we're going to talk about

62
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,760
the KD thing in the show.

63
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,520
I'm saying nothing.

64
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,300
Can somebody... Okay, here's the thing. I struggle with how to even phrase and talk

65
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,360
about these things. Like here's why. Here, let me read this. Let me just pick out. Here's

66
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:47,640
the opening paragraph to the announcement. So here's the headline on KDE.org. KDE-KDEShips

67
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:56,760
Release Candidate of Plasma 5. The next paragraph says, KDE has today made available the candidate

68
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,680
for the first release of Plasma 5, the next generation desktop. This is one last chance

69
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,560
to test for bugs and check for problems for the final release next week. Okay. So here's

70
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,800
where I get a little confused. KDE has today made available the candidate for the first

71
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:23,440
release of Plasma 5, the next generation desktop. See what the problem is, is KDE is the group

72
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:35,600
and the community. Plasma 5 is the desktop. So, but then there is also something else

73
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,600
that's KDE. There's like, I don't know. I'm very, I'm kind of confused on like, there's

74
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
a couple...

75
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
There's a Frameworks and then there's a Plasma Therapies.

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Right, right. So the Frameworks are Q... No, they're K... What are they called?

77
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
KF5 Frameworks, I think. KDE5.

78
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Yeah, yeah. Right. Okay. So there's KDE5 Frameworks, then there's Plasma 5, and then there's KDE.

79
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Okay. So KDE is the group. Right, right. Which is KDE5 basically though, right?

80
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Yeah.

81
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,000
Right. Okay. So you have KDE the community, you have KDE5, the next set of like underlying

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
stuff, and then you have KDE Plasma desktop, or is it just Plasma? What's it called? Just

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Plasma 5?

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Plasma desktop.

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Just Plasma.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,840
Okay. Just Plasma. No KDE. It's very confusing for me for some reason. It should not be so

88
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,840
confusing.

89
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,880
Cygo pasted a picture earlier today about it. I think it was Cygo, where it's like equating

90
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,400
KDE to Microsoft, Plasma to Windows, and 5 to Windows 7.

91
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Well, it's interesting that he did that, because my first thought was this feels a lot like

92
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,520
how Microsoft names products, and this feels a lot like the same kind of confusion that

93
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,020
I get when sometimes I'm trying to understand a Microsoft product line. And I also feel

94
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,480
like that same confusion and how Microsoft titles their products also translates into

95
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,840
their products. And interestingly enough, I feel that same way about KDE. So it's interesting

96
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,620
that Aaron made that same comparison, because in my mind, when I was trying to sort this

97
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,080
out earlier, the first thing that came to mind is, man, I feel like I'm reading something

98
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,040
from Microsoft right now.

99
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:16,600
Isn't that strange that KDE, one of the desktops that is kind of heralded for being Windows-like,

100
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,080
is kind of confusing you like Windows does?

101
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Oh, man.

102
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,720
Check that link in the chat, Chris. It's got an Inga link, which makes it all perfectly

103
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
clear.

104
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,240
Yeah, you should be able to get all that installed in Arch right now, but I tried to, but I could

105
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,200
not for the life of me get it to work.

106
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,120
Yeah, I figure I'm going to wait a little bit. I've been trying out the new theme, so...

107
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,480
Because you've got to use the KDE unstable repo and everything to do it all.

108
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,440
Yeah, right now I've just been getting the next theme on top of KDE 4, the latest, and

109
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,520
that seems to be the safer bet. But I'm a little curious to try out the new hotness.

110
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,640
I really am. Something about it, man. I'm a fresh-coated hound. It's like, I don't know

111
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,840
it's like a pie in the window. And I just start, I'm walking down the street, pretty

112
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,320
soon the next thing you know I'm stealing pies out of old ladies' windows, also known

113
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
as unstable repos.

114
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Okay, let me take a look at this. Imgur, Imgur, Imgur, Imgur.

115
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Now, only if they could fix Phonon. That would be awesome.

116
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:23,680
Hey, there's Josh. Hey, Josh. Josh, join us in the mumble room if you want. Bang mumble

117
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,800
to get the server info. Okay, all right, so here you go. Here is the errands I go. KDE

118
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,720
is not your desktop. All right, so KDE is the organization, Plasma Desktop is the product,

119
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:42,240
and then 5 is the version. Makes sense, right? Very simple.

120
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,680
And you got Qt on top of that. So Qt 5 now too.

121
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:53,320
Now, is it irrational? Okay, so I'm just going to say like, you know, hey maybe if

122
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:03,000
this requires an infographic, maybe it's too complicated. Is that just me being dense?

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,840
Because I understand sometimes like I think I have like a bit of a disability or something

124
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,160
and this stuff doesn't click for me. So I know I'm just maybe seeing this the wrong

125
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
way.

126
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,720
No, I feel the same way. I mean, I looked at this and I was like, oh, oh, okay, and

127
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,880
then there's a piss take at the bottom. Now, go boot your Microsoft, start Mozilla, and

128
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,040
buy Adobe. You're some kind of idiot if you don't understand that KDE is the organization

129
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,680
and Plasma is the product. What kind of fool are you? I'm like, oh, all right then.

130
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:43,120
I guess. Okay, so back in the good old days, was it just straight up called KDE? And is

131
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,920
that where the confusion come from? Is that back in the day it was just KDE?

132
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,600
Yeah, because before there was a Plasma shell. That was it come about till KDE 4.

133
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,960
So didn't they change the game rules on us? And they're like, hey, why don't you guys

134
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
know the rules?

135
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Yeah, they're complicating the shit out of this.

136
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,720
Before it was just KDE 2 or KDE 3, whatever, and it was Plasma at the KDE core.

137
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,080
That's all right. I mean, they could be worse. They could be pulling a fedora and like changing

138
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,600
their name and then changing their name back and then changing their name back to it, but

139
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
not meaning the same thing.

140
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Wasn't there also the whole KDE software collection and malarkey? That confused me as well.

141
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:28,600
I think that's still a thing. I know, I think that's a thing still.

142
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,680
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that says forget legalizing cannabis.

143
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,200
Pizza vending machines powered by Linux are the real crop of our future. My name is Chris

144
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,060
and Matt will be joining us a little bit. They're working out his audio right now. And

145
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,920
it's not only a hot day here in Washington. Let me tell you what, it is a special day,

146
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,640
a magical day, if you will, magical brownie day, sans magical brownies. They've legalized

147
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,700
cannabis here. And then you think that's what I would be excited about, but no, I have discovered

148
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,640
something called pizza vending machines. Go Google it. It's a real thing.

149
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,960
Now they don't run Linux yet. So I think what we need to do is start a community effort.

150
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,040
Maybe we could crowdsource a platform for vending machines. It's going to need a resizable

151
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,160
UI. So we'll have to talk about maybe what we're going to use there. Something for different

152
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,600
pizza vending machine form factors is what I'm saying. Different architectures. Put all

153
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,400
that in there. We'll get it out into the public. Then we'll send the proceeds to the different

154
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,920
open source projects that needs funding. Huh? Chris just laid it out for you. You guys can

155
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,480
take and run with it. I'm an idea guy. I'm putting that out there to the universe.

156
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,800
Well coming up on the show today, we've got a few follow up items news and email wise

157
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,240
that I want to talk to you guys about, including some epic funding, some Civ 5 solutions, a

158
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:47,240
little KDE and Plasma 5 talk, and then we're going to do a community review of KAOS. K-A-O-S.

159
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,220
A Lean KDE Distribution. We have a team now of folks that went through and kicked the

160
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,520
tires on this thing. I've got it running in a VM. We'll talk about it there. We'll talk

161
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:04,020
about it with them. See how it goes. And joining me as always is a fully stacked house. A great

162
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,200
lineup of mumble folks that are going to kick around the topics with us, including Joss

163
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,560
who has joined us before on the Linux Action Show, although I believe he was working with

164
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,680
Sousa at the time of Novell. Joss, refresh my memory. Last time we had you on the show,

165
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:29,000
were you working with OwnCloud yet? I'm pretty sure I wasn't yet because I only joined OwnCloud

166
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,640
April 1st of this year and I think it's been a while since I've been on the show. Well,

167
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,760
I'm really glad you could be here today because a couple of things we're going to talk about

168
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,360
are in your wheelhouse, so I'll be deferring to your expertise as we get to that kind of

169
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,480
stuff and we'll get a little update from you and see what you've been up to in a bit too,

170
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,000
okay? I'd be happy to help. All right, now go back to the World Cup. All right, so we'll

171
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,720
get to our emails first. Ben S. wrote in. He says, hey Chris and Matt. He said, hey

172
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,760
Ben. I love the show. I recently started a command line challenge of sorts. I wanted

173
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,480
to see if I could live in the command line with no graphical desktop of any kind. I started

174
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,920
about two days ago and it's going really well. I use Elinks for my web browsing, Seamless

175
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,920
for my music listening, and Vim for writing. The hardest part was getting my wireless set

176
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,720
up. What do you guys think? Is it possible to work in a command line with no desktop?

177
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,840
I thought about this for a minute for myself. In MumbleRoom, I'd be really curious to know

178
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,280
about you guys. I wonder, could anybody in the MumbleRoom live in the command line exclusively

179
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:35,920
for two days? Anybody? Yes. Poppy, come on. Without HTML? No. I lived in the command line

180
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,520
for two months while my Debian SID system had an X, broken X server. All right, all

181
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,840
right, heavens, all right. Holy smokes. All right, okay, we got to break this down. I

182
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,440
want to start with Poppy because I'm calling BS. Come on, Poppy. Do you know what? I bought

183
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,600
a deck, a vintage deck, VT100, specifically to do this, to have it sat on my desk and

184
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:02,560
be my main machine so I could have some of that retro smell coming from the valves inside

185
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,840
of that terminal. Well, I love the idea of a dedicated machine for it. I mean, I could

186
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,880
see that. Okay, all right, so heavens, when you were doing this for a while, did you listen

187
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:18,040
to podcasts? Did you just randomly Google stuff? How did that work? What was that like?

188
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,660
Well, I was using a command line audio player, and I was actually in my Gentoo compiling

189
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,160
days at the time as well, so my second partition was on Gentoo, and that pretty much took up

190
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,560
an entire two months of time while my Debian system was just kind of in maintenance.

191
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Wow. I don't know. I kind of fall down with Wimpy. What do you think, Wimpy? Haven't we

192
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,520
worked towards perfecting the computer interface and the graphical desktop and building in

193
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,120
all these great video cards to get past this hassle?

194
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:58,600
I think so. I mean, I was brought up on Unix systems in the late 80s and early 90s where

195
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,840
this was your only option, and we were craving for something better, and now we've got something

196
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,840
better. So on your desktop, use a desktop environment or a decent tining window manager

197
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,080
to manage all of your terminals to your connections to your remote systems. I do all of my development

198
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:21,320
over SSH in the shell. That's perfectly fine, but why would you want to do that for your

199
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,680
email and your web browsing and your podcasting and all the other stuff when there are better

200
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,960
tools available now?

201
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:33,680
Well, you say there are better tools, but MUT is a fantastic email client. I actually

202
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,320
miss when I used to use MUT before I started using Gmail. I miss those days because I was

203
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,120
so fast with MUT. I could really manage my email super fast, and I already use IRSSI

204
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,280
for my IRC client. So all I need is GNU Screen or TMUX, and I've got two windows there, one

205
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:57,600
with my email, one with my IRC. All I need is a shell in another. Who needs a GUI?

206
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,920
I like the pine.

207
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,760
I kind of... What do you think, Riley? You think it's possible, in other words, but not

208
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
practical?

209
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,040
Yes, there are several CLI tools that you could use in TTY mode, and you could use different

210
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,880
TTY sessions for each one. I could have WeChat running in one TTY. You can have NPD running

211
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,280
in another and do stuff like that, but it's just not practical to say in age. Unless you

212
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,280
are trying to rebuild an extra or something.

213
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,840
Yeah, yeah. That's kind of how I feel about it. I look at it and I think, boy, I could...

214
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,960
If I didn't need to do podcasts, if I didn't need to do media production, if I didn't need

215
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,860
to show webpages, if I didn't have to edit video, if I didn't have to play video or have

216
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:45,600
to want to play video games, maybe... I don't know. I love the idea of having a fully set

217
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:53,440
up account on my DigitalOcean droplet that's ready to go, could operate at any time and

218
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,880
is a fold command line only environment, but I wouldn't want to live there.

219
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,960
Just out of curiosity, how do I sound over Skype? Because I suspect that this is not

220
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,280
an audio problem. I think it's a mobile problem.

221
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,640
Oh, you sound good now, Matt.

222
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Much better.

223
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
You sound real good.

224
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
You sound really good.

225
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,680
Yeah. Wow, you sound really good, Matt.

226
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
Like normal.

227
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:16,560
Yeah. Well, good job. You guys fixed it. So good. Now Matt's joined us, I think. I think

228
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,200
he's gone now, but he has it fixed, so he'll be back. Anyways, I would like to know if

229
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,840
you could survive on the command line, so let us know in the thread in the subreddit

230
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,240
for this episode of Linux Unplugged. And let us know how it goes, Ben. Be sure you're sending

231
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,480
a follow-up if you ended up breaking, which I think you will.

232
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,320
All right. Colonel Linux, open mic, Colonel Linux. Open mic, Colonel Linux. Open mic.

233
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,880
All right. So I want to do a follow-up regarding my ButterFS stuff. I had failed to mention

234
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,240
during the Linux Action Show episode on ButterFS about recovering that and expanding and reclaiming

235
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,640
space and defragmenting. Samuel tweeted me and said, sorry if this story mentioned to

236
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,200
you, which it wasn't, running defraig in general or recompressing on ButterFS will duplicate

237
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,480
snapshots. So if you use ButterFS and you take snapshots, you need to be aware of that.

238
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,120
And I failed to mention that because I never really have gotten into ButterFS snapshots,

239
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,600
so it didn't really apply to me. That is a huge caveat because that could be a massive,

240
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,000
if you're trying to reclaim space and you have snap, first off, if you're trying to

241
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,160
reclaim space, maybe you should clean up your snapshots. But second thing is, that's just

242
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,040
a little gotcha that I wanted to make sure you guys knew about.

243
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,640
Hey, before we get into a couple of really great news items that just didn't make it

244
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,920
in the Linux Action Show this Sunday, really exciting stuff for a super, super important

245
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,600
open source project that we're big fans of here at the Jupyter Broadcasting Network.

246
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,240
But first, I want to thank our first sponsor and a brand new sponsor to Linux Unplugged.

247
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,760
We had them on How To Linux, and we decided to bench that for a bit so we could restructure

248
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,060
it. But it's such, our next sponsor is so great for you guys that I said, hey, come

249
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,920
over to Linux Unplugged. We'll work out the details. I want to make this offer available.

250
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,400
And Linux Academy said, yeah, you bet. So here's what I want you to do. Go over to linuxacademy.com

251
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,440
slash howto. They've got a summer of learning discount. They're going to take 33% off, so

252
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,080
you're only going to pay $50 for the quarter.

253
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,920
This is a service that's been built from the ground up by Linux enthusiasts and people

254
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,400
who are educators working together on a system that allows you to do self-paced training.

255
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,660
Go test yourself as you move along. They have seven plus Linux distributions available for

256
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,000
you to learn from. So you log in, you pick your course, you choose your Linux distribution.

257
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,200
The courseware automatically adapts to the Linux distribution you choose. So not only

258
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,040
is this awesome if you want to focus on a distro, but if you're also really familiar

259
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,020
with one particular distro and want to just sort of brush up on how the other side lives,

260
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,540
it can be extremely useful for that as well. And how cool is it that they'll adjust the

261
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,620
course material for you? As you go along, they'll have step-by-step video courses. You

262
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,040
can download those and listen to them offline. All of their material is available for you.

263
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,320
All the courseware is high quality. You can download and keep it for yourself. Test yourself.

264
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,900
See where you're at. Engage with the community. See what's worked for them. Take advantage

265
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,260
also of the AWS training courses they have. Go over to linuxacademy.com slash howto. It's

266
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,980
a limited time URL because I really said it's like, you guys, this is such a great offer.

267
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,480
We have to offer it to the Linux unplugged folks. So we just made this kind of switch

268
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,860
just the other day. So that's like an old school URL. If you want to be like a URL hipster,

269
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,060
which I'm sure you do, right? Go use it. Linuxacademy.com slash howto. You can also take a look at some

270
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,220
of their courses. They have the Linux plus exam, introduction to Linux on your desktop.

271
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,980
They also have different levels of the Linux LPIC exam. How to get a Linux job. Introduction

272
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,980
to Android development. Introduction to Python on Linux. Open stack essentials. Linux, for

273
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:45,540
example, novice to pro. Introduction to VMware ESXi. Configuring BIND 9. Configuring Ubuntu

274
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:51,780
NFS. Setting up VNC. The LAMP stack. Nagios. Learning R-Sync. Resolving the Heartbleed

275
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,740
plug. Samba 4 and Linux client and server. I just got an email about that today. All

276
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,200
of that stuff is available right now, including brand new courses for AWS. You want to become

277
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,900
a hybrid technologies expert on AWS? Boom. They've got a course for it. You want to be

278
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,300
an AWS certified developer or AWS certified SysOps administrator? Boom. They've got a

279
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,980
course for it. This is what I'm telling you. Linux Academy has got this covered. And what's

280
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,620
super cool about Linux Academy is you're going through the courseware. If you get to a point

281
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,540
in the lab where you need a server, they on the back end spin up the virtual infrastructure

282
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:30,540
required for you to do that course automatically. This is amazing when you're doing an AWS course

283
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,800
because you don't have to worry about the cost to Amazon. And one of the other things

284
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,100
that I think is truly exceptional about them is they've got this whole system all set up

285
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,380
where you can log in at any point and get a snapshot of exactly where you're at. And

286
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,640
while you're a member, you can take any other course. I don't know how they do it, but they

287
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,820
are adding content constantly. They're fleshing out the OpenStack stuff and the AWS stuff

288
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,140
like crazy right now. This has never been a better time to go over there because they're

289
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,220
giving you the discount for the entire summer. So go over to linuxacademy.com. Take your

290
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,380
skill sets up just to the next level. Make yourself maybe a little more employable. Make

Linux Unplugged.

296
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,340
I've been using the service now since they were a sponsor in Coderadio, and it's really

297
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,540
great. They also have team courses available. So if you're in a group and you guys want

298
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,100
to work together, they have a system available for that too. It's really a neat service.

299
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,100
Linuxacademy.com slash how to. For a limited time you can get the Summer of Learning discount.

300
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:44,020
Okay, so Epic Games funded some Blender development, not just funded by a little bit. This actually

301
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,660
makes Epic the second major game developer to fund Blender development period. This is

302
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,500
a huge contribution to the Blender project. They're majorly excited about it. They're

303
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,700
technically I think now the number one sponsor in terms of dollar amount to the Blender project,

304
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,980
which is awesome. And other contributors include Valve. Valve backed Blender earlier this year.

305
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:12,060
I guess specifically there's some export stuff that the Epic team wants to see Blender work

306
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,060
on.

307
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,020
I don't know if anybody in the Mumbroom knows any more about this, but I think it's pretty

308
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,260
interesting to see as some of these big game companies begin to move over to Linux and

309
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,620
look at it as a viable market, they're kind of looking at some of this infrastructure

310
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,980
project stuff that's not necessarily a video driver, it's not necessarily how the kernel

311
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,580
handles a game pad, but it's still pretty important to the gaming ecosystem and they're

312
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:39,940
making some investments. They're not like, hey, let's just invent our own thing. We'll

313
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,780
come up with a way and we'll create the way you should all be doing it. They're actually

314
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,620
going to these existing, well-respected, open source projects that have been established

315
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,620
for years and not trying to roll them, but just trying to work with them and contribute

316
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,140
to them. And it's great to see now Epic jump on this too.

317
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,940
Not to mention that they don't just do games, they also do a lot of movies as well. I think

318
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:07,140
they did something with the Curious Case of Benjamin Button. I'm not exactly for sure

319
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:13,300
on that. But they do some awesome video graphics as well.

320
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,900
The Blender project, yes, very much so. They're kind of all about that, I know. It's really

321
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:23,460
awesome and so it's good to see. In fact, I don't even know if gaming is a really heavy

322
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:29,060
focus for Blender outside of the context of just a few things like that, other than character

323
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,300
models and stuff like that.

324
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,940
Now, if they can have that quality of graphics inside games at 60 frames per second, then

325
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,420
I would truly be in heaven.

326
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,460
Oh my gosh, the Blender gaming engine? Don't even make me dream, man. That's crazy. That's

327
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,460
crazy.

328
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
It'd be beautiful.

329
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:49,660
I talked about some audio issues I was having, I think it was last week on Linux Unplugged

330
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,520
when we were talking about KD sound issues, and I managed to get them fixed. Turned out

331
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:01,220
to be a config issue with the default fragment size buffer in PulseAudio. Changed the default

332
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:08,980
value, which was way high, down to a millisecond setting of five, and now my Civ 5, which had

333
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,940
choppy audio, plays flawlessly.

334
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,860
So if you've had choppy audio in Civ 5 or XCOM, Enemy Unknown, any of those games, I

335
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:22,260
got a link in the show notes where you guys can go check that out and see how I fixed

336
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,260
it.

337
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:31,700
Now, this is the story, I'm really glad Joss is here, because I have a hard time with understanding

338
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,260
the way the KD naming system works, and thankfully we now have an infographic that Aaron Saigo

339
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,700
posted recently that tells us how it works.

340
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,500
So here it is, ladies and gentlemen, KDE, the project, is happy to announce that they

341
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,180
have shipped the release candidate of Plasma 5.

342
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,820
Now this is the first release of Plasma 5, the next generation desktop, this is the last

343
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,220
chance for you guys to test and file for bugs and check any problems before the release,

344
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,100
which is scheduled next week.

345
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:06,700
So you have Plasma 5, the desktop component, then you have KDE Next, aka KDE 5, sort of

346
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,780
the architecture component.

347
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,500
Joss is there anything you want to jump in on here on this story, are you trying it out,

348
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,820
are there any insights here you can share with the group?

349
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:22,180
Do you have a link to that image, because I'm kind of curious about it, because especially

350
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:28,100
KDE Next is something I've never heard about, so that's kind of new to me, which is rather

351
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,100
odd.

352
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Okay.

353
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,460
I mean, the idea behind the next thing that I do know is that the developers currently

354
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,780
refer to an upcoming Plasma release as Plasma Next, but that is always referring to the

355
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:48,900
upcoming Plasma release, so after Plasma 5.0 is out, Plasma 5.1 will be referred to as

356
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:55,100
Plasma Next, which is kind of a code name, eternal code name for the next release.

357
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:02,740
And so, for example, if I have this timing right, the 5.1 release is already scheduled

358
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,860
for October 15th, a Tuesday, if things all go according to plan, if things work out the

359
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,380
way the project wants them to.

360
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:15,300
Okay, I hadn't seen that date yet, but, and I actually thought it would be coming next

361
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,660
month, so today, yeah, it's Tuesday, isn't it?

362
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:27,740
So it's last night actually, last night we pushed out Framework 5, so KDE Framework 5,

363
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,700
that's basically taken, well, we took our old KDE libraries, the KDE Platform, the KD

364
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:40,220
Libs, however you want to call it, and basically, well, divided it into two parts.

365
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,420
One part we said, okay, this we're going to upstream to Qt, we brought it back into the

366
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,740
toolkit, contributed it to the Qt project, which now has an open governance, so we can

367
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,500
actually contribute and work at it.

368
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,540
And the other part, we basically cut the little pieces with clear dependencies, we worked

369
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:03,060
on it, making a proper closed platform, et cetera, et cetera, basically modularizing

370
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,740
it, and that's frameworks.

371
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,300
So we call it frameworks because there are multiple little pieces, each of them called

372
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:17,780
a framework, that you can use in your applications, and they're explicitly targeting Qt developers,

373
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,700
all Qt developers, and not just KDE developers, because this was the main complaint about

374
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:28,340
the old KDE, right, you install, you know, KDE, as it used to be in the 3.5 and even

375
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:33,740
in the 4 series, and then you get all this stuff, well, we solved that.

376
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:39,540
Framework 5 means you just get what your application needs, applications are smaller, leaner, more

377
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,620
efficient, and a lot of it even went in Qt, so the whole thing got smaller quite a bit

378
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,140
as well.

379
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,940
So this is really a major release, and this is what Plasma is going to build on, and the

380
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,380
idea was actually I think that Plasma initially would release this month, but because it was

381
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,420
meant to build on frameworks, and frameworks got delayed by a month, the Plasma guys also

382
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:08,300
had to delay by a month, and I think it'll come out next month, but that's a wild guess,

383
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:15,020
and maybe the October date is correct, but I thought we would go earlier than that, honestly.

384
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:20,780
And when, so the way this is going to work is really most people probably won't see this

385
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:27,100
ship in a distribution they're going to use until maybe 5.1 is actually out, right?

386
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:36,860
I'm kind of hoping for that, honestly, because as I wrote pretty clearly in I think the last

387
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:45,660
time we released something from Plasma, it's pretty good, even for a 5.0 release, it's

388
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,660
pretty good.

389
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,580
It's nothing compared to KDE 4.0, right, I mean absolutely nothing, that was the first

390
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,700
version of Plasma we did, and we were literally pushing technological boundaries everywhere,

391
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,460
we were pushing the graphics cards, I mean OpenGL support on Linux just sucked back then,

392
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,020
and we basically couldn't really properly do the stuff we tried to do.

393
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:13,020
We were pushing Qt, we were basically taking a new technology, the graphics view on which

394
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,900
Plasma was built, and we were taking it to places where it really wasn't meant to go.

395
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:24,180
But now all that stuff is basically ready, what we're trying to do is pretty much these

396
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:30,500
days what Qt is built for, right, and all the problems with Xorg and the OpenGL support

397
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,020
have been mostly fixed, I mean still everybody's looking forward to Wayland on the developer

398
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,020
side.

399
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,020
Sure, I bet.

400
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,220
But, you know, a lot of the rough edges are out.

401
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,660
In a matter of speaking, yes.

402
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:48,340
In a matter of speaking perhaps, but for normal, you know, for the Plasma guys, Wayland is

403
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,300
really something they look forward.

404
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:55,940
So the first release, on one hand, I mean it's a first release, okay, we've ported from

405
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:01,620
Qt 4 to Qt 5, we ported from Platform 4, as we used to call it, to Frameworks 5, which

406
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,700
is brand new in itself.

407
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,740
So yeah, you will definitely bump into some rough edges here and there, but at the same

408
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,820
time, we fixed a couple of really fundamental issues that were holding us back, and you

409
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,780
couldn't place, I mean a lot of people complain about the placement of things, you know, like

410
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:25,180
it didn't look really right, icons were just the wrong size, they weren't aligned properly,

411
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:31,260
that was all because we simply couldn't get that done in Qt, and now we can.

412
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:36,220
So you will notice on one hand rough edges, but you will also notice that we're finally

413
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,060
building on something that can actually support what we're building.

414
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,260
So it's the groundwork in the early days, so does that mean like, it sounds like what

415
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:50,060
you're trying to say very politely is, don't judge the looks in 5.0 and 5.1.

416
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:55,780
No, certainly not, I mean there's a lot of work still being done on, you know, there's

417
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,540
a lot that was done, but there's still a lot done in the area of polish and also the looks,

418
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,940
I mean there's work on the new theme, but honestly the implementation of the theme in

419
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:10,700
the first version, well to call it hackish, is still a compliment, I mean it's really

420
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:16,300
put together like, okay, this kind of looks like what we want, but the way it's done is

421
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,740
very suboptimal.

422
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:23,340
So certainly when it comes to looks, it shows a direction, right, flatter, cleaner, less

423
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:29,140
lines, less icons, less this and that, that's the direction, that's clear, but it's not

424
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,500
a final look, not by a long shot.

425
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,900
It sounds like you're pretty excited about it though.

426
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,900
I am.

427
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,020
It's maybe a direction you want to see things going for a while?

428
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,500
Well it's a direction, I think that's a big keyword here.

429
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:49,300
When we did KDE 4.0, I mean that's quite a while ago, 6 years ago, but I remember that,

430
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:55,980
I mean I worked a lot on the promo and in general, you know, on the whole, yeah, writing

431
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,180
about it and everything and the cool thing about it was there was a very clear direction,

432
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,300
we were going somewhere and it was awesome, right?

433
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,260
I mean we didn't know that our technology and the whole Linux platform simply wouldn't

434
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,860
be able to, well, carry us into this beautiful new world, so to say.

435
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,740
So we were all very excited because we were really breaking a lot of technology barriers

436
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,340
and I blogged about this a few times, you know, some of the things we did back then,

437
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:29,920
I mean when Plasma was designed, it was designed to basically converge different user interfaces

438
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,100
with one technology, right?

439
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,260
So you would be able to build, and we did by the way build prototypes of this, you would

440
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:42,620
be able to build a widget that would run on a mobile phone and on a tablet and on a desktop

441
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:48,260
and on a television screen and it would have the same underlying code, just a very thin

442
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,660
layer of UI work would be different.

443
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:57,540
Today you still see projects, companies trying to build one user interface for all these

444
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:03,660
devices, surprise, it doesn't work, and you see other companies building completely different

445
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:09,500
user interface for each device, while seven, eight years ago when we drafted this, we already

446
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
did it right.

447
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:16,660
Now, yeah, it didn't exactly work out that way and that's a little frustrating maybe,

448
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,540
but now we can actually do it because the knowledge is there.

449
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,380
So yeah, you bet, I am excited and a lot of us are excited about this.

450
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:30,420
Well I recommend that if folks out there want to know more, check out where Katie is going,

451
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:35,940
Joss just posted part two a couple days ago, so check that out.

452
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:41,060
Yeah, let me share actually simply a link to my blog, because I put a bunch of links

453
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,180
in there that probably are all, I'll put them on IRC, I have no idea how to share in-

454
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,780
Yeah, no, toss them in IRC, that's perfect, I'll grab it.

455
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:54,100
Let's see, yeah, so this has links to an overview of Framework 5, it has a link to an article

456
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,140
that I wrote for linux.com, why it is a big deal for free software, because I think it

457
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:05,420
is another thing we didn't get to, but I think Framework 5 is actually really a big deal,

458
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:11,420
because right now there are half a million Qt developers out there, and I mean people

459
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:17,380
developing software of Qt, and there are more people developing software of Qt than almost

460
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,820
the total number of users of openSUSE and Fedora combined.

461
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:27,140
And that's a lot of people developing software of that, and Frameworks basically brings them

462
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:34,180
all in contact with open source free software, open contributor process, open governance,

463
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:39,420
basically they can, if they want to, and have the skills and knowledge, at least if you're

464
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,900
a developer you do, to get involved with free software, and I think that's really a big

465
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
thing.

466
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,800
Well, it sounds like Frameworks is stepping in the direction to give the development community

467
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,740
a lot of confidence too, like, they're going to have maybe a little more, if they want,

468
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,740
involvement.

469
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:04,740
Yes, I mean, can you imagine if only 1% of those half a million developers decides to,

470
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:11,900
I don't know, fix a couple of bugs in Framework, or add a few features, I mean that will, that

471
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,720
will, I mean, come on, that's 5000 people, that's just crazy, if that would happen that

472
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:24,140
would just turn everything around, right, that would basically bring more than increase

473
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:29,460
the number of people doing gooey stuff on the Linux desktop, it will increase the number

474
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,980
from a few hundred in total to thousands, I mean that's the order of magnitude.

475
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,380
Joss, you've been around for a while, what do you think if you were to put, you know,

476
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:46,700
your forecasters hat on, how long until, you know, Frameworks 5 has been out, Plasma desktop

477
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,140
has been out for a while, how long until, like, it's at critical mass, and it's actually

478
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,560
making a palatable difference where people look back and go, oh wow, this has really

479
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
taken off.

480
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
How far out is that, do you think?

481
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,660
Honestly, I think there are two scenarios.

482
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:06,340
If this direction stays, stays strong, and I think you need to have a clear direction

483
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,820
as a project, and honestly, KD, in my opinion, has been missing that in the last couple of

484
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:18,100
years, but if it stays with a clear direction and gets people together and say, you know,

485
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,220
I mean, this doesn't look good, we need to fix it, and we're just going to fix it, and

486
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,660
not, you know, do something fancy somewhere else, right, because this is the thing that

487
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:31,460
you see a lot in free software, people love building big stuff, and you ask them, you

488
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:37,540
know, I'm quoting Frank Harlitek actually here, the guy who started on Cloud, he has

489
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:41,620
very interesting opinions on this, also been on the board of KD, you know, and he always

490
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:47,260
says, you know, a lot of free software developers work like this, if you ask them for a house,

491
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,380
they'll build you a skyscraper, take out the top and say, look, you know, here's a house,

492
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,700
right, and this is the thing you can't really do.

493
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,180
If you care about the goal and getting something done, you can't do this.

494
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,460
So this, in my opinion, is one of the things that needs to change.

495
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,020
It's changing a bit, but maybe not enough, maybe, I don't know.

496
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:10,540
If it does change, you know, by the way, no, in my opinion, has gotten this one done, right,

497
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:14,380
they have a very clear vision, and they're implementing it, and it doesn't fit, they

498
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:20,140
say no, they're a little extreme, in my opinion, in it, but, you know, if we can find a middle

499
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,380
ground, then I think in a couple of years, you will really see a big difference.

500
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,540
I mean, this can bring hundreds of people, maybe even an order of magnitude increase

501
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,660
in people contributing to the KD project.

502
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,860
We already started on that road, since we started with frameworks, since we started

503
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,060
with some changes in our government.

504
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:46,380
We recently did a manifesto, manifesto.kde.org, and since then, we had like seven, eight projects

505
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:52,900
join us, including GCompre, which is downright a known project that decided to join KDE for,

506
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,760
you know, bringing software to multiple platforms like Android.

507
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:03,300
So if that continues, that could really make a huge difference, but the other scenario

508
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:09,340
is, of course, the bad one, in which we lose direction, and then, well, I mean, KDE will

509
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,180
still be a cool project, and it'll still continue, but it'll be where it is today.

510
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:18,100
The Linux desktop will be where it is today, which is, unfortunately, pretty much irrelevant.

511
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:23,540
It's cool for the people who use it, but let's be honest, what do we have, 0.7%?

512
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,940
It's not enough to move the general needle.

513
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,940
Exactly.

514
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,980
We haven't, and, you know, to move the needle, we need to really change a couple of things,

515
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,300
and that's not just technology, that's also people, and on that side of things, I honestly

516
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
don't know.

517
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,780
As far as I'm concerned, this is a 50-50 thing.

518
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,420
How much of, this is a question that kind of came from Heaven's Revenge, how much of

519
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:53,960
a compatibility break is there between the version 4 of KDE frameworks and whatever it's

520
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,300
called there, and the new versions of all that stuff?

521
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:03,660
Will applications, say, designed for KDE 4 desktop work okay on the Plasma 5 desktop?

522
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,660
I'm pretty sure there will be some quirks there, honestly.

523
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:12,260
I think the best thing is if applications move, and I think the plan is to start moving

524
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,100
soon for the KDE applications.

525
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:21,180
They are now on the three-month release cycle, four months, actually, I'm not entirely sure,

526
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,540
but I'm pretty sure they will start moving well before the end of the year.

527
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,500
A couple of them have been ported already, and it's actually going pretty quick.

528
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,220
I know that an initial port of Dolphin, the file manager, which is a pretty complex application

529
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:39,380
when you think about it, was done by someone not too familiar with the code in, I don't

530
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,380
know, a few weeks.

531
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,380
Okay.

532
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,380
And there was, yeah.

533
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,380
Yeah.

534
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,380
So it's not too bad?

535
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,380
No, no, no.

536
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,140
We have scripts that actually really do 99% of the work.

537
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:55,420
So I think we will be able to, basically, you will be able to run a full Framework 5

538
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,900
based desktop, you know, with Plasma and the KDE applications all on Qt 5, you know, probably

539
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,740
summer or the end of the year, next year.

540
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,020
I mean, some parts will take a little longer.

541
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,740
I know there are people about KDPim.

542
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,820
They don't expect to move that quick, but honestly, if I see how many people have been

543
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,540
joining development there in the last couple of months, I actually think there might be

544
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,780
a little too negative about their roadmap, but we will see.

545
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,780
Things might improve.

546
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,620
Well, Joss, it's great having you join us.

547
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,180
You're welcome to join us anytime and stick around for the whole show and chime in on

548
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
any topic we get to.

549
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,300
We're actually going to do a review of Chaos, K-A-O-S, here in a little bit, which is a

550
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,780
very heavily designed KDE distribution.

551
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:41,220
They've really taken a heavy hand to customizing it and making it a very unique experience.

552
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,740
So we're going to talk about that here in just a second.

553
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,380
Before we move to that, I want to thank our next sponsor of the Linux Unplugged podcast,

554
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,540
and that is DigitalOcean.

555
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,900
Go over to digitalocean.com.

556
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:50,900
Guess what?

557
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,460
Brand new promo code!

558
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,860
That's right, it's Unplugged July.

559
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,660
And when you use the promo code Unplugged July, you're going to get a $10 credit over

560
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,660
at DigitalOcean.

561
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,740
So what is DigitalOcean?

562
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,780
My friend, I am glad you asked, because you need to know.

563
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,460
Did you know you can have a Linux server up in the cloud that you have root access to

564
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,380
in just about 55 seconds?

565
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,380
That's right.

566
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:14,700
DigitalOcean plans to start only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

567
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,180
one blazing fast CPU, and a terabyte of transfer connected to tier one data centers and tier

568
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,100
one bandwidth all over the world.

569
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:26,320
In fact, DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, and

570
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,700
Amsterdam.

571
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,180
Their interface is simple.

572
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,180
Their control panel is very intuitive and power users can replicate the control panel

573
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,060
on a much wider scale using their straightforward API.

574
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,940
And I think I've mentioned it before probably on the Unplugged show, but one of the things

575
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,500
I love the most, one of the things I love the most about DigitalOcean is this amazing

576
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,500
dashboard.

577
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,660
They have managed to somehow take the complexity of KVM and server provisioning and really

578
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:56,660
global data center management, DNS management, backup management, application deployment,

579
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,860
Docker image management, all of that, and wrapped it in an interface where you can spin

580
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,340
up a brand new server in less than 55 seconds.

581
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,100
They also have hourly pricing plans.

582
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:10,500
If you use our promo code, Unplugged July, that $10 credit will get you quite a distance

583
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,140
on their hourly pricing plans.

584
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,460
And one of the things that really stands out about DigitalOcean is they made an early investment

585
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,660
in SSDs.

586
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:21,020
They saw how this was going and they realized if we could take the flexibility that using

587
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,980
Linux and KVM gives us, match that up with incredibly performant disk IO, then that increases

588
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,260
our density so we can host way more systems, the users get more performance out of their

589
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,620
box because the CPUs aren't sitting around waiting for the disk IO, you don't have to

590
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:39,140
have these massive expensive rate arrays of spinning disks, SSDs deliver the performance

591
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:45,100
of an entire array, and if we could somehow wrap it all up in a very straightforward package

592
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,340
that's so easy, even if you're not a server administrator, you have no problem, you can

593
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,700
provision in 55 seconds, you get amazing hardware without even having to think about it.

594
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:59,300
They took all of that, all out there, brought it together, wrapped it up so intelligently,

595
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:04,100
so well done with real vision and purpose, and now DigitalOcean is blowing up.

596
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:07,940
Users love DigitalOcean, Linux enthusiasts love DigitalOcean, but do they have a special

597
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,940
promo code?

598
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,940
Don't think so.

599
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,680
Unplug July to get a $10 credit, check it out, some of the DigitalOcean locations also

600
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,460
have private networking, which is great for a web backend, maybe you want to have some

601
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,700
front-end web servers access a backend database server, and by the way, that private networking

602
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,800
doesn't count against your bandwidth, and it's all just a fixed cost, $5 pricing plans

603
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,820
go up from there, make a lot of sense, and you know exactly what you're going to get.

604
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:32,940
Go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code unplug July when you check out to get

605
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,860
that $10 credit and see what I've been talking about.

606
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,580
DigitalOcean truly rocks, you guys will be really impressed what they can do.

607
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,140
DigitalOcean.com, and a really big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux

608
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:48,620
Unplugged podcast, that's right, that's right, unplug July, crack it open.

609
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:54,500
Okay, so let's talk about chaos, K-A-O-S, K-A-O-S, I know we had a group of you in here

610
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,860
that did the review, I'm really looking forward to see what you guys said about it, Rotten

611
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:03,380
Corpse, do you want to kick it off and kind of introduce it, or do you want me to introduce

612
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,380
what the distro is?

613
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,380
I could do that too if you want.

614
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,900
Well, I can go ahead and give a quick introduction.

615
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:17,620
Chaos is an arch-based distro that is based solely around KDE, I might be mistaken but

616
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:24,580
I'm pretty sure they have a very strict requirement about the packages as in if it's not KDE compatible

617
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,300
it's not allowed in their repo.

618
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,140
It's not installed by default, I think it's allowed in their repo because I know they

619
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,020
have Chrome and a few other things in their repo.

620
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:41,740
Chrome is self-contained so I think it's more in the sense that they don't completely restrict

621
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,180
your ability to use it, but they don't promote the use of it.

622
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:49,660
They mention on their site in their repo they have Firefox 30, Chrome 37, Thunderbird 24,

623
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:54,540
and Adore 3.5, but that's about it.

624
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:01,100
It's arch-based but it's not like a derivative arch, it's kind of like its own thing.

625
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:05,220
They call themselves a tightly integrated rolling transparent distribution for the modern

626
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:11,060
desktop built from scratch with a specific focus, KDE and QT.

627
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:16,620
They also even come out and say their target audience is desktop and operating system enthusiasts.

628
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,600
Those desktop-aholics we were talking about last week, they don't consider this to be

629
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,420
a new user distribution necessarily.

630
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,420
They want it to be more of an enthusiast distribution.

631
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:31,180
The latest version in June, they just came out at the beginning of June, includes the

632
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:39,820
non-free NVIDIA driver, KDE 4.13.2, Linux kernel 3.14.6, and I think there's also an

633
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:48,940
update to 3.15 already, GLib of course, SystemD of course, Xorg Server 1.15.1, KWebKit 2.33,

634
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:55,140
QT530, you know, the good stuff, all your regular stuff, it's a modern up-to-date just

635
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,620
as of June distribution.

636
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,340
Rotten, where do you want to start?

637
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:06,020
Well, I kind of want to start with Popeye.

638
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,020
You want to start with Popeye?

639
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,940
Alright, that's kind of what I was thinking too, because I know Popeye kind of laid down

640
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,420
a few hints last week.

641
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,460
Oh, but before we get to that, Wimpy, you want to touch on the philosophy, I'll give

642
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,460
you a chance, go ahead.

643
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,740
Well, yeah, I've run it, I'm happy to chip in later, I was just going to say I really

644
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:27,180
like that it's super-focused, they've got a very clear vision on this, one desktop,

645
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,140
one architecture, and they're being laser-focused in that regard, and I also like very much

646
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:38,660
that it's an Arch derivative, so in terms of the philosophy and what I read about it,

647
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,420
I was suitably impressed.

648
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,380
Now is it an Arch derivative, or is it just using Pac-Man?

649
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:51,900
Well, no, it's their own version of Arch, so whilst it shares a lot of the core architecture

650
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,700
of Arch Linux, it is not in any way related to Arch Linux, they've taken the tools and

651
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,140
the packaging tools from Arch and they've made their own distribution around it.

652
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,660
Right, okay, so Popeye, let's start with you.

653
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,460
What was your impression of this distribution, where would you like to start on your journey

654
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,460
with Chaos?

655
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,460
So, I first of all tried it in a VM, and then I stuck it on a USB stick and installed it

656
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,020
on real hardware.

657
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:21,940
I used an Intel-based Toshiba laptop that's about five years old, it's Core 2 Duo with

658
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:29,000
three gig of RAM, and it also has a touch screen, but I didn't really test that part

659
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
of it.

660
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,180
I did the install, and when you say it's aimed at desktop enthusiasts, I'm taking that to

661
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:43,960
mean geeks, like, you know, I definitely would not give this to my mum, and I probably wouldn't

662
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:51,940
give it to any new-ish user, it really is quite technical, so some of the things I noticed

663
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:57,100
like for the install, for example, you mentioned the Nvidia non-free driver, like when you

664
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,620
first boot up, the first option is to boot into the installer, and the second option

665
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:07,820
just says Nvidia non-free, with no explanation of what that's all about.

666
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:13,940
At one point when I was booting, I got dropped to like a boot colon blank screen prompt,

667
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,740
as if it couldn't find the Linux kernel, which I thought was a bit offensive.

668
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:24,820
I then got smacked in the face with a box after the install was done, I mean I did do

669
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:32,480
the install, and it worked, but it's really but ugly, their installer, and I didn't enjoy

670
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,140
that process at all.

671
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:39,300
All the bits and pieces on the screen didn't line up right, and it felt over-complicated

672
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,380
and too busy and typical KDE.

673
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:49,580
There was a box that popped up after I installed that said, welcome to chaos, and then it said,

674
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,340
in need of the password file or package list, and then there was like six buttons on the

675
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:54,340
screen.

676
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:59,100
Actually, why smacked me in the face with that, it just seemed a bit weird.

677
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:03,780
And the package list, interestingly enough, is just a PDF, oh I'm sorry, it's just a text

678
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,540
file, it's a text file of just the install packages.

679
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,660
I'm sure to some technical users that might be useful, but that's not something I want

680
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,780
when I've just installed, I don't know.

681
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:18,980
And then I get onto the usual KDE annoyances, I don't know if these are KDE specific or

682
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:26,220
plasma specific, but this is what chaos did, most of the icons had no tooltip, so I had

683
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,220
no idea what they were.

684
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:32,900
And bear in mind, I hadn't used KDE for like five years, and none of the icons were obvious

685
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:33,900
what they were.

686
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,340
I couldn't see an icon that looked like a web browser, I had to find something called

687
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:46,500
Quapzilla, which I had never heard of, loads of weird dialogues, applications that when

688
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,580
I opened them they did nothing, or they popped up multiple dialogues over the top of everything

689
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,100
else and I just found it quite frustrating.

690
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:59,260
Once I got past that, and if I accept that as okay, I could then install some applications

691
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,660
and that was okay, but I found it slightly frustrating.

692
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:08,340
But once it was up, you know, suspend and restore works, update works, I can install

693
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,940
applications and it seemed okay.

694
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,340
What was your impression of the look?

695
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,780
So they've spent a lot of time working on this theme, it's one of the most unique looks

696
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:23,700
of KDE, like they have this special menu that is very heavily designed, did it work for

697
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,700
you?

698
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,700
Did it not?

699
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,940
No, I think it's disgusting, I absolutely don't like it at all.

700
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:35,660
But then I don't really like KDE, so there you go, it's gonna have a hard time pleasing

701
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,660
me.

702
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,260
Heaven's Revenge, did you have a chance to kick the tires?

703
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,260
What did you think?

704
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:45,300
Well, yes, I had enough chance to kick the tires and then I broke it yesterday and I'm

705
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,860
still actually trying to fix it.

706
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,860
How did it break?

707
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,860
What happened?

708
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,860
Oh, give me the story.

709
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,860
Walk me through.

710
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:55,880
Well, something is wrong with Pac-Man, even though I am an Arch kind of guy, I love Arch,

711
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,540
but it's going down the same road as Chakra, as in it does, it has forked and it is its

712
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:06,140
own project, so it is not just a customization of Arch, it is a fork.

713
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:14,020
I completely took away that custom bar at the bottom, I put the normal kicker or the

714
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,140
normal Lancelot menu back.

715
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:22,300
I kind of had to get used to Octopi, considering it's kind of weird.

716
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:29,780
But their Pac-Man, the Pac-Man package manager, it has a very interesting progress bar.

717
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,580
It's like a Pac-Man eating little dots as it goes across the screen.

718
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:36,100
Which is a setting, I have that on my Arch box too, it's fun.

719
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:41,540
I've never seen it before, but I've seen that in this, and it seems quite custom.

720
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:47,500
The file system structure is all just pretty much like Arch, they didn't change too much

721
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,500
of that.

722
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:53,320
I've missed too much of the AUR, I cannot access the AUR, even though they say it accesses

723
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,980
the CCR, but that's, no, screw it.

724
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:04,500
I also had a friend, which is a, well, going to be a, well, he's dabbling in Linux, so

725
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:10,560
I gave him a choice of three or four different Linux distributions by putting a few virtual

726
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,580
machines up and saying, here, do any of these catch your eye?

727
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:22,100
The thing is, is that with Chaos, since it is a custom distro, all the packages are custom

728
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,100
built for the actual distribution.

729
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:30,500
That means there is no wine, there is no Windows emulation layer, and there's no Steam, at

730
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,860
least in the repos.

731
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,480
If anything, you have to go and get it manually.

732
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:42,880
So he needed wine, he wanted to play N64 emulators that isn't available on the, so that was a

733
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,940
showstopper for him.

734
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:49,780
I found the package, or the Pac-Man log viewer to be quite interesting, because I've never

735
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:54,860
used Octopi before, because I'm not much of a Mangero fan, but you can kind of get used

736
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,500
to the package manager.

737
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:04,980
It is very user-friendly, but the distribution is not aimed at new users, it's aimed at people

738
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,020
who can break their system, and like me, is attempting to fix it again.

739
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,080
Right, right, that is true, it is kind of an odd mismatch.

740
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,260
And Riley had a question, I think probably for the group, about 32-bit.

741
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,260
Go ahead Riley.

742
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:21,020
Yeah, according to the website, they don't believe in 32-bit applications, like they

743
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:26,980
were saying, in this modern-day age of computers, they refuse to have 32-bit applications on

744
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,180
their system.

745
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:33,180
So that pretty much means that Steam will not be supported ever at all, and gaming is

746
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,980
pretty much out of the question.

747
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:42,380
They feel that to make the perfect desktop, they have to target a specific platform, the

748
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,380
way they phrase it.

749
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,380
Is they have to take it right?

750
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:48,060
And that's kind of like, we're not doing 32-bit because we only want to think about 64-bit,

751
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,060
was that kind of the reasoning?

752
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:53,420
Yeah, that's what it sounded like to me when I read the website.

753
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:58,720
It's unfortunate because I do believe in 64-bit, but our 32-bit past has still not completely

754
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,720
left us.

755
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:04,000
Hmm, I agree, I agree, Wimpy, I think I'm in sync with you.

756
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,820
They call the distribution chaos, but what they're really striving for is sort of absolute

757
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:14,580
control and not, maybe not necessarily control, but absolute, it's exactly what they want

758
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,100
it to be, it's exactly what they want to present.

759
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,740
Do you pick that up too, Wimpy?

760
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:26,100
Well, yeah, my point is that the tagline is a lean KDE distribution, which is an oxymoron

761
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:32,300
since it juxtaposes lean and KDE, and those two things are contradictory.

762
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:39,860
And my experiences with it were, when I first installed it, I installed it on some hardware

763
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:47,100
that only had 768 meg of RAM, and the installer spits out a warning to tell you that the installer

764
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:52,380
requires one and a half gig of RAM to run, and you can proceed if you like, but you need

765
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,980
to be fair warned that you need one and a half gig to install it.

766
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:00,300
So that was my first, like, hmm, really lean, I need one and a half gig of RAM, so.

767
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,300
Yeah, that's not so lean, I suppose.

768
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:07,100
No, so anyway, I got over that one, I went to a machine with more memory and got through

769
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,780
the installer.

770
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,300
What was your impression of the installer?

771
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,900
I've noticed the disk part, the disk partitioner is pretty interesting, right?

772
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,900
The way it really works is, you launch off, you hit the advanced button.

773
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:21,380
If you have a drive that has no partitions, you immediately have to go to the advanced

774
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,660
button, and then from there, it launches K Partition Manager, and then you partition

775
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,540
out the drive the way you want.

776
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:31,740
Then you go back into the installer, and then once you're in the installer, you have to

777
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:36,460
flag these partitions where you want them to be mount point wise using a different application,

778
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,660
and flag them again to be formatted.

779
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,700
Did you guys find that to be wonky?

780
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:41,700
I didn't have that.

781
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:47,740
Yeah, I did, because I was installing on a... I DD'd zeros to the disk before I started,

782
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,300
and that's exactly what I had.

783
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:54,300
I was a little bit... Well, to me, it wasn't obvious what I needed to do.

784
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,180
There was no disk that I could select, and I clicked the advanced button, and then I

785
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:03,140
was presented with KDE Partition Manager, and there's this whole disjointed partition

786
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,140
thing.

787
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,100
I may as well have just been using Fdisk at that point.

788
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,100
You really could.

789
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,260
You really could just use Fdisk and then go back in here.

790
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:13,300
So yeah, if you have a blank drive with no partition table, you get hit with this where

791
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,740
you have to go into a separate partitioning program.

792
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,880
Not a huge deal, but it's... It does partitioning on itself, but there's

793
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,380
a button that I can't remember where it is, but that installer does do partitioning.

794
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,100
I partitioned my drive in the installer, which was terrible.

795
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,820
All those buttons were grayed out for me.

796
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:35,580
If I've got a disk with no partition... Like not even a table written.

797
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:36,580
Yeah, exactly.

798
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,580
You had to initialize.

799
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,580
Yeah, you had to initialize.

800
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,380
You had to do it mandronically.

801
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:46,580
The other thing I noticed about the installer was the... Well, as Papi said, it's very

802
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:52,580
cluttered, but also the time zone selector is a massive on it.

803
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:56,180
My notes say here is this why it requires one and a half gig of RAM.

804
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:01,300
For those of you that haven't installed it, you get like a Google Earth view of the world.

805
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,020
I think it's marble embedded, right?

806
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,020
It's the KDE Marble.

807
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,020
Yeah.

808
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,020
Rubbish.

809
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:10,020
It's massively over-engineered for choosing a time zone.

810
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,020
Yeah.

811
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,020
They should have spent more time on the disk partitioner.

812
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:19,300
It's kind of hard to manage, too, and depending on your machine, it can be pretty clunky.

813
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,920
Now I think they get the benefit of it just being able to embed that because it's part

814
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:28,660
of the whole KDE desktop, and then they just take the coordinates that you click.

815
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:32,260
Once you get through the disk partitioner, you select that stuff there, you set your

816
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:37,940
swap up... After that, the installer's pretty much done, right?

817
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:41,820
Then it just writes it to disk, and you're off to the races.

818
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:46,620
Yeah, but the installer in itself is a bit strange because it doesn't install in a traditional

819
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,620
sense.

820
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:51,700
It copies the contents of the ISO image to the hard disk, and then installs a bootloader.

821
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:56,980
Right, yeah, so essentially exactly what you get in the live environment is what you get

822
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:00,620
on the installed machine, which feels a little cluttered, perhaps?

823
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,140
Not so much cluttered, but it doesn't feel right.

824
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,860
Yeah, it doesn't feel quite like an installation.

825
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:13,980
One area where Integros sort of shines here, again coming from the Arch roots, is you could

826
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:21,160
have a three-month-old ISO of Integros, but when you install it, it is pulling down the

827
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,740
absolute latest KDE or GNOME.

828
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:26,940
It is pulling down the absolute latest kernel, and so it is super fresh packages that are

829
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:30,460
being written to the disk.

830
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:34,100
If you call yourself a rolling release, that would be nice, but that can mean different

831
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,660
things.

832
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,820
And I'm not trying to be critical of the way Kaos does it, because I also, on the one hand,

833
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:46,020
really like the idea of somebody taking, kind of like Joss was talking about, a direction

834
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:50,100
with a KDE desktop and saying, this is our look.

835
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,620
I kind of applaud them for saying, we're only going to support 64-bit.

836
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:57,660
That eliminates a huge portion of the market, but they're okay with that.

837
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:01,940
They're obviously aware of that, and they've made that choice, and in some ways, I think

838
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:06,500
we need to see more KDE desktops where the people that are implementing it stop saying,

839
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:11,620
we can do everything, and start saying, we're only going to do these things.

840
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:15,380
And I think it's going to take years of doing that to make it really awesome.

841
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:19,340
Isn't that kind of a contradiction to the KDE project though?

842
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:25,340
Because they always want to do everything, which is a double-edged sword, it's great,

843
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,340
and also a negative.

844
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,500
Yeah, very true.

845
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,460
Once it was installed, I found there were some odd, strange applications that didn't

846
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:33,460
seem...

847
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,660
It seemed like if they were going for real polish, they've chosen some odd things to

848
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:42,580
throw in there, like apps that A, don't work, or do weird things, or pop up strange dialogues.

849
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:48,260
It seemed like that once they got the installer done, it was a bunch of applications thrown

850
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,780
in as well, just because they could.

851
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:55,900
Do you think that's a QT bias, where we only want to feature QT applications?

852
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:56,900
My install failed.

853
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,900
Bummer.

854
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:58,900
Darn it.

855
01:00:58,900 --> 01:00:59,900
Well, that's no good.

856
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,900
Well, there you go.

857
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:07,900
I don't know, that could be for a number of reasons, who knows why that died, but there

858
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:08,900
you go.

859
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:09,900
Man, this is chaos.

860
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,400
The introduction or the inclusion of Kabzilla is okay.

861
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,460
It's a very unusual browser, but it's still WebKit based, so it's good.

862
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:25,300
And the one weird one is the appear.in website, which is a WebRTC Skype replacement bookmark

863
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,300
that is in the-

864
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,300
Oh, okay.

865
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,300
Yeah, I see that.

866
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,300
That's what that is.

867
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,300
Okay.

868
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,300
I see how they did it.

869
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,300
I see what they did there.

870
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,500
And then this, there we go.

871
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,300
Yeah, this launch is Quapzilla, Poppy's favorite browser of choice.

872
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,300
Oops.

873
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,300
Well, I did manage to find Chrome in their-

874
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,300
Repo.

875
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,300
In their package manager.

876
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:48,020
Once I figured out how to actually launch it, as I bitched and moaned about last week,

877
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:52,860
using their menu, just searching for the word update or upgrade, couldn't find the update

878
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:56,660
manager or whatever package management tool.

879
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:00,980
It was under add, remove programs, which seemed a bit bizarre to me.

880
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:05,220
This is the only Linux distribution on which I was able to actually look at every single

881
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:11,540
package and read every single one, except from the PBI listing of the PCBSD when it

882
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,400
first started making PBIs.

883
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,740
That's when there were so little amount of them there.

884
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,940
Because they have such a limited amount that one human can actually read through the whole

885
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,600
list in a reasonable amount of time.

886
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,140
I read all of the, yes, all of the packages and the repos.

887
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,140
Okay.

888
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,140
That's an interesting benchmark.

889
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,140
I like that.

890
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:28,140
I've never thought of that as a metric.

891
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,060
But, boy, interesting.

892
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:35,700
So it doesn't sound like anybody's necessarily coming out with a recommendation.

893
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,700
Anybody-

894
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:43,980
Well, I would say if you like KDE and you want a pure KDE desktop, then this might be

895
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,980
an option.

896
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:50,400
And if you're willing to forego the 32-bit stuff, you're missing Steam, Skype, Wine.

897
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,620
Some of the three annoyingly proprietary things that lots of people want, then, yeah, it's

898
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,620
okay.

899
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:57,620
It works.

900
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,620
And Flash, right?

901
01:02:58,620 --> 01:02:59,620
No Flash.

902
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:00,620
Oh, who needs Flash?

903
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,620
Steve Jobs told us years ago we don't need that.

904
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:02,620
That's true.

905
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,620
That's true.

906
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:04,620
We don't need that.

907
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,620
We don't need that Flash.

908
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,620
Yeah.

909
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:09,560
Actually, to me, all of those requirements are completely irrelevant to me.

910
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,860
So chaos is a potential option.

911
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:15,660
And Wimpy, you wanted to say not lean.

912
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:16,660
Yeah.

913
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:23,800
So some months ago, I did, I've mentioned this before, some resource consumption benchmarks

914
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,400
for Linux desktop environments.

915
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,540
And they were all conducted on Arch Linux.

916
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:31,280
And I've got some scripts that automate those tests.

917
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,660
So I thought, right, here we go.

918
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:37,200
Let's see how it's up to its lean statements.

919
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:44,260
So chaos, when I run my scripts, which is bring the system up, wait for all of this

920
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:50,300
auto-started applications to execute and wait for disk.io to settle, and then use PS mem

921
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,640
to gather the memory usage.

922
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,900
Very nice.

923
01:03:53,900 --> 01:04:01,860
So chaos weighs in at 319 meg after first boot with no applications being launched, which

924
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,860
is okay.

925
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:13,800
But a full KDE 4.13.1 on stock Arch under the same conditions weighs in at 302 meg.

926
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,540
So only 17 meg, but leaner.

927
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:24,020
So it kind of raises the question, if the tagline is it's a lean KDE, but it's not as

928
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:30,420
lean as the parent OS, they're kind of missing the target on that one.

929
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:36,120
Well, Wimpy, I would say that it is quite lean in terms of CPU usage, as it is just

930
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:43,500
as, it is equally as efficient in CPU as Antardos is under GNOME or running GNOME.

931
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:49,060
The GNOME desktop, it's a little bit like 100 megs more when it comes to RAM consumption,

932
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:52,060
but the CPU usage, it's actually quite good.

933
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,760
I was surprised.

934
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,460
It's been pretty robust for me as well.

935
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:59,940
Mine's got an uptime of seven days on my laptop, and I've been updating it regularly and trying

936
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,420
out various applications.

937
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:06,500
So despite all the gripes and bitches and moans that I've said that I don't like KDE,

938
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,500
it's stable.

939
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:12,660
If nothing else, it works and the apps that do work, work fairly well.

940
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:16,740
Very good, and if you want to see sort of an inspired KDE design, it's worth checking

941
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:20,140
out from that standpoint, at least in maybe a VirtualBox instance.

942
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:23,780
Also for me, I've tried it before, it never really manages to quite grab me.

943
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:27,740
I look at it and go, oh, yeah, I do see what they're trying to go for.

944
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:28,740
Good for them.

945
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:33,340
And then I kind of go about my day, and I just use a more general purpose distribution.

946
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,500
But I respect it.

947
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,140
You can check it out at kaossx.us.

948
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,980
Yeah, go ahead, Evan.

949
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:43,460
Oh, well, I would say that it would be a good recommendation for anyone who is wanting to

950
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:48,780
learn the Pac-Man package manager, but doesn't want the complete, I'm going to go balls deep

951
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,840
in arch and get way over my head.

952
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:55,020
If you can run Antigros, then sure, that's okay.

953
01:05:55,020 --> 01:06:00,060
Chaos is also another good alternative in order to just learn the Pac-Man package manager.

954
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:05,700
Yeah, or Manjaro, or Chakra, or Pentagross.

955
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:10,380
I had my Chakra days back when it was first created, and when it was first starting to

956
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,380
fork.

957
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:17,580
That's why when it went on that path of forking away from arch, I now stay clear of any distribution

958
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,540
that wants to fork from its parent.

959
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,980
Yeah, that's kind of, I mean, yeah, boy, that's a whole, all right, we'll save that for, I

960
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,500
think actually I want to do a future episode on that topic.

961
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:30,140
I got a couple of bits of business, and we can do some more closing thoughts on the review,

962
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:33,140
so Mumble Room, compose your thoughts for a second.

963
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:36,740
We have a couple of announcements, too, that I want to cover real quick, but first, I want

964
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:40,780
to thank the folks at Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged, linux.ting.com, that'll take

965
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:44,900
$25 off your first device, linux.ting.com.

966
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:45,900
Go own it!

967
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:47,660
I mean, why not?

968
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,640
They put Linux in the URL just for you guys.

969
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,700
Now what is Ting?

970
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,340
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

971
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:55,900
$6 a month, that's all you pay, and then it's just your usage.

972
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,860
Ting takes your megabytes, your minutes, your messages, adds them all up at the end of the

973
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:02,580
month, whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay.

974
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:05,940
Plus, no contract, thus, no early termination fee.

975
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:06,940
What?

976
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:07,940
I know.

977
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,500
It's actually how mobile should work.

978
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,420
Don't pay into some big old contract where they're trying to get a little off the top

979
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:15,700
from you every single month, just pay for what you use.

980
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,540
And every Ting plan includes all of the things you'd want, you got your built-in hotspot

981
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:23,100
and tethering, you just turn it on in the operating system and just pay for the usage.

982
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:27,460
You don't have to be in a family share plan, I think is what my last telco called it, you

983
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,740
don't have to be in a specific kind of plan to use the tethering feature that the vendor

984
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,560
built into the operating system.

985
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,100
You just turn it on and use it because you own the device.

986
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:39,460
In fact, Ting's perfectly happy if you just want to use them as a mobile ISP or make phone

987
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,260
calls all day long.

988
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:44,660
And of course, you can have multiple devices, it's just $6 per device.

989
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:48,780
Fact, too, is if you have multiple devices, it's a great way to save money.

990
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:52,360
It's a fantastic way because each device is only paying for your usage.

991
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,220
So your heavy talkers just pay for their talk, but the folks like myself who don't use a

992
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:59,380
lot of actual phone minutes, you don't end up paying for those people.

993
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:03,260
It works so well, we have a couple of phones here for the Jupiter Broadcasting crew, and

994
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:04,260
it's fantastic.

995
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:08,660
It's a perfect fit for us, and there's no way any other value would work for us.

996
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:12,900
It's perfect for us, but I think what really, at the end of the day, matters is it's super

997
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:16,420
easy for us to manage and keep track of exactly where we're at.

998
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:21,180
Ting Matches, they're an awesome online dashboard that gives you a clear indication of where

999
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,180
your bill is.

1000
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:25,820
You can turn services on and off, deactivate, activate phones.

1001
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:30,620
I've bought several phones from Ting all through the dashboard, all activated, deactivated

1002
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:31,620
phones through them.

1003
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:36,800
I can set up a call forwarding my voicemail options, and if I ever get stuck, Ting has

1004
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:44,140
no hold customer support at 1-855-TING-FTW, anytime between 8 PM and 8 AM, and a real person

1005
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:45,140
answers the phone.

1006
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:49,380
They've also got help.ting.com and an awesome blog where they're posting stuff all the time

1007
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:52,980
to get you updated on what the Ting crew is up to, apps you might want to check out, ways

1008
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:56,940
to save money, all kinds of things, events, giveaways, they all have that at the Ting

1009
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:57,940
blog.

1010
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:02,860
Start by going to linux.ting.com, see what I'm talking about, get that $25 credit.

1011
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:04,560
That paid for more than my first month.

1012
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,340
That gives you an idea of the kind of value you can get, and check out that savings calculator.

1013
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:12,180
Go to linux.ting.com, click what would you save, put your current bill in there, and

1014
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,180
here's a tip.

1015
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:16,680
Put what you're actually using right now, so the actual data, minutes, and text that

1016
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,000
you're sending, and look at the difference.

1017
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,020
For me, it's like $2,000 every two years.

1018
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:27,060
It's a new laptop every two years just by switching to Ting, linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com,

1019
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:31,460
and a really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

1020
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,460
Love it.

1021
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,980
My mobile phone provider for well over a year now, Matt's too.

1022
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:41,100
So coming up in just a few short weeks, I wanted to mention too, we're going to do another

1023
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,100
community review.

1024
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,260
So if you'd like to be involved with that, go over to the show notes.

1025
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:45,740
We have a form you can fill out.

1026
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:49,020
If you want to be drafted to do one of our community reviews, we'd love to hear from

1027
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,020
you.

1028
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,620
Go to the show notes for Linux Unplugged, scroll down towards the bottom.

1029
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:56,700
You'll see the Jupiter Colony review draft, and just fill that out there, and we'll be

1030
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,580
calling on more of you guys.

1031
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,420
And Mumbroom, if you guys have more thoughts on Chaos, save it for the post show.

1032
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:03,620
We'll get to that in just a little bit.

1033
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:09,500
I wanted to just mention before we run too that I'm planning to go to OSCON in two weeks.

1034
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,740
I'll probably be there July 22nd to the 23rd if all scheduling goes as planned.

1035
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:20,740
OSCON 2014 runs from July 20th to the 24th, 2014 in Portland, Oregon.

1036
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:24,420
And I'm going to be there if we're right dab, boom, in the middle of it if all of our timing

1037
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,420
works out.

1038
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,420
And I'd like to know if you're going to be there too.

1039
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:30,500
We could do a little meetup, maybe have some beers, eat some burgers, high five, fist bump,

1040
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,500
whatever you'd like to do.

1041
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,500
Talk about Linux.

1042
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:36,820
Just make sure you call it GNU slash Linux when you are talking to me in person.

1043
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:39,380
I don't care about it on the internet, but if you're talking to me in person, you better

1044
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:41,300
have GNU slash in that name.

1045
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:45,380
OSCON coming up in two weeks, I'll be there July 22nd and 23rd if all goes as planned.

1046
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,260
I think the 23rd?

1047
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,940
It's all kind of up in the air, but I might finalize some of my plans depending on what

1048
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,140
I hear from you guys.

1049
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,900
So leave us a comment in the feedback thread if you're going to be there.

1050
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:59,860
And then last but not least, a little piece of business from the community.

1051
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,980
I'd love to get your own runs Linux again.

1052
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,340
I've made a call out for these from time to time.

1053
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,740
I haven't made one in a while.

1054
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:08,600
I'd really like to get your runs Linux.

1055
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:12,140
Now I'd like to have a picture, and even better, a video if possible.

1056
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:16,340
I know that's asking a lot, but we feature right at the beginning of the Linux action

1057
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,700
show every single week, so I'd like to give it a splash.

1058
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19,700
Make it nice.

1059
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:20,700
Make it entertaining for the folks.

1060
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:23,540
And I'd love to get communities runs Linux.

1061
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:24,880
Could be your desktop.

1062
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,780
Could be something a little more inventive than that.

1063
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,340
Whatever it is, here's how you do it.

1064
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:34,300
Take a picture, record a video if possible, and write up a brief description, and then

1065
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:35,300
send it into the show.

1066
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:38,740
You can go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact, or if it's awesome, just submit it

1067
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:42,220
right to the Linux action show subreddit, and the community will vote it up so we can

1068
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,420
see that.

1069
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:46,240
If you do a video, which I would really, really, really love.

1070
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:51,380
If you do a video of your runs Linux, upload it to YouTube and just give us the link.

1071
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,180
Now you don't have to send us a big video file.

1072
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:56,920
And that makes it a lot easier to submit to the subreddit as well because it previews

1073
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,900
the thumbnail and all that kind of stuff.

1074
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,540
So I'd love to get your runs Linux.

1075
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:03,180
We're going to do runs Linux from the people if I can get enough of these.

1076
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:07,580
I'd like to get your guys' contributions and see what you're doing with your Linux.

1077
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:11,100
It's not a Fosho award show quite, but it's still kind of fun.

1078
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:15,020
And last but not least, go check out Tech Talk today over at jupyterbroadcasting.com,

1079
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:19,520
our brand new technology talk show Monday through Thursday.

1080
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,920
How crazy is that?

1081
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,260
And you can also show up live for that as well and hang out with us.

1082
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:24,260
We love that.

1083
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:25,380
Man, that's a lot of stuff.

1084
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,340
So we'd love to hear from you.

1085
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:29,840
Let us know what you think about those things, and join us next week.

1086
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,500
We do Linux Unplugged every single freaking Tuesday over at jupyterbroadcasting.com, 2

1087
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,940
PM Pacific over at jblive.tv, jblive.info.

1088
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:39,960
And of course, you can email us.

1089
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,040
Just go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com, click that contact link, or join us in the feedback

1090
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,040
thread or on the subreddit.

1091
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,500
We'd like to get it there too.

1092
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,100
And don't forget about the review draft and OSCON.

1093
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,140
A lot of stuff I've asked from you guys.

1094
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,380
It's a busy week for you.

1095
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,740
I hope you're prepared for all that homework.

1096
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:55,740
I think you can do it.

1097
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:56,740
I trust you.

1098
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:57,740
I think you can do it.

1099
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:58,740
We're coming up to episode 50 soon.

1100
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,740
So stay tuned.

1101
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:04,000
There might be a few surprises in the works, maybe even starting this week.

1102
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
You never know.

1103
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
All right, everyone.

1104
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,100
Well, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1105
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,100
Be sure you join us next Tuesday.

1106
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,780
And if we don't see you on Tuesday, we'll see you on Sunday for the Linux Action Show.

1107
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,740
We've got a big show coming up.

1108
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:42,580
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1109
01:13:43,740 --> 01:14:03,740
Mumble Room, thanks, you guys.

1110
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:04,740
Great review.

1111
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:08,060
Any closing thoughts on the chaos now that we're in the post-show?

1112
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:11,500
It sounds like chaos was chaos to install.

1113
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:12,500
Yeah.

1114
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,260
Yeah, I was about to say, when he said it was oxymoron, I was like, it's actually kind

1115
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:22,420
of an apt, a great way to say that it's a little chaotic.

1116
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:26,580
So yeah, well, they're working on something, but it's just like with a small team and stuff.

1117
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,780
It's going to take a long time to get there.

1118
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:33,460
I heard it's like KDU project always in flux and then chaos.

1119
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,460
Wow.

1120
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:38,460
I think it's wasted effort.

1121
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:39,620
I'm not going to do it, dude.

1122
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,620
I'm not going to do it.

1123
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:41,620
You can't get me.

1124
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:42,620
You can't get me.

1125
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:43,620
You can't get me.

1126
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:44,620
I think it's wasted effort.

1127
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:45,620
God dang it.

1128
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,620
Yeah.

1129
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:48,820
Sounds like the review went well.

1130
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,820
I expected Popey to bring out the knives a little more and start stabbing, but he kept

1131
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:53,820
it dialed in.

1132
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:57,740
Well, I did that last week and I got beaten up on the subreddit.

1133
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:58,740
You're a car-e-fueling.

1134
01:14:58,740 --> 01:14:59,740
Yeah, you're right.

1135
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:07,500
I just don't see the point when you don't include or allow 32-bit applications.

1136
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,940
That does not make any sense whatsoever for a user.

1137
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,940
It's because 32-bit sucks.

1138
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:13,940
Screw that.

1139
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:14,940
I actually like 64.

1140
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:15,940
I don't want to do 32-bit.

1141
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:16,940
Give me fucking 256.

1142
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:17,940
The bigger the better, baby.

1143
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:18,940
Give me a frigging Fi.

1144
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:19,940
A frigging Fi co-processor or some shit.

1145
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:20,940
All right, Eric.

1146
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:21,940
How are you doing?

1147
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:22,940
Did you survive?

1148
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:23,940
What happened to you last night?

1149
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:41,940
So my appendix decided it wanted to say, F you, bye-bye.

1150
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:42,940
Oh, heck.

1151
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:43,940
Are you okay?

1152
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:44,940
Yeah.

1153
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,940
Yeah.

1154
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:47,940
Well, I just got home from the hospital.

1155
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:51,780
They removed my appendix laparoscopically.

1156
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:56,620
Right now I'm actually doing okay and a little pain from the incision, but otherwise I'm

1157
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:57,620
fine.

1158
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:58,620
Did they give you any good drugs?

1159
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,620
Dude, I got hydros.

1160
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:00,620
That'll do.

1161
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:01,620
That'll do.

1162
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:02,620
Okay.

1163
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:08,060
So is anybody going to keep running chaos after today?

1164
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:09,060
No.

1165
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,060
No.

1166
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:11,060
No.

1167
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:12,060
I will not.

1168
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,060
Do we have...

1169
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,060
Do we already have some...

1170
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:15,060
Oh, go ahead.

1171
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:22,380
My biggest problem with it was it is super focused and very geared towards a specific

1172
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:28,120
set of applications, which is good on the one hand, but on the other hand, it means

1173
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:32,180
that there's fewer packages available in the repositories compared to Arch.

1174
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:37,400
And that even includes some really useful command line shell utilities that you would

1175
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,260
just install because it's just part of your standard tool bag.

1176
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:44,860
And it was really frustrating to say, right, now I've got to go and find the source code

1177
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:48,740
for this because the AUR doesn't work properly.

1178
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:54,020
And then you find yourself looking at it and you're thinking, well, Anturgus' installer

1179
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:55,820
is far superior.

1180
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,820
They have KDE as an option.

1181
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:01,660
And then you've got the entire Arch package repository at your disposal after the fact.

1182
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:07,020
So why wouldn't you just go to Anturgus and tweak the theming?

1183
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:10,740
Or if you don't want to use Arch, just use Chakra, or there's another one called Freeble

1184
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:15,300
ware, too, that's been around for quite a while.

1185
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,300
Yeah, that's a good point.

1186
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,300
Yeah.

1187
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,300
Frugalwares.

1188
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,300
Yeah.

1189
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,300
That's not so great either.

1190
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,300
Have you read that recently?

1191
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,300
How do you use Frugalware and Forever?

1192
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,740
They've been around for quite a while.

1193
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:27,900
So do we already have an idea kicking around for the next distro we're going to do a community

1194
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:28,900
review of?

1195
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:29,900
I'm loving it.

1196
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,100
I think we should do another one.

1197
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,900
What about Calculate?

1198
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,660
Well, it hasn't been officially decided on, no.

1199
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:37,660
Okay.

1200
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:38,660
We've got a couple ideas, though.

1201
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:39,660
Yeah, we have some ideas.

1202
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:40,660
Okay.

1203
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,900
We're going to announce it soon, so people can get on board.

1204
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,140
Can I toss an idea into the hat?

1205
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:48,580
I've never run this distro, but I heard some friends review it a couple of months back.

1206
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,580
I think it's Semplice or Simplice.

1207
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:51,580
Simplice, yeah.

1208
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:52,580
Simplice Linux.

1209
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:53,580
Yeah.

1210
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:54,580
They really raved about it.

1211
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:59,100
So if you want to pick one that might actually get some positive feedback, it might be worth

1212
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:00,100
tossing that in the hat.

1213
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,380
I actually do like Simplice.

1214
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:03,740
Linux BBQ is another idea.

1215
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,740
I like that one.

1216
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:05,740
That's almost one I want to do.

1217
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:06,740
Yeah.

1218
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,220
We're going to need like six months to review that one, though.

1219
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,980
Because we've got like 80 window managers and desktops.

1220
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:11,980
That's true.

1221
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:12,980
All right.

1222
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:13,980
That's true.

1223
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,700
Well, I mean, Linux BBQ is actually kind of easy, because it's more designed to be like

1224
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:19,980
a distro to be played with, not necessarily actually be used.

1225
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:23,700
So they don't even want you to install it ever.

1226
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,700
So it could be easier in that sense.

1227
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,820
It definitely fills a need, though, because some of those tiling window managers I've

1228
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:32,300
never used, and I'm thinking, yeah, you know, one weekend I'm just going to fire that up

1229
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,300
and have a good old play.

1230
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:38,100
But they don't do anything to them, so it's just the default setup, so that's what I want

1231
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,100
to do.

1232
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,100
Yeah.

1233
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,100
That's the benefit.

1234
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:42,100
That's what you want.

1235
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:45,740
If you're going to learn these things, you need to start with a blank canvas and then,

1236
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:49,180
you know, figure out how they're put together and what you can do with them.

1237
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,180
All right.

1238
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:52,300
So Chaos Theory is our current leading title.

1239
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,300
You guys like Chaos Theory?

1240
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:54,300
I like that.

1241
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,300
That is perfect.

1242
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,300
Okay.

1243
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,300
All right.

1244
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,300
Yeah.

1245
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,300
Okay.

1246
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,300
Very good.

1247
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,300
Well, that was fun.

1248
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,580
It's interesting, too, to hear your guys' thoughts on it, because I tried out Chaos

1249
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:05,580
before.

1250
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:09,300
I made it a spotlight one time or something like that on last, and so I went through the

1251
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:13,540
installer once before and kicked the tires for a couple of hours, and I remember thinking

1252
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:17,380
a lot of the things that you guys thought, so it's interesting to, I don't know, validating

1253
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:21,340
is the right word, but it's like, okay, yeah, that thing that bugged me also bugged three,

1254
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,340
four other people.

1255
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:25,460
So it's like, I'm not totally OCD.

1256
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:31,300
Maybe it gives you like a disconnect so it's not you bashing it as well.

1257
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,300
Yeah.

1258
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,300
I'll play good cop.

1259
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,300
Sure.

1260
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,940
Chaos hasn't been around for that long, though, has it?

1261
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:38,580
The only one that's been around for a couple months.

1262
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:39,580
No, no, because-

1263
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,580
Back in the last year, I think, wasn't it?

1264
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:42,580
Yeah.

1265
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:43,580
Yeah.

1266
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,580
I think I covered them almost six months ago or more.

1267
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:45,580
I can't remember.

1268
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,580
But we didn't do a full review, so.

1269
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:47,580
Oh, gosh.

1270
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:48,580
I thought it was newer than that.

1271
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:49,580
It moves so fast.

1272
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,580
Yeah.

1273
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:51,580
All right.

1274
01:19:51,580 --> 01:20:06,580
Well, all you jerks go back to watching your sports ball.
