WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
Since you a web-based IRC client. Oh you did. Where did you send that to me? Oh, oh in the slacks

00:06.320 --> 00:08.920
Oh, okay, speaking of slack speaking of slack

00:12.600 --> 00:16.000
Oh jeez no not that oh no not that not

00:17.820 --> 00:23.480
Anything but the Gibson I just actually with full Gibson just for a second full Gibson

00:23.480 --> 00:27.800
So what is this West what is this? Oh, a

00:28.520 --> 00:34.600
Self-hosted web IRC let it speak for itself. Hmm. Yeah, so this is called shout a self-hosted web IRC client

00:34.600 --> 00:36.800
That's pretty cool. Always connected shout never sleeps

00:36.800 --> 00:40.880
Just sign in and pick up where you left off the client works smoothly on every desktop smartphone and tablet

00:41.080 --> 00:43.520
Shout is open source and licensed under MIT

00:44.200 --> 00:49.120
This is exactly exactly what I was talking about West. Let's say we got a demo right here. Let's try it out. Yeah

00:49.120 --> 00:55.560
So let's call did now your name is gonna be Chris demo. Okay guys, don't be a jerk. Okay, don't don't troll me

00:55.560 --> 01:01.440
Okay, so oh, oh, they won't let me change the server. Oh, yes, they will Willie. Nope. I can't change the server

01:02.080 --> 01:05.040
Well, okay. We'll just go then I was gonna try to connect to geek shed

01:06.160 --> 01:07.840
you know, this is

01:07.840 --> 01:13.280
This is pretty plain, but it's quite plain. Yeah, is it is it configurable?

01:14.480 --> 01:17.520
Here's the thing. I'm gonna go ahead and show you what it looks like

01:17.520 --> 01:24.120
Here we go. Change sessions show join show parts. I like that. I like that. You can turn that off. That's cool

01:24.320 --> 01:27.720
Show quits. I don't need any of that enabled colored nix. I like that. I

01:28.720 --> 01:30.720
Enable notifications do not want that

01:31.000 --> 01:36.620
Okay, so it's got some configuration options, but the one thing it doesn't let you configure is the look of it. Apparently

01:37.120 --> 01:40.520
It's pretty stark. I mean would be nice, but it's almost doable

01:40.720 --> 01:41.320
You know

01:41.320 --> 01:43.320
I think I'm gonna give it a I think I'm gonna give it a try

01:43.320 --> 01:50.280
Because I was looking at IRC cloud and this is I'm liking this so self-hosted web IRC client shout. Thanks Wes. Good find

01:50.280 --> 01:54.160
How did you find that? I think that is a good find found it somewhere laying on the Internet

01:54.160 --> 01:59.760
I don't know just laying around laying around that crazy. You know, I'm I should be making use of that

01:59.760 --> 02:03.200
I did something else with a web IRC thingy today and

02:03.840 --> 02:09.360
I'm gonna replace it with this. What a web IRC thing. Does anyone tell me what was it? What was it? Oh

02:09.360 --> 02:14.960
I said, well, I guess it's very oh, it's awkward. I can't I can't say oh

02:15.800 --> 02:23.240
Was a proprietary garbage it was wasn't it? No, no. No, it's it's for another podcast. I've been always another podcasts website a

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Facelift

02:27.240 --> 02:30.440
This isn't no, so this isn't IRC client you embed in the website

02:31.400 --> 02:36.640
This is a web based IRC client. That's always connected that you bring up in your web browser

02:36.640 --> 02:40.920
Yeah, no, that's that would be better than what I've done today

02:44.240 --> 02:46.240
I'll put a link in the in the show notes

02:48.200 --> 02:52.960
This is Linux unplugged episode 130 for February 2nd 2016

02:52.960 --> 02:54.960
You

03:05.120 --> 03:11.920
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show and it's Jones and for a new rig. My name is Chris

03:11.920 --> 03:13.440
My name is Wes. I don't know Wes

03:13.440 --> 03:18.040
Maybe it's because before every show Wimpy gives me a hard time about the fact that my that has something to deal with it

03:18.040 --> 03:22.680
That might be stoking the flames as they say well coming up on today's episode of the unplugged show

03:22.680 --> 03:29.800
We're not talking about my drama. No. No, we actually have a great show coming up for you on this week some really interesting updates

03:29.800 --> 03:33.240
We're gonna spend a little more time than usual going through some big stories that have come up

03:33.440 --> 03:35.520
Since the Linux action show was on the air

03:35.520 --> 03:40.800
We have a lot to cover up on and then we'll talk about this Linux command that's getting blamed for bricking laptops

03:40.800 --> 03:47.480
Even when you're not running away. Yeah, I love these controversies that we just seem to fall into we'll do a quick review of tails

03:47.960 --> 03:49.480
2.0

03:49.480 --> 03:53.560
They say it's Edward Snowden's always of choice Wes has got it loaded right here

03:53.560 --> 03:59.040
He's gonna give us his take and some of the challenges he ran into and then later on in the show is Linux mint drunk

03:59.040 --> 04:00.220
with power

04:00.220 --> 04:04.520
What the heck is X apps? I know I I we got to talk about this

04:04.520 --> 04:11.520
Maybe they are brilliant or maybe they're going off into the weeds Linux mint is introducing its own suite of applications

04:11.920 --> 04:16.120
We'll talk about that in the show today. I got it. I just got to get your guys's take on that

04:16.120 --> 04:19.600
I gotta know I gotta know and then did you hear the news?

04:20.240 --> 04:22.160
Dell is

04:22.160 --> 04:26.680
making their own Linux what Dell is making their own Linux and

04:28.920 --> 04:30.920
You're not gonna believe the name

04:31.320 --> 04:35.800
Do you have a guess what it is? Do you know what it is? No, I don't you don't I'm not telling anyone

04:35.800 --> 04:37.480
No, no, I if you have a guess

04:37.480 --> 04:40.720
I would love to hear your guess as to what you think Dell is gonna name them

04:40.720 --> 04:43.280
We're gonna talk about it later in the show, but I think we give away the name now

04:43.280 --> 04:49.280
I think cuz it's so great. It's so great. No, I don't know. Should I not say should we wait?

04:49.280 --> 04:54.520
Okay, we'll wait don't say chat room. Don't say don't say we'll make everybody wait till the end of the show

04:54.720 --> 04:59.200
But you're not gonna believe the name of of does links. Don't say it. Don't say it

04:59.200 --> 05:02.680
Jerem we have so much to get into but before we do that West, you know

05:02.680 --> 05:08.200
We got to talk about because it's become a tradition now just sort of accidentally on the show is the beer we're drinking

05:08.200 --> 05:12.040
Yes, it has and I like you. So you heard me complaining and moaning on the

05:12.040 --> 05:17.440
Last as you do as I do I was beer desperate and I went and I grabbed this coffee beer

05:17.440 --> 05:20.400
Which actually was delicious by stone IPA or by stone?

05:21.200 --> 05:26.320
This however is something completely different. This is a local Washington brew where so I doubt they'll be able to

05:26.680 --> 05:30.600
To drink this so they'll just have to drink vicariously through us. How do you suppose you say that coal?

05:31.320 --> 05:33.320
Colchon, I believe Colchon

05:35.320 --> 05:40.040
You're probably absolutely right so this is their this is their red ale and

05:40.040 --> 05:47.160
It's actually it's it's not it's surprisingly good. It's not amazing, but it's surprisingly good. It's easy drinking on the show

05:47.800 --> 05:52.660
You know what? It matches the weather. It's very nice out. It sure is kind of clean and crisp out

05:52.700 --> 05:56.440
So there you go. I could almost be spring that almost like it's teasing us

05:56.440 --> 06:00.860
So that is our beverage of choice today while we're getting started now, let's get into the show

06:00.860 --> 06:04.240
Let's bring in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mumble room

06:04.840 --> 06:06.840
freedom

06:06.840 --> 06:11.720
Hello, I like it. I like it. Yeah, it's fired up today for a good show

06:11.720 --> 06:16.160
Well, so let's get started with some updates. We have a little bit of a birthday party

06:16.160 --> 06:18.320
I'd play the jingle but it'll get us taken down on YouTube

06:19.260 --> 06:21.100
15 years of

06:21.100 --> 06:28.800
VLC and I think actually specifically it's 15 years since VLC went GPO. Whoa. Yeah, can you believe that you know VLC?

06:30.020 --> 06:35.360
Everybody has a VLC trick right like you have anything like you use VLC for that maybe is a little unconventional

06:35.360 --> 06:40.100
Well, I mostly I just I do stream it every every which way. Yeah when possible

06:40.100 --> 06:46.460
I my favorite is I take our TSP our TMP streams a lot of the television networks

06:46.760 --> 06:50.120
Use these for their back-end streaming between each other and if you can find them

06:50.920 --> 06:55.920
You can use them to get the raw feed and then you can record it which is great for unfiltered

06:55.920 --> 07:01.440
And so you can use VLC to read it right to an MKB file with perfect, you know x264, whatever your codec

07:01.440 --> 07:03.480
It could be Vorbis and Theora, whatever

07:03.480 --> 07:07.400
And it is I mean that's what I use it for. I know a lot of people. Oh, oh

07:09.600 --> 07:12.320
We use it here in studio to send

07:12.760 --> 07:17.400
Where as you can see over there on that screen we have VLC that is playing reruns over there

07:17.400 --> 07:21.000
Yep, and then we have OBS run this so that's on an arch desktop

07:21.160 --> 07:28.380
We have OBS that is taking that VLC window and recapturing it and sending it as an RTSP stream back over to

07:28.380 --> 07:34.100
This machine to run as reruns and I can tune into that stream using VLC from any computer in the studio

07:34.100 --> 07:37.620
And I can check on what's going on in the live stream just by doing that. It's really cool

07:37.620 --> 07:42.080
I did that over the holidays. I set up a repeating Star Wars stream for some of my friends

07:42.140 --> 07:48.900
You know before before the movie came out with the VLC up on a droplet and your password protected with nginx

07:48.900 --> 07:54.940
You just have to sign in and we'll see there and that's awesome. That sounds like a segment. That is super cool. Yeah

07:54.940 --> 08:00.100
So congratulations to VLC 15 freaking years. What would we do without you now Wimpy?

08:00.100 --> 08:03.960
Have you had a chance to try out them beautiful blu-rays in VLC?

08:04.900 --> 08:11.780
Just recently I have yeah, I've got blu-rays playing in VLC. How are you? How does the encryption work in that setup?

08:12.940 --> 08:15.560
So you need a few bits and pieces. There's lib

08:16.420 --> 08:21.660
AACS which does the decryption stuff and there's two ways of doing it my old

08:21.660 --> 08:26.600
Desktop workstation. I patched the firmware to in the blu-ray drive

08:30.060 --> 08:35.060
Did you know you had to get this blu-ray player? Yeah, I've had it for donkey's years

08:37.700 --> 08:44.660
No, no, I've had this since blu-ray was new so it's very old and that's what I've been using to

08:44.980 --> 08:49.700
Dump my blu-ray discs into plex for the longest time

08:49.700 --> 08:56.300
But it died about a week or so ago. So I've got a new blue USB 3 blu-ray drive and

08:57.260 --> 09:01.120
I needed to dump the blu-rays, you know with make MKV

09:01.120 --> 09:05.360
So I needed to do that with the way where you get the key DB file and all those bits

09:05.360 --> 09:08.180
And then I thought well, I wonder if you can get them playing as well

09:08.180 --> 09:11.700
So I've been working on that for a bantu mate and that's all all going now

09:12.580 --> 09:13.620
that

09:13.620 --> 09:16.180
Yeah, I met make MKV man. That's great, too. So

09:16.180 --> 09:21.340
Yeah, also just sort of related. I also just want to give props to VLC

09:21.380 --> 09:28.780
It has become such a badass on Android and the VLC iOS app is actually pretty great

09:28.780 --> 09:32.020
It's great. Yeah, and I can't believe this either

09:32.020 --> 09:37.140
But they have a VLC has an Apple TV app and when one of the things that the Apple TV app can do

09:37.140 --> 09:38.900
I have not tried this

09:38.900 --> 09:43.460
But one of the things the Apple TV app can do is it sets the Apple TV up as a media server

09:43.460 --> 09:47.620
So you can send any video stream to the Apple TV using VLC

09:47.620 --> 09:52.700
I know that Chromecast support is coming that I mean it is so the Android app is great

09:52.700 --> 09:56.220
The Android TV app is great. The Apple TV app sounds cool. I know the

09:56.780 --> 09:59.060
Really, so they've they've been able to sort of

10:00.500 --> 10:04.020
Keep up and they're 15 years old. This is really cool

10:04.740 --> 10:10.660
So yeah, there you go. I five years before it was called VLC. It was called Network 2000

10:10.660 --> 10:12.660
It's called Network 2000

10:13.980 --> 10:19.940
So never been the best with names no that doesn't matter because it turns into a Christmas code that is one of my favorite things

10:19.940 --> 10:21.900
Okay, I'm hoping somebody in the mumble room

10:21.900 --> 10:27.660
I saved this story just for unplugged because I'm hoping somebody in the mumble room knows more than I do about the new

10:27.660 --> 10:32.220
Pac-man that was released Pac-man version 5.0 came out and

10:32.740 --> 10:36.020
I guess here's what I know that's new about it, but I don't know much

10:36.020 --> 10:41.540
Pac-man 5.0 is finally here after many months of development during which maintainers managed to add a great number of new features such as support for

10:41.540 --> 10:43.060
running hooks

10:43.060 --> 10:45.700
Before and after transactions, which sounds pretty cool

10:46.740 --> 10:51.380
Pac-man 5.0 also ships with support for handling sim links to folders that have been replaced by a directory

10:51.620 --> 10:58.980
support for recording the package a variable in a local package database and the ability to print extra info for dependency errors and

10:59.620 --> 11:04.340
Support for comparing the internal versions of a package with a database where you can store your files

11:04.340 --> 11:09.940
You can store your files in a folder that contains the internal versions of a package with a database one after downloading it

11:10.740 --> 11:12.740
These all seem neat. Yeah

11:12.740 --> 11:17.860
Anybody in the mumble room have any more info about Pac-man 5.0. I know it's kind of a big deal

11:17.860 --> 11:22.660
But I don't really have I'll just start with using Pac-man is always a pleasure. I don't know

11:22.660 --> 11:28.420
It's just I'm very rarely unhappy with it. Yeah, and it just works. I guess my systems if it's out

11:28.420 --> 11:30.420
I guess my systems are upgraded. I didn't really notice

11:30.420 --> 11:36.020
So nobody has any comments on that. That's fine. We can move on from there quickly moving then to something that I bet people

11:36.020 --> 11:38.020
Do have some comments on

11:38.580 --> 11:44.180
Edward snowden's favorite distro tails 2.0 is out. That's what they that's what they get to market it now

11:44.420 --> 11:48.920
And they really push that uh, so a couple of things new about tails 2.0

11:49.620 --> 11:55.380
Lots of changes to the gnome shell environment debbie and 8 base, which pretty much means all the software has been upgraded under the hood

11:55.380 --> 12:01.860
Uh, you're using the gnome shell. It's in classic environment and you're sitting here right now wess

12:02.500 --> 12:04.740
with the new tails 2.0 on

12:05.540 --> 12:07.060
How's it going?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.220
It's actually working. It's actually working, isn't it? Yeah

12:09.860 --> 12:14.260
It's working. All right. Uh, so let's start there actually was a little bit challenging to get working

12:14.340 --> 12:18.660
Well admittedly I was trying to install it in a very handy way with grub 2's loopback support

12:18.740 --> 12:23.140
So you can just dump the iso file on a hard drive actually that works brilliantly totally supported

12:23.140 --> 12:24.420
um

12:24.420 --> 12:29.620
Although their live cd disables root permissions by default, which probably does make sense

12:30.420 --> 12:33.220
There's like an extra boot option. You can check to have that happen

12:34.340 --> 12:36.340
Okay, I have not been able to get that working

12:36.340 --> 12:41.380
So I believe you'll probably need to you may need to install it or set it up to boot just from the iso to get

12:41.460 --> 12:44.740
All of the options so i've not been able to set up the wireless

12:45.700 --> 12:47.700
But the gnome shell environment is nice

12:48.500 --> 12:51.540
What was with the error message you got about it not being compatible with your hardware?

12:51.540 --> 12:56.260
I'm not sure. It is like a little dell laptop here. So yeah, it doesn't have an ethernet port

12:56.340 --> 13:00.180
It just has wireless and you're not getting that error message now, or are you still getting that error message?

13:00.580 --> 13:02.580
That's a good question. I'm not sure

13:04.100 --> 13:07.780
So, I mean that was really kind of strange like when it was quite strange when he booted up

13:08.020 --> 13:12.180
He literally got an error message that said it's not compatible with your hardware just trying to get to the network settings

13:12.660 --> 13:15.620
Yeah, and uh, it was like a gtk air air message

13:16.260 --> 13:20.100
Really really strange, uh, but uh, you know, but they've got a lot of great built-in stuff

13:20.100 --> 13:24.500
They've got a tor browser. They've got an unsecure or unsafe browser. Do they have a bunch of great

13:25.060 --> 13:26.740
built-in stuff

13:26.740 --> 13:28.260
libre office

13:28.260 --> 13:29.700
p2v

13:29.700 --> 13:34.340
Life era. Yeah, I don't know about those things. Why the hell are these on my super secure distribution?

13:34.420 --> 13:39.060
Can you give me a single justification because you know what those sound like to me attack surfaces

13:40.420 --> 13:44.020
They sound like software that can have flaws. They sound like software that can be exploited sure

13:44.100 --> 13:49.460
They're not a super critical software, but why is anything that's not necessary on my security distribution?

13:49.460 --> 13:55.060
See I was gonna I was gonna say that but they probably need libre office because all those leaked nsa powerpoints lives

13:55.780 --> 14:02.500
Okay. No, I think what it is is they are setting themselves up as a full-time desktop distribution the switch to gnome shell

14:02.900 --> 14:06.740
The upgrade of libre office and p2v. I mean give me a break

14:07.300 --> 14:10.840
Also the switch to system d like they're coming up now as a desktop distribution

14:11.460 --> 14:13.380
That you can use if you're security-minded

14:13.380 --> 14:20.020
I don't believe the two things hold up. I think what makes tails secure is that you only use it when you're in right like

14:20.340 --> 14:22.260
Stealth mode when you need to be secure

14:22.260 --> 14:25.460
You can spin it up and throw it away and just because it just seems to me

14:25.940 --> 14:32.660
Reasonably so that the longer you use a desktop distribution the longer you make it more insecure the longer your passwords get cached on

14:32.660 --> 14:37.620
The hard drive the longer your your web history builds up the longer you have a piece of software

14:37.620 --> 14:42.820
You don't update or that a zero day vulnerability is available for for a stretch of time that you're not aware of

14:42.820 --> 14:44.820
Like there's so much more

14:45.860 --> 14:51.140
Exposure when you use a desktop full-time than when you just boot into it to do banking or buy your bitcoins or whatever

14:51.540 --> 14:54.740
Right, right. It's useful to not have as a real desktop environment

14:56.820 --> 15:03.460
Uh aco says that it's so that media creators can create with privacy. Yeah, but nobody's actually going to use p2v

15:04.740 --> 15:08.340
So there's not that's not really why I mean I don't mean to be dismissive

15:08.340 --> 15:12.980
But I just I don't that sounds that sounds like a really niche

15:14.100 --> 15:17.220
possible use case that probably doesn't actually happen

15:18.340 --> 15:20.740
And what it actually does is exposing everybody for editing

15:21.300 --> 15:26.900
Family trips but for witness relocation, it's so that isis can post their latest jihadi. John 2.0 videos

15:27.780 --> 15:29.140
That doesn't make any sense

15:29.140 --> 15:34.180
It's just that's such a edge case that it's not worth making the rest of the distribution more vulnerable

15:34.180 --> 15:37.860
I mean, this is supposed to be a security distribution. Am I missing something mumble room?

15:40.100 --> 15:44.260
I don't think so. Also, I don't think youtube creators are going to use this to

15:44.900 --> 15:47.060
To make their videos. Yeah

15:47.060 --> 15:49.060
Yeah, you will be happy to know

15:49.060 --> 15:51.300
High dpi displays are better supported. Yeah

15:52.020 --> 15:58.580
Yeah, go ahead. Sorry going. Oh, is this a live cd you'd be willing to uh boot into during black hat for example

15:58.740 --> 16:00.180
Yeah, exactly. This is yeah

16:00.180 --> 16:06.180
It's that kind of thing or or like I say when you're when you're doing your online bitcoin or stocks or whatever

16:06.420 --> 16:07.940
It does come with a bitcoin wallet

16:07.940 --> 16:10.740
Yeah, they do because that's something you can use it for or you know

16:10.820 --> 16:15.620
If you're going to communicate with a journalist for some purpose, maybe I mean, let's be honest legitimately

16:15.700 --> 16:21.620
You could be a savvy member of the us military witness something that you think somebody in the journalism

16:22.180 --> 16:28.420
Industry should know about and use tales to communicate with them and it would be a mistake to continue to use tales for other

16:28.420 --> 16:30.340
things yes, it would

16:30.340 --> 16:34.180
I just don't I mean, but good for them for the new release. I don't mean to crap on the new release

16:34.660 --> 16:36.260
uh

16:36.260 --> 16:38.820
They also are shipping the vivaldi browser with it

16:40.900 --> 16:44.020
Uh, which is weird and they got the tor browser, of course

16:44.980 --> 16:48.020
Uh and gnome shell, it seems reasonable in classic mode

16:48.580 --> 16:51.860
It's pretty straightforward hard to yeah, it's hard to miss anything that you have there

16:51.940 --> 16:55.860
Yeah, it's still a great distribution being based on debbie and eight. I think it's just a little confused

16:55.860 --> 17:00.020
Yeah, so what is your impression overall of just sort of does it feel like a debbie inbox to you?

17:00.020 --> 17:01.940
Does it feel like something different?

17:01.940 --> 17:06.580
Yeah speed is good speed is fine. Uh, I might try installing it in a vm later and just play with it there

17:06.980 --> 17:10.260
Yeah, that would be cool. Like a vm you could go into when you're doing certain things

17:10.660 --> 17:16.660
You know like your uh, like your big bitcoin exchange enterprise you got going on the side, which is hosted on github. Yes

17:16.820 --> 17:20.500
Well naturally naturally, hopefully it doesn't go down. That's a lot of that's a lot of income

17:20.500 --> 17:25.460
Um any closing thoughts on tails good pro

17:25.860 --> 17:30.740
Uh doesn't have to be related to them being a full-time distro anybody in there tried it before or is this one of those distros?

17:30.740 --> 17:32.740
We all talk about but nobody's using

17:34.100 --> 17:38.260
I've used it before been not for like a full desktop environment

17:38.340 --> 17:41.620
I've used it just you know, do some things and then you know

17:42.260 --> 17:45.220
You know just boot out of it to the regular os

17:46.100 --> 17:48.100
That sounds about right. Yeah, it sounds about right

17:48.100 --> 17:51.540
Uh, I would love to have somebody from the tails project come on the show. Yeah, that would be great

17:51.620 --> 17:56.740
Wouldn't that we have an open mumble room our virtual lug is open to all of you even windows users

17:57.540 --> 18:02.580
Even windows just don't say anything. We won't ask I mean probably sometimes we do

18:02.980 --> 18:07.640
So just say when they're on when their audio seems to be working really well, then we get suspicious

18:10.260 --> 18:12.260
I kid I can't

18:12.260 --> 18:17.540
Bitter much no, I just I'm just joking. I've never installed gnu slash linux. All right

18:17.620 --> 18:24.740
So before we move on, uh, there's something really big that has gotten a lot of headlines from snarky tech press about linux

18:26.420 --> 18:30.100
Brick and laptops and and and the headlines have been

18:30.980 --> 18:32.980
I actually did read this headline, uh

18:33.440 --> 18:36.660
Ubuntu can brick your laptop even if you run windows

18:37.300 --> 18:40.660
Isn't that a good one? Yeah. Wow. Yeah, I I thought that was pretty great

18:40.660 --> 18:41.620
so

18:41.620 --> 18:42.980
And i'm like, okay

18:42.980 --> 18:48.740
And it's right as del's about to announce a new uh, new developer edition of the xbs laptop, too

18:48.820 --> 18:50.420
Then we go come on guys

18:50.420 --> 18:54.820
Uh, so we'll tell you about what's going on there and what actually and actually how you can actually brick the laptop

18:55.060 --> 18:56.980
Now that is actually legitimately something you could do

18:56.980 --> 19:02.420
Uh, but first let me tell you about ting go to linux.ting.com to support this show and get yourself a 25 dollar discount

19:03.140 --> 19:04.500
discount

19:04.500 --> 19:10.820
Linux.ting.com. You can also get 25 in service credit if you have a compatible phone and you might because they got cma and gsm

19:11.060 --> 19:14.100
average monthly bill per device for ting 23 bucks

19:15.060 --> 19:20.740
Isn't that something linux.ting.com? You just pay for what you use. It's a flat six dollars for the phone line

19:21.380 --> 19:26.340
And then your usage on top of that I would suggest to go check a look at some of their devices so you can get an idea

19:26.740 --> 19:29.400
Uh, so this one right here the samsung m400

19:29.400 --> 19:33.820
47 dollars kiosara dura xt. This is the one that no has tried out for a bit

19:34.620 --> 19:38.540
47 he says the speaker on that thing is ridiculous and the battery life is ridiculous

19:38.940 --> 19:45.420
I myself because i'm a classy lady. I would probably upgrade to the ansetel one touch fling. It's new. It's got a camera

19:45.580 --> 19:50.620
It's got an I think it's oled on the front. It totally has a cpu in it. It's a feature phone

19:51.180 --> 19:54.220
And the more I the more I look at the smartphone landscape, I think geez

19:54.220 --> 20:00.140
63 dollars for an unlocked phone. I own that outright. No contract only pay for what I use that

20:00.700 --> 20:03.660
That's ridiculous. You can also get things like the motorola g

20:04.140 --> 20:06.060
Or go all the way up to the really nice phones

20:06.060 --> 20:13.660
In fact, like the blue studio 6 is a great deal for 181 bucks. You own these motorola g third gen 193 dollars unlocked

20:13.740 --> 20:17.680
It's yours. No contract. You only pay for what you use no early termination

20:17.680 --> 20:23.920
nothing like that a really good dashboard super fanatical customer support that rocks and

20:25.360 --> 20:30.000
Geeks, they're geeks too. In fact, they have a blog post up

20:31.080 --> 20:37.320
Watch the Super Bowl without table. Look at that. This is this is like I am NOT a sports ball guy, right?

20:37.520 --> 20:45.160
But I cannot avoid the Super Bowl hype. It's a good excuse for nothing else to have some great appetizers. Yeah, that's that's true

20:45.160 --> 20:48.760
Yeah, have great appetizers be judgy about the commercials

20:49.360 --> 20:53.160
And drink some beer. So Super Bowl 50. Yeah, you guys all know it's upon us

20:53.800 --> 21:00.520
And they have a great breakdown about ways you can watch it. Even if you're a cord cutter, which I think is pretty cool

21:00.520 --> 21:04.600
They also have some internet fiber services depending on your location. Go check them out. We had the

21:07.800 --> 21:12.880
Linux dot ting comm visiting their supports this show try out the savings calculator. See why I've been a customer for three years

21:12.880 --> 21:14.880
Linux dot ting

21:15.480 --> 21:21.760
Commit a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program. You guys are fantastic and thanks for the

21:22.640 --> 21:26.400
MiFi on the way down to back from scale. Yeah, that's great. Mm-hmm

21:26.720 --> 21:30.360
That's how I was able to listen to you and Noah do the unplugged show

21:31.240 --> 21:36.780
Legitimately though. Um, I'm this is I missed I missed about 30 minutes of the show

21:37.360 --> 21:41.260
Not because ting got disconnected but because at that point in time I was an organ

21:41.260 --> 21:46.840
Mm-hmm, and you know, you know, do you know about Oregon gas? I do know about Oregon. What's the deal about Oregon gas?

21:46.840 --> 21:49.760
What's the deal? Well, it's a it's a hazardous liquid. Yeah

21:51.120 --> 21:58.020
Trained and certified to handle so it's so funny you say this because so we get down to Oregon and we're gonna fill up the

21:58.020 --> 21:59.040
Lady, Jupiter

21:59.040 --> 22:03.260
We're almost down to scale right? I mean cuz we got a lot of California is the next the California is the neck

22:03.260 --> 22:08.520
Yeah, glory, ladies. Glory to lady Jupiter, California is the next state and I'm like, I'm gonna blow half a tank and

22:08.520 --> 22:13.440
If I need a boondock, I want to have enough fuel for my generator. So I'm figure we'll fill up

22:14.520 --> 22:16.040
pull off

22:16.040 --> 22:18.040
thing about Oregon is

22:18.120 --> 22:20.120
Like Wes was alluding to

22:20.280 --> 22:22.920
You are not allowed to fill your own gas up

22:23.160 --> 22:28.400
You can it is state law that somebody pumps your gas for you or your petrol or whatever you want to call it

22:28.400 --> 22:34.160
And so we get into a flying J which is designed for large vehicles

22:34.160 --> 22:39.440
Okay, and should have a high pump capacity we get into a flying J truck stop a truck stop

22:39.440 --> 22:41.720
Because lady Jupiter is big and we need a truck stop

22:41.720 --> 22:47.840
I pull in there I go over the ding ding and I spend five minutes lining this huge rig up with the pump

22:47.840 --> 22:50.920
Which wasn't big enough and I had to be pulled way into the parking lot

22:50.920 --> 22:56.400
I'm pulled way into the parking lot blocking the flow of traffic and I sit there five minutes go by

22:57.920 --> 23:01.240
Ten minutes go by oh boy 15 minutes go by

23:01.240 --> 23:05.760
20 minutes go by I'm getting pissed at this point cuz I'm waiting 20 minutes

23:05.760 --> 23:10.720
I'm like I could go out there and pump this gas myself, right and I'm sitting there at least I'm listening unplug

23:10.720 --> 23:14.280
So it's not all lost right 25 minutes go by I start the rig back up

23:14.280 --> 23:18.240
I put lady Jupiter in reverse I go over the the court again to make the thing ding

23:18.240 --> 23:24.200
I go back over the court again. I go back up again this huge motor back up over the court ding ding back up over the

23:24.200 --> 23:25.200
court ding ding

23:25.200 --> 23:28.240
So that way they hear like four times I do this, right and then I park it

23:28.240 --> 23:32.680
I turn it off and I go outside and I wait for the guy he go. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Yeah, we've been real busy

23:32.680 --> 23:37.560
Forgot sorry comes over there. It took it's a hundred gallon tank. It took forever

23:37.880 --> 23:39.840
It took 25 minutes to pump it

23:39.840 --> 23:44.480
So I think so not only to have to wait 25 minutes then took 25 minutes to fill it and I missed that whole part

23:44.480 --> 23:46.220
of the show

23:46.220 --> 23:51.480
So I made a declaration right there. No more fuel in Oregon. No more

23:51.480 --> 23:56.200
We drove through the rest of the one that did not stop again for fuel in Oregon

23:56.200 --> 24:00.440
I was not gonna put up with that crap. And so while we were sitting there in the chair like

24:01.480 --> 24:05.160
We're like, okay. Now we got to know is the state law. What is the reason that it is?

24:05.720 --> 24:09.120
2016 and we are not allowed to pump our own gas in Oregon

24:09.120 --> 24:15.040
What is the reason and so then we found like the whole controversy like there's a for it and against Oregon drama and the against

24:15.040 --> 24:16.840
It folks are like gas stinks

24:16.840 --> 24:21.000
It gets on you it makes your clothes smell and it's gonna kill a bunch of jobs

24:21.000 --> 24:25.480
And then the for people like it takes too much time. It was we fell into a whole controversy

24:25.480 --> 24:31.980
Trying to get our dinner. Are you guys split on opinions? Oh, no, we wanted to pump our own gas. I'll tell you but anyways

24:32.880 --> 24:36.880
Moving on from there. It's just a story from the road that didn't get get on camera because I was too grumpy

24:37.720 --> 24:42.840
So let's talk about this command that can permanently brick some laptops. It is actually a thing

24:42.840 --> 24:46.520
It is really a thing and some people are actually dumb enough to do this

24:46.520 --> 24:52.460
So what we're gonna have to cover it now because it's made controversy and I want to arm you with the knowledge to combat

24:52.460 --> 24:57.700
The controversy some fun may develop and we're gonna be the anti fun solution

24:57.700 --> 25:05.220
So as all things that are relevant and important to the Internet a user posted on the arch Linux forms. We're all great things start

25:06.300 --> 25:09.580
Back in January, which is still this month. I don't know why they wrote it like that

25:09.980 --> 25:13.500
Wondering why their laptop wouldn't boot at all after running the simple RM

25:14.300 --> 25:20.100
tack RF tack no dash preserve dash root slash so

25:20.100 --> 25:22.820
Delete the entire freaking root directory

25:23.340 --> 25:29.380
It's a fairly stupid thing to run such a command, but usually not destructive anything, but the Linux installation itself

25:31.020 --> 25:34.580
And I've done this to myself sure who hasn't spun up a VM just to see well

25:34.580 --> 25:39.900
How long will it keep kicking or a old install of like Red Hat 5 really mad at your friend?

25:39.900 --> 25:46.320
And and it was like the first thing you tried doing it. Anyways, however, it turns out on some MSI laptops

25:46.320 --> 25:53.400
It is possible to completely wipe the EFI boot partition from within Linux. So this is what's happening

25:54.040 --> 25:59.400
It completely wipes it at the directory that destroys that gets destroyed is at slash sys

25:59.840 --> 26:08.160
Firmware slash EFI slash EFI vars it stores information and scripts that the computer uses to boot using the modern EFI standard which

26:09.360 --> 26:12.640
Of course once you wipe that out, it's like not having a BIOS on your machine

26:12.640 --> 26:17.800
essentially and so because it's under a slash sys slash firmware slash EFI slash EFI bars

26:18.120 --> 26:22.020
When you delete everything under root, you are also deleting that right?

26:22.800 --> 26:24.800
and then it no longer boots a

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Thread discussing the issue

26:29.080 --> 26:35.280
The system to your repository on github is full of discussions between developers arguing the director where the EFI boot data stored should not be

26:35.520 --> 26:37.520
entirely writable

26:37.960 --> 26:40.720
How about just don't mount it writable? Yeah, that's not bad

26:40.720 --> 26:44.360
So far the issue appears to only affect MSI laptops

26:44.360 --> 26:48.920
But that's only because there are a handful of cases of it happening the wild few people are wild and brave and have tried on

26:48.920 --> 26:53.680
Their own machines. That's a good point. It could affect other machines, but who wants to be the person to try it?

26:54.280 --> 26:59.760
At how you know, I saw it. Have I told you my story? No, I was actually still in school

26:59.760 --> 27:02.760
so this was a really really long time ago now because I'm an old man and

27:03.440 --> 27:05.280
I

27:05.280 --> 27:08.200
sat down at a Red Hat machine that somebody had set up for me and

27:08.200 --> 27:14.240
I don't know why RMRF was a thing. I tried maybe somebody told me maybe it was in the bash history

27:14.240 --> 27:17.760
That might have been possible. I did RM dash RF slash

27:18.280 --> 27:21.600
And she was this it was this it was one in the computer lab

27:21.600 --> 27:25.780
So it was a school machine and I was logged in as root because why not?

27:26.200 --> 27:28.080
Somebody must have set me up looking back on it

27:28.080 --> 27:34.120
I wish I remembered because it was such a pivotal moment in my young computer history because I

27:34.120 --> 27:41.220
I remember watching the system fall apart completely degrade in front of me and I remember thinking to myself

27:42.140 --> 27:44.140
This is a badass OS

27:44.260 --> 27:49.500
It let me do that. It just let me delete itself and everything that's in RAM is still running

27:49.500 --> 27:56.340
I can still like cuz it was some old desktop environment and the windows that I thought open could still be used and I remember

27:56.340 --> 27:57.380
thinking

27:57.380 --> 28:03.740
This is something I want to learn like I something that lets me delete itself and then continues to run until I restart

28:03.740 --> 28:06.940
At least everything that was existing is like this is freaking impressive

28:06.940 --> 28:11.500
And that was really like so then later on when Linux was suggested as an alternative to NT

28:11.500 --> 28:16.220
I was like, let's give it a shot. That thing was cool. Yeah, it was like a real pivotal moment for me

28:16.620 --> 28:19.040
Wimpy you had a story that I wanted to hear

28:20.180 --> 28:24.740
well, I used to work for a Unix vendor back in the day and

28:25.780 --> 28:33.020
When there were the conferences, you know, and everyone's got all of their workstations out on the on the stands and everything

28:33.020 --> 28:39.780
We did used to go around and accidentally RM minus RF slash our competitors workstations

28:40.460 --> 28:42.460
Really?

28:45.180 --> 28:51.220
At lunchtime, you know when they're having a break just do that and reboot

28:52.340 --> 28:56.700
something kind of equivalent from the technical side is when you're using Linux terminal servers and

28:57.740 --> 29:01.100
the clients lose connection back to the terminal server

29:01.100 --> 29:07.060
They still have x11 and any applications that were loaded in RAM, but they've lost their root file system

29:07.060 --> 29:11.940
It's kind of the same effect and and what's actually really damn impressive and I haven't seen this for a couple of years

29:11.940 --> 29:15.860
But I did see it a couple of years ago is when when the internet connection or the network connection

29:16.020 --> 29:18.860
The LAN connection or Wi-Fi connection, whatever it is comes back online

29:19.220 --> 29:23.460
The clients just resume keep working like in any in just no big deal

29:23.460 --> 29:27.180
They guess there's yeah, there's some errors, but it's no big deal. It was it was like wow

29:27.180 --> 29:33.260
This is a really cool operating system. This is really neat and I remember like some stuff was even GPU accelerated and it still worked

29:33.780 --> 29:39.660
So yeah, yeah, there you go. There that is the that is the rumor this spring around. There's lots of news stories about it

29:40.220 --> 29:46.780
And I guess it is technically possible just don't it should be noted that a lot of this the EFI standard lets you do this

29:46.860 --> 29:51.620
It should work. It just may not be tested go figure was an arch user, right?

29:51.620 --> 29:59.020
Yeah, yeah handles and also some of some parts of the EFI system need to be mounted read write in order for the stuff

29:59.020 --> 30:00.220
to work

30:00.220 --> 30:03.460
Change the very long. Yeah at your next boot things like that. Yeah

30:04.420 --> 30:08.060
Yeah, that is a thing. That's a bit of a problem and it's probably gonna happen again

30:09.180 --> 30:13.060
Okay, so I don't really have any action to take on this myself

30:13.780 --> 30:19.780
Because I'm not on the right side of the pond, but if you are in London or in the area

30:19.780 --> 30:24.200
You might be able to make an impact on the future of the unity 8 desktop

30:25.200 --> 30:31.520
Canonical is posting on their social media accounts that they saw on Twitter g-plus and Facebook so far

30:31.840 --> 30:33.840
They're conducting a research

30:34.000 --> 30:38.040
And the research is a user experience research the studies about Ubuntu

30:38.040 --> 30:42.360
Applications developed by members of the Ubuntu Linux community for the next generation unity 8 user interface

30:42.840 --> 30:48.920
The research study is being led by Ting Ray Chang a user experience researcher at the Canonical or maybe it's yeah

30:48.920 --> 30:51.800
I think it's Chang and it's targeted mainly at Ubuntu or

30:53.000 --> 30:56.920
Fedora users yeah fedora users probably because gnome 3 I guess

30:58.080 --> 31:00.880
Yeah, swathpedia that speculates. They don't know why

31:01.520 --> 31:04.840
But anyways there, so they're gonna do some research and they'd love your help

31:04.840 --> 31:11.440
They're looking for two for participants in a research study on a community developed a unity 8 apps in this survey Canonical

31:11.440 --> 31:14.760
Would like to know what email terminal calendar diary and music after use as well

31:14.920 --> 31:17.480
So I have some links to this there's a survey you can find out

31:17.480 --> 31:20.200
and if you're in the area, they're gonna be doing a study at

31:20.920 --> 31:22.720
they have the

31:22.720 --> 31:26.960
Say it looks like it'll be about about an hour-long study, then there may be a cash incentive

31:26.960 --> 31:30.760
Oh, and you get to talk about Linux mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, so we'll have info about that

31:31.400 --> 31:33.400
the unity 8 desktop West

31:34.400 --> 31:39.080
Do you think they have to nail it when they first ship it as default or do you think there's gonna be?

31:39.280 --> 31:45.920
Capacity to let them improve do you do you think people are at a point where your premiere desktop can be a little undercooked?

31:45.920 --> 31:52.480
I mean it does keep happening. So maybe I think it'll go a lot a long ways if they do nail it

31:53.520 --> 31:57.480
Because people already using it installing it and if it just comes with like that's really first rate

31:57.480 --> 32:02.920
Then you know all the better. I think they do have staying power that if it's improved in a you know

32:02.920 --> 32:04.920
Pretty yeah quickly, then it'll be fine

32:05.240 --> 32:10.280
Micah 68 says I wish they could do the user study more openly than London, but at the same time

32:11.000 --> 32:12.440
What other?

32:12.440 --> 32:18.160
Linux distribution is doing actual real-world user studies that we know of I don't know of any other ones

32:18.480 --> 32:20.480
So at least they're actually doing some

32:22.400 --> 32:24.400
That is extremely

32:26.480 --> 32:29.440
New road trip, I I hope I hope

32:29.880 --> 32:34.600
Wimpy, what do you think? I'm curious to pick your brain as somebody who probably is gonna try it out

32:34.600 --> 32:36.900
How much do they have to nail this right out of the gate?

32:36.900 --> 32:42.260
Oh, you're asking the wrong person really aren't you but I'm very interested in participating in this

32:42.260 --> 32:45.640
So yes, I shall enroll and try and go along to it

32:46.660 --> 32:48.660
You're not gonna try it when they ship it

32:49.380 --> 32:51.380
Well, I'm already trying it. I'm already running

32:52.100 --> 32:59.660
The converged experience on my Nexus 4 and my Nexus 7 and I'm trying out all the new stuff and have are you really using?

32:59.660 --> 33:01.660
Are you really using it?

33:01.660 --> 33:09.180
I'm experimenting with it. But starting next month. I'm going to go for two months just using

33:10.300 --> 33:11.540
the

33:11.540 --> 33:17.620
Ubuntu touch on a phone in a tablet and I'm gonna actually turn off and set aside my Android phone really

33:17.620 --> 33:19.620
Are you gonna do you're gonna use the Nexus 4?

33:20.460 --> 33:23.420
Gonna use the Nexus 4 and an extra 7. Yeah

33:24.340 --> 33:29.620
So when when and when the new I did it last year and it didn't go so well

33:29.620 --> 33:33.700
I did it for one month last year and it was hard work and

33:34.220 --> 33:37.500
I'm doing it again one year on to see you know

33:37.500 --> 33:40.920
It kind of sounds like what your answer then is for a certain category of users

33:40.920 --> 33:45.280
They've already started they're getting close to nailing it now. So it's just gonna depend on who's using it

33:45.540 --> 33:48.100
It's improved an awful lot over the last year

33:48.460 --> 33:54.020
You know, I got a chance to play with it quite a bit at scale and I wasn't super impressed

33:54.020 --> 33:59.220
But I was playing with it on a Nexus 4 and I guess a lot of the canonical folks there are using it on a one-plus

33:59.220 --> 34:01.220
And getting much better

34:01.500 --> 34:02.940
Were you?

34:02.940 --> 34:08.220
Using it as a phone or were you using it as the converged just the phone. I was just experimenting with the phone

34:08.220 --> 34:11.260
There's a really there's a couple of great Jupiter broadcasting apps and I was playing

34:11.500 --> 34:14.220
Yeah, I was playing around with those and stuff like that

34:14.220 --> 34:17.100
But I haven't tried it on anything as powerful as the Nexus 7 or up

34:17.100 --> 34:19.740
They really all my experience has either been on the Nexus 5 or 4

34:20.620 --> 34:21.780
so

34:21.780 --> 34:28.460
I'm I'm gonna set out my criteria of what what I'm going to attempt to get get it to do and

34:28.460 --> 34:34.000
Work for me because there are a number of things that I need to do on a day-to-day basis with it as a phone

34:34.280 --> 34:36.740
but I think really the

34:37.760 --> 34:40.240
Convergence stuff is starting to become

34:41.060 --> 34:44.040
Like the silver bullet because it's really compelling

34:44.280 --> 34:52.160
It's quite amazing actually when you connect your Nexus 4 up and you realize this is a desktop and this is running off a phone

34:52.160 --> 34:53.820
It really is very good

34:53.820 --> 35:00.360
So yeah, if you haven't seen that you're really missing out on the whole point. I think I could see it

35:00.360 --> 35:05.820
I mean, I I do see the point of it. Yeah, I can see you know, it's something I have at home

35:05.820 --> 35:06.440
I bring it to work

35:06.440 --> 35:11.160
I hook it up and I have all my stuff there all my notes that I already had up on my text editor are still

35:11.160 --> 35:16.200
Up on my screen people are already moving to laptops that are you know, but today today for example

35:16.200 --> 35:19.040
They just got the full Chromium browser working. Oh

35:19.040 --> 35:23.080
Oh, that's a touch in the converged mode. So not you know

35:23.560 --> 35:28.560
I've sort of a full-blooded browser, which is that's really, you know important. I think

35:29.400 --> 35:32.880
Important step forward. It's a shame. Popey's not here. I think he must be busy

35:32.880 --> 35:37.040
But maybe another time you can pick his brains about all of this. He's much much closer to it than I am

35:37.040 --> 35:42.380
So how do you just stuff just an observer? What do you square the user between?

35:43.040 --> 35:44.320
So this is really interesting

35:44.320 --> 35:47.840
I find it fascinating that you're so following you're following this so closely on the cutting edge

35:47.840 --> 35:49.840
and then you're also

35:50.120 --> 35:53.680
You know behind Ubuntu Mate edition, which is sort of like this

35:54.360 --> 36:00.540
distribution that epitomizes the traditional desktop environment that is kind of so far away from convergence and mobile that

36:01.080 --> 36:05.680
So, how do you how do you slice that? Like what is it? Is it the different workloads?

36:05.680 --> 36:08.200
Is it different use cases? Where do you see that sort of lighting up?

36:08.200 --> 36:13.500
Or do you think maybe eventually everybody who's seeking out a Mate type desktop would eventually go for a converged device?

36:14.080 --> 36:15.600
well

36:15.600 --> 36:19.360
so many questions, so obviously I'm I

36:20.480 --> 36:22.720
am close to all the new

36:23.840 --> 36:29.900
innovations and advancements in the Linux community just because I work on Ubuntu Mate doesn't mean that I'm

36:30.640 --> 36:34.120
laser focused on on that paradigm

36:34.120 --> 36:40.360
I want to experience everything from the Linux world and learn what I can from all the different projects

36:40.360 --> 36:45.720
But you mean you really are investing a lot of your time and energy and life into one particular paradigm

36:46.520 --> 36:51.080
Yes, and that's mostly because as I've said before family

36:52.640 --> 37:00.000
Depend on having that computing platform, you know, and so that's really where it comes from and it's become popular in its own, right?

37:00.000 --> 37:02.800
So I will continue to support it and back it

37:03.000 --> 37:10.040
But for example, there was a guy at the weekend who had Ubuntu Mate running on a huddle tablet

37:10.040 --> 37:16.240
You've probably not heard of those but that's some the Tesco supermarket over here. Hmm make a line of tablets

37:16.240 --> 37:18.240
I don't really tablets and

37:18.240 --> 37:23.640
He's put Ubuntu Mate on it and I have to say it worked remarkably well and I was thinking to myself

37:23.640 --> 37:30.560
Hmm, we're just a few little user interface tweaks. This could be you know, really quite usable and another guy actually got

37:32.120 --> 37:37.600
The Mate desktop via an Ubuntu CH root running under Android's and

37:37.600 --> 37:39.680
Another one has got it running under

37:40.840 --> 37:47.560
Ubuntu touch as well. So it's interesting that this convergent stuff, you know canonical

37:47.560 --> 37:51.000
Er, you know pioneering this on their platform

37:51.800 --> 37:56.760
With their user interface, but already there are people in the community who are experiments

37:57.080 --> 37:59.640
Experimenting with other desktops and getting them to run under

38:00.440 --> 38:02.440
X mirror and what have you?

38:03.040 --> 38:05.040
and I'm not not sure that I

38:05.040 --> 38:09.120
I want to try and turn Mate into a touch

38:09.760 --> 38:11.760
Platform because that's a bit nuts, isn't it?

38:11.960 --> 38:17.780
but I'm certainly interested in experimenting with all of these touch devices and particularly Ubuntu because

38:19.920 --> 38:23.040
Android has become very entrenched in my life and I use it because

38:23.760 --> 38:27.200
it was the best option five years ago, but I

38:27.840 --> 38:32.840
I'm not I I don't want it to be the thing that I'm wedded to I very much feel that way too

38:32.840 --> 38:35.920
So I've put a lot of effort in the last six months

38:36.800 --> 38:43.600
Get getting to know Ubuntu touch and I've written a couple of apps for myself and I'm starting more and more to get familiar with

38:44.440 --> 38:46.840
snaps and mirror and XMir and

38:47.600 --> 38:51.660
That's something I'm definitely interested in in learning and doing more with

38:52.280 --> 38:58.480
In the coming year, but that's not to say Ubuntu Mate is gonna stop or go away that will continue on its merry way as well

38:58.480 --> 39:00.680
I I find it to be

39:00.680 --> 39:03.680
Exciting that it's actually getting so, you know

39:03.680 --> 39:08.600
We've talked about unity and convergence and all this stuff for it feels like three years now

39:08.600 --> 39:10.400
Yep, but being at scale

39:10.400 --> 39:16.360
I find it to be really exciting to be at scale playing with these devices and seeing real community apps created for like a telegram

39:16.360 --> 39:18.840
app like a jupyter broadcasting apps and

39:20.080 --> 39:25.960
Yeah, I was talking to Ryan from the mycroft project and he was there with his Ubuntu touch device and you know

39:25.960 --> 39:29.240
We're talking about the pros and cons of it and you know for the most part he does

39:29.240 --> 39:31.240
It and you know for the most part he likes it

39:31.920 --> 39:34.840
But when using his device, I could definitely see the performance

39:35.520 --> 39:40.900
Issues there and that's something I'm pretty hypersensitive to because I I just I have a very high expectation

39:41.400 --> 39:43.800
but if I you know if I could read

39:44.120 --> 39:48.760
If I could reconsider some of that stuff and if they could close the gap on some of that stuff

39:48.760 --> 39:54.080
It might just be right just right and when there's a phone that runs it very well and you can get it. I

39:54.080 --> 39:59.640
I liked the idea that was floated that to someone should take an Android device

40:00.280 --> 40:07.800
That was this far into its lifecycle as as the Ubuntu touch phone is now and compare the two and see where the two are

40:07.800 --> 40:11.240
And I was like, oh somebody could get me, you know a good idea of what hardware to use

40:11.240 --> 40:17.440
I would like to try that has a little review is where it's aware was Android at this point in its development lifecycle versus where

40:17.440 --> 40:20.920
Ubuntu touches well, it was sort of the gingerbread

40:20.920 --> 40:25.800
Stage, wasn't it? Would you consider this gingerbread or is this still more like the like the

40:27.160 --> 40:30.600
The well the Moto G or whatever. What was that? What was no not Moto G

40:30.600 --> 40:34.080
What was that first phone called the one that had a little roller on I can't remember now

40:34.800 --> 40:39.840
But it feels like because it's all since we've only gotten really one industry phone. It's like their first phone

40:40.800 --> 40:44.760
Well, if you're talking about, you know device launches, then yes, it's closer to that

40:44.760 --> 40:52.040
I thought you were referring to you know time of time incubating and being developed

40:53.040 --> 40:57.680
Yeah, I guess that that would be they'd have to figure out those ground rules. Do you want to go by that rule or hardware rules?

40:57.680 --> 41:03.240
Yeah, I think what you need to do is work out how many people Android had working how many people Google had working on Android

41:04.240 --> 41:11.720
Yeah, and then and then because what you actually work out from that is that actually Ubuntu are punching above their weight because they've got far far

41:11.720 --> 41:13.240
far fewer people

41:13.240 --> 41:20.760
Yes have made you know pretty much a full fully fledged mobile operating system that with the convergent story in

41:21.280 --> 41:23.960
Three years and I think that's pretty amazing

41:23.960 --> 41:28.400
Yeah, you know people are giving up into a hard time about it and saying it's not good enough yet

41:28.400 --> 41:29.800
And it's not quite ready

41:29.800 --> 41:36.200
But they've achieved such a lot so it can only get better from here because the foundations are pretty solid now

41:36.200 --> 41:41.240
I don't actually I don't know that like that mocking attitude towards Ubuntu. I don't know if it actually

41:41.240 --> 41:44.260
exists in the real world at like

41:45.080 --> 41:48.160
Beyond be I mean beyond internet keyboard warriors

41:49.160 --> 41:51.640
There I just I didn't get the sense of that

41:51.640 --> 41:55.320
I don't you know it's just to keep drawing not to keep drawing on the scale thing

41:55.320 --> 42:01.440
But Ubuntu came up a lot at scale because it would become was going on and there was never any shame

42:01.440 --> 42:03.440
There was never any oh

42:03.880 --> 42:04.840
eye-rolling

42:04.840 --> 42:08.760
And when like display servers which I heard several conversations about display servers

42:08.760 --> 42:12.960
It would go X mere and Wayland or mere Wayland X or Wayland mere X

42:12.960 --> 42:18.920
You know it was just like whatever like it was just these are the things it wasn't like this. Oh effing mere

42:19.480 --> 42:27.320
You know there was time. Yeah, I think there was sort of some it was a community meme wasn't it sort of three years ago to just

42:28.040 --> 42:29.160
outright

42:29.160 --> 42:34.360
Slander Ubuntu for everything they did and I do think that those days of sort of generally behind us now

42:34.400 --> 42:37.880
Yeah, it seems like it. It seems like it was not even a thing

42:37.880 --> 42:43.000
At least in person and so then you still see some you know disro shame and things like that online

42:43.000 --> 42:47.840
But I think the other part is is that people are looking at what they're doing okay?

42:47.840 --> 42:52.360
They actually got something that really working. I think there's a lot of excitement for this upcoming LTS in April

42:53.600 --> 42:57.440
Maybe so Micah. Maybe that is true. I mean yeah

42:57.440 --> 43:00.400
I think it's still it's people that are trying to be funny

43:00.400 --> 43:02.320
They're still gonna be able to take a shot at it

43:02.320 --> 43:09.680
But I think people that are getting work done we recognize the fact that they're trying to get something interesting done and accomplished

43:09.680 --> 43:14.680
I don't know. I I walk away from scale. I didn't really get the opinion that people shamed Ubuntu

43:14.680 --> 43:21.560
I thought that was a good thing it and you know there are just a lot of conversations to about sent OS and Debbie

43:21.560 --> 43:24.800
I'm really yeah, that's great. Yeah, that really seemed to come up a lot

43:24.800 --> 43:29.700
So I it is interesting times and I say good for canonical for actually reaching out to

43:29.700 --> 43:36.660
Actual human beings and getting them in London and paying them for getting feedback on using these applications now

43:36.660 --> 43:39.260
What'd be really cool is if they published the information yeah?

43:41.700 --> 43:47.660
All right, well let me tell you about something else you can get on that's a digital ocean sponsor of the Linux unplugged program

43:47.660 --> 43:51.040
I love digital ocean is my on-demand Linux infrastructure

43:51.040 --> 43:55.140
You can get a super fast rig and if you use our promo code do unplugged you get a $10 credit

43:55.140 --> 43:57.780
Try their $5 rig two months for free

43:57.780 --> 44:01.380
We were just talking a little bit ago about setting up a web-based IRC client

44:01.380 --> 44:05.180
Yeah, put that on digital ocean do it that on do it put everything on digital ocean

44:05.180 --> 44:08.340
They've got all the different distros. You'd really want on demand

44:08.980 --> 44:10.980
Even free BSD well

44:11.140 --> 44:14.940
What is that about? I don't know, but they you know what they got a great implementation of it

44:14.940 --> 44:20.220
They got a great one if you use the promo code do unplugged you try it out two months for free in less than 55 seconds

44:20.820 --> 44:23.720
You get a rig with 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte

44:24.860 --> 44:26.860
SSD because they all SSDs

44:26.860 --> 44:32.660
All SSDs a blazing fast CPU and a terabyte of transfer. They got data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore

44:33.460 --> 44:35.460
Amsterdam London Toronto

44:36.060 --> 44:41.520
Right by Alan Jude and Germany, which is actually a really great spot if you want to distribute to its neighbors

44:41.660 --> 44:47.300
But they really really have excelled at the interface. It is a really good UI very straightforward and

44:48.260 --> 44:49.460
Not only they have a great UI

44:49.460 --> 44:53.260
They have a great API and a bunch of good open source code is written around that API in fact

44:53.260 --> 44:55.020
I was just looking at some of the projects on there

44:55.020 --> 45:00.280
They have a whole bunch listed, and this is just like a tip of the iceberg stuff and like things like a command

45:01.100 --> 45:05.420
Command at IO can integrate using the API a lot of different services with that API

45:05.420 --> 45:10.780
Oh that API the droplet your digital ocean droplet manager. I love that one

45:10.860 --> 45:16.420
But also really good tutorials really good tutorials that help you get a lot more out of your rig

45:16.420 --> 45:18.820
So they have one click to application deployments

45:18.820 --> 45:23.940
So you can get something set up and really you can get you could get we were talking about setting up matter most right?

45:23.940 --> 45:26.300
You can get an Ubuntu LTS stack

45:26.860 --> 45:33.100
Set up with your web server in less than 55 seconds. It's not some weird custom version of Ubuntu

45:33.100 --> 45:38.580
Yeah, it's just it's just really straightforward using great open source code and the KVM

45:38.580 --> 45:40.540
Yeah, all the run on top of Linux

45:40.540 --> 45:44.980
Which is great all sitting on top of the mess SD's and then they have these tutorials to sort of round it all out

45:44.980 --> 45:49.140
So five dollars a month you get a great rig pricing plans are really straightforward, too

45:49.140 --> 45:53.180
So if you want to take our ten dollar credit and just use it for learning or experimenting

45:53.180 --> 45:58.660
You can break it down hourly like that use the promo code do unplugged at digital ocean and go set up a Linux rig

45:58.660 --> 46:06.040
Go play with own cloud. I got myself the own cloud the bit torrent sink the sink thing quasi core. I forget minecraft

46:07.020 --> 46:09.700
We have mumble for the the right

46:10.820 --> 46:15.500
Installed free switch this how do I not mention the fact that we have our virtual lug on a droplet?

46:15.500 --> 46:18.140
That's what makes the show work. I should probably say that from time to time

46:18.140 --> 46:24.500
The mumble on a droplet. Yeah. Yeah, lots of core part of the show infrastructure. You think I would have thought of that

46:25.340 --> 46:27.340
Well, you can try something out either

46:27.980 --> 46:34.980
Little experience or lots of experience you'd be surprised digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplugged and a big thanks to digital ocean

46:38.700 --> 46:41.120
Okay, Wes get ready for this one

46:41.120 --> 46:44.660
I I hope I don't I hope I don't upset anybody

46:44.660 --> 46:52.320
But I I got I got to ask if mint is just a little drunk it with power. I mean this seems this seems like

46:53.340 --> 46:56.280
Biting off way more than anybody would ever want to chew in

46:56.760 --> 47:01.200
2016 you might have heard about it. We covered in the Linux action show Linux mint is getting its own

47:02.240 --> 47:09.760
Application starting with the Linux 18 branch. We're gonna call them X apps for Linux mint distros meant to work across multiple desktops

47:09.760 --> 47:16.500
It'll be gtk3 applications with traditional interfaces. I eat no us, you know, what CSD? What do they call them?

47:17.260 --> 47:19.660
Clients decorations with the header bars. Yeah

47:20.300 --> 47:23.300
no client-side decoration header bars and

47:24.140 --> 47:29.500
the idea would be that anybody could really take these on but they're really gonna be meant for the cinnamon matte and XFCE desktops and

47:30.620 --> 47:34.940
this is part of the mince project of sticking to their guns and

47:36.220 --> 47:38.220
you might say

47:38.220 --> 47:43.900
Askewing new design trends they they say we've all witnessed the rise of the iPad the iPhone

47:43.900 --> 47:47.980
This is in the mint blog and this has caught this great a whole bunch of new trends

47:47.980 --> 47:49.580
But we will not be swayed by those trends

47:49.580 --> 47:52.580
And so X apps are gonna be introduced and you know

47:52.580 --> 47:58.380
I think it's is it Clem that wrote this yeah Clem that wrote this Clem talks about some of the challenges

47:58.380 --> 48:03.540
He's run into with gnome 3.18 and things that depend on that and moving that into mint

48:03.540 --> 48:09.460
it's just a big mess and so the whole idea here is X apps X app X apps and

48:11.660 --> 48:13.420
My initial reaction was a little strong

48:13.420 --> 48:18.260
I don't know. I wanted I wanted to kind of consult with the lug and see if maybe I was overreactive

48:18.260 --> 48:22.540
Maybe there's a point in missing and I definitely want to pick wimpy's brain. So let's start with you wimpy

48:22.540 --> 48:25.140
What do you think about X apps and what Linux mint is doing here?

48:26.100 --> 48:28.100
I've got lots of thoughts about this

48:29.060 --> 48:31.060
I've been very careful not to

48:31.060 --> 48:37.820
Criticize or rag on other distributions and projects since Ubuntu Marte got started. So

48:38.860 --> 48:45.420
Everything I'm about to say isn't intended as a bashing or a ragging on Linux mint. It's my opinion

48:45.420 --> 48:50.300
So if anyone thinks I'm trying to dog on them, that's really I want to say too

48:50.300 --> 48:54.460
I have a lot of respect for Clem. He's worked really hard and he's built a very

48:55.340 --> 48:58.060
Very good distro that I raved about the last version

48:58.060 --> 49:04.500
Yeah, um, I do understand where this comes from so I

49:05.820 --> 49:08.140
I understand technically why

49:09.340 --> 49:13.180
Clem probably feels this is necessary and

49:14.660 --> 49:22.740
I'm active in my local community with small businesses and home users and I can also see why

49:22.740 --> 49:27.060
They don't give a fig for these fancy new. Mm-hmm

49:27.660 --> 49:31.020
Desktops. Sure. If you look at what's happened with

49:31.740 --> 49:37.700
Windows a lot of people are really disenfranchised with with Windows now

49:39.900 --> 49:41.140
These are

49:41.140 --> 49:45.340
Home users and small business users that just need their computer to do stuff

49:45.340 --> 49:51.740
They don't care for all of these redesigns of the user interfaces. They just want the user interface

49:51.740 --> 49:53.740
is they just want the

49:53.860 --> 49:57.020
Look and feel that they're familiar with so they can carry on their merry way

49:57.620 --> 50:03.140
So there are an awful lot of people out there who don't move in technical circles

50:03.420 --> 50:05.900
who are quite happy to stay the course with

50:06.660 --> 50:11.140
traditional user environments, right so I can understand

50:12.420 --> 50:18.980
Why Clem would want to do this and it's been a while now, but there was some discussion

50:18.980 --> 50:22.660
Within the Marte and

50:23.420 --> 50:29.340
Linux Mint teams and a couple of others from some of the other projects, although I think they may have moved on now

50:30.020 --> 50:36.100
About one one idea was potentially forking a tool kit. Hmm. So looking at forking

50:36.580 --> 50:38.580
GTK 2

50:39.100 --> 50:41.100
Retrofitting retrofitting

50:41.780 --> 50:46.740
Modernizing where needed. Yeah. Yeah, and the other idea was forking GTK 3

50:46.740 --> 50:50.420
so that we could establish a

50:51.500 --> 50:53.180
I

50:53.180 --> 50:57.780
Use the word stable to represent a non-changing API rather than

50:58.620 --> 51:03.420
Suggest the GTK 3 is an unstable buggy platform because it isn't the issue with

51:04.300 --> 51:11.900
GTK 3 that a lot of the projects that are trying to write against it are encountering certainly, you know for full desktops is that it's

51:11.900 --> 51:17.020
It's a moving target and it's difficult, you know with each new version of GTK 3

51:17.180 --> 51:21.940
There's new features that primarily target genome 3, right?

51:21.940 --> 51:26.060
And it requires an awful lot of work for the other projects to actually adapt

51:26.900 --> 51:28.900
to those changes

51:28.940 --> 51:33.100
So with that as a backdrop you can understand why forking

51:33.100 --> 51:40.580
These projects to create X-apps is an idea and we did discuss this idea of creating a common

51:41.060 --> 51:44.780
set of cross desktop applications and

51:45.700 --> 51:49.260
At the time we were talking about looking at what?

51:50.180 --> 51:57.740
Cinnamon required what Marte required what XFC required and what LXDE required and the aspiration was is that

51:58.060 --> 52:00.540
all of those desktop environments could

52:00.540 --> 52:03.620
Collaborate and work together on a common set of things

52:05.260 --> 52:14.220
It's it's a sensible suggestion, you know rather than having four different file browsers and four different text editors and so on and so on

52:14.220 --> 52:18.220
That you know, you will coalesce around a common a common set of applications

52:18.220 --> 52:21.260
but then of course, there's nothing to differentiate them and

52:23.220 --> 52:27.820
One of the reasons there's all these different desktop environments on on Linux is because

52:27.820 --> 52:31.980
People have different wants and needs and they want to go their own way and do their different thing

52:32.660 --> 52:36.300
So there was never going to be sort of broad

52:36.860 --> 52:39.940
agreement from all of those desktop environments about you know

52:39.940 --> 52:43.740
Which way to go on which of the file managers would be the you know

52:43.740 --> 52:49.100
The chosen one and all the rest of it. So I imagine that's how Clem has got to

52:50.380 --> 52:53.180
The point he's got to now which is to effectively

52:53.180 --> 52:58.380
Go and cherry-pick different applications that are out there

52:59.180 --> 53:01.980
And bring those in under this banner of Xapps

53:02.940 --> 53:09.820
To use in Linux Mint to sustain this, you know, traditional environment

53:11.180 --> 53:14.380
And I think you said at the weekend that you know

53:15.580 --> 53:19.660
They weren't, Mint weren't keeping up they'd stuck their head in the sands and they weren't

53:19.660 --> 53:25.660
Adopting header bars and client-side decorations, but by and large most of the other desktop aren't

53:26.220 --> 53:30.220
The desktops aren't either. I mean Xfce have started to

53:31.100 --> 53:35.500
Or rather Xfce, I'm not, sometimes the lines are a bit blurred between Xfce and Xfce

53:35.980 --> 53:42.700
But certainly within Xfce some of the newer applications that have come along some of the settings bits and bobs that they've added recently

53:43.180 --> 53:45.980
Those use header bars and client-side decorations

53:45.980 --> 53:50.620
I don't know if that's a trend that Xfce is going to follow

53:51.100 --> 53:54.460
Or if it's just for a few bits and pieces that they've developed recently

53:54.540 --> 54:00.220
It seems like that would be the real winner here for these Xapps if if Zubuntu and other distros started to also

54:00.300 --> 54:07.100
Yeah, as far as I can remember there was not enough engagement and obviously LXDE are going with Qt now

54:07.100 --> 54:10.460
So, you know, they're kind of out of that that discussion

54:10.460 --> 54:17.020
Besides Xfce, it's kind of just Cinnamon and Mate who are the ones they're talking about here. Yeah, I also acknowledge

54:17.980 --> 54:24.300
No, there's two others. There's two others and there's this elementary and they seem to be they do seem to be

54:25.020 --> 54:29.500
Adopting client-side decoration and header bars. I think I think that's their

54:30.220 --> 54:35.580
You know the direction they're headed in from what I've seen. I think that's where they're going. But here's an interesting one

54:35.580 --> 54:44.940
Unity is not a client-side decoration header bar desktop environment. Canonical have been actively patching out

54:45.660 --> 54:52.540
Client-side decorations and header bars from those forked applications that Unity is built upon

54:53.180 --> 54:57.660
And continue to do so, you know, I still see this come up in the um, you know

54:57.660 --> 55:03.980
The Ubuntu desktop IRC channel from Qt. I don't know if that's a trend, but it seems like it's a trend

55:03.980 --> 55:06.300
Ubuntu desktop IRC channel from time to time when a

55:06.780 --> 55:10.860
A new version comes out and somebody has to go in there and refactor the patches to remove it

55:11.580 --> 55:12.700
so

55:12.700 --> 55:19.500
In some respects, you know Gnome is trailblazing this and it's not that the other desktop environments aren't keeping up

55:20.300 --> 55:22.300
They're choosing not to do it

55:24.060 --> 55:28.220
I wonder if uh, this isn't the perfect timing for something like this. He's

55:28.940 --> 55:32.140
you know, uh, he's got to be looking ahead at at

55:32.140 --> 55:36.860
At the desktop for the next couple years and going the demand for a really well done

55:37.180 --> 55:42.300
Tightly controlled Linux based traditional desktop is only going to go up safe easy to use

55:43.580 --> 55:45.580
Pretty predictable. I mean

55:47.820 --> 55:49.020
Clem has been

55:49.020 --> 55:57.500
very shrewd in the way that he's put mint together and he's clearly listened to his user community and I should imagine

55:58.540 --> 56:00.540
This is what they want

56:00.540 --> 56:05.820
But I think forking the applications is not

56:06.780 --> 56:08.460
Not the way to go

56:08.460 --> 56:09.340
um

56:09.340 --> 56:15.740
It and this sounds a bit strange as somebody involved in Marte, which is one of those big, you know forking efforts

56:16.540 --> 56:23.260
um in in some respects, I think we've been justified in doing that because it wasn't

56:24.120 --> 56:26.120
initially it was more about

56:26.120 --> 56:33.560
um, sort of refused nicks, people didn't want to adopt the new thing, but now it's more about

56:34.100 --> 56:36.100
preserving

56:36.120 --> 56:38.120
what was GNOME 2

56:38.120 --> 56:41.720
uh and and keeping that, you know, usable

56:42.280 --> 56:48.040
desktop paradigm available for, you know, the next generation of people to, you know, use

56:49.080 --> 56:51.080
um

56:51.080 --> 56:54.600
I think that just keep forking things and

56:54.600 --> 56:57.240
it's a lot of it's a lot of work and

56:58.200 --> 57:03.800
Uh, I think these XApps will only ever be available in Mint. I don't see that they will

57:04.520 --> 57:09.240
They will get used much if at all outside of Mint's ecosystem

57:09.480 --> 57:15.000
A couple of things strike me about this that make it seem like a a challenging long-term strategy

57:16.280 --> 57:18.280
XApps

57:18.280 --> 57:20.680
Uh and the avoidance of client-side decorations

57:20.680 --> 57:25.320
So client-side decorations, like Tyler points out, doesn't look super great on non-GNOME desktops

57:25.320 --> 57:28.280
I've actually not really had a problem with them, but then again, I'm kind of a fan

57:28.280 --> 57:28.760
Yeah

57:28.760 --> 57:30.440
And I want to make a difference here

57:30.440 --> 57:35.640
We need to we need to be we need to be clear client-side decorations and the header bar in GNOME

57:36.200 --> 57:42.040
Are two different things. Client-side decorations is simply how the decoration is drawn on the client window

57:42.760 --> 57:46.520
And the GNOME header bar is a certain implementation of a client-side decoration

57:46.520 --> 57:53.000
So the reason why that's sort of important to understand going into this conversation is client-side decorations are going to become more critical

57:53.560 --> 57:55.560
When we move to Wayland

57:56.120 --> 58:01.720
Uh and because it'll no longer be up to the X server to draw the decoration because there won't be an X server

58:02.040 --> 58:06.220
So the client will be responsible for its own decorations. Hence client-side decorations

58:07.080 --> 58:10.440
Uh, it's not just for vanity. It's also to support Wayland better

58:10.680 --> 58:13.880
So what Mint is also saying here with these XApps

58:13.880 --> 58:17.240
Is they're saying Wayland is not in our future

58:19.000 --> 58:19.960
Maybe

58:19.960 --> 58:25.720
Maybe that is what they're saying. Um, and what I would what I would add to that is that um,

58:27.320 --> 58:29.320
All of the energy

58:29.320 --> 58:34.600
Almost all of the energy in the Marte team at the moment is focused on uh, GTK 3

58:35.640 --> 58:37.160
um, and

58:37.160 --> 58:40.360
That we had a 1.10 release. Um,

58:40.360 --> 58:45.880
April-ish last year. That was the first experimental version of GTK 3

58:46.840 --> 58:50.520
Uh, we had a 1.12 release, uh towards the end of last year

58:51.400 --> 58:55.980
And that was a much improved GTK 3 implementation still considered experimental

58:56.680 --> 59:01.960
We've got 1.13, which is uh, just trickling out as um, testing tarballs at the moment

59:01.960 --> 59:04.280
I think about three quarters of the components are

59:04.280 --> 59:10.200
Out with um, 1.13 and with 1.14 to follow, uh early this year

59:10.200 --> 59:14.840
And we're getting to the point now where we've only got a handful of sort of

59:15.880 --> 59:19.400
Issues to overcome for for where GTK 3 is a really

59:20.440 --> 59:22.440
um, targetable platform

59:23.140 --> 59:26.360
unfortunately, GTK uh, 3.2.0

59:27.160 --> 59:30.760
Has thrown a couple of spanners in the works. So we've we've we've tried to

59:30.760 --> 59:35.560
We've tried to adjust our release cadence to match GNOME and GTK 3

59:36.360 --> 59:42.680
And because we hadn't had uh, that many regressions to cope with in the last couple of cycles, but um,

59:43.400 --> 59:47.960
A lot of stuff's busted this time. So it's just difficult just as we were about to

59:48.520 --> 59:52.520
Just get comfortable for it. Yeah. Yeah, but um,

59:53.160 --> 59:55.160
You know Marte is

59:56.020 --> 59:58.020
Supporting GTK 3

59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.300
He is supporting GTK 3

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:08.660
And we do have support for client-side decorations and some of the applications that I ship by default

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:10.980
In Ubuntu Marte

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.980
Do use client-side decorations

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.460
They don't look horrible

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:20.580
They just look a bit different. But they work they work just fine. They do work. Yeah, that's a good point

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.740
See this is what we're now

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:26.900
This is sort of I see three tracks in the Ubuntu based distro world

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:33.380
The heavy hitters, of course, I do not mean to take away from Kubuntu or Zubuntu or Neon or whatever

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:37.860
But uh, you have yourself in one corner the Unity default desktop

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:41.780
Which is going to be undergoing radical changes like we've never seen from a completely

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.780
From a transition from GTK to Qt and apps that are designed for both

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:51.300
Mobile and desktop and that powered by an entirely new display server called Mir

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:56.660
That's in corner number one, right the primary contender in corner number two

01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:04.500
You have Ubuntu Mate edition where you have a traditional desktop paradigm, but is integrating current technologies in a very logical

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:11.160
Reasonable fashion keeping up right and then uh, but it could but that could mean in some circumstances

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:16.260
Your apps look a little different or things are just a little different like maybe systemd sneaks in there, right?

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.100
These kinds of horrible things, right?

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:22.260
But and then in corner number three, you now have Linux Mint 18

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:29.540
Which as Clem promises in his blog post will give you one button to make it look exactly like Linux Mint 17

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.860
So that way nothing looks any different nothing changes

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:37.860
It's going to be again based on a very long-term support and these X apps are now going to be a thing and

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.580
I'm two minds of this because it's like these are three very unique

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:48.740
And very radical approaches in their own right on in a belief of what the desktop should be

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:52.980
And so that's my first thought and then my second thought is man as a reviewer

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:58.100
This is really going to be a treat because now these are three very unique and distinct beasts

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:04.660
That uh, you know fully deserve their own review and in the case of mint, you know, i'm going to be using different apps

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.980
I mean, yeah, they're maybe going to be very similar, but they're going to be their own set

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.060
I mean, it's a really its own unique experience

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:15.960
And in some ways it is it is sort of like this. I know I should I actually shouldn't leave out elementary OS

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:20.420
Yeah, in the fourth, it's right in here. There's a fourth quarter west with elementary OS

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.420
The ring is getting full

01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:27.780
And all there's a fifth corner as well because LXQT is going to be a thing this year as well. Oh

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:31.300
A new contender enters with the sixth ring

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.180
the six rings of Ubuntu

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:39.060
Uh, and they all are extremely fascinating all based on one

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.460
mother distro if you will

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.500
Uh, I just find that to be really and and which are all based on Debian

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.700
I find it to be really interesting the way it's all shaping out and uh,

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:53.780
Uh, I I guess in that regard more power to the mint team

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:59.380
I mean, uh Clem brought in more funding for his project than ever. I wonder how many of these there will be

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:04.020
And they might be good. I like I like nemo the the file browser. Yeah, it's not bad

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:07.060
Yeah, nemo's not bad like if they fit in really well and they

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:13.940
Maybe somewhat limited feature set and they just perform well and are well integrated and easy to use then maybe it'll work

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.160
Well, if you zoom out and take it to its ultimate conclusion

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:23.780
This is what well what's really happening here is these these individual groups are taking Linux

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:28.020
And they are truly building their own platform and their own desktop vision on top of it

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:33.060
They are not necessarily trying to make a distro that plays with all other distros

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.740
They are trying to make a desktop experience or a mobile experience in some cases

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:44.100
That is a unique platform all into their own and Linux is the software that is making that possible, but it's not

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.380
You know, it's not what's defining what it must be

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.140
No, it's kind of just at the bottom of the stack hiding away. Yeah

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.580
Uh, which is kind of which makes exactly or Chrome OS. Yep

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.460
But uh just a little closer

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.460
That's interesting time

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:06.500
All right, uh, we should go to uh this Dell Linux distro speaking of distributions that are uh,

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:10.420
This one I I would argue may actually well, you know what?

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.260
I'm just gonna you're not even gonna believe it. But first

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:17.720
Let's talk about Linux Academy go to linuxacademy.com

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.960
Unplugged, please. Why don't you go there to support this show linuxacademy.com

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:27.240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and read more about a great education platform to learn not just about Linux

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.280
But all the technology around it i'm going to tell you more about that in a second

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:36.920
But first for those of you who've heard about Linux Academy before I should mention they have had recently had some major updates new courses

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:43.000
Ansible and AWS courses advanced AWS security. What's up, Docker and Elastic Beanstalk?

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.880
They have a new Cloud Cadet episode as a new series they're doing

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.360
Uh, and also I love it

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:53.000
They now have a mobile app they're working on but on top of all of that i've mentioned they have group accounts before

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.920
Taking it up a notch

01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:00.040
Now you got big old enterprise accounts big old enterprise accounts west where you can have big groups and sub teams

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.220
Linux Academy is really stepping up to the next level here. So if you've got an organization

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:09.480
I encourage you to go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged. This is a great resource

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.320
Started by Linux enthusiasts who first thought well, how do we spread the word?

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:17.800
I am so excited about this technology. Let's go spread the word now

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:22.760
They they teamed up with friends that are developers and educators and they created the Linux Academy platform now

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.360
They've gotten some success

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:28.040
You might say I think so you might say and as a result of that

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:32.440
They've been expanding their team bringing their content up refreshing it keeping it current

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:37.160
They have an incredible system where there's seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from you choose that distro

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.640
It automatically adjusts the course where which when we were trying to figure out how to Linux

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:47.960
We're like how how good we were we were running through ideas like this and when I saw this I was like, okay

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.840
That's cool. And he's like and I remember I was talking to Anthony about he's like, yeah

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.240
But it doesn't just change the course where it also

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:58.120
Adjust the virtual machines that we spin up on demand right as the courseware calls for it the SSH into it

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:02.520
It's the same environment you chose earlier. It's really slick. They have over

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:08.360
2200 self-paced courses. These are great courses. You can go in there self-paced

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.640
So you do it at your own convenience at a speed that is comfortable to you

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:14.520
And you can also set up timelines and reminders

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:20.920
They have scenario-based labs that put you in the middle of tasks common to everyday environments instructor help is available when you need it

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.960
They have graded server exercises. You can get immediate feedback. They have AWS training

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.760
So when you need to do something on AWS, they spin up those instances

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.120
You don't got to worry about Amazon charging you a whole bunch of monies

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:36.760
They have a community stack full of Jupiter broadcasting members live events where you can ask the instructors questions

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:41.800
Or get news directly from Linux Academy folks. It's a really great way to run an academy

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:46.040
It's a great resource for our audience and it's a super cool way to support our show

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:52.200
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.680
I'm telling you that instructor help is so valuable for a topic like this. Yeah, no kidding

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.440
All right. So Dell is uh, well, you know what? Maybe they've been looking at Ubuntu snappy

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.720
And they're thinking to themselves. Hey, this might not be such a bad idea

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:13.000
So Dell is launching its own Linux distribution get hyped everybody get hyped. All right, I'll tell you the name

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.120
You've all been patient Super Dell OS. They're calling it OS 10

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.800
Wait, isn't there isn't there an operating system called that already? I think so. Yeah, only this one isn't with an X

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.800
It's with a one and a zero

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.120
OS 10 that's a little more clear actually

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.840
This is unbelievable

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:34.840
This is their Linux distro called OS 10 and they plan to make it a strategic operating system offering

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:41.640
Expanding Dell switches and their storage products OS 10 is based on a native and I like that they're promoting this

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.480
As somebody who's worked in the enterprise west. Have you ever heard this term before?

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:49.240
A customized hardened Linux kernel. Yeah, right

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.520
Here's a new spin. This is 2016 spin on this

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160
an unmodified Linux kernel

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.480
That's stock. That's their marketing an unmodified Linux kernel

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:04.280
Uh that can support broad range of applications and services from the Linux ecosystems Dell officials say

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:12.040
Dell claims this differentiates from cumulus's network cumulus Linux and HP's open switch because this one's meant for open network systems

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:18.120
You know because of open OS 10 is I can't believe I'm saying that it's comprised of a base module

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.360
And various operational application modules

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:28.680
Separated to offer choice control and programmability. I'm gonna get me some of those application modules later

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:32.440
Yeah, because you get control. This is an alternative where things are bundled tightly

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:36.840
Essentially what Dell has done here. Tell me if this reminds you of something

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:45.160
separation of the OS 10 application modules from the base modules allows customers to tailor IT operations for different use cases and

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.560
operational processes

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:53.800
Dell didn't comment if they're just forking Ubuntu snappy or if they just think it's free BSD. Yeah, right. Yeah, right

01:08:53.800 --> 01:09:01.000
Yeah, exactly. So they've got they're basically doing the Ubuntu snappy thing or the free BSD thing where you have your base OS

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:08.120
And the applications are separated out and the base OS is a read write or read only image and they're calling it OS 10

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.880
OS 10 maybe it's in binary. Is it one zero? I just

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.200
I just don't understand what's wrong with Dell, you know

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:24.120
because like at one hand Dell's like watching the Linux scene and totally into it releasing drivers and stuff like

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.520
It was this week. It's announced that Dell's about to ship a new XPS

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:34.520
Developer edition based with Skylake processors, which means they're taking like a hundred bucks off the Broadwell ones right now if you want them

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:38.560
Which are probably better. Yeah, I have I have the Broadwell XPS

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.480
I think my I don't know and I think it's a pretty good machine

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.040
I and and I would not get it with high DPI and you get a bunch more battery life and

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.080
Better video performance. Yeah better application support so

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.940
You have one hand on one hand

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.320
Dell keeps revving a pretty damn nice machine on the other hand

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.320
They're relaunching their own custom Linux called OS 10

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:05.040
What is that said I it would be kind of nice to run and you know

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.720
Be running a nice Dell switch in production and be like, hey, it's Linux and I know how it works

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:15.680
Well, I don't know how you'll see it though. We'll be caught your your binary joke and you have it. You have an observation

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.680
Go ahead. We'll be

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:23.280
So the first is they've missed a trick because I wonder if they're trolling Apple here and they're just

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:32.440
And this is just you know to get it out in the press and they'll rename it after you know after the dust settles

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.860
But why isn't it? You know Dell OS it goes to 11

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:41.300
You know you go back to cool back to spinal tap and

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:46.580
If it's binary, then it's some OS 2 so neither of them work, particularly well

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.900
The worst possible name, yeah

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:55.060
X apps is worse. But yeah X apps is worse. I

01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:00.660
Jacob in the chair. I'm just asking if I'll update my XPS 13 to OS 10. Yeah, sure

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:05.780
I'll run OS 10 on my XPS 13 just ask me where yeah, it's just this just a train wreck though

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.700
It is of the pics. It'll be the top application. I know it's it's almost a joke

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.320
It is almost joke, but it is it is it is actually true

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:18.380
And I don't know maybe somebody out there have experience with it because there's your Dell OS 9. Yeah

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.220
straight to 10

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:25.580
No, that's that's what I'm wondering like is it just some

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:30.640
Something built for data centers that I wasn't aware of no

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:39.600
I've had clients that have had Dell switches and they did not call it that they didn't call it always no

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:45.440
No, that is that is funny. Wow. Well, there you go. There's marketing 101

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:50.120
We're watching it in right here. Just go straight to 10 the next show

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.760
We can we announce we just gotta call it 10 start with episode 10 call it 10

01:11:53.760 --> 01:12:00.120
That's ridiculous. Well linuxactionshow.reddit.com. You'll find a feedback thread for 130 stories community out

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:06.800
You know like spotlights or call outs anything like that application modules. Yeah, sure sure application module separated from your base

Alright, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode athletics unplugged now that I'm done smacking microphones

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.400
You get the hell out of here. See you next week

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.400
See ya

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:53.400
Oh

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:59.400
Oh

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.520
Alright JB titles calm let's boat. Oh wimpy. I love that. Tell me about your New Year's resolution

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:25.000
Yeah, so, um, I've obviously been consuming independent content for some time now

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.840
Yeah, it's true. It's really true and I was thinking about you know

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:36.840
New Year's resolutions and what have you like everyone does at the end of the last year and I you know wrote up the usual list of

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.120
New Year's resolutions, you know go to the gym more often. Mm-hmm eat healthily

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.680
Not my whole intake alcohol intake to 60 units a week all that sort of thing

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:50.760
And um after I did that, I thought no, I'm I never keep these resolutions

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:55.880
So let's try and think of one. I'm actually going to keep so I I decided right. I'm going to support all of these independent

01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:00.520
Content creators and then I thought well, how do I

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.760
How do I do that? How much am I gonna spend on this?

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.560
So you might be familiar with the fact that in the UK we pay for a TV license. Yeah

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.280
And yet that supports the BBC

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.160
And yet that supports the BBC so I looked at how much that cost a year

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.720
And I took the exact same amount and I have spread that amount of money

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:24.680
across all of the

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:32.120
Content creators that I consume content for so i'm effectively paying the same amount as I pay for my UK TV license

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:36.120
For all of the independent content creators that I listen to and watch

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.280
That's really cool. Yeah, i'm i'm working on something kind of similar

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:42.600
I was looking at the price of satellite TV where i'm at

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:47.240
And I think i'm going to figure out how much that is and then first i'm going to contribute that to independent media

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.000
And then once if I can i'm comfortable doing that then maybe i'll let then you maybe i'll get this

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.480
And I actually feel like that's actually since i've done that

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:58.920
I'm more comfortable at patreon signing up on patreon. It's like it's all really like I feel much better about it

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.240
And and honestly, you know what?

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.800
With all the great set top boxes now

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:10.520
It's easier on the go to get online content a million times over than it is to get your traditional. Yeah, right

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:13.640
Especially for someone like you who's roving all over the place quite literally

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.920
Yeah, good point wimpy

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.920
All right. Well I finish up

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.760
I'm gonna ask you wes

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:25.720
And then you I mean then somebody in the moment room anybody in the moment willing can it can answer but wes

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.440
What would you do?

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.440
What would happen?

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.520
How screwed would you be?

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.520
If github shut down tomorrow

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.040
If github went away off the internet

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:46.440
Totally offline mildly inconvenienced too quite frustrated after after about a day or so

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.600
How would I update youtube to yeah

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.840
See this is the thing is I think the way would impact me is all of the open source stuff

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.480
I use that's on github that would be like offline like aur things would break

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:05.480
And now updates would get around mumber of anybody in there having thought how screwed would you be if github went offline tomorrow?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Uh, I think it will

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:12.040
Sorry fretsel go ahead. I think that

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.200
primary thing for the links community would be that um

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:23.400
Like for example aur a lot of aur packages pull sources directly from github

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:28.280
a lot of people who use go applications would be screwed because

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.960
go

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.960
resolves dependencies by

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.960
downloading stuff directly from github, um

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:44.600
I have for the reasons that there is a chance of github going down. I do have um

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:51.240
a private git instance running on the server that has a lot of stuff that I need but

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:59.800
But it would be massive inconvenience I would have access to my own stuff and all the dependencies that I need for my own

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.400
stuff, but if I

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.400
Want to install something completely new?

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.320
Yeah, it would be horrible. Yeah, that's kind of my take on it

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:12.280
Like it would be hey, you know because if you had a cause git it's git so your own code you see

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:18.120
Yeah, you have on your own machine. It's all the other stuff you depend on that probably doesn't have everything tamir

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:23.480
You don't have local. Yeah now free. So do you have a way to bring that mic closer to your mouth?

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.440
Because we're getting a lot of room echo and background noise on you

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.840
Go ahead will be

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.960
Um, well, I was just going to say that um, yes for all of those other dependent services

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.360
A lot of things would stop working

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:45.640
But if you're an organization or an individual that puts stuff in something like github or trello or bitbucket even

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:49.000
There are tools out there to back up

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.480
your stuff

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:56.440
So that if github or bitbucket or any of those go away

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.040
You actually have your own copy of your data

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:04.760
And a lot of people think that simply having a checkout of github's enough

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:08.760
But if you're an organization with lots of developers with with code checked out

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:12.120
That's not actually a recovery position

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:16.200
So, you know if you're using those services, you should be routinely

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:22.520
Um mirroring your repositories to your own instances inside your organization

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:27.080
So if it goes away, you can just repoint your origins and carry on

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:29.880
Very well put well said

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:35.160
Well, here's why I can feel that i'm slipping because I am coming up with more and more ideas to use slack for

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.440
And now i'm realizing okay

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:40.520
This is starting to speed up to a pace where if I don't watch out this is going to become irreplaceable

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:43.000
And I have learned that lesson

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.600
I have learned that lesson

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:49.480
So now i'm i'm putting a plea a call out to anybody who could help me get a mattermost install

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:53.160
Ideally i'd like to put one on a digital ocean droplet because that's where I manage all my stuff

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:56.200
I would like to do it there if anybody has uh

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.080
Anybody wants to help me with that?

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:02.920
I would love to chat with you because it's happening fast and not only that

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:07.000
But I have ideas that I want to take public

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.360
And it would just make sense to have people if i'm going to work with people in the public

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.160
It would make sense to do it do it on mattermost and not require people to sign up for slack and things like that

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.160
And yeah, that would be nice. Yeah

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:22.520
So i'm putting a call out there if anybody does have any experience with mattermost or a slack alternative

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:29.400
I know of I know like there's trello and things like that, but I want something ideally that would be on my own droplet that

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:35.800
I can take snapshots of and things like that. So wimpy you're gonna you say you're you're about to play with it

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:41.560
No, no not about to play with it. No, it's on the very long list of things to do. Yeah. Yeah

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.960
Yeah, I could see how I could see there's a lot of

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.840
I guess I guess I took I guess I didn't

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:53.960
I guess I didn't take slack seriously first and like it's irc and I have telegram. I have irc and I have telegram. Why do I need slack?

01:19:53.960 --> 01:20:00.600
But the really nice thing about one really nice thing about slack. I don't even know if mattermost supports this

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.560
Well, first of all, it has a good phone app

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:08.920
Which is really nice because if I have an idea on the go I can just quickly open up slack and throw something in there

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:15.080
And it can include a picture or audio. That's super nice. But um, the other thing that slack really nails

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.720
And I don't have any experience with mattermost is

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.360
Switching teams so I can be an I can be a member. I'm like a member of three slacks

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.200
Right. Yeah, I have two

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.480
that is

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.920
That is so that way and I because for me it's all about

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.800
Divisioning off things because I work on things as you know

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.640
I have time for them and that being able to slice things up like that is really nice

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.680
You can just ignore one for a while if you need you just don't look at it

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.000
I have no idea if mattermost has anything like that, right?

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:47.400
So having heard of slack, uh, but never used it and having used irc and telegram

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.200
How does slack?

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:54.280
How does slack differ from telegram and irc?

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.640
well, so a few things that are nice about slack is

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:01.960
Um, it's persistent chat for everybody. So regardless of anybody's client setup

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:05.480
They're always getting all of the chat history that even though the stuff that they weren't present for

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:12.200
Um, it has bot integration which is actually kind of handy and of course any major service it has integrations for so

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:18.600
Uh, for example, we have a bot that monitors the google calendar and whenever there's a calendar change

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.720
It it sends those changes to a specific channel

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:27.240
Uh, and it also does a daily check of the calendar and post the recording schedule to the to the channel

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:34.040
And this has helped us. I mean, it sounds like a really dumb simple thing, but it has helped us keep the calendar accurate

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:38.680
It's like the thing that's helped us make the calendar accurate now is because there's a thread where we're seeing

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.360
We're have we have to look at the calendar every day every show that we do

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:46.360
Has a next thread so the next episode of that show

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:51.320
So that way we can we have a spot to communicate with the people who are involved in each of those episodes

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.360
Uh what we need to have in place for the next episode

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:59.000
And uh, what's really nice about that is if you like if you link a youtube video

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:04.280
It will it will preview the youtube video right there in slack or you can get the link

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.520
It doesn't do a bunch of like crazy redirector

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.160
Urls, you can just get nice clean

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.840
Links, uh, or it does it has uh, you know

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:17.880
Like support for a lot of uh, like you can just plus one a comment instead of having to say I agree

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:22.220
That's kind of nice. Um, it it has support for some offline functionality

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:25.000
And it has limited markdown support

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.760
It has like code snippet support and and things like that that are also

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:35.320
You know nicer than you get with any typical irc client and and regard and I guess what and really the thing about it

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:38.600
Is is there's a ton of good irc clients and telegram and things like that

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:44.680
But what you get with slack is every single person is on the same playing field as far as functionality and capabilities go

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.760
And then the other nice thing that comes with that is a lot of people know slack already

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.320
Just like like one of the great things about using skype is

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.640
A lot of people use skype one of the nice things about using google docs is a lot of people have a google account

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.000
Use google docs

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.280
And it's the same thing now with slack is you know when I invited west to the

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:04.600
Linux unplugged slack. He already had a slack account. He was already set up. Easy peasy. Yeah

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:09.240
Yeah, so there's that too. Okay, so so it is a sort of um

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:12.680
It's taking irc

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.600
And abstracting away some of those bits that you would have to have an admin set up for you

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:24.600
Yeah, and then and then making it super easy to integrate things like dropbox and google docs and you know

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.880
So like if I post a link to a google like i'll say okay

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.880
The uh, the doc is up for this week's episode of unplugged and when I post that link in there

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:38.200
It it gives it a big google doc button. It's obvious this google docs like it's so sort of intelligent about that kind of stuff

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:39.880
um

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:45.640
It's all and and I guess and then of course all you get all of that and it takes you a grand total of 30 seconds

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.520
To set up a team slack, which is also very nice

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.080
Right, but like anyone can do it

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.880
well, that's the other the other thing is

01:23:54.440 --> 01:24:00.680
Uh, it's pretty much free until you want like fancy stuff like maybe private channels archiving of messages

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:05.000
Yeah, but even then like you still get an incredible history like it's still ridiculous 10 000. Yeah

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.160
uh, so

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:10.760
There is and then and then it's eight dollars per user basically after that

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.080
And and it costs you your freedom, of course

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:15.400
Yeah

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:17.880
And if you really want some of the fancy integrations

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.200
You have to have like a heroku account

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:24.120
And you have to host some of the apps on there, which means you're using another closed platform

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.640
But then you can really start doing some serious shit that is you know

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:30.840
people are really integrating like with their business workflows and stuff like

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.800
And there's like there's a lot of support for people who do development work and get integration and things like that

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:39.160
That I don't ever use i've made a few slack integrations. They're they're pretty easy

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.520
Yeah, like what kind of things?

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.720
Uh, like we have a an alert console at work for things that happen

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.080
And uh, so we just made it so like if you're away from that you wanted to ping you on slack

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:53.240
It'll just send all the new alerts new emails for things. We like share inboxes right to live. See this is the problem is

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:59.320
Is there is a community now out there that knows how to do this and if I go to something like mattermost i'm

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.880
I'm forfeiting that

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.880
We got to start making some mattermost plugins, I guess

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:10.200
Yeah, maybe maybe that could be the goal is to get enough traction publicly that people get interested to build that stuff

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.040
I'll help set up a mattermost server

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:18.200
Have you done it or you just you're just willing to take that challenge. I would like to play with one

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:23.400
Oh, no, I i'll take the challenge to set one. Well, you know what ham if you do it build it on a do droplet

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:26.120
Because then if it works you could transfer it to me then I could just start paying for it

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:32.360
Okay, sure. Well, I got some instructions on how to build do it on a ubuntu 14.04

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.400
Yeah, use one of our promo codes, right?

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.760
And uh, and you get so you'll get two you'll get you can try it out two months for free actually

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.280
Build it on a nicer rig. So do like uh, do like one with one gig of ram

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.360
Just that way because I like to do one gig of ram now

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:48.600
Uh, so do a one gig of ram rig. This is going premium up in here and i'll get you one month

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.480
To build it and then you transfer to me and i'll just start paying for it

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.600
I've already used your promo code. So they won't let me use them again

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.640
all of them

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:04.360

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:18.200

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.440
Uh, yeah only probably only one promo code per I don't know exactly how it works

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:26.520
But either way or you know what for god's sakes ham i'll send you the ten dollars whatever it takes

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.360

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:42.520
