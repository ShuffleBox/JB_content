00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 16 for November 26th, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that already has one foot out the door this holiday week.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
My name is Chris.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is Matt.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hey Matt, so we've got a fun show today, a lot of things happening.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Even though it's a holiday week, you'd think, it's turkey, it's turkey day, tomorrow? Yeah, tomorrow here in the United States.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tomorrow's turkey day.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No wait, no, Thursday.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
No wait, Thursday.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Sorry, I got my...

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
There's turkey all week long for us.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've already got tryptophan all in my blood system.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm a wreck over here, Matt, because all I can think about is that bird.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And then just planning my turkey strategy so that I leave enough room for pumpkin pie, but not so much room that I eat too much pumpkin pie, right?

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's all about finding the right bandwidth for your stomach.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Right, and this is what you would think we would be concerned about right now.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But no, my friends, no.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We have more important matters.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Some big things are happening in the land of Linux infrastructure.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You might be familiar with Docker.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now, that could be because I talk about it all the time.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I talk about it too much.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Maybe we should just call this Docker Unplugged.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But this week, something big happened on the day we record live.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
A new version of Docker is out, and it promises to bring Docker to all Linux distributions.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And there's only one way I thought to get the appropriate official word on the new version of Docker, and that was to bring on Solomon from Docker.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He is the co-founder and CTO of the Docker project, I guess?

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What is the organization behind Docker, Solomon?

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So it is now officially Docker Inc, Docker.com.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And that was a transition from?

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, from.Cloud.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ah, right.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
.Cloud was actually, that actually sort of signifies a big transition in how you guys are structuring your business because it wasn't before.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Weren't you guys more of a software of a service platform, and now you're kind of transitioning to the Docker project?

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, so we're.Cloud launched in 2010 a platform as a service.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So if you're familiar with Heroku or Google App Engine, a hosted service that runs other people's web applications, basically.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And so we've been doing that for several years.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We still do it.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The product is still there.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We have lots of customers.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's a growing business.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The change of name is really to indicate that Docker is just going so crazy and growing so fast that the only way we can do a good job at maintaining it is making that the number one focus of the company.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So can we give just a real quick elevator pitch on what do you, when somebody says, hey, what is Docker?

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What do you tell them that just sort of makes it click for them?

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, it depends how technical they are.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Go technical.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't be afraid.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We have a brave crew with us.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So Docker is a container engine.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a way to package and deploy your application in a sort of a unit that can be moved around very easily from server to server and then executed on any of those servers in a very repeatable way.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And it uses a sandbox execution environment that I like to compare to how iOS or Android sandboxes its application.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So it's really that notion of it's one thing, you execute it, and it's running in its own little sandbox.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's not interacting in any way with other applications that may be running on the same server.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And so that gives you a lot of flexibility, a lot of power in how you deploy your applications.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It makes it much easier to automate.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And Docker is sitting on top of some new ish Linux technologies to accomplish this.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is that correct?

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, that's right.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And what are those technologies?

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So I mean, there is there's three main low level technology.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So the first is namespaces and it's the ability for the Linux kernel to execute processes and have them not see each other basically,

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
to kind of sandbox them so that the you know, simplistically, the process thinks it's alone.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And so you've got a bunch of different namespaces, PID namespaces, network namespaces, et cetera.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So a process can have its own network interfaces, its own process space.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So when it lists all processes on the system, it sees only its own, et cetera.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So that's the first. The second is one called cgroups or control groups.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And that is that is a subsystem in Linux that deals with everything resource allocation and resource accounting.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So if your process can get a certain amount of something and and another process can have another amount, that's cgroups.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So anything from memory allocation to CPU priority to how much IO you're allowed to consume, et cetera, that's all cgroups.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And so that's what allows you to run a bunch of applications side by side and do things like, hey, this application gets 100 megs of RAM.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This one gets a gig and they don't walk on each other's toes.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's number two.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And the third feature that we we've been using aggressively is copy on write file systems based on the ability to take a directory,

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
to take a file system and create any number of copies, a lot of copies potentially of that file system.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It almost instantly with very little performance overhead.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And in starting in version, if I'm correct here, starting with the version that came out today, 0.7, is the file system area one of the areas that we're seeing some of the biggest changes for this release?

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, that's correct. And these changes are what?

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So what we've done is we've taken the the underlying copy and write file system that we have been using from the very beginning,

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:37,000
the UFS and making that moving that from a hard coded default to an optional driver and shipping multiple drivers so that you can pick and choose from one.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You can pick one of those drivers depending on what your system supports.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So we're talking multiple Linux distribution support, almost all Linux distribution support.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes, that was a big that was the big the headline of the 0.7 release today.

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There is there's a lot there's a lot going on in that release.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll just start with that. You know, we kind of made a list of seven really important features that that that that shift of zero seven.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, but you know that definitely the one at the top is the fact that this is the first version that runs on a on a non modified standard Linux kernel.

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Which means that Docker runs on basically every every Linux distro, which was not the case before.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's awesome. I mean, that's a that's that.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So to me, what reason that takes Docker in a sense not to diminish the other features, the other six features,

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
but that takes Docker to a sense to sort of in a way becomes the great normalizer amongst Linux distributions because I can I can build up an application

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and its environment on a Fedora box. I can I can get everything running and then I can pick that up and I can move it over to a to a Debian box or an Ubuntu box

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and have the same exact performance results, et cetera, et cetera, that I should have on the other operating system.

92
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Correct. On the other distro. Yeah, it's it's like one of the big.

93
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Goals of Docker is to make that mobility easier, right, that the goal is really that across all the machines that you have access to from your laptop to your production

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
servers to your QA servers across multiple data centers, multiple infrastructures, in-house, public cloud, et cetera,

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:36,000
that the commonality between all of those is that they can run Docker and then you have this kind of big, really, really flexible playing field where you can just move containers around.

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Right. And that's really, you know, we keep using the metaphor of shipping containers.

97
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And I think at this point, everyone's sick about sick of hearing about shipping containers and Docker being the shipping container of computing.

98
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But that's really it's really relevant beyond the hey, let me explain to you containers for dummies. It's a really good analogy because a container shipping system is only as valuable as the sum of places where you can ship.

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You know, no one would care about a shipping infrastructure, a worldwide shipping infrastructure that that was supported by two cities.

100
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Right. No one cares about that. It's valuable because you can ship anything anywhere.

101
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And so that's that, you know, if you look at our roadmap for Docker, that's basically the goal that you can install Docker on any of your machines on one hand.

102
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And on the other hand, whatever it is that you're developing and packaging that Docker can can package it.

103
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So and this part of it, this packaging part of it is sort of one of the comparisons you always see thrown out whenever I talk about Docker in our chat room is jails.

104
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
People compare it to BSD jails.

105
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:47,000
One of the differentiators here and maybe you could go into a little detail here is I could build a Docker container that has Apache and MySQL all set up, ready to go.

106
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And then there is a way, a very Git like way for me to take that entire instance and publish it and then go to another machine or have or have a coworker or a fellow developer or whatever the scenario is, pull it down to their computer using another Git like command.

107
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Right. Yep. That's exactly talk about that a little bit.

108
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, I think there's a there's kind of this constant, you know, over time, we've been we've been Docker has been has been tested and used by a lot of people.

109
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And there's I don't know how many conversations about Docker I've been in, but it's a lot.

110
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And so there's kind of a pattern. There's kind of a pattern in the kinds of questions and reactions we get.

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And there's definitely one particular threat of reaction, which is basically, hey, this is nothing new.

112
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Jails. Well, even in Linux, OpenVZ has been around forever.

113
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Vserver before OpenVZ has been around forever.

114
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You know, Solaris zones, et cetera, et cetera.

115
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Even LXC, which is the kind of the newest of the bunch, has been around for a couple of years.

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So, you know, there's that question of, well, OK, you know, big deal.

117
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What you know, I will concede me, the expert sysadmin who has been using all these these amazing things for years, I will concede that, OK, this makes it easier for the beginner.

118
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But beyond being training wheels for the real deal, what the hell is Docker all about?

119
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And I hear that all the time. And I think there's a big misunderstanding, which is that, you know, Docker, we don't pretend to have invented this stuff.

120
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And we try really hard to make sure that constantly credits the you know, that the all the people building the really hard, important stuff that Docker is built on top of.

121
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So really, we're standing on the shoulder of giants here. What's really valuable, what's really new about Docker is that it's not just it's not just a new like a lighter VM, right?

122
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's not just, hey, I can I can start a machine faster. I can I can sell a VPS for for less because there's less overhead.

123
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's it's about using it's about creating a new unit of software delivery.

124
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Right. And the key word is delivery. It's moving things around, having that portable format and and and a portable runtime where you can specify in advance to the developer.

125
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Here's what's going to happen when when this application is run by Docker and everything that I'm telling you now about what's going to happen will be true for every single installation of Docker everywhere.

126
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And that's kind of a big deal. Do you suppose looking into your crystal ball of craziness going way out in the future as hard drives and bandwidth just become more and more plentiful?

127
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Could actual desktop applications be delivered this way?

128
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, I think so. I mean, you know, our focus is definitely the server first. But and if you had asked me six months ago, I said, well, you know, maybe one day, but but it will it will be a long time.

129
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Meanwhile, we have an entire subgroup, like an entire underground community without within the community that is porting Docker to to Raspberry Pi.

130
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, wow. That was my next question, because it seems like the Raspberry Pi is it is the perfect device for this because the overhead of virtualization is just way too much. Right.

131
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And it's a perfect thing. And you there's plentiful. You could have dozens of them. You could move Docker instances around on all of them. I mean, so is that happening? Is Pi happening?

132
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah. So there was a big blog post. I keep reading about it. I'm just like, wow, who are these people?

133
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But yeah, it's it's it's Docker. We don't officially support 32 bit architectures, mostly not because it can't it doesn't work.

134
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's basically there's an if statement in there. And if it's if 32 bit, then fail. And, you know, they've removed it and then kind of went through fixing problems as I find them.

135
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And yeah, there are people running Docker on Raspberry Pis today. Wow.

136
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And likewise. So embedded systems, I think there's a huge opportunity for that. And desktop applications, I see I see a lot of that going on.

137
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Not delivering, you know, not directly running the desktop application. A lot of the intermediary use case that I'm seeing is people want a desktop environment on the server.

138
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You know, they want a remote. They want a remote desktop. But, you know, but they don't want to junk up their main server OS.

139
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah. And they don't and they also don't want to set up like this one kind of special case desktop remote VM.

140
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They're like, you go you have to go and click around to make it work. They just like Docker run.

141
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There was this blog post about, you know, putting a like I forget the name that, you know, an open source alternative to the to the Microsoft suite, like all ready to go.

142
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So you would Docker run it and then you had an X window remote session, which would be, you know, tunnel through SSH.

143
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And then optionally, on top of that, you could have a VNC viewer, which itself had an HTML5 client.

144
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Wow. Wow. So a little desktop in the browser and, you know, under the hood, it was just a Docker container.

145
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So while we still have that crystal ball out, you know, looking at the future of Linux, this is such a great Linux solution.

146
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It seems to be that more and more people are getting behind, especially on the SUSE side of the fence, getting behind ButterFS.

147
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Any future plans? How does ButterFS play in with Docker? Because I know that there's some challenges there, isn't there?

148
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Like you couldn't use ButterFS in place of, say, an AUFS system, right?

149
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So the short answer is that I'm pasting a link to you right now, and that's a pull request for ButterFS support.

150
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, wow. There it is. And so we're probably going to merge it this week as, you know, under the experimental label.

151
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But the blocker, there was a blocker, you're right. And the blocker was really in the internals of Docker and how our code was organized.

152
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It just had to do with the fact that, you know, Docker had AUFS built in, hard coded,

153
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and it took a little bit of reworking to make that part optional and pluggable and find the right API and all that good stuff.

154
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And it took us a while. Initially, 0.7 was supposed to come out a little earlier, but eventually we figured it out.

155
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And now that we went from one to two drivers, going from two to three and three to ten is really not that hard.

156
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And so there's people experimenting with, you know, a possible ZFS driver.

157
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh, wow.

158
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
SEF, GlusterFS. There's some crazy guy doing something that has to do with automatically syncing to bit torrents.

159
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't know exactly what's going on there.

160
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Wow. That could be pretty cool, too, though.

161
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There's a lot of cool stuff you can do.

162
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So that's really like if I had to summarize what's going to happen going forward since I saw the crystal ball, right?

163
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yep.

164
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Before I get back to you, there's just going to be more of that, of taking things that are hard coded in Docker today

165
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and moving that to an optional plugin, defining an API and shrinking the core.

166
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And we're going to do that for storage, for networking, for sandboxing, for service discovery,

167
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
all of these things that, you know, there's no single true way of doing it.

168
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There is 10, 20.

169
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And everyone has a favorite, you know, everyone has a way they need to customize storage or networking or whatever.

170
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They should all be able to do it through Docker.

171
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm going to be deploying some Docker instances here probably in the beginning of the year because I'm a crazy guy

172
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and I like to have kind of a really rapidly rolling system as my main system, but I can bring up in Docker,

173
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I can bring up a Zimber installation and keep it nice and steady and stable running on top of a supported distribution.

174
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And I just look at this and I think this solves so many enterprise problems.

175
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This solves small business problems.

176
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This solves developer problems.

177
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And it also solves end user problems.

178
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And I think Docker is one of the most exciting things happening at the lower levels of Linux.

179
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So happy to see version 7 out.

180
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But you guys are still not technically saying, hey, this is ready for production, are you?

181
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You're still kind of saying we're still working on it.

182
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah.

183
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't know how long we're going to get away with that.

184
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Because people are using it.

185
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah.

186
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And I can tell you, I got an email.

187
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I mean, there are a lot of people who are very comfortable saying publicly that they use Docker in production.

188
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah.

189
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And, you know, basically we're saying, hey, we're not saying we're not forbidding you.

190
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Just a warning.

191
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If you do it, you better know what you're doing because we're not guaranteeing that anything will work properly.

192
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There is no particular reason.

193
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So people sometimes get suspicious.

194
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I mean, why are you saying that?

195
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What's going to happen?

196
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There is no one thing that's going to.

197
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's just engineering good practice, right?

198
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You code and we're an ops shop, right?

199
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We run people's apps in production.

200
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Right.

201
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We've been in that situation of, oh, cool, let's try that.

202
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Let's use it.

203
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It'll be fine.

204
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And then it blows up, of course.

205
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So, you know, but at the same time, you've got Yandex, you know, the Google of Russia, and they're freaking huge.

206
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You got Baidu of China, and they've got Docker in production on thousands of servers today.

207
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We got an email from a startup called Runnable.

208
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And they do like snippets of code like the Google, like, oh, how do I do this and that?

209
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And but then there's a run button and you click and you get to look a live running version of it.

210
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And they emailed us saying, hey, we have half a million Docker containers in production.

211
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Wow.

212
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Holy cow.

213
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So, yeah.

214
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Then, you know, what do you say to that?

215
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Right.

216
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
OK, well, let me know if you have a problem.

217
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So a question from our chat room.

218
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
They wanted to know, have you heard any indications that maybe this is one of the larger projects

219
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
running using Go?

220
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I think it's the biggest in GitHub, at least.

221
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I don't know.

222
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
We talked to the Go team, the core Go team a lot.

223
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I think, you know, we used Go as a very kind of pragmatic decision process.

224
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We're a Python shop originally.

225
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We're not, you know, Go fanatics.

226
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We're not really fanatics of any language.

227
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And we kind of reached the conclusion of using Go and started using it and liked it.

228
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
We kind of had that kind of gut feeling that it was cool, you know, as systems engineers,

229
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
that this was something we could rely on.

230
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah.

231
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And so far, it turned out to be completely true.

232
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's a great language.

233
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But, you know, what happened is, you know, Docker kind of blew up.

234
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It became popular very unexpectedly, very quickly.

235
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We were certainly not ready for it.

236
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And we're still paying the price now.

237
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I mean, there's chunks of code that, you know, you'll see, you know, fix me.

238
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This should not exist.

239
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And it's been there for, like, four months because we didn't have time to get around

240
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
to just cleaning it up.

241
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Well, you know, I talked to a couple of guys from the Docker project three, four, five

242
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
months ago, can't remember now, on the Coda radio show that we have on the network.

243
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And my comment then was, are you guys ready for how big this is going to get?

244
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Because, you know, I was a sys admin for 14, 15 years.

245
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And this, I mean, let me tell you, I saw all of the problems this solved.

246
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So I can see how it's blowing up.

247
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Do you feel pressure to get to 1.0?

248
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Do you feel like it's building?

249
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh, yeah.

250
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Oh, yeah.

251
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
A lot of pressure.

252
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I mean, there is just the pressure of, hey, a lot of people using it.

253
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You don't want to let them down.

254
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You know, you want that to be worth it.

255
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And now there's the additional pressure.

256
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You know, as a company, as an organization, a lot of businesses are betting their technology

257
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
platform on Docker, right?

258
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So it's kind of this double, you know, you don't want to let down your fellow maintainers

259
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and the community and give them crappy coding and kind of disappoint them.

260
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And you also, you know, you want to make sure that the businesses betting their technology

261
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
future on this.

262
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I mean, it seems kind of it is pretty crazy just how rapidly things happen.

263
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I think it's just a matter of good timing.

264
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So, yeah, the pressure is definitely there.

265
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But, you know, it's healthy.

266
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's good.

267
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's also some of it's also one of the sexier demonstrations of recent low level functionality

268
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
we've gotten in Linux itself.

269
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And it's kind of a neat way to see this, see several like you like the three core components

270
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
you touch on.

271
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's a neat way to see all three of them used.

272
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, very compelling use case.

273
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And so I think a lot of that's resonating with a lot of people.

274
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And the fact that you're sitting on top of these established technologies like namespaces

275
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and C groups, I think people feel a little more comfortable with that.

276
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah, I think it's just a natural fit.

277
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, it's a that's where I'm comfortable personally, that kind of that that junction

278
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
between low level systems and higher level APIs and platforms.

279
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And it's a very delicate it's really it's all about the art of, you know, finding the

280
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
right balance.

281
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If you go to too low level, then you kind of lose the end developer.

282
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What's the point?

283
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't care about this.

284
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And if you go to high level, then you kind of lose touch with the technical reality.

285
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And, you know, you start doing crazy abstractions that are pointless.

286
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's a really hard line to follow.

287
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But, you know, I think it's a really cool challenge.

288
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah.

289
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And the ultimate reward is when you talk to, you know, really hardcore systems guys and

290
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
say, oh, you know, I'm glad you guys exist.

291
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You kind of showcase what's possible with the hard work we're doing.

292
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah.

293
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yeah, that's very true.

294
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
That's pretty it's it's it's pretty cool.

295
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, the last I just have a last couple of questions.

296
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
One comes from the chat room, Bacon Flaps, which is always a great name.

297
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
He wants to know if you could share a little bit about your teams, the ID you use and the

298
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
any kind of tool chain info you could share.

299
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So we're all we're first of all, it's very different from person to person.

300
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I am the least like what's the word like I'm the least sophisticated person you can find

301
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
in terms of working environment.

302
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

303
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I use stock V.I. on my little digital ocean V.M. right.

304
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And I'm happy.

305
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Awesome.

306
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And I think like seriously, people make like everyone in the team makes fun of me is like,

307
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
what?

308
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You didn't tune this.

309
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Like, no, I'll have to remember how to do it again.

310
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah, exactly.

311
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I totally know what you mean.

312
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So and then it's funny because the rest of the team is kind of split between super, super

313
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
intense, super jacked up.

314
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Emax set up and then super tunes V.I. set up.

315
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And I'm like there in the middle, like, you know, with my with my shitty set up.

316
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
No, no, no other ideas really.

317
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I mean, you know, it's it's it is systems work.

318
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So we write and my rule of thumb is, you know, for example, I don't even have C tags configured.

319
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
So when I, you know, when I when I want to look up the definition of a function, I'm

320
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
calling I got to remember which file to go to and go look it up manually.

321
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And I also something that everyone else makes fun of me for.

322
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But I like it that way.

323
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That's kind of my my canary when I when I can't keep it on my head just by moving around

324
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
in files.

325
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I know it's time to refactor.

326
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The code's too complicated.

327
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Oh, you know, that's that's my thing.

328
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Good point.

329
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Good point. All right.

330
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Well, is there anything you want else you want to touch on before we let you get back

331
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
to your Tuesday?

332
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Let's see.

333
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah, there is one.

334
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I mean, yeah, there's a whole list.

335
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Well, we wrote a blog post about the 07 release.

336
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah.

337
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You want to go through some of that?

338
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah.

339
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
There's there's there's a lot.

340
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So I don't want to go through all of it.

341
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh, you know, I'll just encourage everyone to go look at it.

342
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I'll have I'll have that linked in the show notes as well as a getting that you're getting

343
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
started guide.

344
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You guys have is great.

345
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And also a little info about this.

346
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
We'll have the link to this which you're about to cover in the show notes.

347
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So go ahead.

348
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah.

349
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Any parts you want to go through?

350
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm all for it.

351
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I love it.

352
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,080
I love the support for links.

353
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,640
That's because it's a it's a it's a it's a small incremental improvement, but it's the

354
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,360
beginning of a really important part of the roadmap, which is orchestration and service

355
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,960
discovery and basically going from one container in isolation to lots of containers working

356
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,440
together on lots of machines and forming a stack that you can manipulate as as a cohesive

357
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
entity.

358
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
Interesting.

359
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,360
So is this like network networking ports like a turn on networking ports and open for everyone

360
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
in that stack?

361
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Yeah.

362
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
So.

363
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
So this first step is very simple.

364
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,640
It's basically and the feature is called links.

365
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,840
And what it allows you to do is basically connect container A to container B. OK.

366
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,840
So that one can discover and connect to discover the open the ports exposed by the other and

367
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,800
connect to them in a standard way.

368
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,400
Oh, that's really nice.

369
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
That makes it much easier.

370
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Yeah.

371
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,540
So basically you do, you know, Docker run database and then you'll say Docker run front

372
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:27,680
end dash link database and then that the database is linked into the front end and then the

373
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,120
front end can now connect to the database in a simple standard way.

374
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,560
And it's you know, it's it's very simple for now.

375
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,260
It's it's local to one machine only for now.

376
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:44,400
It uses the simplest possible means of discovery and its environment variables, which is both

377
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,680
simple and easy to start using and also limited like it can't change dynamically at through

378
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,000
as the as the process continues to run right.

379
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,440
If you want to attach a new dependency, you have to restart.

380
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,240
So all of that we're going to fix in future versions.

381
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,140
But the fundamentals are there and it's a super, super important part of Docker's roadmap

382
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:10,800
because here's the thing contained the way people use containers.

383
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,520
Is is as a group, right, increasingly, if you got a single container, you can you can

384
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,600
do things, but pretty quickly, like, OK, this is great.

385
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,840
I want more of them and I want to wire them up together.

386
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,840
Absolutely.

387
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
Here's the risk.

388
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,800
The risk is that, you know, the risk is fragmentation.

389
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:32,800
We put a lot of effort in in in building this runtime that is standardized and works the

390
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
same way everywhere.

391
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,320
That way, once I have a dozen of them, I don't have a nightmare of management on my hands.

392
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Right.

393
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,480
Yeah, because it could start to become it could start to get really wily after you have

394
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,520
four or five, six, seven, a dozen, 20 of these things that could be really nuts.

395
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Yeah.

396
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,440
And so in the same way that we you know, we want any container, any image you get from

397
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,560
the index, from anyone that produced a produce an image from using Docker anywhere that that

398
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,320
should run on a 100 percent of all Docker deployments the same way.

399
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Right.

400
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,440
And now we're reaching the point where a lot of these containers, part of their functionality

401
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,520
is to be connected to other containers.

402
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,880
If I if I build the off the most awesome Postgres container you can think of and I share it

403
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,440
with you, you know, what you want to do with that database is connect to it from from another

404
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
container.

405
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,520
So how containers can be plugged into each other needs to be standardized.

406
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,760
Otherwise what will happen is I'll give you this that Postgres container and say, hey,

407
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,560
here's my standard database container.

408
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,400
Oh, by the way, you can only use it if you happen to use ZooKeeper and and and Mezos

409
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,800
because that's what I use for orchestration or you need open stack heat or you need whatever.

410
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,080
So but to solve that problem we need to just put in there just one does that the smallest

411
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:53,080
possible amount of standardization so that every container uses the same mechanism for

412
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:59,720
finding another container and then machine by machine you can customize how it's done.

413
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,800
You can still use Mezos, you can still use a pack, you know, open stack heat, you can

414
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:10,400
still use all of those different orchestration tools, but the container doesn't need to know.

415
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,320
So anyway, that's that's a really important part of it.

416
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,320
Awesome.

417
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
There's gonna be a lot more.

418
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,080
I can't wait to watch as more comes out and I'd love to keep a line open to you guys just

419
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,560
to come on in the future when you get closer to 1.0 as you build towards that because it's

420
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,080
an awesome project.

421
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,280
Thank you.

422
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,120
We have gotten a lot of good response from our audience too.

423
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,720
I think there's a lot of people out there are finding use cases for it too.

424
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,080
Definitely and and one call to action if I could just add one more thing is that if there's

425
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,960
one place that I recommend anyone go if you want to learn more about Docker or just interact

426
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,560
more or ask questions or complain or anything at all.

427
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
It's the IRC channel.

428
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,680
It's just it's the one place, you know, pound Docker on on free node.

429
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,320
There is a lot of people.

430
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,840
It's super active and people are very nice and I don't know about you guys, but I sometimes

431
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,040
I kind of get a bad first experience from open source IRC channels because it can be

432
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:07,440
elitist and kind of it can make you feel stupid if you're a beginner and I'm very it's up

433
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,920
there in my top three, you know, things I'm most proud of in Docker is the fact that everyone

434
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,120
is super helpful and nice on that channel and there's like 600 people there.

435
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
That's awesome.

436
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
That's awesome.

437
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,840
I would say first thing if you have if you're interested in any way just go there and talk

438
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,880
and just or hang out and see what's what's what's going on.

439
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
Very good.

440
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
All right.

441
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,240
Well, thank you very much Solomon for coming on the show today and congrats on the new

442
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
release.

443
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Thank you.

444
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
Appreciate it.

445
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,640
And folks can find more at Docker dot IO will also have links to all of that good stuff

446
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,880
in the show notes and I cannot wait to see as it at version dot eight comes out and then

447
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
dot nine.

448
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
And I don't know.

449
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
I don't think I'm going to wait till dot one Solomon.

450
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
I just have to warn you.

451
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
I think I'm going to be putting in production before then, but I won't tell you I won't

452
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
stress you out.

453
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
All right.

454
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
You know where to find me if you have a problem.

455
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Okay.

456
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
Well, thanks so much for coming on the show.

457
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
Okay.

458
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Thanks.

459
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
Appreciate it.

460
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
All right, Matt.

461
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Well, that was fun.

462
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
And how great was that?

463
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,160
That was all worked out because I know they're pretty proud of that new release and it sounds

464
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
really great.

465
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
So I mean, it was great.

466
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
It was fantastic.

467
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
Yes, it was.

468
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,480
You know, he mentioned he mentioned something in our chat with him that I think maybe now

469
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,080
be a good time to take a little break and mention to the good folks at home.

470
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,640
And that is our sponsor this week.

471
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,760
And that's digital ocean.

472
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,960
Digital ocean is simple cloud hosting that you control.

473
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,840
I'm talking you get the root account of this bad mama jamma and it is yours.

474
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,020
And digital ocean loves Docker.

475
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,000
So if you're not familiar with digital ocean, let me let me give you the background here.

476
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,700
Digital ocean, simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

477
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:42,660
easy to spin up cloud servers ever use users like, you know, you, me, I do it in 45 seconds,

478
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,600
but maybe you'll get it done in 55 seconds to spin up a totally your own server.

479
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Pricing plans are great, too.

480
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,580
They start around five dollars per month.

481
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,320
Five dollars per month gets you five hundred twelve megs of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD drive,

482
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,960
one CPU and a terabyte of transfer.

483
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,520
Digital ocean has data centers located in New York, San Francisco and Amsterdam.

484
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,040
In fact, I've got last time I checked, there's two data centers in New York.

485
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,760
And the way I've done it is since I'm here on the West Coast, I decided I have some stuff

486
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,680
here on the West Coast that I host out of my own house on my files business connection.

487
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,960
And then for the stuff that I need to have a little bit better performance on or stuff

488
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,240
I just want to help supplement me on the West Coast, I set up a digital ocean VPS in and

489
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,480
I think there's like their New York, New York number two server.

490
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,160
And now I've got it on both ends of the continent, it's on the continent, both ends of the United

491
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
States of America.

492
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,800
It is it is really great for the functionality I'm using for in this case, it's BitTorrent

493
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,520
sync with some supporters and a few other a few other functionalities they need internally

494
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
to the network.

495
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
I just I pay five dollars a month.

496
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,920
But what's awesome is if you're like, yeah, I think maybe there's some things I could

497
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,920
use this for.

498
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
I'm not quite sure.

499
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,160
Well, we can get you a ten dollar credit.

500
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,880
And if you get the five dollar a month system like I've got, that'll get you two months

501
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,400
for free when you use the code Linux 13.

502
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,560
One word Linux.

503
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
You know about Linux.

504
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,860
You like Linux, right?

505
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,200
So use that code Linux.

506
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
And then 13.

507
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Why 13?

508
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Lucky number.

509
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,240
Actually, that's just the episode they joined us like Linux 13.

510
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,820
Digital Ocean also offers a vast collection of tutorials in their community section.

511
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,840
And you can submit you can submit to that community section and get paid fifty dollars

512
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,200
per published piece.

513
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,280
So if they decide they want to publish what you've written, you can get a fifty dollar

514
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
fifty dollar bone.

515
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,880
I think they probably give you and I don't think of your bones or if they give you credit,

516
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,440
but you get fifty dollars from Digital Ocean.

517
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,540
I will have a link to that in the show notes.

518
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,540
But I wanted to back up.

519
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,600
So we were just talking about Docker and with Solomon from Docker.

520
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,840
And one of the things that's really nice, in fact, I'm going to go log in and show you

521
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
this right now.

522
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,320
Just take a second.

523
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:43,780
But so one of the challenges I've had is I'll get something all set up here at the house

524
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:49,280
and then and then it works well enough that I don't actually ever go put it public because

525
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,280
the time it would take to to go reset it up again is just I'm not interested.

526
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,640
I've already spent my time setting up.

527
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,880
It works like I started experimenting.

528
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,320
The experiment was a success.

529
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
And then it ends up in production.

530
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
Right.

531
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,360
And it's always like, well, this is just going to be temporary and then it never ends up

532
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
being temporary.

533
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,720
You can get right.

534
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,440
So this is what this is why I think Docker is going to be really brilliant is I could

535
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,000
take Docker, I could set up the instance that I want to create.

536
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,800
So maybe in my case, it's a BitTorrent sync.

537
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
Maybe it's a Zimbra server.

538
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,680
And here I'll show you if you're watching the video version.

539
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:27,640
I go in, I name my host name on DigitalOcean and I'll just call this Helper.

540
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,680
And I'm going to choose the five dollar month, five twelve megs of RAM, one CPU, 20 gig SSD,

541
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,800
one terabyte of transfer for five bucks a month.

542
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,260
Oh, they they also have hourly rates.

543
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
They have hourly rates.

544
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,160
If you just want to try something for a little bit, I'm going to choose New York, too.

545
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:45,840
Now, so on the select your image, I can choose Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Arch, Linux or Fedora.

546
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Yeah, Arch.

547
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,440
That's not any crazier than Fedora on a server, right?

548
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
That's awesome.

549
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
I mean, come on.

550
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
Not at all.

551
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Not at all.

552
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
Nothing wrong with that.

553
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
No.

554
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,920
But they also have application images.

555
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
And look at this.

556
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Which is very, very cool.

557
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
Big time saver.

558
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Saves you time, right?

559
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,920
Yeah.

560
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,960
WordPress on Ubuntu 12.10, Docker 0.7.

561
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,880
The version that came out today.

562
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,120
That's crazy.

563
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Right there.

564
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:15,360
Ubuntu 13.10, or I'm sorry, 13.04, 64 bit.

565
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,800
And if I just if I click create droplet, I now have a Docker system ready to go.

566
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,720
And I would just use that Docker check in and check out process.

567
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,080
I would check in my Docker instance, log in over SSH and just check it in on this machine.

568
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
And I'm done.

569
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
I started and it's running.

570
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,520
It's like I'm all done.

571
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,080
All that work I did set up on my local machine.

572
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,080
I just upload it.

573
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
I started.

574
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
It's brilliant.

575
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,480
And this shows you how sophisticated DigitalOcean is to have version 0.7 today.

576
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,800
And what's beautiful is inside that Docker container, even though this is a Ubuntu 13.04

577
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,080
image that would be running in the host operating system, I could have a CentOS base in there,

578
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
right?

579
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,160
I could have I could have an arch base in there.

580
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,720
I could have anything inside that container.

581
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,240
It's just so awesome because it totally normalizes the underlying operating system and DigitalOcean

582
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
is down with it.

583
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,440
And you load that on top of their super fast SSD drives and the crazy great bandwidth and

584
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,280
the terabyte transfer you're getting for five dollars per month.

585
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,280
That's cheaper than a lunch at Jack in the Box.

586
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,840
And you have an awesome VPS server that can just load anything you need.

587
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,400
It's totally ready to go and is totally a quantified cost.

588
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
I think that's awesome.

589
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,800
So use our code Linux 13 when you're checking out over DigitalOcean and you'll get two months

590
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,960
of credit.

591
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,200
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

592
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Oh, definitely.

593
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,520
And you got to love the fact that you are able to not only find yourself among the most

594
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,280
bleeding edge stuff possible, but I mean, but it actually happens today.

595
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,200
I mean, like, I mean, the fact that it's being released today, we thought we had the big

596
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,360
scoop because we got the CTO on the day it comes out.

597
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,080
Meanwhile, DigitalOcean is like, yeah, what else?

598
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
We already have in production.

599
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,080
Let's go.

600
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Hey, Matt.

601
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:55,240
This is CNN breaking news, a little breaking news here in the unplugged headquarters.

602
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,220
Turns out Jack in the Box does not exist in the Southeast.

603
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,240
So seriously, I did not know that.

604
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
My apologies.

605
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:07,240
I made a I made a reference to a crappy burger joint that I still sometimes eat out.

606
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,360
But that's not even in the Southeast.

607
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,800
So I'll take it up a notch.

608
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,280
Did you know that the Waffle House doesn't exist up here?

609
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,320
Yeah, I don't know, though, because I would tell you what, to my knowledge anyway.

610
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
Well, here's why.

611
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Here's why.

612
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,320
It's so funny.

613
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,320
You bring that up.

614
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
That's kind of weird, actually.

615
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:27,560
So there's this site I just heard about called Coinmap.org and Coinmap.org is a Google Maps

616
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
overlay.

617
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,000
I think it's Google Maps that shows you all the places around you that accept Bitcoin.

618
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,280
And since Bitcoin is the only form of currency I now have to my name, I thought I maybe should

619
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,040
get familiar with the places that accept it.

620
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,240
And I kid you not.

621
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,360
And I don't know.

622
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,140
It's ironic that you brought this up because I was seriously looking at this like two hours

623
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
before the show.

624
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,520
We hadn't talked before the show.

625
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,560
But two hours ago, I was looking on a Coinmap.org and oh, this is Waffle Stop.

626
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,200
All that build up and it's not Waffle House.

627
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,200
It's Waffle Stop.

628
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,280
But there's a Waffle Stop in Bellingham that takes Bitcoins for waffles.

629
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
Oh, is there really?

630
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Yeah.

631
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,320
Bellingham is pretty, they're pretty good at adopting new technology.

632
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,560
I'm not terribly surprised.

633
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm surprised there's not a few medical cannabis stores on this map.

634
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
That seems like a match made in heaven.

635
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,960
No, that's on the way to Anacortes.

636
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,960
I mean, not that I know anything about that.

637
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
So anyway.

638
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,840
You know, they get a drive through going, right?

639
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Okay.

640
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Yeah.

641
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,120
If you guys want to check out Coinmap.org, it also uses, if your browser supports location

642
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,240
APIs, it'll be creepy and figure out where you're at.

643
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,400
So okay, Matt, here's what I did.

644
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,680
I brought in the Mumble Room, our online Linux users group, and I figured they could help

645
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,960
us answer some of our emails.

646
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,040
Since we're doing the show a little out of order, I wanted to get our guest on and talk

647
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,440
about that because I'm a bit of a docker slut, so I felt like I needed to chat with

648
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
him.

649
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
Well, aren't we all?

650
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
Right.

651
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Right.

652
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
Well, it is pretty cool.

653
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,040
So Eric the Great wrote in, and sometimes I make jokes here on the show.

654
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,740
And what I'm about to tell you is not a joke at all, I'm 100% serious.

655
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:05,440
Eric the Great wrote in a very long email and he wanted to talk about how the problem

656
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,760
with Linux on the desktop is that it's lacking apps.

657
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:16,280
Ironically, Eric sent the email as an attachment in a doc X format.

658
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,560
Now I got to believe he's screwing with me a little bit here, right?

659
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Maybe, maybe.

660
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,520
But he may have a point to a degree.

661
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
Let's hear what he has to say.

662
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
All right.

663
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,320
It's been so, so long that I can't read all of it, but he says, industry specific apps

664
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,880
are either not available for Linux desktops or not as mature as they are on their Windows

665
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,880
counterparts.

666
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,560
Number two, there's not enough software that's configured to work by de facto standards.

667
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,360
Don't know what he means by that.

668
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,160
There's no good desktop groupware clients for the Linux that replace Outlook.

669
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,160
Okay.

670
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Arguably true.

671
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,440
Except for Zimber desktop is pretty good.

672
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,680
Number four, the other thing that's a good Linux desktop needs is properly integrated

673
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
features.

674
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,440
Many times there's a piece of software that Linux just works, that works well.

675
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,120
MakeFS is one of these encrypted NFS, unlike TrueCrypt, it provides it.

676
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
Okay.

677
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
Anyways.

678
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,640
And the thing to remember is the desktop should be usable offline.

679
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,440
Oh, is Pope in here?

680
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
Oh, is Pope in here?

681
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,820
Oh, the desktop should be usable offline for a small business when the server or internet

682
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,200
connection goes down.

683
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:20,280
You know, I feel like his main complaint was the applications he wants to buy aren't available

684
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
for Linux.

685
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Well, here's the meat and potatoes of it that everybody fails to get is.

686
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,420
And Linux users do it, Windows users do it, OS X users do it.

687
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,000
If it doesn't meet my requirements, then it affects the entire world around me.

688
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,140
And it just drives me nuts.

689
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,140
It drives me nuts.

690
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:40,040
It's like for myself, honestly, 99.99999% of what I do is in Linux.

691
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,360
I mean, like I literally, the only time I actually run Windows is when I need to run

692
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,680
for business purposes, multiple video conferences in Skype.

693
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,720
And because it doesn't happen to be supported in Linux, that's literally for myself the

694
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,200
only reason that I would.

695
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,920
So and there's other people that have other needs.

696
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,040
Maybe they have an AutoCAD need or maybe they have other specific things.

697
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,240
But I think it's more task oriented.

698
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:06,680
To claim that the platform is flawed or not usable based on the fact that he's not finding

699
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,640
it meeting his needs is ridiculous.

700
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,440
I agree, although you can apply that same argument to the Mac.

701
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,560
But here's my take on it.

702
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:21,080
It's like if I'm Eric the Great, I'm good for probably the next 10 years, right?

703
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:26,640
I got Windows seven's got support till until I don't know when, like for a while, right?

704
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,200
And then even then, yeah.

705
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Oh wow.

706
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Wow.

707
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
That's amazing.

708
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,960
And then even then, like if I really, really still loved Windows in 2020, I can probably

709
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,040
jump on the eight dot one bandwagon, install some crappy extra software to give me a start

710
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,080
menu and make it even for a few more years.

711
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
Right?

712
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Yeah.

713
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
But like there is a path.

714
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,520
But even then, Eric's got to be sitting here going, man, I'm really about to get screwed.

715
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,080
This is this is not going in the right direction.

716
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,160
I mean, he's got to be sitting here thinking, what am I going to do?

717
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,680
Maybe I mean, not immediately, right?

718
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,480
No, but he hasn't experienced that he hasn't experienced the pain point yet for him.

719
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,120
His pain points that he's experiencing is that he's missing specific applications that

720
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,240
do certain things that he's used to the way he's doing it or that even its availability

721
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,240
and that may be the case.

722
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,720
And I think history will look back and go, boy, look at all of the things Microsoft did

723
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:20,480
to enable their own downfall because I actually think extending Windows seven support to 2020

724
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,720
what you're doing is you're giving time for alternative ways of doing things to develop

725
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,840
and people are going to come up with replacements.

726
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,960
And I talk about this more and more now where I think like video editing on Linux is a good

727
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,760
example of something that will never match the proprietary commercial offerings.

728
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,480
I mean, you can now buy like I don't actually know what the actual price is, but I think

729
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,760
Final Cut 10 is like ninety nine bucks and motion is like ninety nine bucks and you could

730
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,800
make TV grade productions from that from those products.

731
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,440
It's not going to happen on Linux and if it does happen on Linux, it's going to be too

732
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,320
far too late because things like Google Hangouts are going to get better and WebRTC where it's

733
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,340
not really taken off yet.

734
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,200
There is such industry support for that that there's going to be products built around

735
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,920
WebRTC and today when we say video editing in the cloud, that sounds effing crazy.

736
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,440
Well by 2020, it's not going to sound that effing crazy because it's going to be so doable

737
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,520
that there will be software packages that clowns like me that broadcast from a garage

738
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:24,240
can buy that use WebRTC and I do all of it through my web browser and then I just download

739
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,240
the final file to my Linux box and apply any final touches to it.

740
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,840
And what my point here is, is this is going to completely change the way video editing

741
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,840
is done.

742
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,160
So it's not that the existing method of video editing is going to come to Linux.

743
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,960
We're just going to do video production in new ways and Linux will be there when those

744
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,560
new ways are developed.

745
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,960
And I believe it is the same for CADs and all this kind of stuff.

746
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,360
It's just going to take a really long time.

747
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,920
And it'll all run on Docker, obviously.

748
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,520
Well, I mean, you know what I'm saying, it could totally happen.

749
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,560
Yeah, I mean, I've already seen early attempts at like online video editing, very young,

750
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,260
very much not ready for primetime and it's very, you know, Windows Movie Maker level.

751
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,320
But the stuff does exist.

752
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,320
It's already beginning to happen whether people want it to or not.

753
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Yeah.

754
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,360
Visit the Google Chrome extension store sometime.

755
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,360
I think you'd be surprised.

756
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,440
There's a lot of stuff there.

757
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,440
Not Jupiter Broadcast, you know?

758
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
No, not there.

759
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
All right.

760
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
So Craig writes in.

761
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,440
Go ahead.

762
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Well, that's the thing.

763
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,320
Today, like connectivity is extremely simple.

764
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,640
We've got LTE, we've got 3G.

765
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,480
So it's not hard to be wireless and connected now.

766
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,880
The whole Microsoft ad as well is just stupid.

767
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,180
It's like, oh, yeah, if you're not connected to the internet, you can't use it.

768
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,040
That's not entirely true.

769
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,920
But when are you not connected to the internet?

770
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,880
I mean, I'm always connected to the internet now.

771
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,920
Like anywhere I go, even if I go into like the woods where like it's all Blair Witchy.

772
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,800
Well, and I guess maybe the better question is what are you doing in the woods?

773
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,800
Whoa.

774
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Yeah.

775
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,800
Whoa.

776
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,800
With your laptop, too.

777
00:44:51,800 --> 00:45:00,800
I would challenge him to run a Linux distro for a month and find those alternatives because

778
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,160
it doesn't sound to me like he's done his research.

779
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,960
No, I'm going to wager that this is someone who has, it's what I call a drive-by review.

780
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,720
Well, basically they stuck their toes in it.

781
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,720
Well, come on.

782
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:20,440
I mean, I don't know, like if I went to work every day and needed After Effects, I mean,

783
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,440
it comes down to needing After Effects.

784
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,440
No, that's fair.

785
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,220
But I think he was happy where he was at.

786
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,080
Someone probably recommended he check it out.

787
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,080
He half-assed it.

788
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,080
He tried it.

789
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,840
And it was kind of like, eh, not really for me.

790
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,840
I'm happy where I'm at.

791
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,920
He gave his honest opinion.

792
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,720
We got a lot of emails from people who say that converting to Linux is like, you got

793
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,560
to understand, it's not just an alternative software selection, it is an alternative way

794
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,960
to use your computer.

795
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,960
Oh yeah, God, me using OS X is like newbies trying to use Linux.

796
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,760
I understand the frustration of stuff.

797
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,040
Believe me, I scream at Mac all the time.

798
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,040
I can't deal with it.

799
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,880
So I understand like that switching platforms frustration.

800
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,240
I totally get that.

801
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:01,120
But then again, when I'm yelling at the Mac, it's because I'm half-assing it.

802
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,120
I'm not trying.

803
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,120
I'm like, this is hard.

804
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,120
I give up and I go back to Linux.

805
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,120
It's fine.

806
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,380
Well, the thing about the Mac, and this is sort of the truth about the Mac, there's two

807
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,240
ways to do things.

808
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,800
There's Apple's way that they let you do it, and then there's no way to do it.

809
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,280
And if you're okay with the Apple way, then the Mac will work for you.

810
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,300
And if you ever kind of want to go outside that box, that's where it starts to become

811
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,300
a frustrating experience.

812
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,720
But I'm a special kind of idiot.

813
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,080
And you know, when it comes to using OS X, I can, can I do it?

814
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,120
Yeah, I can do it.

815
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,240
Do I find it to be the most ass backwards way of doing pretty much everything?

816
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,240
Yeah, I do.

817
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,560
I just, I can't deal with it.

818
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,000
The way they, the way they lay things out, I've always frustrated me.

819
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,280
I've always gotten grief on it.

820
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,280
Well, idiot, it can use a Mac.

821
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,280
Well, then I'm a special kind of idiot.

822
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,280
I don't know.

823
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,280
That's okay.

824
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:43,200
You know, I was like, you can use it and want to, or two different ways.

825
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,040
Well, Mac is also genius because when you make, you move files and drag and drop files,

826
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,600
it doesn't, it doesn't make a copy for you.

827
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,920
It makes a shortcut, which everybody wants.

828
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,920
They lost me when I started ejecting stuff by dragging it to a trashcan.

829
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,920
I'm done at that point.

830
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,920
It's like, you know what?

831
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:05,920
Hey, I know Apple is, he used Ubuntu and then he saw those Amazon ads and was like, what?

832
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
Oh, hell yeah.

833
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,920
Yeah.

834
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,880
There's that controversy, but that's just a jab.

835
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,680
Craig writes and he says, Hey Chris and Matt, I love Linux Unplugged and I haven't missed

836
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,680
an episode yet.

837
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,040
Converting to Linux, even for a veteran admin is something no one really wants to do.

838
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,520
There are just too many distros to choose from.

839
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,680
Going through the late nineties, like you said on episode 15 is hardly, is hardly heard

840
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,160
of losing him here about this.

841
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,600
Let me read ahead a little bit.

842
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,560
Upon switching, I had no issue at all as I became more and more interested in computers

843
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,120
and learning what the command line was.

844
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,520
However, my situation was as almost perfect situation as it could ever be for a Linux

845
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,520
convert.

846
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,800
My girlfriend can log into a Ubuntu 13.04 and open up a new tab to research something

847
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
for college.

848
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,080
My mother calls me with her wireless mouse, battery's dead and proceeds to tell me she

849
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,080
needs a new computer.

850
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,420
And that's essentially all I have to worry about.

851
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:58,080
But he brings up the point that it's just a big hassle to switch over and, and it's

852
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,920
not even a matter of being better.

853
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,780
It's a matter of, uh, being a, of a familiarity, right?

854
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,780
It's a matter of that.

855
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,780
I agree with.

856
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,780
Yeah.

857
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:12,200
So I go back to, I go back to, I look at this and I think, uh, uh, he thinks that, uh, you

858
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,280
know, as you, as you make the switch over, it's just kind of all going to be based on

859
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,560
what your motivations are.

860
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,520
Um, he says, uh, I, he said, if, if, if East East, well, this is one part of that was interesting.

861
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,960
He said, if each distro came together and focused on the major issues like video drivers,

862
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,840
auto audio drivers, audio, video editing, software, gaming, then Linux would be a thousand

863
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,040
fold better than windows or Mac, uh, hands down.

864
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,680
I, you know, well, and see, there's another one of those statements.

865
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,120
It's like, okay, the video drivers and audio drivers, again, based on someone's personal

866
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,580
experience where they running a machine, which clearly is giving them some grief with it.

867
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:48,200
I have no problems, but I run, I run computers that I fortunately are compatible with what

868
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,200
I'm using.

869
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,440
So, you know, is it truly a widespread problem?

870
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,640
Honestly, you really want to get the brass tacks.

871
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,500
I would say windows has more, uh, retroactive, uh, compatibility issues with driver support

872
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,040
than Linux ever will.

873
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,080
So, you know, so yeah, it's kind of like, it's all perspective, I suppose.

874
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,080
So I mean, yeah, absolutely.

875
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,440
There are people out there that will find that, you know, they get a black screen when

876
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
they boot from a live distribution.

877
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,440
Hey, wait a minute.

878
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,400
Did you install the drivers first or did you connect the USB device first?

879
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,680
Because if you connected the USB device before you installed the drivers, it's not going

880
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,680
to work.

881
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,680
Sorry.

882
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,300
And it's really important when you have a Palm Pilot to not install the drivers and

883
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,520
plug that in first because that always works really well.

884
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,520
I remember those days well.

885
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,200
God, it used to frustrate the hell out of me.

886
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:34,480
My wife has a MacBook pro and sometimes it'll sit on her lap and she'll shut the lid and

887
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,680
go to put it underneath the sofa and I'll see the light still on and I'll say, hang

888
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,680
on a minute.

889
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,280
That's, that's not right.

890
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,840
And my, my game OS, uh, desktop windows seven doesn't suspend.

891
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,000
It flat out won't suspend.

892
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,440
I've tried to spend the energy, it just doesn't, I've gone through all the knowledge base articles

893
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,040
and I cannot make it work.

894
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:59,040
And no matter how many drivers or firmware or BIOS updates I put on it, it just doesn't

895
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,040
work.

896
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,640
It's just me that the windows and OS 10 outclass Linux on the driver department is talking

897
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,640
out of their ass.

898
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,640
Yeah.

899
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,800
I've got, I've got one windows machine left in the house.

900
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:14,040
I booted into it, uh, two weeks ago for Koda radio.

901
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:19,000
And after I was done with that episode of Koda radio, I went to shut it down and it

902
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,860
would only go back to the login screen.

903
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:24,600
If I restart or shut down, it would only go back to, that's all they could do is log out

904
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,320
and then just hold the power button down.

905
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,960
It didn't matter what I clicked.

906
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,200
And it's just like, what really?

907
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,200
This is, this is ridiculous.

908
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,400
Well, and the one last one, my wife's Mac, her Mac specifically, it never fails.

909
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,280
I put, we go ahead and we put it in suspend as soon as we're ready to go to bed, it comes

910
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,280
to life all by itself.

911
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,280
Hey, are you sleeping?

912
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,280
Are you sleeping?

913
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,080
And it's always Facebook that kicks it on.

914
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,080
It's like, what the hell?

915
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,080
You know?

916
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,080
It misses you, man.

917
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,080
It misses you.

918
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,080
Oh, clearly.

919
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,080
Yeah.

920
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,080
It's, it's beckoning me.

921
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,080
Have you checked the iTunes store?

922
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,080
Come log into iTunes.

923
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,080
I got a very special crowbar with its name on it.

924
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,080
I'll tell you, man.

925
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,240
All right.

926
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,880
So Bob wrote in, this is just a quick one.

927
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,120
He says, great show my experience with mom and dad users that they not only need to use

928
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,920
a web browser, but also an office suite.

929
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,580
I know many of these users who struggle with windows eight.

930
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:14,560
So I moved a few of these people to Ubuntu 12.04 where they're all able to get by without

931
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,920
any tinkering with the default install.

932
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,800
These users were unable to learn windows eight at all.

933
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,760
So I disagree with some of the statements on Linux unplug that new users need to tinker

934
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,760
more with Linux.

935
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,080
I think the intermediate users probably do, but certainly not new users.

936
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,520
Ubuntu and Mac are only two OSs that I found new users can just pick up with no help.

937
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,520
Yeah.

938
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,920
I think, I think it depends on how you define new user.

939
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,920
My favorite new user is someone that has zero experience with a computer because they have

940
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,920
no perceived misconceptions.

941
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,520
Fewer and fewer of those people now though.

942
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,520
Yeah, they're still out there, but it's nice and nice.

943
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,520
Unless you live out where I live out in the backwoods.

944
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,520
Right.

945
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,520
Yeah.

946
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,960
You go out in the country or, you know, you go up into the older demographics and you

947
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,960
can find them still.

948
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,520
I mean, we still have people chasing cows around with USB cords.

949
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,520
It's scary.

950
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,520
But yeah.

951
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,800
Well, windows eight really is.

952
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,000
I mean, I'm sure I probably overshared this story, but I'll just share it again because

953
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,440
I haven't told it on this show.

954
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,480
When windows eight came out, actually when it was, when it was like, I guess it was done

955
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,480
with RC or whatever, where you could download a trial for a limited time.

956
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,160
You didn't have to buy it.

957
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,440
And so I had a client that had five computers.

958
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,620
So they had this room where they had QA people because they ran a website where they posted

959
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:27,800
things that had to be QA'd all the time because they came from outside sources.

960
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,160
So they had a team of about a dozen QA people and they had about five computers that were

961
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,760
not being used because they would only kick them into gear during the heavy season.

962
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,960
And then during the slow time they would, it was temp staff and they wouldn't, those

963
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,440
computers wouldn't be in use.

964
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,800
So I took those five computers and per the client's request, loaded the eight one demo

965
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,640
or trial on it and which you could re extend a couple of times.

966
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,920
And I did have to extend it one time.

967
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,640
So we put these five users of various proficiency.

968
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,620
One that I would say is he's definitely not a technical user, but he knows windows seven

969
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:05,960
so well that he showed me a couple of things and I know windows pretty well.

970
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,840
I've, you know, used to support it for years.

971
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,160
And so he's, he's definitely sophisticated.

972
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,480
I mean, he'd never know anything about like event viewer or, you know, any of that kind

973
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,920
of stuff, but he probably knows about device manager and he can definitely install printers

974
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,920
and all that kind of stuff.

975
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,480
Then I had a user who, you know, is pretty much still struggling with the fact that the

976
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,920
mouse has two buttons and one of them does something different than the other button.

977
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,840
So good range, right?

978
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:33,240
And none of them, none of them could figure out how to shut down the windows eight computer.

979
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,420
Oh, it's confusing.

980
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,420
None of them could.

981
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,160
Cause the thing is, is they won't, they won't just go poking in the corners.

982
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,920
They won't just go down there if there's no visual indications for them.

983
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,380
And none of them even paid attention to the tutorial, even though I played the tutorial

984
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,220
for all of them that comes with windows a, they didn't, they didn't help at all.

985
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:54,240
And the other thing that was constantly confusing for them was the, the thing they were QAing.

986
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,880
They had to QA a version of it in IE and a version of it in Firefox and a version of

987
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,880
it in Chrome.

988
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,280
Well, cause the IE one uses active X, only the problem was the Metro version of IE doesn't

989
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:08,760
use active X. So, and they kept getting confused between, wait, am I in IE on the desktop?

990
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,360
Am I in IE in Metro?

991
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,480
And the, why is the address bar on the bottom and this UI and why is the address bar on

992
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,480
the top in this UI?

993
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,920
And totally disconnected from it.

994
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:23,560
And these same people, these same users for a, for a short period of time were on an XFCE

995
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,980
desktop and had none of these problems because it, because first of all, who the hell uses

996
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:28,980
hot corners?

997
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:29,980
I mean, that's the problem.

998
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:30,980
So.

999
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:31,980
Yeah.

1000
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,600
Uh, Chris Lee, uh, my friend was looking up, looking to update his laptop.

1001
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,680
So we went online, we found the model.

1002
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:45,480
We ended up with a HP Smudge, I believe, and it came with Windows 8.

1003
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,000
He's not overly familiar with Windows because when he was first getting into computers,

1004
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,920
I actually convinced him to actually use Ubuntu.

1005
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,400
So he's always been an Ubuntu user.

1006
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,360
He used it for a week and he said there was so many weird things, like because there was

1007
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:03,000
a touch screen, he said we'd type stuff and then Metro would just pop up for no reason

1008
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
at all.

1009
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And he said, it was just, I'm like, yeah.

1010
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And he's just like, he got so frustrated and like a stupid things like when he's trying

1011
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,720
to do like the HTMI out, um, he didn't quite understand you got to slide the bar over and

1012
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,080
then you've got like the mirror, but like, it's not just mirror.

1013
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:20,200
You've got like options for like screen resolutions, but the screen resolutions was wrong for the

1014
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:25,520
TV and it killed like the screen on the monitors when it was on the TV.

1015
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,520
He had so many hassles.

1016
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,600
He said, look, he said, I don't care anymore.

1017
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,380
He said, just come over, put that operating system on that I've been used to because I

1018
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,680
absolutely hate Windows 8.

1019
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,160
I explained to him that like, you know, I'm not going to be able to draw a boot properly

1020
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,880
because it's got U F I E problems.

1021
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,400
I said, I can do the thing where you do like escape.

1022
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,840
He said, no, I do not want Windows 8 at all.

1023
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,080
He said, I absolutely hate it.

1024
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,480
He said, I don't want it.

1025
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,560
So you know, people, and he's not very computer literate.

1026
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:55,680
He's pretty useless on the computer, but he can work his way around it perfectly fine.

1027
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,080
I think it's what you get used to using.

1028
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,400
I realized something when Chris said earlier that people didn't know how to do the shutdown

1029
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:07,640
and I have messed with a Windows 8 and 8.1 and I've helped people like walk them through

1030
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,800
things and when you said that, I realized that I have never shut it down on Windows

1031
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,800
8.

1032
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,840
I have no idea how to do it.

1033
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,200
It's a, I I've worked with eight and it's definitely a, but first you got to do the

1034
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,340
hokey pokey and then you shake it all about, twirl around in a couple of circles and then

1035
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,440
finally it will appear.

1036
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,440
It's the weirdest thing, but yeah, it's about, it's about three different options.

1037
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,440
It's be dug into.

1038
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,440
Yeah.

1039
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,440
Yeah.

1040
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,320
The funny thing about Windows 8.1 is that they brought back the start button but not

1041
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,320
the menu.

1042
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,320
Yeah.

1043
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,360
So when people who have a start menu, like a third party installed, that it, they're,

1044
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,520
the buttons are in the same place on top of each other, so there's like a 50 50 chance

1045
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,520
which one you click.

1046
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,520
What a train wreck.

1047
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,520
What a train wreck Windows is becoming.

1048
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,520
It is so, wow.

1049
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,520
Oh, it abuses me.

1050
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,520
I'm, I'm fine with it.

1051
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,520
I mean, let's be honest.

1052
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:53,960
I mean, I used to do PC repair and Windows is what drove me to Linux.

1053
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,720
I mean like actually repairing other people's stupidity is just, that's literally what drove

1054
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,720
me to it.

1055
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,720
You know?

1056
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,240
So two, two more emails and then the grand question I want to ask you and the, and the

1057
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,760
mumble room.

1058
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,080
But first we should, we should thank our second sponsor this week.

1059
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,080
So everybody knows about Ting now, right?

1060
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,760
Everybody knows about Ting cause Ting is sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

1061
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,760
Now Ting is mobile that makes sense.

1062
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:23,100
And I want you to go over to linux.ting.com linux.ting.com will get you $25 off your first

1063
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:28,920
device or $25 off your first month of service if you already have a sprint compatible device.

1064
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,920
Now.

1065
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,040
Oh, guess what?

1066
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,360
My Nexus 5 shipped today.

1067
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,600
My Nexus 5, I'm supposed to, freaking UPS is I'm going to get it tomorrow.

1068
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,600
I don't know if that's possible.

1069
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,600
I am so jealous.

1070
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,600
I am so excited.

1071
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,080
Are you going to be cackling at the poor man as he watches it?

1072
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,520
Oh, well I'm going to give him a handy.

1073
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,520
Are you kidding?

1074
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:51,040
I'm, he's, I'm excited to get my Nexus 5 and here's why I think this is a better time than

1075
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,040
ever to sign up for Ting.

1076
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:58,320
First of all, if you have the internet phone with the iOS 4 or 4S, iPhone 4 or 4S and now

1077
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,240
compatible with the Ting network, you go over to the BYOD page, which you can find over

1078
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,600
at linux.ting.com and they'll give you all the info you need.

1079
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:09,020
If you've got a sprint compatible iPhone, if you've got the Nexus 5, this is what is so

1080
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:13,720
awesome about Ting is they've been very transparent about the entire process because first of

1081
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,240
all, they're a CDMA network, which is a huge boon here in the US because that gets the

1082
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,520
signal through areas that GSM just doesn't generally penetrate as well.

1083
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,640
And so one of the things that a CDMA carrier has had to deal with for sort of the first

1084
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:30,120
time is a phone that requires a SIM card because that's generally something that's only on

1085
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:35,520
the GSM networks and it's been really awesome and encouraging to watch the Ting folks very

1086
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:40,480
publicly in their forums and in their blogs work with their community, work with the experts.

1087
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,880
It's so awesome to see a cell phone company recognize that people in their audience know

1088
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:50,360
a lot about these Android devices and are very savvy and very capable of helping them

1089
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,960
have a better service.

1090
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:57,280
It's huge for me as a Ting user and to see them work to get the Nexus 5 with their community

1091
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,520
has been awesome and it's what gave me the final push to make my Nexus 5 purchase.

1092
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:09,340
I cannot wait to combine the power of purchasing directly from Google on Google Play and unlocked

1093
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:14,560
Google experience Nexus 5 phone and then bring it over to Ting, which is no contracts, no

1094
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,080
early termination fees and you only pay for what you use.

1095
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,600
That is such an awesome combination and I want you to go over to linux.ting.com to get

1096
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:27,760
started and by the way, if you're in a contract now and you've been thinking about switching,

1097
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,920
Ting is going to give you some early termination relief.

1098
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,520
You can get more information at ting.com slash ETF.

1099
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,600
They're going to give you about up to $75 I believe it is per line that you have to

1100
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,600
get canceled.

1101
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,400
All you got to do is grab your Ting device, port your number, then submit your ETF claim

1102
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,520
and Ting will help you get out of that contract and then you're only paying for what you use.

1103
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,280
They include hotspot, they include tethering, their customer support is amazing.

1105
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,640
about the Nexus 5.

1106
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,920
They'll just talk to you about the Nexus 5 like you got questions on how that's going

1107
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,200
to work, how's picture messaging, all that kind of stuff, you just talk to them.

1108
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,560
They'll give you, they'll help you out.

1109
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:05,560
They've also got help.ting.com which gives you lots of resources.

1110
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,360
You can find out more information, do discovery and exploring on your own.

1111
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,120
So go over to linux.ting.com to get started.

1112
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,120
You're going to love Ting.

1113
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,120
It makes sense.

1114
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,120
It's no BS.

1115
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,120
No hidden fees.

1116
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:20,680
You can pay for what you use, $6 per line and you can share it pooled minutes.

1117
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,880
It's really awesome.

1118
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,240
So I want you to go try it, linux.ting.com and go get started now because the sooner

1119
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,640
you switch, the more money you'll save in the long term.

1120
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,060
I love those guys.

1121
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,140
They keep my bills stupid cheap.

1122
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,140
It's great.

1123
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:33,140
I know.

1124
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,140
It really is awesome.

1125
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,140
I kind of feel like I'm cheating a little bit.

1126
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,140
I don't know.

1127
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,720
Well, that could be interpreted depending on what you have in mind for the UPS guy.

1128
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,720
I don't know.

1129
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:43,280
Once you're mentioned in there, it's like, wait, what?

1130
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,640
So Carl wrote and he said, dear Linux, please keep on breaking.

1131
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:48,640
What?

1132
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,920
He says, my typical day is I fire up windows when I'm at work because there's no efficient

1133
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,280
way to get around the fact that they have like a dozen proprietary windows only apps

1134
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,280
they require me to run.

1135
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,400
And since I already have windows set up for work, I also get caught in playing steam games

1136
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,320
on windows because well, F, if I got the windows installation, why not?

1137
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,320
He says.

1138
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,160
However, as soon as the clock strikes five and the workday is over, I hit the switch

1139
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,240
on my desktop and boot into Linux.

1140
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,200
The best way I can describe that moment is coming home from a hard day's work and throwing

1141
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:20,840
off a stiff suit before putting on your sweatpants and cracking up a cold one.

1142
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,000
Heading out to the garage to restore that car or something like that, Linux will always

1143
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,280
fight me, which is to be expected since I have a multi-headed setup with three monitors

1144
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,880
of different sizes and resolutions.

1145
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:37,000
And I'm also sending my sound over HDMI to the one of the monitors connected to my Nvidia

1146
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
card.

1147
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,060
In other words, I'm begging for trouble with broken X, but that's fine.

1148
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:45,380
That's part of why I love it, because when stuff breaks and has to be fixed, that's when

1149
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:50,960
you learn how it works, why it broke, and how you can configure it better than before.

1150
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,340
Hell, half the time I'm almost hoped for something to behave unexpectedly, so I'll have a reason

1151
01:01:55,340 --> 01:02:01,560
to sit down and have a puzzle to solve, he says, walking out knowing a lot more than

1152
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,560
I did before.

1153
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,720
And I think it's one of the hidden charms that keeps a lot of people away from the platform.

1154
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,720
Oh, okay.

1155
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:12,000
He says, and that allowed me to move quite quickly from hand-holding Ubuntu installation

1156
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,600
to running two servers, a laptop, and a desktop under arch.

1157
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,440
I had everything just working.

1158
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,840
I might have gotten bored and jumped back full-time to Windows, but now with the challenge,

1159
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,840
I press on.

1160
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,800
He says, most people can live with Linux.

1161
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,400
Tinkers can hardly imagine living without it.

1162
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,480
Also, all this time spent on Linux has taught me a few still valid tricks on how punching

1163
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,320
my Mac in the face through the terminal when it's ill-behaved.

1164
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,320
Nice.

1165
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,240
Which is also a reward to itself, he says.

1166
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,240
Keep up the good work.

1167
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,640
Once again, thanks for the great show, Carl.

1168
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,640
Good time.

1169
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,000
I'm going to be honest.

1170
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,080
I think one of the things that keeps me on Linux is the tinkering factor.

1171
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,440
Yeah, I mean, for me, well, see, for me, I think it's different.

1172
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,240
It's the consistent behavior.

1173
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:00,200
And like I said, what drove me to it initially was the fact that I was watching, I don't

1174
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,240
want to say de-evolution of humanity, but it felt like it at some days, to where people

1175
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,160
were not only being dumbed down using these other operating systems, but quite honestly,

1176
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,880
it was like it was more operating system than they needed, that Linux could in fact fill

1177
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,880
these needs.

1178
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,000
And a lot of people, when I actually retired from it, I switched them over to Linux, and

1179
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,520
then occasionally provide some remote support, and it works out really well.

1180
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,440
I don't have the problems I used to have with it.

1181
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,440
So different strokes, different folks.

1182
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:29,040
In fact, to put it all in perspective, Terence wrote in, and the headline was...

1183
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,040
Oh, go ahead.

1184
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,960
Yeah, Matt, I completely agree with that.

1185
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,560
If you're going to install Linux onto someone's laptop or computer, definitely install Team

1186
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,560
Viewer.

1187
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,560
So when you do...

1188
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,560
Oh, yeah.

1189
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,560
Yeah.

1190
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,560
So you could just...

1191
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,560
It takes two seconds.

1192
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,560
Team Viewer in, click, click, done.

1193
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,560
And you sort that PC out.

1194
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,560
Exactly.

1195
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,560
Yeah.

1196
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,560
Yeah.

1197
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,560
Or Splashtop.

1198
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,560
Yeah, Splashtop.

1199
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:51,560
Remote access, regardless of what system they're running.

1200
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,560
Yeah.

1201
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,560
Exactly.

1202
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,560
Yeah, totally.

1203
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,560
That was a real game changer for a lot of folks, for sure.

1204
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,560
Mm-hmm.

1205
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,320
You know, all of that's going to get real crappy, by the way.

1206
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,320
I believe.

1207
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,320
Yeah.

1208
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:04,440
I believe that Landon and Mir both proposed to make those remote viewers much more challenging.

1209
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,440
Well, that's important.

1210
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,440
Yeah.

1211
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,440
Because, you know, I mean, we have something we can really be proud of, but let's break

1212
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,440
it.

1213
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,440
Good news, everybody.

1214
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,440
Yeah, right.

1215
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,440
It's like, okay, Dr. Nick.

1216
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,440
Good to know.

1217
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,560
And then we'll have to go back into the virtual machine remoting.

1218
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,560
Yeah.

1219
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,800
You know, I help people out in Birmingham and stuff on Team Viewer.

1220
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,880
Team Viewer is like a must if you're trying to wean someone off like weaned Hazel Mack.

1221
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,880
Yeah.

1222
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,880
It really is, yeah.

1223
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,880
You've got to have that hand-holding experience.

1224
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:32,360
Yeah, I have not used Team Viewer as much because I don't like the... Isn't the client

1225
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,680
on Linux a wine app?

1226
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,440
It is a wine, it's a self-contained bottle, yeah.

1227
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,440
Yeah, yeah.

1228
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,440
Yeah.

1229
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,800
And see, with Splashtop, they actually have a native Linux app, and I just... I use that

1230
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,600
to get into my mom's machine, and it's click, click.

1231
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,760
You know, it's so fast.

1232
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,320
I like that.

1233
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:50,960
So in terms of... You mentioned Mir and remote desktoping.

1234
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,840
That won't be a problem for a while because the next LTS release we're going to is going

1235
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
to still have X.

1236
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:00,520
So for the next five years after 2014, it's not a problem.

1237
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,520
Right.

1238
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,520
Yeah, true.

1239
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,520
Yeah.

1240
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,520
That's a good point.

1241
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,520
I mean, I guess that's the silver lining.

1242
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,520
Good enough for me?

1243
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,520
Good enough.

1244
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,760
Whalen, however, proposes to introduce that problem.

1245
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,760
They are working on...

1246
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,760
Yeah, those guys.

1247
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,760
Oh, come on.

1248
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,760
Whalen at Whalen today.

1249
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,800
Actually, I think the Whalen guys are working with somebody from one of the VNC groups to

1250
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,840
figure something out, but it is good times.

1251
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,200
But I think all of this... I think we all need a little perspective right now.

1252
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,200
So Terrence writes in.

1253
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,640
He says, back in my day, insert old man's voice, back in my day, when I installed Linux,

1254
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:38,280
there was a distro called Slackware, and it was an unholy beast in its infancy during

1255
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,800
the late 90s.

1256
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,880
One of my beloved 386 XSs.

1257
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,600
It took 10 hours to compile the Linux kernel, and one misstep would ruin your install.

1258
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:52,660
Consider yourselves lucky whiny Nancy boys that you even have a window manager or a graphical

1259
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,000
settings manager.

1260
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,400
There's no Google back then.

1261
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,120
All I had was a 500-page Slackware book that came with way too many floppy disks for the

1262
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,120
installation.

1263
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,120
Installing Linux...

1264
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,120
Yeah.

1265
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,120
We want it, Nancy boy.

1266
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,120
That won me over.

1267
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,560
Installing Linux back in those days was a blast because it was an adventure with numerous

1268
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,560
pitfalls.

1269
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:15,720
You used Linux with pride because it was your baby made with your sweat and tears.

1270
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:19,520
Linux is far from perfect, but I feel sorry for people who are locked up in Apple and

1271
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,120
Microsoft's jails.

1272
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,680
They are narrowing their dimensions of yourselves every day, and eventually all that will be

1273
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:29,640
left with their services that they'll sell at a premium.

1274
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:34,120
Linux is the wild, wild west of operating systems, and may God bless Linus.

1275
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,120
Wait.

1276
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,120
Linus is our God.

1277
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,120
Terrence.

1278
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,120
Wow.

1279
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,120
Tell us how you really feel.

1280
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,120
Praise Linus.com.

1281
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,120
Yeah.

1282
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,120
Really.

1283
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,120
Yeah.

1284
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,120
I like to hold you.

1285
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,120
That was pretty good.

1286
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,120
Thank you.

1287
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,120
Thank you.

1288
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,120
I was just connecting with him there.

1289
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,120
Yeah.

1290
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:57,600
So I have one... We're getting a little tight on time, but one of the things that we've

1291
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,640
been looking forward to on the Linux Action Show is getting our hands on that new Leopard

1292
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,640
Extreme from System76.

1293
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,640
Oh, yeah.

1294
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:07,040
Well, so we just got word from System76.

1295
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,040
It's better than that.

1296
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,040
Oh, yeah.

1297
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,560
We're also going to get the new Kudu, right?

1298
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,560
That's what it's called, the Kudu?

1299
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,560
Yep.

1300
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,560
Kudu.

1301
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,200
And we're going to get their Ultrabook with a brand new keyboard arrangement that they've

1302
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,680
just set up for it based on their purchaser feedback.

1303
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:25,960
So I thought I'd ask you guys, as we get ready to review these... And I'm going to start

1304
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,800
with Matt to give the mumble room time to think.

1305
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:33,700
Matt, what for you... If you were going to buy a computer, what are some of the key things

1306
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,400
you need in a Linux workstation?

1307
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:39,440
Well, and I think we already know that, obviously, compatibility is already set with Ubuntu, so

1308
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,440
that's a no-brainer.

1309
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,440
That's done.

1310
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,800
But I think a keyboard's a really big thing for me.

1311
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,120
Keyboard and the actual touchpad placement itself, how that feels.

1312
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,480
Do those keys feel responsive?

1313
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,480
Are they working for me?

1314
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,480
Because I'm really crazy.

1315
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:54,800
So if you were in the market right now, would you buy a desktop or a laptop?

1316
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,360
Based on current needs, laptop and a stone cold second, yeah.

1317
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:05,000
But based on if I needed both, I would probably say desktop first, because I'm kind of weird

1318
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
like that.

1319
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,920
But yeah, based on current needs, totally laptop.

1320
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,840
And I'm really, really specifically weird when it comes to keyboards and laptops.

1321
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,880
And System76 has been really good overall.

1322
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,680
If I only had one keyboard, I wasn't really in love with, but most of them are really

1323
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,680
awesome.

1324
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,680
All right.

1325
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,680
Just a couple of things for me, I would love... Because you don't really see it on a laptop

1326
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:24,680
keyboard.

1327
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,680
I'd love a keyboard with backlight.

1328
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,680
I could see the keys and stuff.

1329
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,680
Yeah, yeah, right.

1330
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,680
I understand that.

1331
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,680
You guys are all really focused on laptops.

1332
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,680
Yeah.

1333
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,680
I want the Bonomo.

1334
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,680
Screen resolution or laptops suck.

1335
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,680
They still suck.

1336
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,680
Many of them not even 1080p.

1337
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,680
Yeah.

1338
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,680
Yeah.

1339
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,680
The high resolution on the laptop's important.

1340
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,680
Sure.

1341
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:46,360
I mean, I got a tablet in a higher screen resolution and most tablets, not to use laptops

1342
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,360
on the market.

1343
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,960
It's ridiculous how low screen resolution laptops are.

1344
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,160
So what about on the desktop though?

1345
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,800
Like what do you look into for a desktop, like for the ultimate desktop?

1346
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,800
Quiet.

1347
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,800
Yeah.

1348
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,800
That's what I was thinking too.

1349
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,800
Quiet.

1350
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,800
That's what I was thinking.

1351
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,800
Quiet and power.

1352
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,960
And also not having to wonder, okay, how much of what am I maxing out now?

1353
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,880
Or do I have enough resources to do this?

1354
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,880
So expandability.

1355
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,880
Yeah.

1356
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:08,880
Powerful.

1357
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,880
Yeah.

1358
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,880
Power and expandability and quiet.

1359
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,880
Those are two different things.

1360
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,880
Case quality too.

1361
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,880
Case quality.

1362
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,880
Case quality.

1363
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:20,520
While I want the quietest computer, I want the loudest clacky keyboard to show that I'm

1364
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,520
actually working.

1365
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,520
Right.

1366
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,520
I know what you mean.

1367
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,520
Old IBM style clacky.

1368
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,520
Yeah.

1369
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
They've got to get the jerry switches.

1370
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,880
There's a few people in Mumble with very loud keyboards, so I can.

1371
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:30,880
Yeah.

1372
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,880
Yeah.

1373
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,880
Yeah.

1374
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,640
On TechSnap, I often joke that Alan's keyboard is the third host because he's got one of

1375
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,920
those Razer with the clackies.

1376
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,920
Yeah.

1377
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:42,520
So this is what I'm thinking for a desktop's quiet expandability, case quality.

1378
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,040
It sounds like on a laptop, we got keyboard, backlight.

1379
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,160
It's funny because so far nobody said battery life or wireless.

1380
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,760
Oh, that's a good point.

1381
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,760
Yeah.

1382
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,760
The battery life, yeah.

1383
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:52,760
That would be helpful.

1384
01:09:52,760 --> 01:10:00,040
I always want an SSD no matter what, desktop or laptop.

1385
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,360
No way I'll ever go to a hard drive now.

1386
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:07,840
SSD is kind of getting just the only way to go now.

1387
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,200
The only feature on a laptop that is a go no go for me is if the keyboard doesn't have

1388
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,400
a touch point on it, I don't want it.

1389
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,400
Like the little nipple?

1390
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,400
Yep.

1391
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,960
If it hasn't got one, I don't want it.

1392
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:19,960
Really?

1393
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:20,960
Yeah.

1394
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,760
I've spoken to the System76 guys about it and I was like, dude, last time I bought a

1395
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,720
laptop, I bought a ThinkPad and if you had a nipple on your laptop, I would totally have

1396
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,720
bought it.

1397
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:39,760
I'm the opposite, I hate those nipple things.

1398
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:40,760
It hurts my finger.

1399
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,760
Yeah.

1400
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,760
Well, with all due respect, you're wrong.

1401
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,920
For me, I feel like I should be buying it dinner first or something.

1402
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,920
It just feels weird.

1403
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,240
It just feels incredibly intimate and awkward.

1404
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,240
I don't know.

1405
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,240
Pope is all about his nipples.

1406
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,880
It's how you caress it, whether it's good or not.

1407
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,880
I'm Scaramanga.

1408
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,880
I have three.

1409
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,880
For Chandler.

1410
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:10,040
Going back to the Touchpad, I would say the clickable buttons, I cannot stand Touchpads

1411
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,320
without clickable buttons.

1412
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,320
Right.

1413
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,320
Actual clicks.

1414
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,320
That's how my H is.

1415
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,320
You need that tactile.

1416
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,320
Yeah.

1417
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,320
Yeah.

1418
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,320
Yeah.

1419
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,320
Yeah, the Trackpad.

1420
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,320
I feel like right now, which is funny because it doesn't match what you're saying, even

1421
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,000
though I completely agree with you, I feel like the only people who have the one button

1422
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:33,280
Trackpad really great is Apple because even on my Bonobo, I totally can use it.

1423
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,920
In fact, I appreciate that it has two finger touch scrolling because that is a very natural

1424
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,360
kind of way to scroll a web page and stuff.

1425
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,900
But generally, if I'm going to sit down like what I'm doing last, and it's partially how

1426
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,480
I sit too, but I still prefer to go to a physical mouse.

1427
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:52,480
That's why I'm... Is the Trackpad or the nipple, is it really that big of a deal?

1428
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,480
Is it a make it or break it?

1429
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,280
It's kind of like the Touchpad that you can do like a zoom in for like a Google Earth

1430
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,760
and we can see the multi-touch on the Touchpad.

1431
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:10,320
The nice thing about the nipple is with the middle mouse button, you can hold your... If

1432
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:16,880
you imagine holding your index finger on the nipple and your thumb on the... Don't... Steady.

1433
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,680
And your thumb on the middle mouse button, you can use that for scrolling.

1434
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:26,200
Usually when I'm laying on the sofa and I've got my laptop, I'm making such minimal movement,

1435
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,200
I look like I'm dead.

1436
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,280
So your thumb is on the Trackpad still?

1437
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,840
So your thumb is scrolling on the Trackpad?

1438
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,160
No, the middle mouse button.

1439
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,840
It's got three mouse buttons below the space bar.

1440
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,840
Oh, right, right, right, right.

1441
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,840
Okay.

1442
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,840
So for you, it's about effective behavior.

1443
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,840
It's about an effective experience.

1444
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,840
Totally.

1445
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,840
Yeah.

1446
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,840
Okay.

1447
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,840
Okay.

1448
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,840
Hmm.

1449
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:48,000
I have my... The only thing I want on a laptop is the button to turn off the Trackpad.

1450
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Right.

1451
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Oh, yeah.

1452
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Yeah.

1453
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Yeah.

1454
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
You can just install an app for it.

1455
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I forget what the hell it is, but yeah.

1456
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Yeah.

1457
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I have... It's funny.

1458
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I have a button on my Bonobo.

1459
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,120
If I hold down Function F1, it turns off the Trackpad.

1460
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,880
And if I hold down Function 1, Function 1 turns all the fans on at full blast, which

1461
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,880
is funny because-

1462
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,880
Oh, really?

1463
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,240
The Bonobo is quite well ventilated.

1464
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:11,240
It has two big fans in the bottom of it, and then it has these big vent outtakes in the

1465
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,240
back.

1466
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:16,140
So I've never actually heard it kick up to full fan speed until the day I accidentally

1467
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:21,560
pressed Function 1, and I was like, whoa, this thing really is... I was going to take

1468
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,560
off.

1469
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,560
It's like air wolf in your lap or something.

1470
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:24,560
Right.

1471
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,080
But now that I know, it's like every now and then I'm like, yeah, I'm about to do something

1472
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,080
that's a lot of work.

1473
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,080
Maybe I'll just kick the fans up for a second.

1474
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,080
Yeah.

1475
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,080
And then I just smack it.

1476
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,080
That's pretty cool.

1477
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,080
That's pretty cool.

1478
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,080
Rev the engine, Matt.

1479
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,080
Vroom, vroom.

1480
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,080
Yeah.

1481
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,320
And there's also those apps you can install that will actually keep it... When you're

1482
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,680
typing on your keyboard and your touchpad's being bumped into, you need to be able to

1483
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:40,680
disable that, too.

1484
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,680
Yeah.

1485
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:42,680
So sorry, I didn't mean to go there.

1486
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,360
I was talking about laptops, so make sure it has enough ports, too, because a lot of

1487
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,360
times you want to get one or two USB ports in a one-way...

1488
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,360
Oh, yeah.

1489
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,360
Okay.

1490
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,360
Let's talk about it.

1491
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,360
Let's talk about it.

1492
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,360
That's a big one, actually.

1493
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,360
For both workstations and laptops.

1494
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,360
So let's first do laptops.

1495
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,360
I'm writing all this down for our review.

1496
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,760
So okay, on laptops, connectivity.

1497
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,000
So we're talking USB is a must.

1498
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,360
Now, USB... Now, remember, we're getting less and less ports these days, so we've got to

1499
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,360
keep it realistic.

1500
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,360
Yeah.

1501
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,360
HDMI out?

1502
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,360
Is that a must?

1503
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,360
No.

1504
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,360
Not for me.

1505
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,360
Yeah.

1506
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,360
Yes.

1507
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,360
Whoa.

1508
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,360
That's what I was going to say the other week.

1509
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,920
I want USB ports just like... I want it to look like a UFO.

1510
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,760
So maybe we'll just put the difference and say we have to have good video out.

1511
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,760
Yeah.

1512
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,760
So video out.

1513
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,760
Yeah.

1514
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:26,240
Because it's really handy if you've got like HDTV, you've got Netflix or... Well, because

1515
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,240
it works on Linux now.

1516
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:32,400
You can just shove your laptop, put it underneath your TV, connect a wireless keyboard or mouse,

1517
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,480
and then you can just sort of like surf on your laptop and use it as sort of like a home

1518
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,480
feature PC.

1519
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,480
Oh, yeah.

1520
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,480
Basically.

1521
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,480
Yeah.

1522
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:45,440
So if it's got Bluetooth built in, that's amazing because I just flip on a Bluetooth

1523
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,240
mouse and go.

1524
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,040
Firewire at 100.

1525
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,760
The bacon flaps is mentioning none of us... Nobody said anything about price yet.

1526
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,760
I guess that's a scaling kind of requirement.

1527
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:55,760
That's a scaling thing.

1528
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,760
It depends on what you value.

1529
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,000
But honestly, I want this thing to look like a hub.

1530
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,800
I want USB ports all the way around it.

1531
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:05,720
I mean, don't talk... I want danglers dangling and I mean, yeah, I'll give up HDMI any day

1532
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,720
because I don't need it.

1533
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:07,720
No, sorry.

1534
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,400
What would you use the USBs for?

1535
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,640
I never know.

1536
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,360
I never need them until I'm missing them.

1537
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,360
It's wicked.

1538
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,360
Yeah, that's the thing.

1539
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:18,560
See, that's... I have the same question because my laptop only has two USB ports.

1540
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,560
Mine has three.

1541
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,560
Mine is filled with a Bluetooth.

1542
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,560
How about a DVD drive?

1543
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,560
How about a DVD drive?

1544
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,560
How about a DVD drive?

1545
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,680
I've just bought a seven port USB three hub from Amazon that's arriving tomorrow because

1546
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:32,480
my laptop only has one USB three port and I want more.

1547
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,480
More.

1548
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,480
Yeah.

1549
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,480
Yeah.

1550
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:38,480
Well, I have like an old 2008 era system 76 laptop here and it's got four, which is

1551
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:43,240
good but I would be perfectly happy with like 12, eight, you know.

1552
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,280
Yeah, that'd be good.

1553
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,960
What's people's views on a DVD drive?

1554
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,080
I'm not really that big anymore.

1555
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,080
Not anymore.

1556
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,080
Optical is dead.

1557
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,080
All right.

1558
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,080
Legacy media.

1559
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:54,080
Optical is dead.

1560
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,080
All right.

1561
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,080
So I go with that.

1562
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,080
I don't keep it around.

1563
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,080
I keep it around.

1564
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,360
That's just because I burn DVDs for people.

1565
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,920
Well, that's why you need that USB port.

1566
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,920
Yeah.

1567
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,840
And I have external what not for that.

1568
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,920
That's what I do now too.

1569
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:05,920
And that's true.

1570
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:11,400
So, um, you, so, uh, you know, when I, when I expect the bonobo, I went the direction

1571
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,640
of getting a drive, a disc drive.

1572
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:19,160
And now looking back on it, I do wish I had gone with like a third disc in that spot because

1573
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,780
like with the Cuda machine, they're saying this, you can actually do an S there.

1574
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:27,380
They have two slots for SSD for drives and then they have, you can swap out the optical

1575
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,520
bay for a drive if you want to.

1576
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:34,000
So you can do three SSDs and a laptop, which if you think about it, like you could, you

1577
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,640
could dedicate an entirely separate OS to one of those drives if you wanted to.

1578
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,640
You could do anything.

1579
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,880
So yeah, I agree.

1580
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,800
Optical is probably dead and I'm going to, all right, so that's a good list right there,

1581
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,800
you guys.

1582
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,800
Thank you.

1583
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,280
So that'll be, just kind of wanted to get some updated requirements from folks.

1584
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:51,480
I was going to have passive 3d, but that's a little bit different for laptops.

1585
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:57,080
There is one, there's, you know, your microphone and headphone port merged together nowadays

1586
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,080
on the more recent.

1587
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,080
Yeah, they are.

1588
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,080
You're right.

1589
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,080
Audio jacks.

1590
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,080
Yeah.

1591
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,240
So if you want the two separate jacks or one which is combined together.

1592
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,240
Right.

1593
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,480
The one that's combined together, you can get an adapter for pretty cheaply on Amazon.

1594
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,200
So that's really not too much of a factor.

1595
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,200
Yeah.

1596
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,760
Well, some people have these very specific mics, simply just how they don't ever want

1597
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,760
to change programs.

1598
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,920
Sometimes they have this special microphone that they want to plug in, which is not, you

1599
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,640
know, like what they're used to.

1600
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,640
Very true.

1601
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,640
True, true, true, true.

1602
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,720
All right.

1603
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:26,720
Anything else for me?

1604
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,720
Yeah.

1605
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,400
Make sure, like, also like no weird proprietary connectors, like ethernet adapters.

1606
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,400
Oh, yeah.

1607
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,400
Right.

1608
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,400
Oh, yeah.

1609
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,400
Got to have ethernet.

1610
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,400
I'm gonna write that down.

1611
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,400
You got to have ethernet.

1612
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:38,400
I think.

1613
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,400
Serial port?

1614
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,400
Absolutely.

1615
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,400
This is totally serious.

1616
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,400
I would love to have multiple eSATA USB combos.

1617
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,400
Yeah.

1618
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,400
Yeah.

1619
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,400
Yeah.

1620
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,400
That's a nice to have for sure.

1621
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,400
I love having eSATA on the Bonobo.

1622
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,400
Just curious.

1623
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,400
You know, like the old laptops used to have these PCIe slots.

1624
01:17:49,400 --> 01:18:02,400
Do anyone use them anymore?

1625
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,400
No.

1626
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,400
PCMCIA.

1627
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,400
Just for the...

1628
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,400
Yeah.

1629
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,400
No.

1630
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,400
Just for, like, what?

1631
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,400
For the wireless.

1632
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,400
I'm staring at an old Orinoco wireless card.

1633
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,400
SSD drives on there.

1634
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:17,920
I've seen some hacks where people set out Nvidia, like, graphics cards using the PCIe

1635
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:18,920
socket on a laptop.

1636
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:19,920
Oh.

1637
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,920
That'd be kind of wild.

1638
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,920
Yeah.

1639
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,320
Q5 Sys in the chat room votes for parallel port.

1640
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,320
All right.

1641
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,320
Well, we'll...

1642
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,400
Now, I don't think we're gonna have these in time for next LAS.

1643
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,400
I think they're gonna...

1644
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,160
I think they're arriving Monday or so.

1645
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:32,180
So we'll probably have them in the following LAS.

1646
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,180
But I'm looking forward to it.

1647
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,720
So I think what we're probably gonna do is we'll go after the laptops in one episode

1648
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:42,240
and then we'll abuse the heck out of the Leopard in the following episode after we've

1649
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:45,760
thrown a week of just battery of battery of batteries of tests at it.

1650
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,040
So I think that'll be good.

1651
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,040
All about punishing it.

1652
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,040
Yeah.

1653
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,040
Yeah.

1654
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,040
Absolutely.

1655
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,040
All right.

1656
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,040
Well, thank you to our Mumble Room for joining us today.

1657
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,680
And thank you to Solomon from the Docker Project for calling in at the beginning of the

1658
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,680
show.

1659
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,000
That was great to get an update from them.

1660
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,320
And don't forget, guys, you can watch the show live on Tuesdays.

1661
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,040
We begin at 2 p.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv.

1662
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,600
Show up about a half hour early to get the pre-show.

1663
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,600
And you can contact us.

1664
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,040
Go over to jupitabroadcasting.com, pop that contact link, and just use Linux Action Show.

1665
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,520
I don't even know if we have a separate entry for Unplugged in there.

1666
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,900
And then fill out the contact info and send it in and we'll read it on a future show.

1667
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,900
We'd love to get your follow-up.

1668
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,000
That way we have a thread through each episode.

1669
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
All right, Matt.

1670
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
We'll have a great week.

1671
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1672
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Sounds good.

1673
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
See you then.

1674
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
All right, everyone.

1675
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,160
