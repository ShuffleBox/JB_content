WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
I do have a pre-show topic that I thought maybe we could talk about.

00:03.160 --> 00:07.700
Have you guys, anybody in here been to Microsoft's website recently today?

00:07.700 --> 00:09.940
Because they got a new page up we can talk about.

00:09.940 --> 00:13.640
Why Microsoft is better than Linux.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.580
Microsoft versus Linux.

00:15.580 --> 00:21.920
Not Windows versus Red Hat Enterprise, Linux, no no, Microsoft versus Linux.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.000
Have you seen this?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.560
It's a comparison page.

00:24.560 --> 00:25.560
Awesome.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.560
What's the page?

00:26.560 --> 00:27.560
Microsoft.com?

00:27.560 --> 00:30.360
No, why Microsoft.com.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.880
Go to why Microsoft.com.

00:31.880 --> 00:32.880
How great.

00:32.880 --> 00:33.880
Look at this.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.640
Did you know that Windows has a lower total cost of ownership?

00:36.640 --> 00:38.120
Greater flexibility.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.400
Did you know that being closed source gives you greater flexibility with Windows?

00:41.400 --> 00:44.300
And you can have the sequel edge when you're using Windows.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.600
And here's a good one.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.960
So they got the Microsoft column on the left and the Linux column on the right.

00:49.960 --> 00:54.560
Under the Microsoft column, you need to be future proofed for the cloud with Microsoft.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.280
Again, not Windows, which I think is fascinating.

00:58.280 --> 01:01.760
With Microsoft, you're not just choosing a single solution provider, you're choosing

01:01.760 --> 01:04.960
a trusted business solution provider and IT advisor.

01:04.960 --> 01:07.680
IASS and PASS are available on Azure.

01:07.680 --> 01:12.160
Office 365 enables great productivity in the cloud and Ubuntu CentOS and SUSE Linux enterprise

01:12.160 --> 01:16.560
servers are all supported as clients on the Azure cloud platform.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.200
But under the Linux column, clear roadmap to the cloud question mark?

01:21.200 --> 01:25.200
Will your Linux provider be able to support your entire infrastructure in the cloud if

01:25.200 --> 01:26.200
the time comes?

01:26.200 --> 01:27.200
Okay.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.200
What does that even mean?

01:28.200 --> 01:30.200
Like, what are they even talking about right there?

01:30.200 --> 01:33.600
The best is that they're saying that Google Apps is an untried service, but you should

01:33.600 --> 01:35.360
use Office 365 instead.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.360
Which is newer.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.360
It's newer than Google Docs.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.360
Oh, man.

01:39.360 --> 01:43.200
I think they've actually got a section on security threats in that.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.200
We don't want to try out Google.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.200
Okay.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.200
Found the other guy, but I found him.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
Okay.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.200
Security threats on this?

01:48.200 --> 01:49.200
This is hilarious.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.200
I know.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.200
Let's talk about the security threats.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.200
Oh, wow.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.200
All right.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.360
So, in the security, Microsoft has a proven security development lifecycle.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.760
We've made security a top priority with our security development lifecycle, also, by the

01:59.760 --> 02:00.760
way, called SDL.

02:00.760 --> 02:01.760
Hmm.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.680
I feel like SDL has been taken by something else.

02:04.680 --> 02:09.840
Customers also have direct access to the SDL under a Creative Commons license.

02:09.840 --> 02:10.840
Wow.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.840
Oh, man.

02:12.840 --> 02:18.840
Now, under the Linux column for security threats, persistent threats and dedicated attackers

02:18.840 --> 02:23.680
can slow your projects and put your IT environment at risk with Linux projects.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.160
What does that even mean?

02:25.160 --> 02:26.480
Oh, man.

02:26.480 --> 02:33.720
Do you think this is in response to Munich, the French gendarmerie, to lose the UK announcement

02:33.720 --> 02:35.840
about open document format?

02:35.840 --> 02:38.200
Do you think they realize they've got a fight on their hands now?

02:38.200 --> 02:41.560
Well, I do find it to be particularly interesting that they're not trying to push Windows.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.080
They're trying to push everything Microsoft has to offer.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.080
All the things, yeah.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.080
All the things.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.440
That's one thing.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.840
Like how focused we are, because all the things are now one thing.

02:50.840 --> 02:55.040
I just hope that the BS marketing speak they use in these comparisons doesn't appeal to

02:55.040 --> 02:58.920
people outside of Microsoft, because if it does, then that really sucks.

02:58.920 --> 02:59.920
Right?

02:59.920 --> 03:00.920
Yeah.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.040
Any of these statements that have any value under the Linux column apply just as much

03:04.040 --> 03:05.520
to Windows as it does to Linux.

03:05.520 --> 03:06.520
I know.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.520
Yeah.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.760
But they've got a page there to compare themselves with Google.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.320
I mean, they're just asking for a beating here, aren't they?

03:12.320 --> 03:13.320
They do.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.720
And the best part is, it's like, is Google reliable?

03:15.720 --> 03:16.720
We are.

03:16.720 --> 03:17.720
We are.

03:17.720 --> 03:18.720
Microsoft versus Google.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.720
We don't think they're reliable.

03:19.720 --> 03:20.720
Microsoft.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.480
Is this story made even further by Microsoft?

03:24.480 --> 03:26.120
Okay, here we go.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.000
I actually do wonder that.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.280
Privacy, security, and compliance.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.520
You can trust.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.520
Now Google is riskier for the enterprise with a focus on advertising and a lack of clarity

03:35.520 --> 03:37.120
around data governance policies.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.560
Google apps are riskier for enterprise.

03:38.560 --> 03:43.700
I would say that's the one bullet point I agree with, because Google just recently kind

03:43.700 --> 03:47.640
of got caught with their hand in the cookie jar when it came to monitoring students' docs

03:47.640 --> 03:49.820
for advertising, and they had to pull back on that.

03:49.820 --> 03:52.600
So Microsoft now gets to lean on that kind of stuff.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.180
Yeah, I don't know.

03:56.180 --> 03:58.680
What about their comparison with Open Office?

03:58.680 --> 04:00.240
They have Open Office on here?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.240
Look at this.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.240
Yes, they do.

04:02.240 --> 04:06.680
They say, there's like a quote from a company that says something like, we used to use Open

04:06.680 --> 04:08.700
Office, but we switched back to Microsoft Office.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.840
You could practically hear the sigh of relief right after we switched back.

04:11.840 --> 04:12.840
Oh my god.

04:12.840 --> 04:16.400
That quote is over two years old.

04:16.400 --> 04:20.480
That quote, we covered that two years ago on the Linux Action Show in a video.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.840
And this same one where they said it was cumbersome, that was also from that same video.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.780
Inefficient, if they're referencing the UI, is absolute BS.

04:28.780 --> 04:32.820
Every time I'm forced to use Microsoft Office and I don't know where something is, there's

04:32.820 --> 04:40.440
no logical way to find it, whereas in Libre Office, you just find the category and it's

04:40.440 --> 04:41.440
there.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.960
They are comparing it to Open Office, which who the heck knows how many years old that

04:44.960 --> 04:45.960
is.

04:45.960 --> 04:50.240
You guys, last time I checked, Open Office doesn't have the ribbon, so screw you.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.440
All right, let's see.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.440
No ribbon, no business.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.080
Wait, someone should actually get a copy of this web page, because you know they're going

04:57.080 --> 04:58.080
to take it down at some point.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.380
Yeah, you know what I like too?

05:00.380 --> 05:03.520
This is the biggest admittance that they're screwed, is right on their Microsoft versus

05:03.520 --> 05:06.160
Linux page, right there on the right hand side.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.120
Second link, speed up PHP performance.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.400
Now this is, how telling is that?

05:11.400 --> 05:16.080
But on their this is why we're better page, they have to give you right there front and

05:16.080 --> 05:21.960
center a link on optimizing something that out of the box just works great on Linux.

05:21.960 --> 05:25.240
Everything could use optimization, but I think that's extremely telling right there.

05:25.240 --> 05:30.760
And PHP isn't a language that sort of cutting edge stuff is going to be deployed on these.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.600
It's not a scale anyway.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.760
You're not driving a ton of clicks by advertising your PHP support.

05:35.760 --> 05:36.760
No.

05:36.760 --> 05:43.840
And the companies they're using as examples aren't really good like big tech related companies

05:43.840 --> 05:44.840
either.

05:44.840 --> 05:45.840
It's interesting.

05:45.840 --> 05:46.840
I don't know.

05:46.840 --> 05:47.840
Yeah, yeah.

05:47.840 --> 05:55.800
That how we compare those should really be list of companies that are eating our lunch.

05:55.800 --> 06:01.280
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that just hit the one year mark.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.880
Without missing a beat, I'm a little excited.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.400
My name is Chris.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.400
And my name is Matt.

06:06.400 --> 06:11.240
And at episode 52, if I am doing my math right and it's easy math because we've never skipped

06:11.240 --> 06:14.520
a week one year mark right here, buddy, we just landed on it.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.160
It's like just fell right into our laps.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.160
That's crazy.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.800
It feels like it's been like three months maybe at most.

06:19.800 --> 06:20.800
Yeah.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.580
And I think this actually what this teaches me is that I am just not very good at time

06:24.580 --> 06:28.680
perception because I am also like at the same time, I'm like, you know what?

06:28.680 --> 06:31.720
It kind of feels like it's been really like you said, like three months.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.720
And then the other time it feels like, well, okay, I can't remember a time when we haven't

06:34.720 --> 06:35.720
been doing this show.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.720
True.

06:36.720 --> 06:37.720
Now that's true.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.560
Now I could say that of last, but yeah, definitely with this show, it doesn't feel like it's

06:40.560 --> 06:41.560
been that long.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.560
Yeah.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.560
Yeah.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.560
You know what?

06:44.560 --> 06:45.560
That's what it is.

06:45.560 --> 06:46.560
It's in perspective of the Linux action show.

06:46.560 --> 06:47.560
Yeah.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.560
Definitely.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.560
I know.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.560
Yeah.

06:50.560 --> 06:51.560
I'm a con says, it says every time a show hits a landmark, it makes me feel like I'm

06:51.560 --> 06:52.560
around you guys for too long.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.560
That's true.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.560
I'm a con.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.560
It's your warning sign.

06:55.560 --> 06:56.560
It's time to take a breather.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.560
No, I'm just kidding.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.560
Don't take a breather.

06:58.560 --> 06:59.840
We've got a great episode today.

06:59.840 --> 07:03.280
Frederick from the Crux Project is going to join us and talk about Crux Linux here in just

07:03.280 --> 07:04.440
a little bit.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.880
And we've also gotten some great emails in from the audience following up on some topics

07:07.880 --> 07:10.860
that we covered on Sunday's Linux action show.

07:10.860 --> 07:14.720
So I want to start with that because the first one was one that I was kind of talking out

07:14.720 --> 07:16.920
my butt during the show and I knew we were going to get some feedback.

07:16.920 --> 07:21.300
In fact, I was kind of hoping for some feedback and Odin wrote in and he delivered.

07:21.300 --> 07:24.520
It's in regards to Copper, the Fedora project we talked about.

07:24.520 --> 07:28.680
Odin says, from my understanding, the new Fedora Copper service is not really similar

07:28.680 --> 07:29.680
to the AUR.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.200
Instead, it's more like a PPA competitor.

07:32.200 --> 07:37.320
Unlike the AUR, which is a single repository that allows users to download build scripts,

07:37.320 --> 07:41.300
Copper is a build service that allows users to create personal repositories and upload

07:41.300 --> 07:42.920
their source packages.

07:42.920 --> 07:47.880
The Copper service builds the source packages and makes them available through each separate

07:47.880 --> 07:49.980
repository.

07:49.980 --> 07:55.080
Users who want to use Copper repositories need to add each new repository separately

07:55.080 --> 07:59.600
to their system using DNF, which is the future yum replacement.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.240
For example, I've had problems installing Google Chrome on Fedora 21 because it depends

08:03.240 --> 08:08.240
on a legacy version of LibCrypt, which is no longer supported in Fedora 21.

08:08.240 --> 08:12.880
But there's a Copper for that, so after running some DNF commands, he enables the repo, then

08:12.880 --> 08:16.240
he installs that compatible library, and Bob's your uncle.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.240
He's good to go.

08:17.240 --> 08:20.640
He says it's kind of like a PPA, but with a central repository.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.640
Interesting.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.440
I could work with that.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.440
Right?

08:24.440 --> 08:25.440
I could work with that.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.440
Yeah.

08:26.440 --> 08:32.320
I think maybe the system I would prefer is the AUR in-hole, because I like the fact that

08:32.320 --> 08:34.680
there's a voting system there, a comment system there.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.200
I like the selection.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.320
Copper obviously didn't have the same selection.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.520
The other bit of feedback we got is that Copper has some of the same legal constraints that

08:41.520 --> 08:45.140
Fedora as a whole has, since they're building those packages and whatnot.

08:45.140 --> 08:49.640
So there's going to be certain things there that maybe, like for example, popcorn time

08:49.640 --> 08:55.320
would show up in the AUR, but maybe isn't going to show up in the Copper repos, perhaps?

08:55.320 --> 08:56.320
I don't know.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.320
I don't know.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.320
That's bizarre.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.320
I'll bring in the mumble room.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.320
Hello, virtual lug.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.600
Anybody in here a Fedora user and familiar with Copper?

09:02.600 --> 09:04.000
Have we gotten anything wrong?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Are we egregious?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
No.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Okay.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Good.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Apparently not.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
No.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I think that means no.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Apparently you nailed it.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
I think so.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
That's good.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
That's a good sign.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
That means we're not leading people astray, Matt.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
All right.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
That's it.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Next email.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Let's get to the next email.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
It comes in from Michael, and Michael writes into the show.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.880
I mean, you can write in too by going to JupiterBroadcasting.com, clicking contact, Linux

09:24.880 --> 09:29.360
unplugged features, contact from the Linux unplugged form, and also from the Linux action

09:29.360 --> 09:30.360
show.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.160
We get so much email to both shows that we try to collect it all in one place.

09:33.160 --> 09:37.240
So Michael writes in about emails and email clients.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.240
He says, hi guys.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.240
Huge fan of the show.

09:39.240 --> 09:43.600
When I was using Outlook, I was crazy about the integration with a really decent calendar

09:43.600 --> 09:44.600
feature.

09:44.600 --> 09:48.600
My question is, with all of the talk about viable Linux calendar apps and with the availability

09:48.600 --> 09:53.320
of LibreOffice, why haven't we seen an email client or calendar from them?

09:53.320 --> 09:54.320
It doesn't make any sense.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.000
And I think it's time for one.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.240
I could surely use it.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.520
Keep up the great work, and thanks, Michael.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.940
So Matt, do you think we have a...

10:02.940 --> 10:06.360
This is the third week in a row, which is crazy to me that we've gotten people commenting

10:06.360 --> 10:10.800
about productivity apps like calendar and email under Linux.

10:10.800 --> 10:16.120
And do you think the LibreOffice project should be making a calendar?

10:16.120 --> 10:17.240
I think it's overdue.

10:17.240 --> 10:22.040
I think the problem is, and this is very true in the Linux world in general, is that everybody's

10:22.040 --> 10:27.600
kind of focused on the projects they're passionate about, and the end users basically gets to

10:27.600 --> 10:29.120
come along for the ride.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.920
That sounds terrible to say, but that's been my general experience.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.000
And I'm not speaking to distros.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.260
I'm speaking to specific applications.

10:35.260 --> 10:39.440
So I look at the Evolution project, or I'm looking at various things you can do to Thunderbird

10:39.440 --> 10:41.520
to PIM it up, if you will.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.440
And it always feels janky, I guess, at the end of the day.

10:45.440 --> 10:49.640
And because you go to other platforms, and you've got a stupid amount of choice.

10:49.640 --> 10:50.640
It's just ridiculous.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.640
That's true.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.800
But if it's like, you're pretty much going to end up going web-based.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.800
You just are.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.520
There really is no other alternative.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.320
I mean, truly.

10:59.320 --> 11:03.280
I've been using Evolution with some success, and then I have also been trying out Lightning

11:03.280 --> 11:04.280
on Thunderbird.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.280
But you're right.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.280
It does feel a little janky.

11:06.280 --> 11:07.280
Oh, Evolution.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.280
Yeah, Evolution.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.280
Well, yeah.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.760
I mean, so what I've been using more so is the Evolution data server backend, which then

11:12.760 --> 11:13.920
populates my GNOME calendar.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.920
I don't actually use Evolution that much.

11:16.920 --> 11:22.000
And then I have my Lightning calendar subscribed to the same calendars that my GNOME data servers

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
subscribe to.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.160
But that means I have two different programs checking the same calendar feeds.

11:25.160 --> 11:28.660
It's not super elegant, but at least they're referencing the same source.

11:28.660 --> 11:34.520
So there was a blog post about the future of Thunderbird posted on July 31st.

11:34.520 --> 11:38.440
And they say, so current update, which is good news for any Thunderbird users, guess

11:38.440 --> 11:39.440
what?

11:39.440 --> 11:40.560
Thunderbird usage is growing.

11:40.560 --> 11:43.740
They say we have a strong core team and expect to remain relevant on the internet for the

11:43.740 --> 11:45.360
foreseeable future.

11:45.360 --> 11:50.000
And that Thunderbird, they recognize, is mission-critical to tens of millions of users.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.080
Here's where they want to go in the near term.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.460
Thunderbird should be a full-featured desktop personal information management system incorporating

11:56.460 --> 11:58.120
messaging, calendar, and contacts.

11:58.120 --> 12:02.400
We need to incorporate the calendar component, Lightning by default, and drastically improve

12:02.400 --> 12:03.600
contact management.

12:03.600 --> 12:07.640
We should be actively promoting open internet standards in messaging, calendar, and contacts

12:07.640 --> 12:09.640
through implementation.

12:09.640 --> 12:14.680
So they also apparently see the need to integrate calendars into Thunderbird.

12:14.680 --> 12:15.680
I don't know, Matt.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.680
I don't know.

12:16.680 --> 12:21.520
I feel like Thunderbird needs to stick to email and just focus on email.

12:21.520 --> 12:25.400
I think when you plug in Lightning into Thunderbird, it feels janky.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.840
But I think that the Lightning idea and the app itself is actually just worlds better

12:29.840 --> 12:30.840
than Evolution.

12:30.840 --> 12:34.000
Evolution just feels like a trip back to the 90s.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
I can't even deal with it.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.120
And I used to use it a lot.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.980
I mean, I've spent years with it, and I hate it with a passion.

12:38.980 --> 12:40.280
But I'd say Lightning's a great idea.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.280
I like the idea.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.120
I don't really want to blend it in with current Thunderbird.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.400
It just doesn't fit well enough.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.480
But that being said, it's usable.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.720
It's not horrible.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.840
And if you have some sort of web-based calendar or have something that you can sync up with

12:52.840 --> 12:53.840
a calendar, whatever.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.840
As long as they get it right.

12:54.840 --> 12:55.840
It's doable.

12:55.840 --> 12:56.840
They've got to get it right.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.000
Because if they screw it up, Matt, my Thunder, if they ruin my Thunderbird, what am I going

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
to do, Matt?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.320
What am I going to do?

13:01.320 --> 13:02.320
That's true.

13:02.320 --> 13:05.100
And if you have the option to take kind of an opera approach and disable something you

13:05.100 --> 13:07.360
don't want in it, problem solved.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.360
I don't want a calendar.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.360
I just want email.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.360
Make it go away.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.360
Poof.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.360
Gone.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.360
Problem solved.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.360
I agree with Evolution.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.520
Like, strip out all the task stuff.

13:16.520 --> 13:20.160
Because the task implementation in Evolution is just god-awful.

13:20.160 --> 13:24.360
Like, please burn it alive sort of thing.

13:24.360 --> 13:28.560
Honestly, Evolution just should be calendar and mail.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.560
And that's it.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.560
Yeah.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.560
Yeah.

13:31.560 --> 13:36.320
As long as you don't implement the exchange backend, it's less painful.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.200
The exchange backend will make you want to punch things.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.200
It's horrible.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.200
Yes.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.200
Oh my goodness.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.200
All right.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.200
I think we're probably done talking about Thunderbird.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.640
We have one more email to get to.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.680
I mean, you guys can still, you can send in your feedback.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.680
We'll read it.

13:48.680 --> 13:53.040
If this is a topic people are obviously interested in, Andreas writes in, he says, hello, Chris

13:53.040 --> 13:54.040
and Matt.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.160
I've been watching almost all of the JB shows for a year now.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.160
This is great content.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.900
I have a DigitalOcean droplet serving up Django.

13:59.900 --> 14:00.900
It's a Django project.

14:00.900 --> 14:05.240
One of the things I want to do is some kind of virtual meeting, sometimes part of a group.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.560
Oh, we have a little echo back there.

14:07.560 --> 14:08.560
Sometimes it's part of a group.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.720
Or, you know, he wants to single to multiple people sometimes.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.640
Maybe just a single person.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.000
And also maybe have an embeddable IRC client.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.420
It could be video or audio.

14:18.420 --> 14:19.680
So he says, here's the requirements.

14:19.680 --> 14:23.840
He needs to be able to run on a DigitalOcean droplet and a way to send out audio or video.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.980
He wants to be able to serve anything from the droplet, not any third-party host.

14:27.980 --> 14:32.480
So like no Google services, no Twitch.tv.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.960
And the video is just one way, or the audio.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.140
So he only needs to be able to send it out, doesn't need to be able to receive anything

14:37.140 --> 14:42.160
from them, except for IRC.

14:42.160 --> 14:46.600
So he wanted to know if we had any recommendations for virtual meetings, things that he could

14:46.600 --> 14:52.080
do to broadcast something to multiple people, all hosted on his own system.

14:52.080 --> 14:57.600
I was thinking, IRC, you could host your own IRC server.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
I would not.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.440
I would say go on to GeekShed or go on to FreeNode and just grab a room.

15:02.440 --> 15:06.300
You can make it a private room, but don't bother with that.

15:06.300 --> 15:09.800
For the broadcasting, I don't know, maybe somebody has a better idea.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.360
I was thinking IceCast.

15:11.360 --> 15:14.280
Just do an audio IceCast stream because he wants to be able to embed the player on the

15:14.280 --> 15:21.040
website and you could use HTML5 audio, heyo, to stream IceCast right in the browser.

15:21.040 --> 15:24.780
It wouldn't be video, but you would get audio though.

15:24.780 --> 15:26.080
That's about the best I could come up with.

15:26.080 --> 15:30.680
I mean, really, because he's not wanting to utilize other tools and services, that definitely

15:30.680 --> 15:31.680
limits my ideas.

15:31.680 --> 15:37.880
Well, chatroom points out WebRTC might be a solution here too, PalavaTV, P-A-L-A-V-A-T-V,

15:37.880 --> 15:39.760
browser-to-browser video conferencing.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.600
WebRTC might be able to solve this too.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.680
Anybody in the Mumba room have any software suggestions for something to do self-hosted

15:45.680 --> 15:46.680
video conferences?

15:46.680 --> 15:49.600
I don't think so.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.600
They're bubkissed today.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
They're bubkissed.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.600
They're just coming up nothing.

15:52.600 --> 15:53.600
Yeah.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.600
There is one called Appear.in.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.600
Okay.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.600
Is that a WebRTC one?

15:57.600 --> 15:58.600
Yes.

15:58.600 --> 15:59.600
Yes.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.600
That makes sense.

16:00.600 --> 16:01.600
That makes sense.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.040
That's probably your best bet right now.

16:04.040 --> 16:08.680
And the nice thing about WebRTC is if they even have a semi-modern browser, you're not

16:08.680 --> 16:11.820
going to have to have them install a plug-in or something.

16:11.820 --> 16:15.640
If you're using a system that requires a plug-in, you're almost dead in the water right there.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.640
So you know what?

16:16.640 --> 16:19.140
WebRTC is probably actually the really sensible approach.

16:19.140 --> 16:21.120
So Andreas, look into WebRTC solutions.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.400
We actually did an episode of Linux Action Show a ways back.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.680
There's a few.

16:25.680 --> 16:30.320
Check out meet.jitzi.si or G-I-T-I dot S-I.

16:30.320 --> 16:34.760
There's a couple of different options out there, and we'll try to collect a few links.

16:34.760 --> 16:39.160
And oh, it would be a good time to say, if you're listening to this after the fact and

16:39.160 --> 16:44.280
you're like, oh man, there's one the guys need to know about, please go over to linuxactionshow.reddit.com,

16:44.280 --> 16:47.560
find the feedback thread for this episode, and drop a link in there.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.680
And I'll try to remember to collect all of those, and we'll cover them in a future episode,

16:50.680 --> 16:52.940
maybe episode 52.

16:52.940 --> 16:57.000
So our buddy Mike there was talking about how he was hosting this, or I'm sorry, it

16:57.000 --> 16:59.400
was Andreas, over on DigitalOcean Droplist.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.160
So why don't I just take a minute here and tell you about DigitalOcean, because guess

17:02.160 --> 17:03.160
what?

17:03.160 --> 17:05.920
I rock DigitalOcean Droplets like a boss.

17:05.920 --> 17:10.220
Over at digitalocean.com, we've got a brand new promo code for the month of August, which

17:10.220 --> 17:12.800
is blowing my mind, Unplugged August.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.280
Unplugged August, all lowercase, go over to digitalocean.com.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.560
Let me tell you about DigitalOcean.

17:17.560 --> 17:21.240
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

17:21.240 --> 17:22.840
easy way to spin up a cloud server.

17:22.840 --> 17:26.440
Now if you're a boss, you can probably do this in under 55 seconds, like myself.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.400
But you know, for most of you, maybe it's your first time, you're new, you can spin

17:29.400 --> 17:35.440
up a cloud server in less than 55 seconds, and pricey plans start at only $5 per month.

17:35.440 --> 17:40.800
That gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.660
Their pricing plans are so straightforward and simple, too, that as you go up, you get

17:44.660 --> 17:47.480
more bandwidth, you get more CPU, more storage, et cetera, et cetera.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.880
And when you use that promo code, Unplugged August, you're going to get that $10 credit.

17:50.880 --> 17:55.080
So if you grab the $5 rig, like I've been using forever now, you grab that $5 rig, you

17:55.080 --> 17:58.160
can try it for two months for free when you use the promo code Unplugged August.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.120
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

18:02.120 --> 18:03.880
and a brand new one in London.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.340
Their interface is so simple.

18:05.340 --> 18:09.400
Their control panel is super intuitive, but extremely powerful.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.400
And then you're like, hey, you know what?

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
I need more power.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.400
I need more power.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.400
Well, guess what?

18:13.400 --> 18:15.720
Boom, they got you covered, straightforward API available.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.480
You can replicate a lot of the functions on a much larger scale.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.760
Automate that ass, son.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.020
Go out there with that straightforward API.

18:22.020 --> 18:25.060
And if you go over to DigitalOcean right now, I want you to go over there and click on the

18:25.060 --> 18:28.400
features tab and take a look at the control panel.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.120
So they have the droplet management system.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.920
They have the DNS system built into.

18:31.920 --> 18:37.540
They also have snapshots, two-factor authentication, an HTML5 console written in Go.

18:37.540 --> 18:42.480
You can resize and deploy applications with one click like Ruby on Rails, WordPress, GitLab,

18:42.480 --> 18:43.480
all of that.

18:43.480 --> 18:44.480
Boom.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.480
Send it all there.

18:45.480 --> 18:49.120
It's all running on top of a Linux box, sitting on these SSDs, so you get that super fast

18:49.120 --> 18:51.480
I.O. connected to tier one bandwidth.

18:51.480 --> 18:54.840
I mean, it's a really great offering, DigitalOcean.com.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.480
And you can try it out for two months for free.

18:56.480 --> 18:59.080
They also have some hourly pricing structures available.

18:59.080 --> 19:02.720
So if you want to just try something out for some testing, you can do that.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.720
I tell you what.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.920
I've got a BitTorrent sync system over there working flawlessly.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.560
Really unbelievable reliability.

19:08.560 --> 19:12.880
I've now got an own Cloud 7 instance over there, and I don't know if I want to give

19:12.880 --> 19:13.880
it out just yet.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.440
I might eventually, but I've got a great domain name for it because some of the new TLDs that

19:17.440 --> 19:18.440
are out there.

19:18.440 --> 19:24.000
So now every time I SSH into my new DigitalOcean droplet with this new TLD, it makes me giggle.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
I love it.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.360
Go over to DigitalOcean.com.

19:26.360 --> 19:29.120
Use the promo code unpluggedaugust when you check it out.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.820
Grab yourself something, and you'll get it for two months for free.

19:31.820 --> 19:37.000
And since DigitalOcean is so cool, if you forgot, because maybe it's late, I'll forgive

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
you.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
You forgot to use the promo code.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Bro, it happens.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.760
It's okay.

19:41.760 --> 19:42.760
DigitalOcean's got you covered.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.840
You can go retroactively apply that promo code if you forgot.

19:45.840 --> 19:48.720
DigitalOcean.com, unpluggedaugust when you check out.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.120
That lets them know, too, that you really do appreciate them keeping us on the air.

19:52.120 --> 19:56.560
DigitalOcean.com, huge thanks to those guys for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

19:56.560 --> 19:57.560
Okay, Matt.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.400
Well, Fredrik joins us from the Crux Project.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.760
Fredrik, it's great to have you on the show.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.920
How long have you been with the Crux Project?

20:04.920 --> 20:05.920
What's your background there?

20:05.920 --> 20:17.840
Well, I started using Crux in, I think, about 2004, 2005, and I was the one who started,

20:17.840 --> 20:28.360
I guess, the port that is now Crux 3.0 and 3.1 for x86-64.

20:28.360 --> 20:33.160
So I think I started that in 2008 or something like that, perhaps.

20:33.160 --> 20:34.160
Quite a while, then.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.160
Quite a while.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.160
Very good.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.160
Well, I really appreciate you being here.

20:37.160 --> 20:42.200
We had a chance to look at Crux on Sunday, and the thing that really sort of stood out

20:42.200 --> 20:46.400
to both Matt and I is when you have a distribution that has a lineage of Crux, I think something

20:46.400 --> 20:50.480
that people have a hard time really wrapping their brains around is this isn't based on

20:50.480 --> 20:51.480
something else, is it?

20:51.480 --> 20:56.760
This Crux is an OG Linux distribution, and do you feel like maybe that makes Crux stand

20:56.760 --> 20:58.480
out from the crowd a little bit more?

20:58.480 --> 21:00.440
Yeah, I suppose so.

21:00.440 --> 21:08.040
I use quite a few distributions at work and on different platforms, so it's not like Debian

21:08.040 --> 21:11.380
or not like CentOS or Red Hat or anything like that.

21:11.380 --> 21:18.360
So I think if you need to compare it to anything, it's probably more like Slackware or just

21:18.360 --> 21:19.360
Linux from scratch.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.360
Okay.

21:20.360 --> 21:25.160
Well, I'm going to jump ahead a little bit because what you kind of touched on is probably

21:25.160 --> 21:27.320
one of the number one questions we had sent to the show.

21:27.320 --> 21:32.800
So we let the folks know that you'd be on the show, and if they had any questions, to

21:32.800 --> 21:33.800
send them in.

21:33.800 --> 21:37.380
And we got a bunch of questions into the show, and a lot of them were the same one.

21:37.380 --> 21:40.240
So I guess I want to start there because you kind of just touched on, is a lot of people

21:40.240 --> 21:45.800
wanted to hear where you felt, just in your opinion, Crux fits in, like I can say, compared

21:45.800 --> 21:46.800
to Arch.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.760
I think a lot of people wanted to know Crux versus Arch.

21:49.760 --> 21:53.080
What would you say Crux's strengths are, say, over Arch?

21:53.080 --> 21:59.160
Well, actually, I've never used Arch in my life, so perhaps I'm not the right person

21:59.160 --> 22:09.240
to answer that question, but as far as I can understand, just by looking very not really

22:09.240 --> 22:12.160
in depth on Arch, I guess it's pretty similar.

22:12.160 --> 22:17.800
But yeah, I'm not really comfortable making a comparison.

22:17.800 --> 22:18.800
That's fine.

22:18.800 --> 22:23.160
I think a lot of people see that it's sort of a set up from scratch kind of scenario

22:23.160 --> 22:26.200
that I think a lot of people see a similarity there.

22:26.200 --> 22:30.240
I think your comparison more to Slackware, perhaps, is more apt.

22:30.240 --> 22:37.040
And do you consider Crux to be competing with the Ubuntu's and the Debian's out there?

22:37.040 --> 22:44.920
Are there similar use cases there, or is Crux not really competing in that kind of way?

22:44.920 --> 22:50.760
No, we're not really competing with anyone, and we don't really look to compete either.

22:50.760 --> 22:57.760
If you like Crux, if you think it fits your philosophy and how you use your computer,

22:57.760 --> 22:59.520
that's great.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.000
We like it.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.120
Success isn't measured in user base size.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.380
No, no, no, not at all.

23:05.380 --> 23:12.960
Even if it was, if everyone else left Crux tomorrow, I'd still run it, and I'd still

23:12.960 --> 23:13.960
maintain it.

23:13.960 --> 23:20.320
Do you guys have a rough estimation of the user base size of Crux?

23:20.320 --> 23:22.960
No, not really.

23:22.960 --> 23:28.720
We don't really distribute the ISO from the Crux site itself, so it's only mirrors, and

23:28.720 --> 23:35.100
that's pretty hard to really count, I guess.

23:35.100 --> 23:43.040
Perhaps the best way to really get a count is to monitor the rsync usage from ports 3,

23:43.040 --> 23:49.240
but I asked a few days ago and it didn't really get a response, so I'm not really sure how

23:49.240 --> 23:50.240
many we are.

23:50.240 --> 23:55.760
But I guess it's probably less than 10,000, more than 200.

23:55.760 --> 23:59.040
Yeah, that's probably a pretty safe guess.

23:59.040 --> 24:02.860
Wimpy, you were a former Crux maintainer.

24:02.860 --> 24:04.060
Now you work with the Arch Project.

24:04.060 --> 24:08.000
Did you want to share your insights on some of the similarities between the projects?

24:08.000 --> 24:12.080
Yeah, there are some similarities.

24:12.080 --> 24:19.760
You mentioned on Sunday that Arch, the original Arch developer, Judd Vinnette, was inspired

24:19.760 --> 24:26.100
by Crux, and it was the inspiration that led to him developing Arch.

24:26.100 --> 24:29.880
In that respect, there are some similarities.

24:29.880 --> 24:40.760
I was a Crux maintainer from January 2002 to December 2003, so that was Crux 0.9 era,

24:40.760 --> 24:47.100
and I was a bit shocked to learn I used to be the KDE maintainer for Crux, which I blanked

24:47.100 --> 24:56.040
out of my memory, but in terms of the similarities, if you look at Arch Linux before the system

24:56.040 --> 25:03.560
D switchover when it still used rc.conf, configuring Crux is very similar to how you used to set

25:03.560 --> 25:05.760
up Arch.

25:05.760 --> 25:12.160
The other similarity is, of course, it's a ports type system, which effectively the AUR

25:12.160 --> 25:15.240
is like a ports tree, if you like.

25:15.240 --> 25:21.200
If you actually go and look at the PKG files on Crux, and then go and look at a PKG build

25:21.200 --> 25:28.000
file for Arch Linux, you can clearly see that Arch was heavily influenced by Crux, because

25:28.000 --> 25:33.200
there's fewer functions in Crux, but they are almost identical, and I've even heard

25:33.200 --> 25:37.760
rumors that you can take packages from Crux and build them on Arch without having to change

25:37.760 --> 25:38.760
anything.

25:38.760 --> 25:43.200
Yeah, you could do that, you need to change a few variables and stuff like that, but it's

25:43.200 --> 25:47.680
really simple to just move it over to Crux, if you like.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.680
That underscores it.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.240
So that kind of brings me to the next, probably most common question.

25:52.240 --> 25:57.120
This is not really controversial, but I suppose some people consider it to be, but Otter was

25:57.120 --> 25:58.120
the first to ask.

25:58.120 --> 26:02.260
He says, I noticed there's no system D package in the repos, and there's no system D page

26:02.260 --> 26:03.520
on the Wiki.

26:03.520 --> 26:07.360
Do you have any issues with system D as a distribution, like some of the same problems

26:07.360 --> 26:09.480
some of the other source-based distros have?

26:09.480 --> 26:10.640
Or what are your thoughts on that?

26:10.640 --> 26:14.600
Because I know the BSD init script style system is sort of an important identity point for

26:14.600 --> 26:15.600
Crux, isn't it?

26:15.600 --> 26:16.600
Yeah, I guess so.

26:16.600 --> 26:25.000
Our init scripts to boot the system is perhaps a couple of lines, perhaps 80 lines, I haven't

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
really counted.

26:26.000 --> 26:30.400
And it's really simple, you can easily see everything that happens, you can change anything

26:30.400 --> 26:31.400
if you like.

26:31.400 --> 26:37.560
So we haven't really, yeah, we don't think system D really fits with our philosophy.

26:37.560 --> 26:40.520
I'm not really personally interested in it.

26:40.520 --> 26:50.680
The only contact we have with it is the merger of Udev to system D, and that has been a bit

26:50.680 --> 26:57.760
of a headache for us, and I guess it's made us a bit worried on what to do from here.

26:57.760 --> 27:02.720
Frederick, since you've been working with Crux since 2008, have there been any surprise

27:02.720 --> 27:06.480
Crux use case scenarios where you'll bump in and find, oh, this embedded device is using

27:06.480 --> 27:07.480
Crux?

27:07.480 --> 27:11.120
Or this company has Crux deployed on their servers that sort of surprised you that you

27:11.120 --> 27:14.680
never even knew about until one day it just sort of fell in your lap?

27:14.680 --> 27:20.960
Yeah, I guess one or two years ago we had a guy asking for support on a really old Crux

27:20.960 --> 27:21.960
distribution.

27:21.960 --> 27:28.920
I can't really remember the use case, but it turned out he was the boss of a company

27:28.920 --> 27:35.240
that used Crux for data recovery, forensic data recovery on hard drives.

27:35.240 --> 27:37.200
So that was a bit of a shock, actually.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.200
Cool.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.200
That's a good one.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.400
BitPuffin, you wanted to share some thoughts on system D and what kind of drove you to

27:42.400 --> 27:43.400
Crux?

27:43.400 --> 27:44.400
Yeah.

27:44.400 --> 27:49.280
Well, basically I really liked the way Arch used to be configured, and when they switched

27:49.280 --> 27:53.720
to system D it all kind of became magic, and I didn't really feel comfortable with that.

27:53.720 --> 27:57.960
So I switched to Crux, and I actually like most of it more anyway.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.920
So it was kind of what drove me there, but then I just liked everything more.

28:01.920 --> 28:06.400
Yeah, I could see how Crux could be a refuge for a lot of folks that are not super happy

28:06.400 --> 28:12.200
with system D. To me, I would feel as a distribution not implementing system D, I would feel like

28:12.200 --> 28:20.440
it is looming over me, like I'm becoming surrounded, and that it's, I don't know, it seems like

28:20.440 --> 28:24.920
it's just going to become more and more intertwined with every other distribution out there.

28:24.920 --> 28:25.920
Yeah, absolutely.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.960
It could be an uphill battle, Frederik.

28:28.960 --> 28:31.680
Yeah, really.

28:31.680 --> 28:40.000
I think we're the only other distribution, other than Gensu that use Udeb, the fork of

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Udeb.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.440
But I guess we'll see in a few years how things look.

28:45.440 --> 28:50.120
Yeah, you know what, it might turn out to be a really good long-term bet, actually.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.360
You never know, right?

28:51.360 --> 28:53.520
Crazier things have happened.

28:53.520 --> 28:59.560
Did you have any Crux myths or common misconceptions you wanted to address or anything kind of

28:59.560 --> 29:00.560
like that?

29:00.560 --> 29:05.640
I know that sometimes some of the underrepresented distributions sort of misconceptions can kind

29:05.640 --> 29:09.200
of crop up over time, so I always like to give the floor to a guest to have a chance

29:09.200 --> 29:13.040
to pop some of those rumor bubbles if there are any.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.120
I'm not really sure.

29:15.120 --> 29:23.160
We're quite a close community, not close, but tight community, so I don't really think

29:23.160 --> 29:29.840
many people have any misconceptions on what Crux is.

29:29.840 --> 29:36.240
The one I would give you, the one I would shoot at you is, and I think it's actually

29:36.240 --> 29:42.560
a good thing, is I think the common misconception is that people are little curmudgeons over

29:42.560 --> 29:43.560
in Cruxland.

29:43.560 --> 29:47.760
And I think really what it is is it's actually just a sense of pragmatism about what functionally

29:47.760 --> 29:55.280
works for this group of people, and it's not about setting up a fence where the neckbeards

29:55.280 --> 29:56.280
can hang out.

29:56.280 --> 30:00.480
It's about just creating a very simple distribution that works, that doesn't have a lot of extra

30:00.480 --> 30:05.120
stuff built around it that gets in the way, and it is extremely practical.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.960
Is that essentially my sense, right, Fredrik?

30:06.960 --> 30:08.600
Yeah, I think so.

30:08.600 --> 30:16.960
I do need to shave, but we've had some users mailing to the mailing list asking for a gnome

30:16.960 --> 30:25.000
or why doesn't this work on Crux, how do I get Steam to work, things like that, and you

30:25.000 --> 30:30.560
can get it to work, but you just need to spend a lot of time building everything because

30:30.560 --> 30:39.600
we don't want to do it, so, especially with that, you could do it, but yeah, I guess we

30:39.600 --> 30:41.720
like to keep it simple.

30:41.720 --> 30:45.080
Very well, and as you should, because I think that's what's particularly appealing about

30:45.080 --> 30:46.080
it.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.080
Well, Fredrik, if you don't mind, if you want to stick around, we're going to talk about

30:49.080 --> 30:50.080
Crux.

30:50.080 --> 30:53.520
We had the folks in the room kick the tires, and we're all kind of going into this knowing

30:53.520 --> 30:58.000
that it's not a distro for everybody, but now, that said, Mumble Room, feel free to

30:58.000 --> 31:00.920
speak your mind, and Fredrik, you feel free to respond to anything you want.

31:00.920 --> 31:03.240
We'll talk about the community's reaction.

31:03.240 --> 31:09.760
We have a virtual review lug, if you will, a strike team that goes in and tactically

31:09.760 --> 31:10.760
assesses distribution.

31:10.760 --> 31:11.760
That sounds ridiculous.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.760
That sounds scary.

31:12.760 --> 31:18.800
You know, we call them Linux Team Six.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.680
Oh, my God.

31:20.680 --> 31:21.680
Oh, wow.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.680
I'm sorry.

31:22.680 --> 31:23.680
Too soon.

31:23.680 --> 31:24.680
Too soon.

31:24.680 --> 31:28.960
All right, but before we jump into that, I'll thank our next sponsor, because Linux Academy

31:28.960 --> 31:32.940
has just recently rolled out some brand new stuff, so this is a great time to mention

31:32.940 --> 31:33.940
Linux Academy.

31:33.940 --> 31:36.000
Head over there to check them out, linuxacademy.com.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.920
In fact, go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.680
That'll get you the Summer of Learning discount.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.360
That's right, up to 33%.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.340
That makes it $50 a quarter.

31:46.340 --> 31:51.720
They just rolled out brand new stuff, an entire new course called OpenStack Essentials.

31:51.720 --> 31:55.280
It's 100% complete, and it's up on Linux Academy right now.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.920
Go over to linuxacademy.com and take the tour.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.920
See their new AWS-certified SysOps Administration prep course?

32:00.920 --> 32:04.920
It's really come together, and it's packed with over 14 hours of content.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.360
Now, what is Linux Academy?

32:06.360 --> 32:07.360
Think of it this way.

32:07.360 --> 32:11.960
A group of extremely passionate Linux users who had an educational background, and then

32:11.960 --> 32:15.420
the other side of the group had a development background that came together and said, we

32:15.420 --> 32:19.620
need to create a platform for other Linux users to learn and expand their skill set.

32:19.620 --> 32:20.800
So here's what they did.

32:20.800 --> 32:24.540
They set up a system that's all based around step-by-step video courses with downloadable

32:24.540 --> 32:26.560
comprehensive study guides.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.760
Each course, when you're required, it comes with its own server.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.160
They spin up on demand.

32:30.160 --> 32:33.120
You can run seven-plus of the available Linux distributions they have.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.560
They automatically adapt the courseware to match that distribution.

32:35.560 --> 32:39.240
This is a great way, if you need to switch distros to learn how another one is done,

32:39.240 --> 32:42.960
or if you've been primarily a Red Hat guy and now you're working on an Ubuntu box, go

32:42.960 --> 32:46.800
get yourself up to speed, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

32:46.800 --> 32:50.040
You can keep track of your progress as you go, too, so you'll see exactly how long it's

32:50.040 --> 32:53.040
going to take you, so you'll know exactly how much time you need to budget.

32:53.040 --> 32:57.260
You can come back later on and check it out, see where you're at, test yourself, keep up

32:57.260 --> 33:01.000
to date, and they've got a community, too, that'll help kind of give you that incentive

33:01.000 --> 33:02.320
if you choose to engage.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.480
You can remain a loner.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.480
That's fine.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.940
That's my approach, but if you'd like to go in there and tell people and talk to people

33:06.940 --> 33:10.480
about where you're getting stuck, help people kind of, get people to kind of help you move

33:10.480 --> 33:14.160
along and sort of, it's like when I went to a gym, I would have, I would have a gym buddy

33:14.160 --> 33:15.960
that would kind of encourage me to keep going.

33:15.960 --> 33:18.300
The community can be that same kind of thing.

33:18.300 --> 33:21.440
So go check out all of the intercourse where they're adding all of the time.

33:21.440 --> 33:24.720
If you want to mess around with AWS, too, this is a great opportunity because they'll

33:24.720 --> 33:27.940
spin up the AWS instances as you need them.

33:27.940 --> 33:31.960
They've also been doing some live streaming with Q&A so you can ask the instructor questions,

33:31.960 --> 33:36.080
and I think one of the things that I've enjoyed hearing a lot from our audience is when they're

33:36.080 --> 33:39.520
learning and they really get excited about the topic and they're really starting to,

33:39.520 --> 33:42.880
you know, it's really scratching that itch, but they need to step away for a while.

33:42.880 --> 33:47.780
They're taking these comprehensive study guides because they're in video, PDF, and audio,

33:47.780 --> 33:51.560
and they're downloading them offline and consuming them when they're in the shower, when they're

33:51.560 --> 33:54.560
in the car, and they're always able to learn.

33:54.560 --> 33:58.660
This is a great way to get your skill set up, to help you become a little more employable,

33:58.660 --> 34:02.700
or land that next contract, or check that box off on the review, or just intellectually

34:02.700 --> 34:06.460
stimulate yourself, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

34:06.460 --> 34:09.680
Go take advantage of the Summer of Learning discount because you know what, summer's not

34:09.680 --> 34:14.560
going to last forever, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

34:14.560 --> 34:18.280
And a really big thank you to Linux Academy for being so damn awesome and supporting the

34:18.280 --> 34:22.560
Linux Unplugged show, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

34:22.560 --> 34:28.800
Okay, Mumble Room, so you guys got to do what Matt and I did for last Sunday.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.920
You got to try out Crux.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.120
I'm really kind of looking forward to it now.

34:32.120 --> 34:35.640
I know we have a wide range of experience here.

34:35.640 --> 34:39.560
Wimpy, obviously, as a former Crux maintainer, didn't have a hard time.

34:39.560 --> 34:44.040
But Josh, I know that when you started to dig into it you realized it might be a little

34:44.040 --> 34:46.680
more than you were willing to bite off, right?

34:46.680 --> 34:52.960
Yeah, so first a disclaimer, I am completely spoiled by binary packages.

34:52.960 --> 34:57.520
I refuse to compile anything unless I absolutely have to.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.160
It's like a pride thing, is that what you're saying?

35:00.160 --> 35:01.880
No, it's more of a time thing.

35:01.880 --> 35:03.600
I don't have time to compile everything.

35:03.600 --> 35:07.480
I understand some people have really high-end computers and they could compile stuff in

35:07.480 --> 35:08.480
freaking milliseconds.

35:08.480 --> 35:12.480
But Josh is on a Celeron, he's got, no, I'm kidding.

35:12.480 --> 35:16.760
No, not quite.

35:16.760 --> 35:23.760
When I looked at Crux and I came to the realization that I needed to compile my kernel and figure

35:23.760 --> 35:29.680
out all the modules I needed, and I disclaimer, they do have a really good set of defaults,

35:29.680 --> 35:31.480
that immediately turned me off.

35:31.480 --> 35:37.440
But here is why I think you should use Crux, plain and simple, and that's their port system.

35:37.440 --> 35:42.560
It would be insane if you're using Arch and you want something more source-based where

35:42.560 --> 35:50.280
you want to control every little bit of source that goes into your system, Crux is for you.

35:50.280 --> 35:55.320
And if you want to make sure that there isn't any unnecessary garbage that's getting thrown

35:55.320 --> 35:59.680
in your system, the port system is just so flexible.

35:59.680 --> 36:05.400
And from what I've seen, there is a lot of ports maintainers.

36:05.400 --> 36:10.000
You have a core team and you have a lot of experienced individuals that maintain an extensive

36:10.000 --> 36:11.880
amount of ports.

36:11.880 --> 36:18.120
And you could easily enable different port sections such as Contrib, which is the most

36:18.120 --> 36:22.920
experienced port maintainers from what I've seen.

36:22.920 --> 36:26.040
And that opens up a huge variety of software.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.040
That's good to know.

36:27.040 --> 36:31.640
Now BitPuffin, you say there may be a solution for Josh who wants binary packages, right?

36:31.640 --> 36:39.000
Yeah, so me and another fellow Cruxer named ProLogic are working on an open-source service

36:39.000 --> 36:42.320
for maintaining port collections and stuff.

36:42.320 --> 36:48.400
And it will also provide automatic builds so you get binary packages.

36:48.400 --> 36:54.200
And there's actually a binary package manager in Crux called PackageGet, like PortGet, but

36:54.200 --> 36:58.400
for binary packages basically.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.440
So that might help a bit.

37:00.440 --> 37:01.440
That's very true.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.400
And so you've got some solutions.

37:04.400 --> 37:07.740
It seems like every time I dig into something, Frederick, when it comes to Crux too, it sounds

37:07.740 --> 37:13.840
a lot of times like the portions of the community just sort of spontaneously come together and

37:13.840 --> 37:14.840
fill in gaps.

37:14.840 --> 37:20.040
Like isn't that how PackageGet kind of also originally was materialized is by community

37:20.040 --> 37:24.600
participation and it's like, okay, we as a community want to fix this thing, let's all

37:24.600 --> 37:25.600
get together.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.080
And that's really cool.

37:27.080 --> 37:34.760
Yeah, I think most of the Crux system you see today actually was built by the community.

37:34.760 --> 37:41.520
Crux was started by Pär Lidén and he was pretty much alone maintaining it for a number

37:41.520 --> 37:45.760
of years before the community stepped in and joined up.

37:45.760 --> 37:52.720
So PortGet, tools like that are mostly developed from scratch by the community.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.280
So I guess so.

37:54.280 --> 38:01.720
We have an ARM fork because somebody noticed that they wanted to put Crux on ARM, so that

38:01.720 --> 38:02.720
was created.

38:02.720 --> 38:03.720
And yeah.

38:03.720 --> 38:04.720
Fair enough.

38:04.720 --> 38:05.720
I guess so.

38:05.720 --> 38:06.720
Yeah.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.720
Wimpy, you know, you touched on it.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.600
Maybe it was in the pre-show, Josh was like, yeah, boy, when I found out I had to compile

38:11.600 --> 38:12.600
my kernel.

38:12.600 --> 38:17.840
Wimpy, do you have some wisdom when it comes to building the kernel under Crux?

38:17.840 --> 38:18.840
Not wisdom.

38:18.840 --> 38:23.260
I mean, obviously, you read the Crux page and it makes it very clear that they use the

38:23.260 --> 38:25.840
words experienced Linux users.

38:25.840 --> 38:29.160
So I see this and I think, right, brilliant, let's get a large glass of whiskey, roll our

38:29.160 --> 38:31.160
sleeves up and get stuck in.

38:31.160 --> 38:36.560
So the install, I found very similar to Arch, if you've installed Arch since they got rid

38:36.560 --> 38:40.520
of the menu based installer, Crux and Arch are very similar.

38:40.520 --> 38:50.400
And I would say that installing Crux is as easy, in quotes, as installing Arch, although...

38:50.400 --> 38:53.800
But you have to compile the majority of the stuff.

38:53.800 --> 38:58.680
Well, the install, everything comes from binaries except the kernel.

38:58.680 --> 39:06.520
So my critique would be that as part of the install, stick a kernel on that's pre-built

39:06.520 --> 39:10.120
with the defaults because the defaults are very good.

39:10.120 --> 39:13.560
And then for the tinkerers and tweakers, you can then...

39:13.560 --> 39:20.320
Couldn't you grab the live cities kernel image from the live cities slash bot?

39:20.320 --> 39:21.320
You could.

39:21.320 --> 39:22.320
Yeah.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.320
I didn't think...

39:23.320 --> 39:29.720
The live city kernel, it's built with modules and stuff like that.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.720
It might be a bit tricky to move over.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.720
I'm not really sure it's simpler, but...

39:33.720 --> 39:34.720
But I would actually...

39:34.720 --> 39:40.080
I actually think building the kernel is the easiest part of the Crux install because you

39:40.080 --> 39:45.200
just go into the kernel source directory, make menu config, choose your options, make

39:45.200 --> 39:46.200
all...

39:46.200 --> 39:49.920
Make module install and then copy the image over and then edit the grub.

39:49.920 --> 39:54.160
The hard part is editing Lilo and moving the VMZ image over.

39:54.160 --> 39:57.960
But because the source code is already on the ISO, it's not like...

39:57.960 --> 39:59.720
For me, when it comes time to...

39:59.720 --> 40:03.760
For me, building a kernel from scratch is you use links to go to kernel.org, you download

40:03.760 --> 40:07.520
the freaking source code, you extract the freaking source code, then you go into that

40:07.520 --> 40:10.380
new directory that you've just extracted and then you make menu config.

40:10.380 --> 40:13.760
For me, the fact that the folder was already there and extracted made it easy.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.040
It doesn't seem that hard to me.

40:15.040 --> 40:20.120
Yes, there's the man who's got a Bonobo Extreme with a sexy CPU.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.360
I'm on a seven-year-old laptop.

40:22.360 --> 40:25.120
It's not how difficult it is, it's how long it takes.

40:25.120 --> 40:26.120
Okay, all right.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.120
Fair enough.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.120
That's the real thing.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.120
How long it takes.

40:29.120 --> 40:30.520
It's like, I have other stuff I need to do.

40:30.520 --> 40:36.680
And I get it, once you're up and running with it, it's potentially just as easy as running

40:36.680 --> 40:43.520
an Arch install, if not easier, but it's the time you have to initially take into it might

40:43.520 --> 40:45.320
not be appealing to some individuals.

40:45.320 --> 40:46.320
Now hold on.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.320
BitPuff and...

40:47.320 --> 40:48.320
Oh, go ahead, Fredrik.

40:48.320 --> 40:53.080
Yeah, and if you notice you need something that's not really provided by the community,

40:53.080 --> 40:56.080
it might be a bit of a pain in the ass.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.080
Sorry.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.080
Well, I mean...

40:58.080 --> 40:59.080
Like Steam, for example.

40:59.080 --> 41:03.840
We have had a few people who got it running, but it is a lot of work and you need to install

41:03.840 --> 41:06.960
half the internet for libraries and stuff like that.

41:06.960 --> 41:11.040
So yeah, you could do it, but perhaps it's not really the distribution you want if you

41:11.040 --> 41:12.040
need to do that.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.040
Well, there's that.

41:13.040 --> 41:17.080
But it sounds like what BitPuffin is saying is that the port system might actually have

41:17.080 --> 41:18.880
a solution for some folks.

41:18.880 --> 41:19.880
BitPuffin?

41:19.880 --> 41:20.880
Yeah.

41:20.880 --> 41:25.040
So you could theoretically make a port that builds the kernel and stuff for you, and I

41:25.040 --> 41:28.680
think people have attempted maintaining that in the past, just that they probably maybe

41:28.680 --> 41:31.080
left or something, or very probably knows that they've been...

41:31.080 --> 41:32.400
But it's technically possible.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.400
Yeah.

41:33.400 --> 41:34.400
Okay.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.400
Well, all right.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.400
That makes sense.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.160
I've been dancing around this question the whole time, wimpy.

41:38.160 --> 41:43.580
I really want to know, as a former Crux maintainer, but it gives you a bit of a bias, I'm sure,

41:43.580 --> 41:44.580
but I'm really curious.

41:44.580 --> 41:46.760
I know you dove into it more recently again.

41:46.760 --> 41:50.220
What was it like going back and what were your impressions?

41:50.220 --> 41:57.000
I was really surprised how little has changed in the last 10 or 12 years.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.480
Is that good?

41:58.480 --> 42:01.080
Well, I think it is.

42:01.080 --> 42:05.520
I've got some notes here and towards the end I explain why I think it's a good thing.

42:05.520 --> 42:11.400
But yeah, the package system, the way it's distributed, the way it's installed, the fact

42:11.400 --> 42:18.000
you have to compile the kernel as part of the install, the package tools, PRT-GET even

42:18.000 --> 42:24.520
or PKG-GET, I forget, PRT-GET, it's all as it was when there's no dependencies in the

42:24.520 --> 42:28.840
base package system, which is just how I remember it.

42:28.840 --> 42:35.280
But it was this compiling stuff from source that ultimately reminded me why it was I left

42:35.280 --> 42:38.800
Crux in the first place.

42:38.800 --> 42:44.680
And that was because I'd been using Crux for two years and what I realized was that I hadn't

42:44.680 --> 42:48.880
actually used my Linux workstations for anything productive whatsoever.

42:48.880 --> 42:54.760
I just spent two years compiling stuff, tinkering and configuring my system, but not actually

42:54.760 --> 43:00.840
using it, which is sort of bad, but it's also good because I learned an awful lot during

43:00.840 --> 43:06.600
those two years and I owe the project a debt of gratitude because I learned about all of

43:06.600 --> 43:12.120
the file systems, I learned about compiling kernels, I learned about loading modules and

43:12.120 --> 43:16.240
when to choose to make kernel modules and when to build them into the kernel.

43:16.240 --> 43:21.220
And this was all invaluable skills that have served me well to this day.

43:21.220 --> 43:28.360
So there is a place for Crux to exist and I couldn't see myself using it now as my main

43:28.360 --> 43:34.880
operating system, but for people that are out there that have installed Debian or Ubuntu

43:34.880 --> 43:40.120
or Mint and then want to learn a bit more about how Linux works, then you can graduate

43:40.120 --> 43:46.320
to maybe a Debian net install, text-based installer and then install all of your packages

43:46.320 --> 43:52.680
and compile it and build it and then migrate to Arch Linux and then migrate to Crux, which

43:52.680 --> 43:56.700
will give you an even deeper understanding of how you put together a Linux operating

43:56.700 --> 44:01.920
system and then you can go for something like Linux from scratch to really learn how the

44:01.920 --> 44:08.940
boot manager talks to the kernel, talks to the init process and round off your understanding

44:08.940 --> 44:10.000
about how it will work.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.440
So there's a place for Crux and without Crux there probably wouldn't have been an Arch

44:14.440 --> 44:15.440
Linux.

44:15.440 --> 44:16.440
So it's pretty great.

44:16.440 --> 44:17.440
Whimby, let me ask you this then.

44:17.440 --> 44:23.540
I mean I noticed, I like your graduation scale of ways like stepping up your learning, starting

44:23.540 --> 44:27.520
with net install of Debian and stepping up there, but there's the elephant in the room

44:27.520 --> 44:32.320
in your step there is it seems like it might be possible to take Crux out of that step

44:32.320 --> 44:34.640
and insert Gentoo and have the same effect.

44:34.640 --> 44:39.560
Do you feel like you have a clear differentiator in your mind where Crux is strongly differentiating

44:39.560 --> 44:42.080
from Gentoo and why you might choose one over the other?

44:42.080 --> 44:50.760
Yeah, I think you could say that Gentoo helps you a little bit more along than Crux does.

44:50.760 --> 44:56.920
The package system eBuilds are a little bit more flexible and more mature as well.

44:56.920 --> 45:03.440
I mean some of the things I ran into installing the system was footprint errors, which was

45:03.440 --> 45:08.040
frustrating because installing a lot of packages takes a long time.

45:08.040 --> 45:14.480
You can't rely on it to complete automatically in the background because you get footprint

45:14.480 --> 45:17.480
errors that you have to then go to and sort out.

45:17.480 --> 45:22.480
True, yeah, I guess regarding the footprint errors, I really do think we need to improve

45:22.480 --> 45:26.720
that bit.

45:26.720 --> 45:31.600
You could have new footprint errors or you could have missing and of course new.

45:31.600 --> 45:38.440
It just might be because you installed CUPS or whatever and some crucial packages are

45:38.440 --> 45:43.600
built with the printer support and you get a new library file and yeah, you get an error.

45:43.600 --> 45:49.440
It's not really pretty at the moment but yeah, we could improve that and we probably will.

45:49.440 --> 45:54.240
Yeah, I mean those things happen and it's an ongoing process.

45:54.240 --> 45:57.080
I know some other folks in the mumble room had a chance to kick the tires.

45:57.080 --> 46:00.880
Anybody else want to chime in with their thoughts about Crux?

46:00.880 --> 46:05.180
I can see Wimpy's point as a learning tool.

46:05.180 --> 46:07.480
It's a very humbling experience.

46:07.480 --> 46:11.120
With every time I want to try and do something, I have to think a little bit but I don't see

46:11.120 --> 46:15.760
a whole lot of, and I might get my head bit off for saying this, I didn't see a whole

46:15.760 --> 46:17.920
lot of practical purpose for it.

46:17.920 --> 46:23.980
Yeah, I guess that's a fair point I think.

46:23.980 --> 46:24.980
You could use it.

46:24.980 --> 46:31.680
I use it at home, at work, pretty much everywhere but yeah, you can find another tool that perhaps

46:31.680 --> 46:32.680
does the job better.

46:32.680 --> 46:35.960
Yeah, and I kind of like that attitude of the project.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.320
It's like, hey, that's fine and I think Kernel Linux, I think you and I kind of fall in the

46:39.320 --> 46:44.040
same camp where it's like, yeah, this tool isn't the right one for my box, hello, but

46:44.040 --> 46:50.000
I think there are some boxes that tool fits quite well and like Joe Prager in the chat

46:50.000 --> 46:56.040
room says that Crux has been his main workstation for almost a decade now.

46:56.040 --> 46:59.800
For some folks, it does happen to fit that.

46:59.800 --> 47:03.240
So Noah, were you able to get it installed or did you kind of read through the documentation

47:03.240 --> 47:06.760
and hit some road bumps and stop there?

47:06.760 --> 47:11.200
First I tried installing it on VirtualBox and that turned out to be a huge mistake.

47:11.200 --> 47:17.780
I guess the way that the Kernel compiles, I understand that I guess it's a little bit

47:17.780 --> 47:19.660
different if you're going to do it on a VirtualBox.

47:19.660 --> 47:24.680
What I ended up doing is I bought one of those Chrome boxes from Best Buy for like 150 bucks,

47:24.680 --> 47:26.760
I ended up installing it on that.

47:26.760 --> 47:31.640
And yeah, I got it installed so everything worked okay, it was kind of what somebody

47:31.640 --> 47:35.560
else said it already but it was one of those things that like after a couple hours of every

47:35.560 --> 47:39.560
time I wanted to do something, going out and compiling all it, I just kind of was like,

47:39.560 --> 47:41.040
well, that was Crux.

47:41.040 --> 47:46.680
Yeah, I understand, but BitPuff, you say, hey, to me that means I know just about where

47:46.680 --> 47:48.080
every file is on my system.

47:48.080 --> 47:50.560
I can go in and fix anything I need to, right?

47:50.560 --> 47:58.600
Yeah, and like when things go wrong, we just know how to fix them and we don't like having

47:58.600 --> 48:01.640
to refer to a wiki and look for workarounds and stuff.

48:01.640 --> 48:05.240
Is it a bit of a ticker aspect?

48:05.240 --> 48:10.080
Not so much a ticker, it's just more like we have, it looks like a more close relationship

48:10.080 --> 48:11.080
to the system.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.080
I understand that.

48:12.080 --> 48:16.800
In Arch, you might not know what everything does because it just magically configures

48:16.800 --> 48:21.600
stuff but here we kind of do a lot of things on our own so we know how to fix things.

48:21.600 --> 48:23.320
You are one with your file system.

48:23.320 --> 48:24.320
Yeah.

48:24.320 --> 48:25.640
Yeah, no, I get that.

48:25.640 --> 48:30.920
I actually, I also don't feel like, you know, I don't think like, I think sometimes we're

48:30.920 --> 48:35.080
always trying to look for like, and this comes back from like the 80s, like computers are

48:35.080 --> 48:39.500
useful tools that have practical reasons to use them all the time and sometimes it's okay

48:39.500 --> 48:43.640
to say, you know what, I have a computer over here and I like to tinker a little bit with

48:43.640 --> 48:44.640
the OS.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.360
I like to be a little bit of a hobbyist and I can also get my work, and I kind of feel

48:47.360 --> 48:50.000
like that's for me, that's where Arch fits.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.760
It's like it's very serious and gets work done but I can also tinker with it.

48:52.760 --> 48:54.320
Do you feel it fits in there, Noah?

48:54.320 --> 48:57.800
Yeah, I was just going to, you hit on something important.

48:57.800 --> 49:03.200
I love that mentality and I think here's what bothered me specifically, Crux, and Arch falls

49:03.200 --> 49:04.200
into this too.

49:04.200 --> 49:09.320
I feel like I find myself in a monkey see, monkey do situation where I'm doing stuff

49:09.320 --> 49:13.960
to get things done but I don't necessarily understand what I'm doing and I feel like

49:13.960 --> 49:18.600
when I ask for help, everyone wants to give me the answer to how to get the job done but

49:18.600 --> 49:22.400
nobody wants to explain why it is I'm executing the commands I'm executing.

49:22.400 --> 49:23.400
Hmm.

49:23.400 --> 49:27.960
Yeah, I get that can also, that can be a symptom of a wiki.

49:27.960 --> 49:31.360
You know, because it's just there, you just kind of fall into this copy paste syndrome.

49:31.360 --> 49:32.360
Right.

49:32.360 --> 49:33.360
That makes sense.

49:33.360 --> 49:36.360
And then you do, so maybe you're not learning if you're doing that.

49:36.360 --> 49:37.880
I think you're always learning something, right?

49:37.880 --> 49:41.600
Like even if, even if I know what, what commands to execute to get something done, even if

49:41.600 --> 49:44.040
I don't understand what those commands are doing, I'm still learning something.

49:44.040 --> 49:48.040
But there are, there are multiple times I was like, I wonder what exactly that's doing.

49:48.040 --> 49:51.600
That's like, that's really interesting and I just feel, I mean, it's not that it's anyone's

49:51.600 --> 49:55.180
job to explain it to me, but it would have been, it'd be nice if there was more explanation

49:55.180 --> 49:56.800
to what each of those commands do.

49:56.800 --> 49:57.800
Yeah, I do.

49:57.800 --> 49:58.800
Yeah, I agree.

49:58.800 --> 50:03.120
Well, like one thing about the community that I find kind of different also is like with

50:03.120 --> 50:04.120
what you're saying.

50:04.120 --> 50:08.400
Like in Arch, I definitely feel like people are just like, Oh, you know, you just do this.

50:08.400 --> 50:13.280
But in the Crux IRC, for example, I feel like they are much more pedagogical, but of course

50:13.280 --> 50:17.260
we could probably be better than we currently are, but I still feel like there was a big

50:17.260 --> 50:22.360
difference from Arch to Crux in how friendly people are with helping new people.

50:22.360 --> 50:23.360
Yeah.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.360
Yeah.

50:24.360 --> 50:25.720
I mean, Arch does kind of have a bad rep for that.

50:25.720 --> 50:26.720
All right.

50:26.720 --> 50:29.240
Last call for Crux thoughts before we move on to our next topic.

50:29.240 --> 50:34.720
This has been a fascinating, I actually, in some ways, I think you guys are lining up

50:34.720 --> 50:36.720
exactly with kind of where I fell on it on Sunday.

50:36.720 --> 50:39.320
Matt, do you have any thoughts before we wrap up?

50:39.320 --> 50:40.320
I think that's really it.

50:40.320 --> 50:44.240
I think that the meat and potatoes of it, it comes down to that you can actually, you

50:44.240 --> 50:49.580
know, learn how Linux works, understand what's going on and go beyond merely reading a Wiki.

50:49.580 --> 50:53.080
That if you have a community with Crux that you can actually ask, why is it, why am I

50:53.080 --> 50:55.600
doing this specifically as Noah pointed out?

50:55.600 --> 51:00.640
That's really cool because in most other distributions, you are basically just copying and pasting.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.400
So I think it's a great learning tool.

51:02.400 --> 51:03.640
I think that's what I see it as.

51:03.640 --> 51:08.320
It's a great way to understand what your end result's going to be.

51:08.320 --> 51:11.120
If I do this, this happens, but I had to do this to get there.

51:11.120 --> 51:12.120
Oh, that's cool.

51:12.120 --> 51:13.120
Yeah.

51:13.120 --> 51:14.120
Yeah.

51:14.120 --> 51:15.120
Yeah.

51:15.120 --> 51:16.120
Very well said.

51:16.120 --> 51:17.120
All right, Mumble Room.

51:17.120 --> 51:18.120
Go ahead.

51:18.120 --> 51:19.120
Go ahead.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.120
Last call for any thoughts.

51:20.120 --> 51:24.840
I think if you're eyeballing Gentoo and you have the time or like Matt said, the urge

51:24.840 --> 51:28.360
to learn, try out Crux first.

51:28.360 --> 51:30.360
That's the one thing I have to say.

51:30.360 --> 51:31.360
Very nice.

51:31.360 --> 51:32.360
All right.

51:32.360 --> 51:36.480
Well, I've got something that's been floating around the web and seems to have really resonated

51:36.480 --> 51:41.520
with a lot of Linux users, long time Linux users and new Linux users that I want to bounce

51:41.520 --> 51:43.520
around with you guys and get your take on it.

51:43.520 --> 51:45.720
So first let's stop and thank Ting.

51:45.720 --> 51:50.760
Go over to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com, think about that for a second.

51:50.760 --> 51:54.320
First of all, we've got a mobile carrier to create a URL that has Linux in it.

51:54.320 --> 51:58.080
So go to linux.ting.com to rock it, to thank them for supporting Linux Unplugged.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.080
Now what is Ting?

51:59.080 --> 52:00.400
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.340
My mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider.

52:03.340 --> 52:04.560
And here's what Matt and I love about it.

52:04.560 --> 52:05.560
No contract.

52:05.560 --> 52:07.000
That means no ETF.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.200
Don't ever worry about that.

52:08.200 --> 52:09.600
You don't have to deal with it.

52:09.600 --> 52:12.920
Plus, it's pricing structure is so simple.

52:12.920 --> 52:14.480
It's a flat $6 a month.

52:14.480 --> 52:15.480
Okay.

52:15.480 --> 52:16.480
$6 a month.

52:16.480 --> 52:19.280
Then any taxes the man's going to put on that because the man be taxing.

52:19.280 --> 52:23.440
But then it's just your usage, minutes, messages, megabytes.

52:23.440 --> 52:24.440
They add them up.

52:24.440 --> 52:27.160
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay.

52:27.160 --> 52:28.960
That's how all mobile companies should be.

52:28.960 --> 52:29.960
It's so unbelievable.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.300
It seems impossible, but it's legit.

52:31.300 --> 52:32.300
That's how Ting works.

52:32.300 --> 52:35.040
In fact, if you go over to Ting, they have the savings calculator.

52:35.040 --> 52:36.840
Pop that savings calculator.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.040
Put your usage in there.

52:38.040 --> 52:40.080
Not what they're scamming you out of.

52:40.080 --> 52:41.520
Not the amounts they're getting you to pay.

52:41.520 --> 52:43.880
Oh, well, you might use a thousand minutes, right?

52:43.880 --> 52:45.800
You better pay a thousand minutes every single month.

52:45.800 --> 52:48.000
Oh, actually, it turns out I only use 500 minutes.

52:48.000 --> 52:49.880
Well, I'm in a two-year contract.

52:49.880 --> 52:51.400
No, no, no.

52:51.400 --> 52:53.840
Go over to linux.ting.com.

52:53.840 --> 52:54.960
Click the savings calculator.

52:54.960 --> 52:57.640
Put your actual usage in there, and then get ready for this.

52:57.640 --> 53:00.000
Look at the savings, and then I've got good news.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.960
Ting has an early termination relief program.

53:01.960 --> 53:05.080
They'll pay up to $75 per line that you have to cancel.

53:05.080 --> 53:08.200
Then you're like, Chris, not good enough, buddy, because I got this phone, and this

53:08.200 --> 53:09.800
phone don't work on the Ting network.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.280
I got you covered.

53:11.280 --> 53:12.960
Actually, Ting's got you covered.

53:12.960 --> 53:14.040
They have a swap program.

53:14.040 --> 53:19.360
You can bring your smartphone over to Ting, and they'll swap it for a Ting-ready device.

53:19.360 --> 53:23.440
If you've got an AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobes device, bring that over to Ting, and take

53:23.440 --> 53:26.160
advantage of their swap program, and they're going to hook you up.

53:26.160 --> 53:28.440
And then you're taking advantage of the Ting control panel.

53:28.440 --> 53:30.120
Then you're only paying for what you've used.

53:30.120 --> 53:34.600
Then you've got no-hold customer service at 1855-TING-FTW, where a real person answers

53:34.600 --> 53:35.600
the phone.

53:35.600 --> 53:36.600
You've got hotspot.

53:36.600 --> 53:41.040
You've got tethering, picture messaging, caller ID, all built into every single plan, and

53:41.040 --> 53:43.160
you only pay for your usage.

53:43.160 --> 53:44.720
That's what's so awesome about Ting.

53:44.720 --> 53:48.900
And when you combine it with devices like the Nexus 5, hello, you can go get an awesome

53:48.900 --> 53:52.920
smartphone that you straight-up, legit own, and then go put it on a network where there's

53:52.920 --> 53:56.920
no contract, no early termination fee, and you're paying for your usage.

53:56.920 --> 54:02.280
Linux.ting.com will take $25 off your first device, $25 off your first device if you're

54:02.280 --> 54:03.440
going to bring a device.

54:03.440 --> 54:07.520
They'll give you a $25 service credit, and if you're like me, that's going to pay for

54:07.520 --> 54:09.360
more than your first month.

54:09.360 --> 54:10.360
Linux.ting.com.

54:10.360 --> 54:11.360
Linux.ting.com.

54:11.360 --> 54:17.640
And a really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

54:17.640 --> 54:20.640
Matt and I are here to tell you, the Ting service rocks.

54:20.640 --> 54:24.440
And Matt, I don't know if you've traveled outside of Washington much because, you know,

54:24.440 --> 54:27.440
I don't think you have since we haven't missed a week of shows.

54:27.440 --> 54:28.440
I don't think you have.

54:28.440 --> 54:30.320
I was going to say, the big secret is I never leave the house.

54:30.320 --> 54:31.320
Yeah.

54:31.320 --> 54:35.200
So, but that was great because I'm pretty much always here at the studio or I'm at the

54:35.200 --> 54:36.200
house and I'm on Wi-Fi.

54:36.200 --> 54:40.340
So, I save a ton of money that way, and if you out there are in a similar situation,

54:40.340 --> 54:44.280
there is ridiculous savings to be had, but even if you do end up on the road and use

54:44.280 --> 54:46.760
a fair amount of data or minutes, there's still savings to be had.

54:46.760 --> 54:49.880
If you can take advantage of Wi-Fi, then it really gets blitz nuts.

54:49.880 --> 54:53.960
I'll tell you though, Matt, since you don't travel much, I was very happy to report that

54:53.960 --> 54:58.200
when we were down in Portland, I was getting LTE coverage like a boss everywhere I went.

54:58.200 --> 54:59.200
Nice.

54:59.200 --> 55:03.280
So, yeah, I felt like I was actually living in 2014.

55:03.280 --> 55:04.280
It was pretty cool.

55:04.280 --> 55:07.920
Well, and what's weird here recently is I've always had good coverage in the house, actually.

55:07.920 --> 55:12.200
I have a Verizon phone and I have a Ting phone, and, you know, they're both different companies

55:12.200 --> 55:14.480
doing their thing, but I've noticed that Ting always got better coverage.

55:14.480 --> 55:18.440
What was interesting is recently, and I don't know what happened, I got more bars.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.440
Boom!

55:19.440 --> 55:20.440
I don't know what...

55:20.440 --> 55:21.440
More bars, yeah.

55:21.440 --> 55:22.440
I don't know if they...

55:22.440 --> 55:23.440
Well, they're firing up LTE...

55:23.440 --> 55:24.440
Did they turn on a power?

55:24.440 --> 55:25.440
No, yeah, they are.

55:25.440 --> 55:26.440
Yeah, all over it.

55:26.440 --> 55:27.440
So, they're...

55:27.440 --> 55:28.440
It just totally destroyed Verizon.

55:28.440 --> 55:29.440
Yeah, there has been a big rollout for the last...

55:29.440 --> 55:30.440
So, this is the other thing, too, about the coverage.

55:30.440 --> 55:33.120
The coverage, the entire coverage map has changed in the last year and it's still continuing

55:33.120 --> 55:34.120
to change, too.

55:34.120 --> 55:35.120
It's really kind of neat.

55:35.120 --> 55:37.240
They're really making an investment in that.

55:37.240 --> 55:41.760
Okay, I wanted to bounce around a topic with you in the mumble room.

55:41.760 --> 55:50.080
It's a piece that was over on fosforce.com and it's been making the rounds.

55:50.080 --> 55:54.640
Every news outlet I follow to collect news for these shows has been carrying this piece.

55:54.640 --> 55:58.400
And the title is, you've probably heard about it, When Linux Was Perfect Enough.

55:58.400 --> 56:00.120
All right, I'm not going to quibble about the title.

56:00.120 --> 56:02.400
I'm not a huge fan of it, but okay, whatever.

56:02.400 --> 56:03.400
So, here it is.

56:03.400 --> 56:04.400
The other day, this is...

56:04.400 --> 56:05.400
I'm going to summarize it for you.

56:05.400 --> 56:09.800
This is from Christine Hall and she writes, the other day, my colleague, friend, and sometimes

56:09.800 --> 56:14.280
partner in crime, Ken Starks, published an article here on Fosforce on one of his favorite

56:14.280 --> 56:17.080
gripes, that things didn't work right in Linux.

56:17.080 --> 56:20.760
This time, he was complaining about the font issue in Mint when using KDE.

56:20.760 --> 56:23.000
This is nothing new for Ken.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.440
In the past, he's written other articles about broken aspects of various Linux distros that

56:26.440 --> 56:31.320
never seem to get quite fixed and his contention is these small bugs, which remain unfixed

56:31.320 --> 56:36.600
release after release, are largely responsible for desktop Linux failures to take hold with

56:36.600 --> 56:37.600
the general public.

56:37.600 --> 56:40.760
Now, here's the thing, she says, he might be right.

56:40.760 --> 56:45.080
For Christmas, I bought my roommate a new second generation Nexus 7 tablet running Android,

56:45.080 --> 56:47.520
an OS built around the Linux kernel.

56:47.520 --> 56:51.120
It just worked out of the box with no tweaking necessary.

56:51.120 --> 56:55.480
During the last seven months, she's used it for hours daily and as far as I know, she's

56:55.480 --> 56:58.120
never found any glitches that require fixing.

56:58.120 --> 57:02.360
I point this out because Linux is all but taken over the tablet and phone end of the

57:02.360 --> 57:03.360
computing spectrum.

57:03.360 --> 57:06.800
Alba makes plenty of money with the iPhone and iPad, but that's due to their high prices.

57:06.800 --> 57:09.760
In market share, they lag far behind Android devices.

57:09.760 --> 57:14.760
And Microsoft has proven that Windows is not unbeatable anymore.

57:14.760 --> 57:16.680
It's not the giant it once was.

57:16.680 --> 57:20.180
Even with massive money spent on television ads and conspicuous product placement in nearly

57:20.180 --> 57:25.120
every scripted drama on CBS, mobile devices running Windows remain a mere asterisk when

57:25.120 --> 57:26.120
looking at market share.

57:26.120 --> 57:31.000
Today's average computer users, and I loathe to use the word consumers, want to get things

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
done on their computers without having to delve under the hood to fix things.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.520
This is understandable and isn't unlike the average automobile owner who just want to

57:39.520 --> 57:42.960
drive their cars without knowing or caring how it works.

57:42.960 --> 57:46.680
Just as most drivers take their cars to the shop for repair to solve mechanical and computer

57:46.680 --> 57:51.200
related issues, most computer users take their device to the shop with no concern about whether

57:51.200 --> 57:53.260
the problem is hardware or software related.

57:53.260 --> 57:55.120
They just want the damn thing to work.

57:55.120 --> 57:58.720
Back in 2002, I installed GNU Linux for the first time.

57:58.720 --> 58:02.680
At that time, like most Americans, I was tethered to a dial-up connection.

58:02.680 --> 58:06.080
And she goes on to talk about all of the little hardware problems that she had but didn't

58:06.080 --> 58:07.080
care about.

58:07.080 --> 58:09.780
You know, sound card didn't work, scanners didn't work.

58:09.780 --> 58:15.640
But gone finally was the blue screen of death and that nearly daily crash that was business

58:15.640 --> 58:17.240
as usual with Windows.

58:17.240 --> 58:21.040
Unfortunately, gone were a lot of my peripherals that used to just work.

58:21.040 --> 58:22.080
But I didn't mind.

58:22.080 --> 58:26.260
I was free of Microsoft and I was using a different operating system that made me feel

58:26.260 --> 58:29.140
like some sort of computer genius.

58:29.140 --> 58:34.240
My point is that back in those days, none of these flaws mattered.

58:34.240 --> 58:39.640
Most of us were already used to having to fiddle with configuration files and such.

58:39.640 --> 58:43.960
Even using IBM compatible computers running Microsoft products, you still had problems.

58:43.960 --> 58:48.340
Like most users in those days, I'd cut my teeth on command line DOS machines where printers

58:48.340 --> 58:51.680
had to be configured separately for each and every program and where the ability to write

58:51.680 --> 58:55.420
a succinct autoexec.bat was necessary.

58:55.420 --> 58:57.560
But that's not who's using computers today.

58:57.560 --> 59:02.520
Today computer users just want the computer to work without problems out of the box.

59:02.520 --> 59:05.560
They don't want to have to figure out why Hulu or Netflix doesn't work or why their

59:05.560 --> 59:09.480
fonts display properly in some applications but not others.

59:09.480 --> 59:11.720
These days, that includes me.

59:11.720 --> 59:17.800
While I'm happy I have enough skills to usually fix a bug that made in the past, while I'm

59:17.800 --> 59:23.040
glad I have the skills to usually fix a bug that made past developers of Mint and Fedora,

59:23.040 --> 59:26.120
I just assume not be able to deal with it at all.

59:26.120 --> 59:31.040
I have work I have to get done and when I'm not working, I want to be wasting my time

59:31.040 --> 59:34.920
with friends on Facebook, not getting aggravated with my computer.

59:34.920 --> 59:41.320
So she's making the point, what she's trying to say here is Linux's amount of tweaking

59:41.320 --> 59:48.480
it takes to work sometimes was okay five years ago or so, back when all computers were like

59:48.480 --> 59:49.480
that.

59:49.480 --> 59:54.480
But a lot of computers, when you look at Chromebooks and iPads and MacBooks, have moved forward

59:54.480 --> 59:59.880
where that tweaking and that stuff just doesn't really happen at all anymore on those.

59:59.880 --> 01:00:03.880
And it's no longer acceptable that Linux is still requiring that amount of configuration.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.600
Matt, on its face, do you think the premise is roughly accurate?

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:14.720
Not only is it accurate, but her source actually, unlike us who talk a lot, actually is in the

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:18.280
trenches putting Linux and computers in front of people that can't afford them.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:22.640
So I mean, he really knows what he's talking about, literally, at the base level.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.640
Ken does.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.640
Yeah, Ken does.

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:25.640
Exactly.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.560
And I used to be one of those guys that actually swap people out and stuff like that, but nothing

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.560
like he does.

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.640
So he's seen this and loving Linux and he's seen this on a daily basis.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640
And he's right.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.080
I mean, at the end of the day, there are certain paper cuts that exist on the most polished

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.920
Linux desktop that can frustrate people to a certain extent.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.200
That being said, I've been a big supporter of the idea that with a proper support system

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.800
in place, this would not be a problem.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.360
I've seen various companies attempt this, Linspire, Zombo, various, various attempts

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.560
all failures, but the idea was sound.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.520
Provide that Apple-like experience.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.520
Here's the rub.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:05.560
As soon as you point to anything that basically has the word A in it, like Apple, or has any

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.560
other non-Linux flavor to it or doesn't require you to get your hands dirty, a lot of Linux

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.120
people get really butt-hurt and really upset by that.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.720
And I never really understood what the big deal was.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.040
First of all, how many of them have actually experienced what Ken's talking about or what

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:24.920
she's talking about specifically, the author of the article.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920
It's interesting.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.840
I think that we're going to have to really noodle that over.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.920
Let me toss this to Faith.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.600
Faith says the problem here is that there's not enough pre-installed Linux machines.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.920
Faith, do you think it's not a fair comparison because a lot of people buy a machine and

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.640
a lot of stuff is already set up for them?

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.640
What do you think?

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.280
Well, I just think the issue is a little bit more complex.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.320
It's not any one thing.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:47.360
And for some people that need, like you said, Hulu or Netflix, that's going to be an issue.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.360
But I've done installs for my friends and family.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.960
And for example, I don't think anybody I've installed Linux for, they've used Hulu or

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.320
Netflix on their computer.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.840
They have it on their set-top box.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.640
So that hasn't been an issue, but they never would have used Linux if it wasn't for me.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.600
Because even if you have a perfect distro where you never have to get your hands dirty,

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.200
you still have to get your hands dirty to get the distro on the computer.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.000
And it's just there are companies that sell pre-installed Linux, but you have to already

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.600
know what Linux is and go find them.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.800
Colonel Linux, you've got your ears on.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.560
You've moved a lot of users over to desktop Linux.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.020
But when you do it, you're probably maybe smoothing over a few rough edges, even if

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:30.560
it's just somebody setting up creating user accounts, maybe adding the printer.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.280
What's your take on this article, Colonel Linux?

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.280
Right.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.280
No.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280
So I agree completely.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.280
And I want to echo what Faith said.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:41.800
I think the biggest problem is, I watched, and I was ragging on this in the mumble room

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.600
I think a couple days ago, but I was in Best Buy and this lady comes in and she's sitting

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.160
there and she goes, yeah, I need to buy a new computer.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.080
And so I was looking at one of those MacBooks, so they go over, well, what do you do?

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.680
Well, I checked my Gmail and I like to watch YouTube videos.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.920
Oh, and I like to go on Facebook.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.040
And I'm like, that's a Linux user right there.

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.040
That could be a Linux user.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.360
And the only reason she's not a Linux user is because there's no computer she can pick

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.560
up in this brick and mortar store other than a Chromebook that has Linux installed.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.560
But when I was listening to you read that article, one of the things that stood out

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.800
to me is how many of those problems are not Linux's fault.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:15.800
For example, Netflix.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.320
Yes, we don't have Netflix.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.200
Yes, it's a hack together solution.

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.360
What are we supposed to do about it?

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:28.180
If Netflix won't, if the market share doesn't dictate enough users for Netflix to make the

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:32.800
necessary changes to support Linux, what are we as Linux users supposed to do about that?

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.920
Well, okay, so, I mean, you mentioned the Chromebook.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.360
That's the elephant in the room, I think.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:43.200
I think the Chromebook is successful Linux in a sense.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:48.400
I think the Chromebook represents what a company that takes Linux and consumerizes it and ships

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.120
it on the desktop, just like the Android is also that.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.880
See, the thing is, is that Linux itself is just a general technology.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.840
And what I think we sometimes forget is we are the ones electing to implement this general

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.680
technology as a purpose workstation, right?

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.940
And it's not necessarily, we are taking something that's not necessarily an end product and

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.600
forming it into an end product, and it's not like we're doing it on billions of dollars

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.960
of budgets like the folks at Google are doing when they're making Chrome OS.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.640
So I think when you look at it from that standpoint, it's not a fair measurement to completely

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.720
compare it to a commercial offering.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.680
And I think we need companies like System76 to come in and say, here it is as a product.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.240
I've always said, I think one of the important roles that System76 plays is they productize

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:37.600
Linux because it isn't just, here's the ISO, or here's the DVD, or here's the box set.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.600
We've tried that.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600
It doesn't work.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:43.680
It's really got to be kind of an end-to-end consumer solution.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:50.840
And right now, it's kind of Android and Chrome OS as far as Linux goes at a large scale.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840
So here's my...

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840
Yeah.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.840
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:54.840
No, go ahead.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.840
No, so here's my question to you.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.340
So Chrome OS is technically Linux under the hood, and I can get to a root shell.

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:04.080
So why can't I install GNOME 3 on, what is it, Gen 2 that it's based off of?

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.080
Yeah, probably.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.080
Well, you know...

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:13.160
Gen 2 is the build system, it's just used as the staging builds.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.160
That's what I'm getting at.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.160
Yeah.

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.160
It's almost an...

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:20.800
I guess what I'm getting at is it's almost unfair to call Chrome OS Linux because, yes,

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.000
it uses a Linux kernel, but it's really not, I mean, it's not even...

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.840
Android is actually even closer to Linux than Chrome OS is, isn't it?

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.840
I don't know.

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:29.840
No.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.840
No.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:31.840
I think Chrome's closer.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.840
No.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.840
Yeah.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:41.760
I think it's an Ubuntu workstation to bootstrap the Gen 2 bootstages in a CH root.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.920
I don't even look at it like that.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:47.680
When you run a binary on Chrome OS, that's a native Linux binary.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:51.640
If you did a PSAX, you'd actually see a Linux binary process.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.380
When you run an application on Android, most of the time you're running it inside a Java

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:55.380
virtual machine.

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:58.920
That could be just as easily running on top of a Mac inside a JVM, right?

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:03.120
If they ported Dalvik over to Windows, you could run that same app.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.720
If you had all of the APIs available to you.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.040
So it's not a Linux app, right?

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.980
But on Chrome OS, those are native Linux processes.

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:14.840
That's why I think Chrome OS is more of a true Linux in a sense.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:18.880
It's a funky distinction, really.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:23.520
Chrome OS kind of takes a lot of the zeal that people have out of the whole Linux topic

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.360
because you get to run a web browser and that's about it.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:33.120
Yeah, I think what Christine Hall and what Ken are touching on is it's definitely worth

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.840
us taking it in.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:38.200
We need people out there thinking about this.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:43.760
I've got a story that we'll cover on Sunday's Linux Action Show that really does demonstrate

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:48.560
that when you take somebody, like what Colonel Linux aka NOAA is doing, where you go out

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.640
to a client or you go out to a company or you offer a service and you productize it,

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:56.920
it does work and it is usable.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:03.840
That's like the last mile essentially is that piece that takes the most work.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:12.120
I think as Chrome OS continues to show success and as Microsoft continues to sort of focus

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:18.040
on trying to create some sort of amazing synergy across all of their devices and all of the

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:24.740
UIs and as Apple continues to eventually move towards iOS and they armify their desktop,

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.640
there is going to be people watching Chrome OS and go, you know, I could do that.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:32.400
I could make it even more like an actual computer and I could do that.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.560
Maybe it's HP one day, right?

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.560
We don't know.

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.480
One of these companies could have something in the skunkworks for all we know and all

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:43.640
of a sudden, boom, they bust out a new laptop and it's like Chrome OS only it's maybe based

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.040
on Gnome 3 or something.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.360
Who knows?

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:52.160
I think what the future holds is Linux is going to have an answer for somebody who wants

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:55.680
to bring something to market and maybe what we see today isn't even what we'll have in

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.840
five years.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.640
So I'm not too worried about it and in the meantime, as long as I can keep building my

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.880
desktop, I'm happy.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.880
All right.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.880
We'll wrap it at that.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.880
Go ahead.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.000
You can close it out.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.760
I would have to say that I'm not much of an Ubuntu guy, but I would really wish that Canonical

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.380
stopped focusing on the mobile so much and go out back to the desktop a little bit and

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:25.480
actually gave us a real Linux desktop that people can buy and people can look forward

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:30.420
to buying on the shelves instead of only looking towards the phone as if the mobile was the

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.120
only future that we have.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:35.680
We have a lot of desktops, a lot of laptops, they're not selling anywhere.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:36.680
Preach it, brother.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.040
Preach it, brother.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.080
Hold those thoughts because that's actually going to... I have a topic I want to cover

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:45.120
in the post show that'll sort of underscore what Heaven's just said and I think what Wimpy

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.240
wants to touch on too.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.080
So I'll wrap us up with this.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.080

JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar will also have that in your time appropriate time

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.760
zone.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.760
The robots do that, Matt.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.320
We got robots just on standby.

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.200
That's how much skills we got here, I think.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.200
Something like that.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.200
All right.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.200
Well, we'll wrap it up right there.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.120
Thank you everyone for joining us this week on Linux Unplugged.

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.320
Be sure to join us on Sunday for a great Linux Action Show.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:58.360
That's coming up and then we'll be right back here next Tuesday.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:04.720
Matt, have a great week and make sure, I'll make sure I have some Coca-Cola for you on

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.360
Sunday because that was a disaster last time.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:08.360
That was unforgivable.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.360
All right, everyone.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.560
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:14.920
See you right back here next week.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:22.760
You know what I realized is out of context, it sounds like I'm talking about like the

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.840
kind of Coke you snort.

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.600
I'll get you some more Coke, Matt.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.920
This makes sure the mirror's actually been wiped off this time.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.760
That's the biggest issue I have.

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.000
I mean, I can't stand it when there's like snot.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Sorry about that.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
That's terrible.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Yeah, blame that on the kids, Matt.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I blame that on the kids.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
All right.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.480
So there was a story I wanted to talk about in the post show.

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:43.520
Everybody go to JBtitles.com when we talk about this and vote real quick.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.360
But I don't know if you guys saw this, but the Times of India today ran a story talking

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.400
about massive gross that Ubuntu is seeing in India.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.720
And it's not Ubuntu Touch.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.340
It's Ubuntu on the desktop.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:59.340
The Linux-based operating system grew 50% year over year in – oh, look at that nice

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.160
full-screen pop-up Times of India.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.160
That's so classy.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:06.760
50% year over year, Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, has partnered with Dell and

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.160
HP to bundle the OS.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.720
Enterprises have been moving more to the cloud.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.720
They've not commented.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:14.880
And as more enterprises move to the cloud, they'd like to have the same operating system

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.400
on the desktop and on the server.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.200
This is according to Greyhound Research's CEO.

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:24.000
And online directory service just dials among early adopters of Ubuntu, has 4,500 desktops

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
running Ubuntu currently.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.240
And I say it because they have a web-based app.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.580
It works real nice.

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:29.920
So here you go.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.920
India.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:33.240
Ubuntu is exploding in India.

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:38.680
And I guess what my point is, I guess what I get all upset about, and maybe I'm just

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.680
totally wrong.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.320
I admit that I could be wrong on this.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:47.720
But damn, it seems like Ubuntu just has like some kind of crazy-ass inertia right now.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.960
And more and more people and governments and countries are adopting it.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.320
Right at the time, they're like, oh, mobile, over here, look at this, over here.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:59.160
Like they're getting like, oh yeah, 50% year over year growth in India.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.160
In India.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160
That's huge, right?

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.720
That's fundamentally huge.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:09.480
Yeah, I mean, I think my big concern is that I do feel like that they constantly are – they

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.040
fall into the PC is dying mindset.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.600
Okay, yes, mathematically, statistically, if you pound numbers hard enough, technically

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.880
speaking, there's a big decline.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.880
No question about that.

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:22.480
Well, actually, just recently, actually tablet sales are down.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.480
Apple's tablet sales are down.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.200
Tablet sales are down and PC sales are up right now.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.200
Well then there you go.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.200
The numbers would be yes.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.720
So yeah, that totally kind of makes the point.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.280
You can't get caught into these trends.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.400
I mean, at the end of the day, people need to do things on their computers.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.000
I've tried doing things on a tablet.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.200
I can't stand it.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.920
I can't actually get work done on a tablet.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.920
But I can on a computer.

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.920
I'm weird.

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:43.920
I like a keyboard and mouse.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:44.920
I'm strange.

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.920
So –

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.240
Am I wrong in the – my general sense of it is like they're like Luke Skywalker and

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.240
like somebody on the radio is like stay on target, stay on target, Luke, stay on target.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:59.600
And then at the last stretch, they veered off target and like now it's just – now

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.840
despite that, they're still seeing adoption.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.880
Well, here's what's happening.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.640
Luke Skywalker's on target doing his thing.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.880
And here comes Han Solo on the big mobile phone, yeehaw, you know, and he does whatever

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.880
the hell he does.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:12.880
He gets all the credit.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.880
You got it, kid.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:14.880
Josh, you think I got it wrong, Josh?

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.880
Yeah.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.280
I mean, most of these governments are, you know, deploying large bounds of LTSs.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:25.080
You know, it's not like they're going to be putting the bleeding edge 14.10 unicorns

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.080
on there or something.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.080
So you think it doesn't matter?

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.080
No.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.080
I mean, that still matters.

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.840
A lot of the work that's being done for mobile is going to occur during the times between

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:35.840
LTSs.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:41.120
So by the time an LTS lands, it's theoretically going to be stable and unit D8 should by then

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:44.520
have landed an LTS and if not, then they'll just be supporting unit D7.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:52.520
Where that argument falls down is that presupposes that they can afford about a two to five year

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:56.280
window where not a lot of improvements are made on the desktop.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.960
And I mean, you just look at that article we just read, Linux is trapped in this uncanny

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:06.400
valley where we're like good CG, but we're not yet convincing CG.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.560
And every time we release a new movie, we're finally like, yeah, man, that CG was good.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.200
And then you see the next movie and you're like, oh yeah, that CG was way better than

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.320
the last movie.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.400
That's where desktop Linux is at.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:20.000
We're in the uncanny valley where we just can't quite seem to nail it.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.080
And I would argue the last, last thing we need to do is dial it back and put it on the

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.800
back burner for a couple of years while we focus on a completely unproven platform that's

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.600
completely already dominated by massive multinational companies.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:38.360
Well, I'd just like to also point out, they may not work on the desktop for a couple of

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:39.360
years.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.200
How long did XP go in use without it being worked on?

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.840
But that's not fair though, because no, that's not fair because Microsoft continued to release

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:46.880
service packs.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.120
They made fundamental changes in SP3 to Windows XP.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:54.280
I mean, so they've continued to release, they've continued to release Internet Explorer, Windows

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.560
Media, DirectX, all of these things over the lifespan of Windows XP got updates that added

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.880
fundamental new functionality to the operating system.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:05.120
Right, but Ubuntu is doing the same thing for, I mean, Canonical is doing the same thing

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.120
for Ubuntu.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.440
They released hardware enablement stacks for new kernels and new drivers and such, and

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.080
they keep deploying new versions.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.280
You're comparing a finished product to something that's not good enough.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.400
The Ubuntu desktop is not good enough.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.400
It's not good enough.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.120
XP at the time was good enough for the market.

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.120
I think that's subjective.

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.120
Right.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.120
Yeah.

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.120
No, no, no, no, no, it's not.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.120
It's subjective to who?

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:32.040
The millions of people that are not buying Ubuntu-based machines?

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.040
That's who it's subjective to.

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.040
I mean, look at the sales.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.360
The sales bear it out.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:41.000
It's subjective to only us because we're the ones willing to tolerate the pain.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.240
I think as a community, we fail to recognize the severity of the problem, and I think this

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.320
plays into the mass sales of MacBooks and Mac OS X, is we are blind to it.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.840
We recognize it's kind of there, but we don't see it.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.120
It's that, again, I go back to Uncanny Valley, to us, it looks good, but you show it to somebody

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.120
else.

01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.120
You're like, man, that looks like horrible CG.

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:04.440
I've had people who think that Linux looks great, but they think it's too expensive or

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:10.160
too hard to set it up, but if there was a company that just took Chromebooks and System

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.680
76 dialed it and just turned it into a Linux machine and then they sold it as a product,

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.320
that would bring in a ton of people.

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.320
Yeah, I mean-

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:21.560
Well, since the proposed argument here is that we aren't objective because we're using

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.600
it, but everyone that I've- every single person I've installed Ubuntu on, and I always

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:31.320
installed Ubuntu with Unity, none of them have hated it or thought it was bad.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.320
They just never knew it existed.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.000
Yeah, but you could make that same argument if you gave them a MacBook Air.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.040
I definitely would make the same argument, too, it's just they can't afford that.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.760
They probably have a Mac if they could afford it.

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:47.000
Yeah, I think part of the mistake is we almost should really stop comparing it to Windows

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.200
in a sense because I think people who have decided to make the Switch aren't necessarily

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.160
shopping to other Windows machines.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.880
If you're making the Switch away from Windows, by right now, by default, you're almost just

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880
going to the Mac.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.600
There's also a really weird fundamental thing here.

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.960
Tablets are tablets, PCs are PCs, mainframes are fucking mainframes.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.320
They don't go anywhere.

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.560
They're still around from like 40, 50 years-

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.360
Yeah, they're their own technology branch.

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.360
Yeah, true.

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.360
That's a great point.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.640
Little desktops or little friggin' mobile things, that's their own niche.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:19.920
They're not gonna replace desktops.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:25.520
Desktops are here for pretty much the end until we, I don't know, 120 years from now.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:34.040
I guess the core issue, back to Josh's point that I take the most problem with is this,

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:38.680
I go back to this problem that I've talked about a million times, but we've had two huge

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:43.600
windows of opportunity for desktop Linux, specifically for Ubuntu, more so than any

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.960
other distribution.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.800
One was Windows Vista, which they blew it by that's when they switched to Unity, and

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:53.320
the second one is Windows 8, which we've now blown it by just kind of sitting and putting

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.840
the desktop on the back burner.

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:58.940
And maybe for some of you, and this is no judgey, I mean, legitimate, maybe for some

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:04.640
of you, Ubuntu truly has solved all of the little niggles that bother you, and it's fine.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.640
You're very fortunate.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:09.520
For me, when I use Ubuntu, it starts to feel very dated.

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:10.520
It feels very old.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.200
There's things about it that should have been addressed a long time ago.

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.320
There's little things that shouldn't be like that anymore.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:20.920
And it, to me, I sit there and I see a desktop that's been neglected, and I can't see past

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.480
that neglection when I use Unity and when I use Ubuntu.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.120
All I can see is the neglection.

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.160
Now if you don't see that neglection, that's great for you, but it is a reality because

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:34.080
they're obviously focused on other things, and isn't this just, God damn it, the wrong

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:36.320
time to lose your focus on the ball?

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.400
It's coming right into the mitt.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.960
You can make the perfect catch.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.680
Well, and to reiterate what you were saying, I want to expand on that.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:46.280
Take the software center, you know, that thing that has not been updated since I can't even

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.480
remember how long.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:51.840
The comical part of it is, is they, when Canonical actually went and did this whole thing, they

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:57.320
got people from Linspire who did the original software center, which, by the way, in 5.0,

01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:02.560
was way cleaner and way, way, way, way easier to use than it is in Ubuntu.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.440
It was one click to install software.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.280
Granted, bad, bad, bad permissions.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.280
It was admin.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.280
It was evil.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.280
It was terrible.

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:12.280
I get that.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:15.300
But the point is, is the end user didn't care, and yet, and now they managed to actually

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:20.480
take those developers, apparently make them make a crappier product, and then, okay, we're

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.480
done.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.480
Let's make a phone.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.480
I mean, what the hell were they smoking?

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.560
I don't understand that.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.840
I mean, to this day, it infuriates me when I show, when I see the software center.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.840
I just want to, I just want to punch my screen.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:29.840
I hate it.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:33.560
Well, and it's systemic of like a failure to complete, like, like they almost get there

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:34.840
and then they never bust it.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.720
Like so, for example, like they get so.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:37.880
Well, how the hell is it production?

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:40.860
They get so close to something good, and then they say, oh, we're not making any money off

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:42.000
the software center.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.160
Instead of making the software center great, they just kind of bail and say, well, that

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.360
was our path to revenue.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.360
That didn't pan out.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.040
It's a bloated bag of stuff.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:50.040
I'm not going to say on the air.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.040
I mean, it's horrible.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.040
So, you know, I can't understand.

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.040
I mean, let me put it this way.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:57.120
I can run it faster in the most bloated browser possible.

01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:01.760
I can run it like IE6 faster than I can, and it is better on the web.

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:02.760
All right.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:10.240
Well, that's why I hate you, but when people know our perspectives of why I don't trust

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.440
them anymore or dislike them, yeah, so the same way, too, about everything that you said

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.440
about Ubuntu.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:21.180
Like, that's why I run Gnome 3 on Arch, but I just don't think that perspective that they're

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:27.080
not doing enough is inherent in the average consumer that these companies and governments

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:28.080
are catering to.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.080
Right.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:33.040
So for enterprise and governments is not necessarily as important.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.040
Let's be honest.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.040
They're not.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.040
They do a good job there.

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:37.040
They do a good job for enterprise.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.040
Generally speaking.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.040
Yeah.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.040
If you need a calendar, if you need email, it's not as important.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.040
It doesn't matter as much.

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:42.040
It just got to work.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.040
Yeah.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.040
That's why XP worked for them.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.040
Yeah.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:46.040
Oh, God.

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:47.040
Okay.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.040
You know?

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.040
Yeah.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:53.480
So if we all hate Ubuntu, then what do we go to?

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:55.480
What's the next solution that we can hand out to people?

01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:00.460
I would say the outrage comes from the fact that people don't hate it.

01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:02.600
The outrage comes from the fact that people want it fixed.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.600
Yeah.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.600
That's it.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.600
That's my problem is that I like the Ubuntu core.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.600
I do.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:08.600
I like the base.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.160
I like Ubuntu.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.880
Even Unity, with all its faults, is great.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.640
I can get over so much of all the things because they do a lot of nice things that I notice.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.400
When I boot into it, it's like, oh, hey, things that I would normally like to tweak are just

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.400
done.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.040
And look at what happened when Steam was announced.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:27.000
You could see how it was important for Valve to have a company to reach out to canonical

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.440
and say, hey, we want to work with you guys.

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.440
We're going to use this.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.560
And hey, how does this work?

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.920
How does this work in your kernel?

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:34.960
Can you do hardware enablement?

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.440
These kind of things, these back and forths.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:42.280
Having a company behind a widely used desktop product is beneficial because that's how the

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.280
industry works.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.280
Right?

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.760
I don't think you could ever have Arch be the number one distro on desktops because

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:50.820
there's not a company for the rest of the business world to interface with.

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:55.480
There's not a CEO that goes up on stage and announces features and gets everyone's attention.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.580
So you need a canonical.

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:58.580
You do.

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:02.560
And I think going even further than that, I would point out the fact that I realize wholeheartedly

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:05.760
that Ubuntu, there's certain things you're just not going to be able to just magically

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:06.760
fix.

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:07.760
I get that.

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.040
But some of the things that are wrong with it are so stupid obvious.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.560
It makes my brain hurt.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:18.080
If you know an app sucks, first of all, for the love of Pete, fix your stupid bug reporting

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.120
system.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.120
Get a grip.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.120
We're not all developers.

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:25.080
I don't want to sit there and spit out a buttload of text about stuff, half of which I'm not

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.080
going to read.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.600
Look, make it stupid easy.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.720
When I crash something on any other operating system, God, just get a grip, guys.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:33.960
There's just little things they can fix.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.960
That's an example of negligence.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:42.240
That's a perfect, like the app report thing, how is that still a thing after all this time?

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.240
How is that still a thing?

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.240
It's negligence.

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:45.240
Especially when it doesn't tell you.

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.240
Yeah.

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:47.240
There's been an error when it doesn't tell you what it is.

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.240
Go after yourself.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.240
We want them to succeed, but they just freaking aren't doing it, right?

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:52.240
My favorite.

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.240
We're pissed off that they're not doing it.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:54.240
They should.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:58.760
My favorite one was, there's a new version of your proprietary graphics driver.

01:23:58.760 --> 01:23:59.760
Okay.

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:00.960
Well, let's install that.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.040
Oh, now I don't have any picture.

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.120
Now I'm in a shell.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.120
Now what do I do?

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:09.840
Oh, I'd look it up on the internet, except I don't have internet, because I have no picture.

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:14.400
Is that really the fault of Ubuntu and not the fault specifically about the developers

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.400
of said driver?

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.400
Well, they're the ones that pushed it out to me.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.400
That's the problem.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:22.400
Yeah, the end user, all they know is there's a driver, and it's newer than what's there,

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.440
and they might want to play their games better, so why don't I click to install it?

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.440
Oh, now I don't have a picture.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.520
Well, and that was probably a function of the tool, right?

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:31.240
The tool shouldn't have completed the installation if there was a mistake.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.240
Exactly.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.040
Let's do it again if you haven't updated.
