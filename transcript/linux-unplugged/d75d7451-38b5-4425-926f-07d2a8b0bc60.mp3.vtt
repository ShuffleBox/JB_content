WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.760
Well, it's taken nearly 25 years,

00:01.760 --> 00:04.660
but the mainline Linux kernel this year

00:04.660 --> 00:08.940
will finally be able to boot the Nintendo 64 game console.

00:08.940 --> 00:09.840
I know you've been waiting.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.680
It's about time.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.200
I'm switching everything over.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.440
Yeah, I know you've been talking about building clusters

00:14.440 --> 00:16.220
of N64 consoles.

00:16.220 --> 00:19.040
I know how much you want to rock that 93 megahertz processor.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.760
I'm just not sure what you're using it for.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.360
You'll be surprised when you find out.

00:22.360 --> 00:32.720
Hello there, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

00:32.720 --> 00:33.480
My name is Chris.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.280
My name is Wes.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.440
Hello, Wes.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.760
Did you know that this episode's brought to you by a Cloud

00:37.760 --> 00:39.600
Guru, the leader in hands-on learning?

00:39.600 --> 00:42.480
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.960
That's why ECG provides hands-on labs, Cloud Linux servers,

00:44.960 --> 00:46.320
and much more.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.120
Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

00:49.120 --> 00:53.240
This is episode 390, which gave me a huge realization

00:53.240 --> 00:55.160
that we are not that far away from 400

00:55.160 --> 00:56.200
when we got started today.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.040
It's a little scary.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.520
Threw me off my game a little bit.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.240
But we have a lot to get to today.

01:01.240 --> 01:05.240
We're going to celebrate the anniversary of lwn.net,

01:05.240 --> 01:07.600
a fantastic community resource.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.760
The founder will be joining us a little bit in the show

01:09.760 --> 01:13.040
to talk about LWN, talk about the Linux kernel,

01:13.040 --> 01:16.880
talk about development in the Linux kernel, and a lot more.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.800
But before we get there, we have a couple

01:18.800 --> 01:21.040
of special items on the agenda.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.280
So to help us address those, I want to first introduce

01:24.280 --> 01:26.480
and welcome back to the show someone brand new,

01:26.480 --> 01:28.520
new kid on the street, never heard of him before.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.160
His name's Drew.

01:29.160 --> 01:29.920
Hello, Drew.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.240
New kid on the street.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.560
I've been here for years, sir.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.280
Welcome back.

01:34.280 --> 01:34.880
Welcome back.

01:34.880 --> 01:35.800
It's good to have you.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.200
Doesn't show at all on your face.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.720
And I know that you're in the middle of moving, too.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.400
So I appreciate you taking a few minutes,

01:41.400 --> 01:44.800
because moving life is worst life.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.600
Yeah, it just doesn't get worse.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.600
Maybe we can be a little bit of an escape for a bit from that.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.800
Yeah, it's only 1,600 miles away.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.960
So you know, I mean.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.880
Although I do dream at the end of it of Wes and I

01:57.880 --> 01:59.640
coming out there and us doing a Linux

01:59.640 --> 02:00.840
unplugged together in person.

02:00.840 --> 02:01.360
Yes.

02:01.360 --> 02:01.800
Oh, we got it.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.840
That could be at the other end.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.520
Let's do it.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.240
Yeah.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.120
Also, to help us dig through the community news, of course,

02:07.120 --> 02:08.720
we have our virtual lug.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.520
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:10.520 --> 02:11.240
Hello, hello.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.600
Hello, everyone.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.120
Hello.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.720
Bienvenido.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.160
Happy Sunday.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.720
Yeah, this is a Sunday edition of the show,

02:18.720 --> 02:20.280
just kind of unannounced.

02:20.280 --> 02:23.600
We decided to record a little bit early this week.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.920
And because it's a Sunday and Wes and I will be here all day

02:26.920 --> 02:30.520
long, there may have been some gin snuck into our drinks.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.520
And we don't normally drink during a show.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.400
No, we don't.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.400
But we also snuck some nachos in, so it's a special occasion.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.320
It's like we've made a whole day out of it.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.720
So we're sitting here on a Sunday.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.080
We're hanging out with the virtual lug who

02:43.080 --> 02:44.680
has their normal up lug session.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.720
And we just kind of came in there at the end.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.800
We'll talk more about that in housekeeping.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.280
But first, I just want to get a couple of PSAs done,

02:51.280 --> 02:53.040
because these are kind of important.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.480
Number one, because I've talked about it a lot on this show,

02:55.480 --> 02:58.320
of course, we address this in detail on Self-Hosted,

02:58.320 --> 03:02.020
is Home Assistant has a second security vulnerability

03:02.020 --> 03:04.520
that they've identified that needs patched and needs

03:04.520 --> 03:06.740
to be patched pretty quickly.

03:06.740 --> 03:09.040
And they're really trying to get the word out about this.

03:09.040 --> 03:13.140
It's an issue that impacts third party custom integrations.

03:13.140 --> 03:15.280
And it's a significant vulnerability.

03:15.280 --> 03:19.120
And if you've already patched, this is a second wave.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.680
I do some analysis in Self-Hosted,

03:20.680 --> 03:23.560
but I thought probably should let people know.

03:23.560 --> 03:25.320
Yeah, allowed an attacker to steal any file

03:25.320 --> 03:29.200
without logging in doesn't sound great.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.360
Probably want to patch.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.320
And the thing is, is they had some mitigations,

03:32.320 --> 03:34.560
but the mitigation didn't go quite far enough.

03:34.560 --> 03:37.040
And so this is supposed to address that.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.760
I don't have a lot more to add.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.560
But this is, I think, to be expected.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.480
Home Assistant is a very large platform.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.800
With a lot of integrations.

03:44.800 --> 03:45.480
Yeah.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.820
And that's what makes it so great at the same time.

03:47.820 --> 03:49.900
Well, and it's worth mentioning that one

03:49.900 --> 03:53.080
of the things affected by this is the Home Assistant

03:53.080 --> 03:54.760
Community Store hacks.

03:54.760 --> 03:58.400
So make sure you get that updated too.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.640
Which I love.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.760
And then there's another one.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.720
We covered the initial development of this story

04:04.720 --> 04:06.360
on Linux Action News.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.000
And that was the Google announced

04:08.000 --> 04:10.760
they were disabling Chromium Sync for Chromium

04:10.760 --> 04:12.520
and Chromium-based browsers.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.280
The typical Google Sync back end is going away.

04:16.280 --> 04:17.920
And now what we are witnessing, since we

04:17.920 --> 04:20.240
covered that on Linux Action News,

04:20.240 --> 04:24.160
is the distributions and how they're all reacting

04:24.160 --> 04:25.360
and what they're processing.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.600
Do you leave it in even though you

04:26.600 --> 04:28.900
know it's just going to end up being broken pretty soon?

04:28.900 --> 04:31.080
Or do you take it out even though for the moment

04:31.080 --> 04:32.200
it's still working?

04:32.200 --> 04:33.280
That's a tough call.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.520
Yeah, because end users are going

04:34.520 --> 04:36.480
to think maybe something broke in the distro.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.560
They're not going to know why.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.960
It's not like they're following Google's Chromium development

04:39.960 --> 04:40.520
blog.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.840
Yeah, and the error message, I'm sure, will not explain.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.960
Yeah, and this seems a little sticky.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.520
I've been following the developments on this.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.520
And one that's been really fascinating

04:50.520 --> 04:53.160
is watching the Chromium maintainer for Fedora

04:53.160 --> 04:55.160
kind of chew on this, going back and forth.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.160
Should we even bother with the effort

04:57.160 --> 05:00.280
now of packaging this bastard of a browser

05:00.280 --> 05:01.900
when they're doing this to us?

05:01.900 --> 05:03.940
So if you're not familiar with the whole story,

05:03.940 --> 05:05.280
like I mentioned, Google has announced

05:05.280 --> 05:07.060
they're cutting off that sync access.

05:07.060 --> 05:09.860
And that's what we're trying to react to now as a community.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.440
Now, the thing that's kind of odd here

05:11.440 --> 05:15.240
is that Google gave the builders of the Chromium distribution

05:15.240 --> 05:19.520
packages access rights to this API back in 2013,

05:19.520 --> 05:22.200
specifically so that they could have

05:22.200 --> 05:24.560
open source builds of Chromium with near feature

05:24.560 --> 05:25.700
parity of Chrome.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.080
And now they're just taking it away for reasons.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.080
Tom Callaway did give a lot of thought

05:30.080 --> 05:32.040
about whether it was even worth the effort

05:32.040 --> 05:35.240
to continue maintaining the Chromium package in Fedora.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.160
And that kind of says it right there, right?

05:37.160 --> 05:39.720
I mean, it just doesn't feel second class

05:39.720 --> 05:41.880
or even first class, second class.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.840
Maybe it's a third class citizen at this point.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.240
But it's almost not a proper browser,

05:46.240 --> 05:48.200
despite all of the great browsing functionality

05:48.200 --> 05:52.040
that's built into Chromium and how useful it has been to folks.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.080
I feel like we could have a website that just did nothing

05:55.080 --> 05:58.160
but track when the deal gets changed on us,

05:58.160 --> 06:02.040
like an initial deal, how the deal is then further altered

06:02.040 --> 06:03.560
and you will not complain.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.880
That's all we need is how the deal was changed on us.

06:05.880 --> 06:09.980
And to his credit, he's going to continue to package it

06:09.980 --> 06:11.480
because some users won't even mind

06:11.480 --> 06:13.240
that sync has been disabled.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.280
And then in the short term, he'll just have to take the knock.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.760
The people will assume it's because of something he did.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.180
It's interesting, too, to watch Arch and Debian

06:21.180 --> 06:22.680
have the same conversation and try

06:22.680 --> 06:24.180
to decide what they're going to do.

06:24.180 --> 06:27.280
Each distribution is really looking at it.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.160
Some have already solved for this.

06:29.160 --> 06:32.360
There's also kind of the universal package option here.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.280
That's kind of the elephant in the room.

06:34.280 --> 06:38.000
Perhaps, in the case of Fedora, perhaps Thomas

06:38.000 --> 06:39.880
doesn't have to continue to package it

06:39.880 --> 06:41.480
if eventually we got to the point

06:41.480 --> 06:44.080
where Flat Hub was just turned on by default.

06:44.080 --> 06:46.000
And when you searched in software,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.080
software that's packaged like Chromium on Flat Hub

06:48.080 --> 06:48.840
would just come up.

06:48.840 --> 06:49.960
Yeah, that'd be interesting.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.000
Colonel in our IRC asks, maybe this

06:52.000 --> 06:55.200
is an opportunity for a syncing service back end

06:55.200 --> 06:56.640
third party integration.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.720
Because if you think about it, you've just

06:57.720 --> 06:59.120
been relying on Google for that.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.880
Maybe you wouldn't choose that.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.880
It'd be neat if you could maybe use Microsoft or some even more

07:03.880 --> 07:05.000
trusted third party.

07:05.000 --> 07:05.400
I agree.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.240
And Josh, what do you think?

07:06.240 --> 07:08.560
Is this essentially Google killing another product?

07:08.560 --> 07:12.000
Or is this because it's just shutting off like an API key,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.240
is this not quite that equivalent?

07:14.240 --> 07:17.120
It seems to be the way that all the other services go.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.720
There's a little bit here, and then this little bit there,

07:19.720 --> 07:21.920
and then you get the shutdown notice.

07:21.920 --> 07:22.720
Yeah.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.200
Yeah, it's a little bit of deal alteration.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.040
It should be tracked.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.960
I feel like this should be logged and tracked.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.960
And then how the distributions have to deal with it.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.680
That's an interesting aspect of open source.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.520
Well, I'm just waiting for somebody to reboot XMarks.

07:34.520 --> 07:39.760
Oh, yeah, XMarks, the original bookmark sync.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.080
Oh, wow, that makes me nostalgic.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.760
You were an XMarks user with Firefox

07:43.760 --> 07:44.840
back in the day, I take it?

07:44.840 --> 07:47.560
Oh, yeah, way back in the day, but absolutely.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.640
Yeah.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.800
OK, so let's talk about another deal that's getting changed.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.520
And this time it's Elastic that's

07:53.520 --> 07:57.480
making the changes to the licensing around Elastic search

07:57.480 --> 07:58.840
and its dashboard product.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.960
And they're changing it from essentially,

08:00.960 --> 08:05.000
I think it was Apache version 2, to the server public license

08:05.000 --> 08:08.320
and the Elastic server license, or just Elastic license.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.360
And Amazon has reacted pretty significantly

08:11.360 --> 08:12.960
with a really strongly worded blog

08:12.960 --> 08:15.680
post, which we dissect in this week's Linux action news,

08:15.680 --> 08:19.680
announcing that they are forking Elastic search.

08:19.680 --> 08:22.880
And they have this whole rationale, of course.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.560
And I kind of wanted to try to process this in a way that

08:25.560 --> 08:28.000
was useful for the audience, even if they're not

08:28.000 --> 08:31.680
a corporate enterprise user that needs Elastic search.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.560
And I thought maybe we'd get a little bit of Drew's opinion

08:34.560 --> 08:36.680
on this, because he's using it every day.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.440
He's been deep diving at actually recently

08:38.440 --> 08:40.000
at the day job.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.160
And maybe we could start with an explanation

08:42.160 --> 08:44.600
of what Elastic search is.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.160
Yeah, absolutely, because it's not

08:47.160 --> 08:50.400
something that just totally makes sense

08:50.400 --> 08:52.240
until you really get into it.

08:52.240 --> 08:57.040
It is essentially, it's a database search tool

08:57.040 --> 09:00.320
that's built upon Apache Lucene.

09:00.320 --> 09:04.760
So it's similar in a lot of ways to Apache Solar, S-O-L-R.

09:04.760 --> 09:10.440
But it is a product that allows you to ingest data,

09:10.440 --> 09:12.400
sort it, and search it.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.880
And where the Elastic part comes in

09:14.880 --> 09:19.480
is that it scales both horizontally and vertically.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.120
So you can either add more servers to it,

09:22.120 --> 09:25.880
or you can add a bunch more storage on a particular node.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.720
Whatever your use case is, whether you're

09:28.720 --> 09:30.480
read-heavy or write-heavy, you have

09:30.480 --> 09:34.680
options for how you want to build out the infrastructure.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.000
And you can have clusters.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.320
You can have distributed clusters.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.400
You can have clusters that talk to other clusters.

09:41.400 --> 09:47.640
Basically, it is extremely flexible ability to search.

09:47.640 --> 09:51.880
And so what we're using it for is monitoring and log

09:51.880 --> 09:53.080
aggregation.

09:53.080 --> 09:56.000
More on the log aggregation than the monitoring right now,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.040
because we have other monitoring solutions.

09:58.040 --> 10:01.960
But what we can do is we can deploy these really lightweight

10:01.960 --> 10:05.480
agents that just pull in all of the logs.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.760
Sometimes I have to write custom parsers for them

10:07.760 --> 10:10.760
if they're not in the standard format.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.800
And then we get it all into Elastic.

10:13.800 --> 10:17.240
And then I can use their dashboard software, Cabana,

10:17.240 --> 10:21.880
which is actually what Grafana was originally forked from.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.880
In order to visualize this data, create dashboards from it,

10:25.880 --> 10:31.120
and really get it in a way that we can have,

10:31.120 --> 10:33.840
like, say, a particular service that we can then

10:33.840 --> 10:37.480
monitor the logs for in almost real time.

10:37.480 --> 10:40.200
And so the deal that's been changed recently really

10:40.200 --> 10:42.960
doesn't affect a deployment like yours, right, Drew?

10:42.960 --> 10:45.480
Your use case isn't really impacted by the changes

10:45.480 --> 10:46.840
Elastic has made here.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.240
It's more directed at big shops like AWS.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.280
Yeah, exactly.

10:51.280 --> 10:55.200
It's directed at people who are taking the product

10:55.200 --> 10:58.080
and then building out additional services on top of it,

10:58.080 --> 11:00.600
repackaging it, and selling it as their own product,

11:00.600 --> 11:04.360
like AWS Elasticsearch has been doing for years.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.000
It's the same kind of thing that we've

11:06.000 --> 11:09.360
seen companies like Redis really struggle with,

11:09.360 --> 11:14.480
and then they try to relicense to avoid having somebody just

11:14.480 --> 11:18.120
take their work and port it into something new

11:18.120 --> 11:22.000
and start charging for it without giving anything back.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.240
Now, AWS is saying, well, hold on.

11:25.240 --> 11:27.920
We've been pushing code changes up and really contributing

11:27.920 --> 11:31.320
to the project, and now we're being punished for it.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.800
So why not just fork it and release our own product built

11:34.800 --> 11:37.800
off of the latest version of Elastic,

11:37.800 --> 11:42.600
which was still open source, and just have an open source fork?

11:42.600 --> 11:44.240
Yeah, how do you feel about that, though?

11:44.240 --> 11:47.200
Because it seems like it's going to perhaps,

11:47.200 --> 11:49.480
because you're going to be using the original,

11:49.480 --> 11:50.960
and then there'll be this other thing out there

11:50.960 --> 11:52.720
in the industry that may over time change

11:52.720 --> 11:53.920
from what you're using.

11:53.920 --> 11:54.760
Yeah, I don't know.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.600
I mean, time will tell.

11:56.600 --> 12:01.920
It's a bit of a gamble either way, I think.

12:01.920 --> 12:06.160
Will Elastic continue to really dominate the market?

12:06.160 --> 12:10.360
All signs point to yes, because they're really deeply embedded

12:10.360 --> 12:15.640
in enterprise, and so is Amazon's version.

12:15.640 --> 12:19.760
So who knows which one's really going to come out on top.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.280
Right.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.320
I know a lot of places that essentially use it

12:22.320 --> 12:25.420
for their user-facing website, too, to surface search results

12:25.420 --> 12:27.720
and sort their content libraries and whatnot.

12:27.720 --> 12:28.400
Absolutely.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.720
You can't overstate how significantly popular

12:30.720 --> 12:31.720
it's become.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.020
Wes and I were looking at data for our Linux Action News

12:34.020 --> 12:38.520
reporting, and you can just see explosive growth around 2018,

12:38.520 --> 12:40.960
where it just kind of gets next level crazy.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.240
Everyone's got an Elastic Stack cluster somewhere

12:43.240 --> 12:44.040
on their premises.

12:44.040 --> 12:44.800
I mean, that's too.

12:44.800 --> 12:47.860
It's a $15 billion business for Elastic,

12:47.860 --> 12:50.000
and that's not even counting all of the people who

12:50.000 --> 12:52.560
are using it from other services that are hosting it.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.680
I wonder, too, if that's part of all of this.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.120
Obviously, the fact that Amazon is giant and sort of the default

12:58.120 --> 13:00.660
makes things more complicated, because it's not sort of just

13:00.660 --> 13:02.800
Elastic competing against a similar company.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.600
They're competing against this behemoth.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.720
And I don't know.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.800
That's just a tough environment to exist in,

13:09.800 --> 13:12.480
but maybe it doesn't make sense for a company who's

13:12.480 --> 13:14.500
trying to operate on an open source basis

13:14.500 --> 13:15.800
to necessarily be that large.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.560
Like, is the value they're providing,

13:17.560 --> 13:18.960
does that valuation make sense?

13:18.960 --> 13:21.640
Or does it make sense to be a smaller, more steady state

13:21.640 --> 13:22.520
sort of operation?

13:22.520 --> 13:25.040
But in these days, everyone's trying to be the big unicorn

13:25.040 --> 13:27.200
and make a whole bunch of money for your investors, right?

13:27.200 --> 13:27.480
Right.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.360
Everybody's got to make that VC money back.

13:29.360 --> 13:32.960
And yeah, that's part of what's the pressure here,

13:32.960 --> 13:35.160
is there's a lot of investors that put a lot of money

13:35.160 --> 13:36.960
into these kinds of things, and they expect results.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.440
But Neil, I think fundamentally, one of the issues

13:39.440 --> 13:42.120
that Wes and I were struggling with is this license

13:42.120 --> 13:43.400
looks a little concerning.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.720
Yeah, so one of the bigger problems with this thing

13:46.720 --> 13:49.600
is that the server-side public license, which if y'all

13:49.600 --> 13:51.120
remember from a couple of years back,

13:51.120 --> 13:53.000
this was actually created by the MongoDB folks

13:53.000 --> 13:57.920
when they relicensed from the new Afero GPL version 3

13:57.920 --> 14:02.180
as part of trying to drive more growth into their enterprise

14:02.180 --> 14:03.500
commercial product.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.720
The problem with the SSPL is, well,

14:06.720 --> 14:08.480
aside from it not being classified

14:08.480 --> 14:11.380
as an open source license, the open source initiative

14:11.380 --> 14:13.040
has not deemed it as such.

14:13.040 --> 14:15.240
Fedora particularly has a decent analysis

14:15.240 --> 14:19.540
of why they consider it not an open source license,

14:19.540 --> 14:23.160
particularly around it's hard to discern what the bounds are,

14:23.160 --> 14:26.880
and it seems to be punishing towards certain field of use

14:26.880 --> 14:28.320
and endeavors.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.240
The issue is that for a lot of organizations,

14:31.240 --> 14:33.800
they rely on fundamental assumptions

14:33.800 --> 14:37.960
about how software consumption works for compliance

14:37.960 --> 14:42.360
and making sure that to de-risk their usage of solutions

14:42.360 --> 14:43.600
and infrastructure.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.960
For example, anyone who's running GitLab Enterprise

14:46.960 --> 14:49.320
is probably running an Elasticsearch system connected

14:49.320 --> 14:50.160
to it.

14:50.160 --> 14:54.080
And there's open questions about that combination

14:54.080 --> 14:56.840
if you use Elasticsearch's version of Elasticsearch

14:56.840 --> 14:58.440
with this license change.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.200
And those are the sorts of things

15:00.200 --> 15:02.700
where it becomes extremely difficult to say,

15:02.700 --> 15:04.040
we can do this.

15:04.040 --> 15:07.600
It becomes a very uncomfortable question

15:07.600 --> 15:10.760
because Elastic is able to do this because they've become

15:10.760 --> 15:13.600
so dominant in this particular space.

15:13.600 --> 15:18.960
They essentially forked away from the Apache multi-vendor

15:18.960 --> 15:24.280
approach for a single-vendor, very opinionated variant

15:24.280 --> 15:26.040
of Lucene.

15:26.040 --> 15:31.040
And in some ways, because of some sort of like,

15:31.040 --> 15:32.120
what's it called?

15:32.120 --> 15:33.200
Precedent setting.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.560
Yeah, yeah, trend setting and that sort of thing.

15:35.560 --> 15:39.000
And this is the negative impact of that.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.560
It's very easy for something to turn dominant,

15:41.560 --> 15:43.040
and then everyone is screwed.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.400
And people have gotten very comfortable with doing this

15:45.400 --> 15:47.920
because with open-source software,

15:47.920 --> 15:51.240
when you change the deal, you have another option out.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.960
With the MongoDB thing, nobody felt

15:52.960 --> 15:54.800
that it was worth exercising that option,

15:54.800 --> 15:57.240
so it just kind of rotted and died out.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.720
But with Elasticsearch, because it's so hugely dominant,

16:00.720 --> 16:02.480
AWS basically had no choice.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.000
They had to fork the whole project

16:04.000 --> 16:07.080
because they have a product that they

16:07.080 --> 16:09.600
have to serve to their customers, lots of people

16:09.600 --> 16:11.480
relied on it, and it's going to be

16:11.480 --> 16:15.320
painful for everything that was relying on Elasticsearch's

16:15.320 --> 16:17.320
proprietary API, because that's what it is.

16:17.320 --> 16:21.200
It's a proprietary solution now, to move to an open platform

16:21.200 --> 16:22.960
such as Apache Solar.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.920
Really honest to God, I really hope what this does

16:26.920 --> 16:29.480
is it causes the industry to re-examine their assumptions

16:29.480 --> 16:33.120
and start moving towards true open-source solutions

16:33.120 --> 16:34.880
like Apache Solar.

16:34.880 --> 16:37.320
But I am not confident that that will happen.

16:37.320 --> 16:40.800
And in the meantime, Amazon Web Services has stepped up,

16:40.800 --> 16:43.640
and they're planning on setting up a proper open-source project

16:43.640 --> 16:45.720
with real governance and that sort of thing.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.520
And they have customers that are going

16:47.520 --> 16:48.840
to continue to require this.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.600
And this is kind of the meta story, isn't it, Drew?

16:51.600 --> 16:54.680
Is that you have these enterprise-type open-source

16:54.680 --> 16:57.720
projects, and then they get to this massive size,

16:57.720 --> 17:00.400
and they run into this iceberg, essentially.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.520
Yeah, absolutely.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.080
I mean, what we're kind of seeing between them, Redis,

17:05.080 --> 17:10.000
MongoDB, and anybody else who's kind of hit this critical mass

17:10.000 --> 17:12.600
and realized that another company is just

17:12.600 --> 17:15.800
eating their lunch, is that we're

17:15.800 --> 17:19.880
going to see how this all shakes out over the next few years.

17:19.880 --> 17:24.880
And if this becomes a tenable business model for companies

17:24.880 --> 17:28.160
that started as very open-source and moved

17:28.160 --> 17:32.800
to kind of half open, half proprietary, something

17:32.800 --> 17:37.680
nebulous in the middle, will that allow them to survive?

17:37.680 --> 17:40.520
Or will other open-source solutions

17:40.520 --> 17:42.280
come in and take their place?

17:42.280 --> 17:45.840
Or will they move even further towards being

17:45.840 --> 17:47.160
completely proprietary?

17:47.160 --> 17:48.080
I don't know.

17:48.080 --> 17:53.000
And I don't know that there's one good answer here.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.040
But I think in a lot of ways, this

17:55.040 --> 17:58.520
is going to be a trial balloon for the shape of things

17:58.520 --> 17:59.000
to come.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.160
towards your new account.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.000
Linoad is the largest independent cloud

18:11.000 --> 18:12.160
for developers.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.480
Simplify your infrastructure.

18:13.480 --> 18:14.400
Go check out Linoad.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.800
And with that $100 credit, you can make some distance.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.280
It's pretty significant.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.520
They have native SSD storage, 40-gigabit connections,

18:22.520 --> 18:25.760
and a new revamped, easy-to-use cloud manager.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.640
Linoad has really done a good job here

18:27.640 --> 18:31.280
of making it easy to use but not too many clicks away

18:31.280 --> 18:33.840
to get to the real power user features.

18:33.840 --> 18:37.240
And Linoad costs 30% to 50% less than major cloud providers

18:37.240 --> 18:38.760
like AWS.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.480
You receive a balance of technology and performance

18:41.480 --> 18:43.280
in a package that's really straightforward.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.800
They have 11 data centers worldwide

18:44.800 --> 18:46.480
so you can get close to your clients

18:46.480 --> 18:47.920
or your customer or yourself.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.520
And they have built-in monitoring tools

18:49.520 --> 18:51.520
that give you an idea of what your rig's doing.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.880
I knew probably time to up the RAM in our matrix server.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.960
It's just by watching my Linoad charts.

18:56.960 --> 19:00.200
And it made it really, really simple to do that.

19:00.200 --> 19:04.400
And tons of flexibility in the post-server-already-setup

19:04.400 --> 19:05.880
upgrade options.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.520
I was really impressed with that.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.880
I also was able to make an image from one of my disks

19:10.880 --> 19:12.400
and then move that between my systems

19:12.400 --> 19:15.640
to make setting up some things really simple.

19:15.640 --> 19:16.960
Also, see if they're hiring.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.560
They often have job openings.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.280
You go to linoad.com slash careers

19:20.280 --> 19:22.160
because if you're listening to this show,

19:22.160 --> 19:23.560
you might be a good fit for Linoad.

19:23.560 --> 19:24.560
They love Linux.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.480
And knowing that you listen to a Linux podcast,

19:26.480 --> 19:28.720
probably going to make you an appealing candidate.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.360
Linoad is our cloud hosting provider.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.040
It hosts all of our new infrastructure

19:32.040 --> 19:34.040
that we've built for JB 3.0.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.960
Recently set up some PeerTube instances.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.680
And it's like having our own Jupiter broadcasting YouTube

19:38.680 --> 19:39.720
in a box.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.200
I love it.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.120
You should try it out.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.760
linoad.com slash unplug.

19:42.760 --> 19:47.040
You support the show and you get a $100 60-day credit.

19:47.040 --> 19:47.760
I'm serious.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.520
Isn't that great?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.680
linoad.com slash unplugged.

19:50.680 --> 19:54.800
Moving right along.

19:54.800 --> 19:59.320
In fact, we just stormed in in the middle of a Luplug.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.040
So why don't we do a little housekeeping?

20:01.040 --> 20:06.120
And Minimac, what do you think?

20:06.120 --> 20:09.160
Successful Luplug this Sunday?

20:09.160 --> 20:12.000
Very, very, very successful Luplug.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.120
I want to thank Justin that had the idea for our accessibility

20:16.120 --> 20:20.320
talk, and also Daniel Ferre who came there here.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.400
And we had a good talk over an hour.

20:23.400 --> 20:28.440
And we also had Sean, another user that contributed a long

20:28.440 --> 20:30.520
time and shared his experiences.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.200
It was a really good talk, and I hope

20:32.200 --> 20:34.960
you can listen to it at the end of the month.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.240
Yeah, in the near future, the audio should be available.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.400
We'll try to do an update here in housekeeping.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.040
Also, check out the Jupiter broadcasting all shows feed.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.480
Yeah, we got one feed to rule them all.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.400
Things are in the works.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.040
You never know.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.160
You don't want to miss something new.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.720
So go get our all shows feed right there

20:50.720 --> 20:52.880
at Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.280
Westpane, do you have anything to throw in the housekeeping

20:55.280 --> 20:55.920
before we go?

20:55.920 --> 20:57.920
It's your last chance for some big moment.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.040
Oh, sounds like there's an upcoming Jellyfin release

21:00.040 --> 21:00.920
we should be aware of.

21:00.920 --> 21:01.240
Look at you.

21:01.240 --> 21:01.720
Look at you.

21:01.720 --> 21:02.720
You got something.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.280
Yeah, that's right.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.120
I guess there's a release candidate out there,

21:05.120 --> 21:05.960
eh, Colonel?

21:05.960 --> 21:10.040
Yeah, so the Jellyfin release candidate three is out.

21:10.040 --> 21:13.680
And they've made it much easier for people on RPM distros

21:13.680 --> 21:15.120
to get that installed.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.920
They've clarified and restructured their repositories

21:18.920 --> 21:20.480
to allow for that.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.400
In addition, they've switched from the standard.NET

21:23.400 --> 21:27.040
over to.NET Core, which standardizes the.NET

21:27.040 --> 21:29.280
implementation across all the platforms.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.800
That is fantastic.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.480
Some big news.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.280
So if you're interested, maybe go give that a try,

21:33.280 --> 21:35.240
see if you find any bugs, and get them reported.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.720
Earlier, I had a chance to sit down

21:39.720 --> 21:43.240
with the executive editor of lwn.net, which

21:43.240 --> 21:45.280
has been a fantastic resource for as long

21:45.280 --> 21:46.600
as I've been using Linux.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.600
And they're hitting a major milestone.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.360
So Jonathan Corbett came on the show,

21:50.360 --> 21:52.960
and we talked about that and a lot more.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.560
I want to welcome Jonathan to the show.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.160
I think lwn.net is known by our audience

21:57.160 --> 22:01.240
as one of the most trusted news outlets in open source.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.800
So it's a treat to talk to you.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.320
Well, thank you.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.520
It's a pleasure to be here.

22:04.520 --> 22:07.840
And kind of the pretense or excuse to get you on the show

22:07.840 --> 22:11.160
was that there's an anniversary coming up for LWN.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.880
So how many years will that make it?

22:12.880 --> 22:16.520
That will make it 23 years.

22:16.520 --> 22:20.080
We first published in January of 1998.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.720
Congratulations.

22:21.720 --> 22:22.520
Wow.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.920
And so Jupiter Broadcasting is about 12 years old.

22:25.920 --> 22:29.440
And I was kind of going over the history of LWN

22:29.440 --> 22:31.480
before the show started.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.880
And I noticed, and I don't really know the back story

22:33.880 --> 22:36.720
much, but I think we have a similar kind of back story

22:36.720 --> 22:39.960
where you were independent for many years, I think,

22:39.960 --> 22:41.920
then acquired, and then deacquired,

22:41.920 --> 22:43.280
and now independent again.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.640
Can you tell me the history of that?

22:44.640 --> 22:45.120
Yeah.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.520
We were independent just for a few years.

22:47.520 --> 22:50.600
We were actually acquired right at the very end of the.com

22:50.600 --> 22:54.400
boom, which was an interesting story in its own right,

22:54.400 --> 22:56.480
actually.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.760
It was easy to be acquired in those days

22:58.760 --> 23:03.240
if you had Linux in your name or your activity anywhere.

23:03.240 --> 23:07.640
But then, of course, the.com crash happened, and that ended.

23:07.640 --> 23:13.040
And the folks who acquired us, a company called Two Cows,

23:13.040 --> 23:15.120
found that they didn't have a way to make money from us

23:15.120 --> 23:17.840
anymore, if they ever did.

23:17.840 --> 23:21.240
And so they basically just gave it back to us

23:21.240 --> 23:24.760
and let us continue on where we were before.

23:24.760 --> 23:28.160
If I'm right, but please correct me if I'm wrong,

23:28.160 --> 23:30.000
when you came back initially, you came back

23:30.000 --> 23:33.480
as advertiser-based, but then eventually transitioned

23:33.480 --> 23:36.600
to member-only after your readers said, do it, we'll pay.

23:36.600 --> 23:41.000
Yeah, I mean, advertising had been the intended model

23:41.000 --> 23:44.160
sort of since the beginning, ever since we decided we could

23:44.160 --> 23:48.520
maybe try to make a living with this newsletter we created.

23:48.520 --> 23:54.240
And that, of course, also fell to pieces after the.com crash.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.960
And it didn't take us all that long

23:55.960 --> 23:58.840
after we were newly independent to realize that we just weren't

23:58.840 --> 24:01.760
going to make that work at all.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.760
And we tried donations for a little bit,

24:04.760 --> 24:06.920
and that brought in a few thousand dollars,

24:06.920 --> 24:09.640
which isn't really enough to keep

24:09.640 --> 24:12.720
a staff of several people going, trying to write this thing.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.280
So we actually announced that we were shutting down,

24:15.280 --> 24:18.000
at which point some of our readers said, well, you

24:18.000 --> 24:20.560
idiots, why don't you try running a subscription model

24:20.560 --> 24:25.120
before you do that, and we'll subscribe and keep you going.

24:25.120 --> 24:28.800
So we made a try at that, and it has been

24:28.800 --> 24:30.600
what has sustained us ever since.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.400
That's remarkable, because I think

24:32.400 --> 24:34.920
there's something kind of special about the type

24:34.920 --> 24:36.640
of journalism you do.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.040
Well, I want to ask you about this,

24:38.040 --> 24:41.680
because the way LWN bills itself as news

24:41.680 --> 24:44.280
from the source, which is just a brilliant tagline,

24:44.280 --> 24:47.000
because you are getting it directly from the source,

24:47.000 --> 24:49.880
but also you can read source code and get the news.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.840
It feels like what LWN pioneered is,

24:52.840 --> 24:55.160
I don't know if it's journalism or if it's

24:55.160 --> 24:56.480
a contribution of some form.

24:56.480 --> 24:57.480
What are your thoughts?

24:57.480 --> 25:00.520
You know, we never really thought of it as journalism.

25:00.520 --> 25:01.760
I never thought of it as that.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.520
I thought of it as, initially, we

25:04.520 --> 25:06.240
were spending a lot of time trying

25:06.240 --> 25:09.000
to keep up with the kernel mailing list and all that,

25:09.000 --> 25:12.520
because it was a whole hundred messages a day or something

25:12.520 --> 25:15.680
in those days, and nobody could keep up with that.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.880
And we were staying on top of it.

25:17.880 --> 25:20.000
We were trying to launch a consulting company

25:20.000 --> 25:21.960
and show the world how smart we were.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.800
So we figured we could just sort of share

25:24.800 --> 25:28.840
what we were learning as we kept up with the world

25:28.840 --> 25:31.760
and attract attention and help the community in that way.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.760
And it's always sort of been a community effort to us.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.920
It's something that we've done from within the community

25:36.920 --> 25:40.200
as a part of it, as opposed to coming in from the outside

25:40.200 --> 25:41.040
and watching it.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.040
Right.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.360
It feels to me like it may be, in a way,

25:45.360 --> 25:47.400
I think I consume it as a form of journalism,

25:47.400 --> 25:49.720
but it feels like, to me, in a way, it's also,

25:49.720 --> 25:53.200
it's helping inform a community that has to make decisions.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.680
So it is a contribution in that sense.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.160
And the other thing that I think that really makes it special

25:58.160 --> 26:02.080
is you yourself contribute to the kernel.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.800
I believe you're the maintainer of documentation, right?

26:04.800 --> 26:05.800
The document maintainer.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.800
And also, I heard a rumor, maybe some drivers, too.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.880
I've done various driver work.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.680
I wrote the camera drivers for the One Laptop

26:13.680 --> 26:16.480
per Child systems, among other things,

26:16.480 --> 26:19.000
and various other bits and pieces over the years.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.720
That's kind of special in a way, too,

26:20.720 --> 26:23.040
to have somebody who can contribute in that way

26:23.040 --> 26:26.440
and participate at events, but then also communicate it

26:26.440 --> 26:28.200
to people who can consume the information

26:28.200 --> 26:30.080
and then participate in the community.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.520
And I know that also means that you've

26:32.520 --> 26:34.640
done things in the past, like the kernel report,

26:34.640 --> 26:38.120
and you've brought up concerns about maintainers not really

26:38.120 --> 26:40.960
scaling with the number of just developers

26:40.960 --> 26:42.480
that are contributing to Linux down,

26:42.480 --> 26:44.280
the amount of contributions.

26:44.280 --> 26:46.320
And you, being a maintainer yourself,

26:46.320 --> 26:49.120
I was wondering if you see that, I mean, since last time I

26:49.120 --> 26:51.160
saw you speak to that was probably 2018,

26:51.160 --> 26:53.760
I'm wondering if that situation has improved at all.

26:53.760 --> 26:56.040
I think that's hard to say.

26:56.040 --> 26:59.320
It varies depending on where you look within the kernel.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.640
There's an increasing effort among maintainers

27:01.640 --> 27:04.040
to delegate maintenance to a group

27:04.040 --> 27:06.560
and to bring in backups and that sort of thing

27:06.560 --> 27:09.760
and to try to spread that load out a little bit.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.800
There is also some work going on to try

27:12.800 --> 27:17.320
to separate the maintainer and the reviewer roles, where

27:17.320 --> 27:20.320
maintainers really just become the people who herd the patches

27:20.320 --> 27:23.400
and get them upstream, but aren't necessarily

27:23.400 --> 27:25.680
the decision makers or the people who have to actually

27:25.680 --> 27:27.480
review all those patches.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.480
And by splitting those responsibilities,

27:29.480 --> 27:32.560
it's hoped that we can bring more people in and spread

27:32.560 --> 27:33.360
the work out a bit.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.000
And I think that has worked fairly well

27:35.000 --> 27:39.240
in some subsystems, less well in some others.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.680
But things are being done in this regard,

27:41.680 --> 27:43.600
and we haven't collapsed yet.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.480
So there is hope there.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.680
That is good to hear.

27:48.680 --> 27:53.200
I would imagine it must be some of the more popular subsystems

27:53.200 --> 27:55.680
more easily attract maintainers, and some

27:55.680 --> 27:59.520
of the less popular or just well-known systems

27:59.520 --> 28:00.760
probably lack them.

28:00.760 --> 28:06.000
Popularity in some sense, yeah.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.600
It's a bit harder than that.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.920
It's more a matter of where people

28:09.920 --> 28:14.960
and where sponsoring companies see it as being their problem.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.040
So I stepped up for documentation

28:17.040 --> 28:19.800
because it's an area of interest to me.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.880
But it has also languished for years

28:21.880 --> 28:24.200
because there's no company out there

28:24.200 --> 28:27.000
that is making a living off of kernel documentation.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.400
There's no company that really saw it

28:29.400 --> 28:34.200
as being something that they needed to support to further

28:34.200 --> 28:35.760
their own business goals.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.760
So there are a lot of areas like that in the kernel

28:37.760 --> 28:39.760
that kind of languish a bit, some of them

28:39.760 --> 28:42.280
being fairly important areas.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.920
A lot of hardware support, for example,

28:43.920 --> 28:46.080
is very well-maintained because the company selling

28:46.080 --> 28:47.360
that hardware wanted to be.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.880
Sure, that makes sense.

28:48.880 --> 28:52.000
A lot of core kernel areas often tend

28:52.000 --> 28:55.680
to hurt for maintainer effort, even though they're

28:55.680 --> 28:57.560
some of the most important parts of the kernel.

28:57.560 --> 28:59.080
I guess when you put it in that framework,

28:59.080 --> 29:00.280
it totally makes sense to me.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.840
So I wanted to ask you just about development in general.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.200
You have followed this for a very long time.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.960
We have a lot of some of the people

29:06.960 --> 29:09.040
that started in the very early days still involved.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.840
But is development shifting for the Linux kernel

29:11.840 --> 29:12.800
in any significant way?

29:12.800 --> 29:14.760
Or is it still kind of the standard way

29:14.760 --> 29:16.640
it's been made over the years?

29:16.640 --> 29:19.680
I saw I think you predicted that in the near-term future,

29:19.680 --> 29:21.920
someone will be able to submit a patch to the kernel

29:21.920 --> 29:23.920
without ever having to touch email.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.160
Well, the way that we have done development, of course,

29:26.160 --> 29:30.280
has changed quite a bit from really the first decade, where

29:30.280 --> 29:32.520
it was just a matter of sending patches to Linux

29:32.520 --> 29:34.600
and hoping that he did something with them

29:34.600 --> 29:38.080
before deleting them from his inbox.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.400
So we have changed quite a bit.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.200
And that's continuing.

29:42.200 --> 29:44.160
The kernel project can be said to lag

29:44.160 --> 29:46.480
behind a lot of other projects in terms of the tools

29:46.480 --> 29:50.600
that it uses, until it gets around to pioneering tools

29:50.600 --> 29:54.200
that work on the scale of the kernel project, where

29:54.200 --> 29:57.880
we have over 4,000 developers contributing something

29:57.880 --> 30:01.520
on the order of 80,000, 90,000 patches every year.

30:01.520 --> 30:04.320
You can't do that on GitHub, for example.

30:04.320 --> 30:07.760
It won't scale to that at this point.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.680
So we don't use tools like that.

30:10.680 --> 30:13.960
We had the same problem with source code management systems

30:13.960 --> 30:17.680
until BitKeeper showed how the source code could

30:17.680 --> 30:21.080
be distributed amongst a whole lot of maintainers

30:21.080 --> 30:24.160
and then get made that into free software

30:24.160 --> 30:25.840
and truly available to the world.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.800
And then not only did the kernel catch up

30:27.800 --> 30:29.720
to other projects using source code management,

30:29.720 --> 30:32.520
but we ended up actually leading the way for a while

30:32.520 --> 30:34.720
and bringing out the source code management system

30:34.720 --> 30:37.600
that now everybody else uses as well.

30:37.600 --> 30:42.160
So I think that may well happen again with development models

30:42.160 --> 30:47.040
that get away from the send your patches by email approach.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.440
But there is really nothing else that scales

30:49.440 --> 30:51.800
to what we need at this point.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.360
There are people working on ideas,

30:53.360 --> 30:54.320
and we'll see what happens.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.880
It's going to be interesting to watch.

30:55.880 --> 30:59.080
But for now, we're still sending patches by email.

30:59.080 --> 31:01.600
Yeah, that definitely will be a fascinating development.

31:01.600 --> 31:02.840
What would you guess is a timeline

31:02.840 --> 31:03.840
for something like that?

31:03.840 --> 31:05.600
Do you have any foggy guesses?

31:05.600 --> 31:07.240
Well, I did predict that we might

31:07.240 --> 31:10.320
see some sort of proof of concept stuff out there

31:10.320 --> 31:11.720
this year.

31:11.720 --> 31:15.440
And we've seen some increase in the development of tools

31:15.440 --> 31:19.880
around patch submission and all that now that have already

31:19.880 --> 31:21.400
helped quite a bit.

31:21.400 --> 31:24.240
But within the next few years, I don't

31:24.240 --> 31:25.640
see things changing a whole lot.

31:25.640 --> 31:29.480
But with luck, we'll see the tools start to take shape.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.280
Yeah, well, while we're looking ahead,

31:31.280 --> 31:33.280
I wouldn't mind shifting back to LWN a bit.

31:33.280 --> 31:37.240
And who cares what you see the next couple of years?

31:37.240 --> 31:41.040
Nothing dramatic, but just the semi-near-term future for LWN.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.840
Do you see anything shifting or anything new coming down

31:43.840 --> 31:46.480
the horizon or thoughts in that regard?

31:46.480 --> 31:50.160
To a great extent, we'll keep on doing what we do, I suppose.

31:50.160 --> 31:54.480
And I'm forever trying to bring in more staff

31:54.480 --> 31:56.280
to do writing for us.

31:56.280 --> 31:57.800
So if there are any listeners out there

31:57.800 --> 32:01.720
who are looking to do our style of writing,

32:01.720 --> 32:03.440
please do contact us.

32:03.440 --> 32:07.000
And with that, I would like to perhaps expand our content

32:07.000 --> 32:11.600
range and perhaps add more features to the site, which

32:11.600 --> 32:13.840
is kind of languished for a bit and so on.

32:13.840 --> 32:16.560
But in terms of the core of what we do,

32:16.560 --> 32:18.840
which is reporting on the development community

32:18.840 --> 32:20.480
for the development community, I don't really

32:20.480 --> 32:21.720
see that changing much.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.220
I think a lot of people will actually

32:23.220 --> 32:24.640
be very glad to hear that.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.360
I hope you guys can continue to publish for a very long time.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.160
I'm sure the audience would be interested in getting

32:30.160 --> 32:31.200
in touch with you.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.860
There's probably a few people motivated.

32:32.860 --> 32:35.080
What's the best way for them to do that?

32:35.080 --> 32:39.880
If you go to the LWN.net page, there's

32:39.880 --> 32:42.080
a link right there that says write for us.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.400
And it talks a bit about how we work

32:44.400 --> 32:46.720
and what we're looking for and how to proceed.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.680
Nice and simple, I suppose.

32:48.680 --> 32:51.280
Well, I absolutely appreciate, Jonathan,

32:51.280 --> 32:53.200
just all of the work you and the staff

32:53.200 --> 32:55.520
have done at LWN over the years.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.800
I've been a longtime member, a longtime reader.

32:57.800 --> 33:03.120
And I think it's such a needed resource.

33:03.120 --> 33:06.600
And over the years, since you started,

33:06.600 --> 33:11.200
you've watched blogs take off like crazy, podcasts,

33:11.200 --> 33:11.840
and YouTube.

33:11.840 --> 33:14.880
And LWN feels like it's stayed true to itself

33:14.880 --> 33:16.880
through all of that.

33:16.880 --> 33:19.080
Were you ever pulled at all to try

33:19.080 --> 33:23.000
to get in on any of these new kind of media thing

33:23.000 --> 33:25.240
platforms that were going crazy at a particular time

33:25.240 --> 33:26.080
or another?

33:26.080 --> 33:29.080
Oh, people suggest it, and we think about it.

33:29.080 --> 33:32.520
And we've occasionally talked about maybe trying

33:32.520 --> 33:34.760
to do a podcast or something like that.

33:34.760 --> 33:38.920
But it's enough work just to do what we're doing now.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.400
And we just haven't felt that we had the bandwidth

33:41.400 --> 33:43.200
to try to take that on, too.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.240
If we were to find somebody that we

33:45.240 --> 33:47.520
can bring into staff who wanted to pursue such a thing,

33:47.520 --> 33:48.480
we could consider it.

33:48.480 --> 33:52.560
Yeah, I think there is a real needed place, too,

33:52.560 --> 33:56.080
for really well-done, written material

33:56.080 --> 34:00.320
that you can trust the source and the publication behind it.

34:00.320 --> 34:03.520
I think since you've started until where we are now,

34:03.520 --> 34:06.160
it's become more and more of a precious commodity.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.760
So I salute you.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.640
And of course, if you ever did want to get into podcasting,

34:10.640 --> 34:12.520
your friends here at Jupiter Broadcasting

34:12.520 --> 34:16.120
would be more than happy to help make that happen.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.320
OK, that's good to know.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.360
I will definitely keep that in mind.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.160
Well, Jonathan, thanks for coming on the show.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.840
All right, well, thank you very much.

34:22.840 --> 34:23.760
It's been a pleasure.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.880
It was a treat to chat with Jonathan.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.840
LWN.net is a favorite resource of mine,

34:28.840 --> 34:31.040
and I just wanted to help celebrate

34:31.040 --> 34:33.200
their upcoming anniversary.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.000
And you can check them out at LWN.net

34:35.000 --> 34:36.320
if you haven't read it before.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.320
Go over there.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.880
Give them a read.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.640
I think they have a really cool model where you can subscribe

34:41.640 --> 34:44.200
and get the content right away, or you wait a little bit,

34:44.200 --> 34:46.680
like a week, and then the content is available for free.

34:46.680 --> 34:48.560
Yeah, it's really just a fantastic resource.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.400
And if you love the nerdy stuff we're

34:50.400 --> 34:55.240
talking about on this show, it's the next level.

34:55.240 --> 34:58.920
odir.app, complete website monitoring from multiple locations.

34:58.920 --> 35:01.840
They have broken link detection, mixed content as well,

35:01.840 --> 35:04.800
advanced SSL certificate reporting, and more.

35:04.800 --> 35:11.080
So visit odir.app and use promo code LINUX for a $10 discount on any plan.

35:11.080 --> 35:14.160
Don't find out something's down by your users telling you it's down.

35:14.160 --> 35:17.040
Be the first to know when your site is unavailable.

35:17.040 --> 35:20.120
Odir has global uptime checking with servers worldwide

35:20.120 --> 35:23.200
that will report on any problem as soon as it happens.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.000
And they can go deep into your site.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.640
They crawl and index your entire website,

35:26.640 --> 35:29.960
and they'll detect a broken link and then intelligently notify you.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.240
You can also monitor scheduled tasks and cron jobs

35:32.240 --> 35:35.360
and find out if they haven't run at their scheduled time.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.960
And odir is always monitoring the performance and speed

35:37.960 --> 35:40.280
of your website over time.

35:40.280 --> 35:42.760
They detect if something is suddenly slow

35:42.760 --> 35:45.080
or watch if there's been a change in performance

35:45.080 --> 35:47.040
over a period of time.

35:47.040 --> 35:50.860
But one of the things that I think really makes odir stand out

35:50.860 --> 35:52.400
is their API.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.760
You can configure everything about the application

35:54.760 --> 35:55.680
through their API.

35:55.680 --> 35:57.520
Everything you see in the dashboard

35:57.520 --> 36:00.640
can be controlled with their easy-to-use RESTful API.

36:00.640 --> 36:03.640
And as a bonus, all the changes you make via the API,

36:03.640 --> 36:05.880
immediately available in the dashboard.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.120
odir is a monitoring solution that embraces automation.

36:08.120 --> 36:12.000
It gives you the tools to build your infrastructure by code.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.040
And its comprehensive API means integrations

36:14.040 --> 36:15.340
are simple and straightforward.

36:15.340 --> 36:19.680
There's already a ton you can take advantage of just out of the box.

36:19.680 --> 36:22.000
It's monitoring that's done right.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.600
It's a modern solution, and it has a comprehensive API

36:25.600 --> 36:27.560
with kick-ass documentation.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.480
So right now, head over to odir.app

36:30.480 --> 36:33.960
and start your 10-day, no-strings-attached trial.

36:33.960 --> 36:35.320
No credit card required.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.000
You can get set up in less than a minute.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.640
And when you do sign up for a plan,

36:38.640 --> 36:41.600
use the promo code LINUX for a $10 discount.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.440
And if they ask, tell them Linux Unplug sent you.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.120
odir.app.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.560
It's monitoring with a comprehensive API

36:48.560 --> 36:49.720
for today's automation.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.120
odir.app.

36:51.120 --> 36:56.360
I feel like it's time we get into some picks, you know?

36:56.360 --> 36:59.360
We've had some good picks in the past.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.360
We've had some contenders.

37:00.360 --> 37:03.740
But this week, we have something real special, Wes.

37:03.740 --> 37:06.240
This is one that both you and I came across.

37:06.240 --> 37:09.720
We followed the back streets of Linux applications

37:09.720 --> 37:12.000
and see what everybody's talking about.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.160
And every now and then, we stumble across a new contender,

37:15.160 --> 37:17.680
one that seems to be growing in popularity.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.640
And this week, it's Polybar,

37:19.640 --> 37:24.040
which aims to be a beautiful and highly customizable status

37:24.040 --> 37:27.280
bar, I think that gin's kicking in,

37:27.280 --> 37:30.520
without the need of being a black belt in bash scripting.

37:30.520 --> 37:33.440
Have you seen this there, Drew, the P-Polybar?

37:33.440 --> 37:34.960
It's not like the kind of Polybar

37:34.960 --> 37:36.920
that lives with multiple other bars,

37:36.920 --> 37:39.080
and then they all tell themselves they're OK with it.

37:39.080 --> 37:41.560
It's a status bar for multiple kinds of desktops.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.440
Yes, I've used Polybar.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.040
It's not exactly new, though.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.800
I used it years ago.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.320
Hey, now, I didn't say it was new.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.360
I said it's been getting a lot of attention recently.

37:50.360 --> 37:50.920
Fair enough.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.400
Fair enough.

37:52.400 --> 37:58.280
Yeah, as far as an X11 bar for i3, it's my favorite.

37:58.280 --> 37:59.240
It's the go-to.

37:59.240 --> 38:02.420
And if you want something that is

38:02.420 --> 38:05.520
Wayland compatible, that's very similar to Polybar,

38:05.520 --> 38:06.920
I would recommend Waybar.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.720
One question, Drew.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.400
Is Waybar written in Rust?

38:10.400 --> 38:12.360
I don't believe so, no.

38:12.360 --> 38:15.680
Move on, next pick.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.800
That's good to know, though.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.160
Waybar is good to know.

38:18.160 --> 38:18.820
It's good to know.

38:18.820 --> 38:20.600
It's just that we do have a second pick.

38:20.600 --> 38:25.000
And yes, as you may have guessed,

38:25.000 --> 38:29.560
it's another open source project rewritten in Rust,

38:29.560 --> 38:32.240
which we have to follow because these are special.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.080
And it's called Dust.

38:34.080 --> 38:38.980
It's a more intuitive version of DU, and it's written in Rust.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.600
So this one looks pretty special, Wes.

38:40.600 --> 38:41.520
Yeah, it's nice.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.360
I don't know that it's going to replace

38:43.360 --> 38:48.480
NC DU for me because that's just so handy because I can also delete stuff

38:48.480 --> 38:51.360
while I'm viewing, but it runs really fast

38:51.360 --> 38:54.280
and gives you a really nice little column chart here

38:54.280 --> 38:55.880
of where all your space is going.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.160
It's got a little index tree.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.880
It's got nice command line options, just how deep

38:59.880 --> 39:02.440
you might want to go in your file system, stuff like that.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.440
And because it's Rust, well, it's just a binary,

39:04.440 --> 39:06.800
you can download right off the GitHub releases,

39:06.800 --> 39:09.840
run it on your system, and see where your space is going.

39:09.840 --> 39:15.620
Yeah, I mean, are you tired of having to type TACD, TACA, or TACH flags

39:15.620 --> 39:17.480
when you're launching DU like an animal?

39:17.480 --> 39:19.680
Yeah, remember which one is which?

39:19.680 --> 39:20.760
I can't keep it straight.

39:20.760 --> 39:24.120
That's why I use Dust, the Rust alternative to DU.

39:24.120 --> 39:34.360
While we're talking about things that are epic,

39:34.360 --> 39:37.840
I want to say a big thank you to our Unplugged Core contributors,

39:37.840 --> 39:40.960
unpluggedcore.com if you'd like to become a member of the show.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.400
Keep the show independent and help reduce the ad load needed.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.920
Let us be picky and say, no, thank you.

39:45.920 --> 39:49.160
And as a thank you to you, you get some perks.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.800
Did you know this, Wes?

39:50.800 --> 39:54.600
I mean, FYI, Wes, did you know there's two options for our members?

39:54.600 --> 39:55.600
What two options?

39:55.600 --> 39:56.960
That sounds like one too many.

39:56.960 --> 39:57.280
I know.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.160
We should throw them all out.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.720
But no, we like to have them all.

39:59.720 --> 40:02.800
You can get a limited ad version of the show, nice, tight, well-produced,

40:02.800 --> 40:05.440
same full production, just limited ads.

40:05.440 --> 40:08.160
Or go the absolute opposite route.

40:08.160 --> 40:12.600
Get way more show, extra run length, the full live stream,

40:12.600 --> 40:15.120
all of our screw-ups, of which there are plenty,

40:15.120 --> 40:17.160
and stuff that never makes it into the show.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.560
And really shouldn't.

40:18.560 --> 40:21.240
For good reason, you can get all of it.

40:21.240 --> 40:24.120
It's like the extra show that we use our better judgment

40:24.120 --> 40:25.520
and don't release to the public.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.320
We make that available as a feed.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.360
To our contributors, you support us, so that way

40:29.360 --> 40:31.920
we show you what we really made of, and then you probably stop supporting us.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.080
Yeah, that's a lot of trust.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.480
Why don't we do it?

40:34.480 --> 40:35.040
I don't know.

40:35.040 --> 40:38.280
Unpluggedcore.com, go get yourself a little bit of that.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.080
Also, don't forget, you can find our sponsor, Cloud Guru,

40:41.080 --> 40:43.520
on social media, like Twitter, YouTube, or the Facebooks.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.440
You got all of them.

40:44.440 --> 40:45.080
It's real easy.

40:45.080 --> 40:49.000
You just go to slash a Cloud Guru, and you find them.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.240
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow this show,

40:51.240 --> 40:52.400
at Linux Unplugged.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.360
The network is at Jupyter Signal.

40:54.360 --> 40:58.320
And the entire Jupyter Broadcasting network of fantastic podcasts

40:58.320 --> 41:00.320
can be found at JupyterBroadcasting.com.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.720
I don't think we say that enough.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.360
Yeah, there's one page, all the shows, links to everything,

41:04.360 --> 41:05.480
all the places.

41:05.480 --> 41:06.560
Can you believe that?

41:06.560 --> 41:07.960
There's more than just this show?

41:07.960 --> 41:09.640
Jeez, what's the matter with us?

41:09.640 --> 41:11.100
Drew, thank you for making it, man.

41:11.100 --> 41:13.100
It was good having you on the podcast this week.

41:13.100 --> 41:13.940
Yeah, absolutely.

41:13.940 --> 41:15.800
Anytime I can, I try to.

41:15.800 --> 41:18.640
I imagine a far distant future where we're all together,

41:18.640 --> 41:21.240
hanging out in Denver, doing a little pod action.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.920
Could be happening very soon.

41:22.920 --> 41:25.880
But in the meantime, you can find the show generally live on Tuesdays,

41:25.880 --> 41:29.040
with the exception of the occasional Sunday sneaky show.

41:29.040 --> 41:33.280
We do it at 12 PM Pacific, 3 PM Eastern over at jblive.tv.

41:33.280 --> 41:36.200
Links to everything we talked about today, how to contact us,

41:36.200 --> 41:39.120
the mumble info, the matrix server info, and even ways

41:39.120 --> 41:43.240
to subscribe to this show are available at linuxunplugged.com.

41:43.240 --> 41:44.520
See you next week.

41:44.520 --> 41:47.040
Same bad time, same bad station.

41:47.040 --> 41:50.120
So thanks so much for tuning into this episode of the Unplugged program.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.280
Thank you to our mumble room, who takes the extra step

41:52.280 --> 41:54.900
to show up and contribute and make the show even better.

41:54.900 --> 41:59.360
Thank you to our IRC room, who chats along and fact checks us,

41:59.360 --> 42:00.880
fact check falses us as we go.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.560
Gives us the links we just can't find.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.320
That's right.

42:03.320 --> 42:05.020
And helps make the show notes even better.

42:05.020 --> 42:06.640
There's also just people watching.

42:06.640 --> 42:07.440
We appreciate that.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.600
And more than ever, we appreciate those of you

42:09.600 --> 42:12.160
who download the podcast and share it with friends.

42:12.160 --> 42:14.720
Nothing helps a podcast grow like word of mouth.

42:14.720 --> 42:17.560
So if you think this show might be interesting, share it with them.

42:17.560 --> 42:18.440
Helps the show a lot.

42:18.440 --> 42:20.000
We appreciate that too.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.180
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

42:23.180 --> 42:32.800
And we'll see you right back here, not tomorrow, but next Tuesday.

42:32.800 --> 42:33.300
Hey.

42:33.300 --> 42:33.800
Hey.

42:33.800 --> 42:34.300
Hey.

42:34.300 --> 42:34.800
Hey.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.300
Hey.

42:35.300 --> 43:05.280
Hey.

43:05.280 --> 43:07.280
All right.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.000
JBtitles.com.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.360
Let's go vote.

43:10.360 --> 43:12.700
Did anybody have something that didn't make it in the main show

43:12.700 --> 43:14.560
that they wanted to pick up in the post-show?

43:14.560 --> 43:15.480
Now's the time.

43:15.480 --> 43:16.200
Yeah.

43:16.200 --> 43:19.680
JBtitles.com.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.960
That was amazing.

43:21.960 --> 43:24.160
Should really get a sound water clip of that for later.

43:24.160 --> 43:24.720
Yeah.

43:24.720 --> 43:27.120
Record that locally so I can fire that off, would you?

43:27.120 --> 43:28.120
That'd be great.

43:28.120 --> 43:29.040
Hooked on dust.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.280
That's amazing.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.080
Wow.

43:32.080 --> 43:33.480
Eating the license cake.

43:33.480 --> 43:33.980
Wow.

43:33.980 --> 43:34.920
Everybody's on fire.

43:34.920 --> 43:35.760
Read-only licenses.

43:35.760 --> 43:38.800
That's good because in my head right now, I have no idea what to call that show.

43:38.800 --> 43:39.300
Yeah.

43:39.300 --> 43:40.200
Yeah.

43:40.200 --> 43:43.040
When is JB Titles going to get SSL?

43:43.040 --> 43:43.760
Never.

43:43.760 --> 43:46.160
When we rewrite it for Matrix, perhaps?

43:46.160 --> 43:47.720
In Rust.

43:47.720 --> 43:48.360
Yeah.

43:48.360 --> 43:48.880
I'm sorry.

43:48.880 --> 43:49.440
What was that?

43:49.440 --> 43:49.760
I'm sorry.

43:49.760 --> 43:50.440
I didn't hear that.

43:50.440 --> 43:50.940
No.

43:50.940 --> 43:51.440
No.

43:51.440 --> 43:51.940
No.

43:51.940 --> 43:52.440
No.

43:52.440 --> 43:52.940
No.

43:52.940 --> 43:53.440
No.

43:53.440 --> 43:53.940
No.

43:53.940 --> 43:54.440
No.

43:54.440 --> 43:54.940
No.

43:54.940 --> 43:55.440
No.

43:55.440 --> 43:55.940
No.

43:55.940 --> 43:56.440
No.

43:56.440 --> 43:56.940
No.

43:56.940 --> 43:57.440
No.

43:57.440 --> 43:57.940
No.

43:57.940 --> 43:58.440
No.

43:58.440 --> 43:58.940
No.

43:58.940 --> 43:59.440
No.

43:59.440 --> 43:59.940
No.

43:59.940 --> 44:00.440
No.

44:00.440 --> 44:00.940
No.

44:00.940 --> 44:01.440
No.

44:01.440 --> 44:01.940
No.

44:01.940 --> 44:02.440
No.

44:02.440 --> 44:02.940
No.

44:02.940 --> 44:03.440
No.

44:03.440 --> 44:03.940
No.

44:03.940 --> 44:04.440
No.
