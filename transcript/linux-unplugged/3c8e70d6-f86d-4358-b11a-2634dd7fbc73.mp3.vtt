00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 45 for June 17th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:42.320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's raised from the ashes, stronger,

00:42.320 --> 00:45.880
and more in-depth than ever before. My name is Chris.

00:45.880 --> 00:46.880
And my name is Matt.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.320
Hey Matt. Okay, so I'm gonna be clear with you. It's gonna be an express edition this

00:50.320 --> 00:57.800
week because I've been here since about 6am and I was here until about 10.30 last night.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.980
We had some hardware death, Matt. You know there's when hardware dies and there's when

01:01.980 --> 01:06.920
hardware has deathed. And I have hardware death where it's like I came into the room,

01:06.920 --> 01:11.680
I heard some clicking. It kinda actually did go down like that. It happened during Coda

01:11.680 --> 01:15.280
Radio yesterday. I'm sitting here and see we have a mixer, it's all controlled by software

01:15.280 --> 01:21.280
and it doesn't even have physical switches. It doesn't even have physical pots as they

01:21.280 --> 01:24.880
call them where you can pull up or pull down a pot to make somebody louder or quieter.

01:24.880 --> 01:28.880
None of that. No sliders, Matt. It's slider free. It's all controlled by software. Well

01:28.880 --> 01:31.880
guess what happens when the hard drive in the machine that controls it by software starts

01:31.880 --> 01:36.200
to die? You don't have access to the mixer anymore. So we won't have our mumble room

01:36.200 --> 01:41.080
with us today because I actually just got it working like an hour and a half before

01:41.080 --> 01:44.240
the show. I texted Matt, I'm like, uh, Matt, I think we're gonna have to reschedule the

01:44.240 --> 01:48.480
show today. And then like last thing I try, like I was like while I was texting Matt,

01:48.480 --> 01:52.160
then I'm like, well, I'm gonna try one more thing. This is not gonna fix it. And of course

01:52.160 --> 01:58.760
it fixed it. So we made it just in time for the show. So that's good. Uh, which is nice

01:58.760 --> 02:04.100
because I got, I got something kind of fun, uh, to talk about. I've, I've, um, recently

02:04.100 --> 02:10.360
had the opportunity to take, uh, Android, Ubuntu touch and Firefox OS, slapped them

02:10.360 --> 02:14.960
all on my Android phone. And I'm going to tell you how Rick, I did it. Wow. Yeah, it's

02:14.960 --> 02:18.880
really cool. Sounds like a software sandwich. I'm triple booting. I, yeah, I am. I'm triple

02:18.880 --> 02:23.520
booting and the latest Android Firefox OS and Ubuntu touch. I wish we were on the mumble

02:23.520 --> 02:27.120
room cause I know fate and a couple others in the mumble room are doing this. So maybe

02:27.120 --> 02:31.680
after the show we'll do some post-show troubleshooting and see what they're able to do. So today

02:31.680 --> 02:36.080
it's, it's only a partial show because we wanted to be able to get up. We were here,

02:36.080 --> 02:40.720
but uh, it's going to be abbreviated. So why don't we start, uh, with the feedback so that

02:40.720 --> 02:43.720
way we can get that covered. Cause we've got some good ones. Uh, Nick wrote in, we talked

02:43.720 --> 02:51.080
last week about, um, the whole Alienware going with a windows box. Remember that? I, I still

02:51.080 --> 02:53.960
can't get over it. It's like a bad nightmare. I keep thinking I'm going to wake up and it's

02:53.960 --> 02:57.000
all going to be gone. Yeah. So to recap, for those of you who didn't catch last week's

02:57.000 --> 03:03.240
episode of Linux Unplugged, um, at E3 last week, Alienware announced they'd be shipping

03:03.240 --> 03:10.620
not a steam OS box, but a steam machine. The steam machine is going to run, you guessed

03:10.620 --> 03:16.000
it, Windows. So, uh, we won't, uh, we won't know exactly what it's, what their, what their

03:16.000 --> 03:19.560
offerings are going to be, you know, what, until it hits the market. But, uh, we had

03:19.560 --> 03:24.400
some heavy thoughts. We had some, we had some, we had some frustrations, I would say. And,

03:24.400 --> 03:28.180
uh, we talked about them last week on the show and Nick, Nick, I thought came in with

03:28.180 --> 03:33.000
a pretty good response. Uh, cause we, we definitely took a hard line response and Nick, you know,

03:33.000 --> 03:38.400
he's a, he's, he's more rational than we are. It says in Linux Unplugged episode 44, there

03:38.400 --> 03:43.080
was a debate over Alienware and it betraying Linux. In my opinion, Alienware made the right

03:43.080 --> 03:46.680
move. Although Linux is gaining developer support for games, Windows is developer support

03:46.680 --> 03:51.680
that currently far outreaches Linux. Even when running steam OS, a gamer would be limited

03:51.680 --> 03:55.240
on the selection of content that was available to him or her. The move to Windows allows

03:55.240 --> 03:58.920
Alienware to push out a console that allows gamers access to the array of content available

03:58.920 --> 04:04.440
for Windows while having a better UI that circumnavigates the whore that is Windows

04:04.440 --> 04:10.260
Metro. Don't get me wrong, I love Linux, but Windows is still the OS of choice for gaming.

04:10.260 --> 04:13.720
Gaming on Linux has a long way to go, but if we're going, if we're going to be seen

04:13.720 --> 04:18.880
squabbling about why gaming, uh, related companies are stupid instead of asking the question

04:18.880 --> 04:23.400
of how to bring games to Linux, we will not be taken seriously by developers that may

04:23.400 --> 04:28.520
be looking at Linux as a viable platform. He says, uh, by the way, many popular games

04:28.520 --> 04:32.720
such as Battlefield run their own independent clients and services that have yet to be coded

04:32.720 --> 04:38.280
for Linux. These games would still be accessible for those using that Alienware Windows box.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.000
Hopefully these developers will begin developing content for Linux, but we'll have to wait

04:41.000 --> 04:44.940
and see. It makes a good point about like things like a Battlefield who have their own

04:44.940 --> 04:47.800
like networking clients and all that stuff. There's not even available. The backend for

04:47.800 --> 04:50.920
that's not even available for Linux. Well, this is true. And it goes back to what I was

04:50.920 --> 04:55.920
saying last week. And then at the end of the day, it comes down to titles, you know, which,

04:55.920 --> 04:59.800
which platform has the most titles. And I, and I guess Alienware was looking at that

04:59.800 --> 05:03.960
fairly practically and saying, okay, look, um, while I personally think it sucks and

05:03.960 --> 05:08.160
it makes me mad and it doesn't shock me that the Dell slash Alienware guys would do this,

05:08.160 --> 05:12.480
I, you know, having chance to kind of noodle it over, I do feel like that that's the decision

05:12.480 --> 05:17.480
that was made. That being said, I still don't agree with it. Yeah. And, uh, I, like I'm

05:17.480 --> 05:21.160
only, I'm kind of with Riley and the chairman's like, well then why not just wait, just wait

05:21.160 --> 05:25.240
till steamOS was ready for that point. Because it seems like this is a failed product already.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.840
Like we've seen this product bail and you're just shipping something that's already not

05:28.840 --> 05:32.080
worked. And you're going to sort of, I hope they don't draw conclusions about what steamOS

05:32.080 --> 05:37.200
itself would do in a marketplace. I guess that's my Alienware may and good for them

05:37.200 --> 05:41.160
fail. Go away. Yeah. Maybe that's right. Let him get out of here. Get it out of here, right?

05:41.160 --> 05:46.160
That's probably a good point. Cause after all, I think Alienware is wasted effort. Yeah.

05:46.160 --> 05:52.080
Yeah. Um, all right. Well, uh, because, because we have a long email to get to, I want to

05:52.080 --> 05:56.520
take a moment right here and I want to stop and thank team over to linux.ting.com. They're

05:56.520 --> 06:00.200
one of our sponsors for the Linux unplugged show and it's mobile that makes sense. My

06:00.200 --> 06:03.920
mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider too. In fact, I was just

06:03.920 --> 06:08.480
talking with Matt at the beginning of the show about my nexus five and Matt's got the

06:08.480 --> 06:11.880
note too. Now Matt, you know, you might want to consider, I mean, I'm just going to throw

06:11.880 --> 06:16.840
this out there, but you might want to consider, uh, I think, Oh, I don't actually know. Oh,

06:16.840 --> 06:21.520
you know what? I think this trick I did is limited to the nexus devices, but I am doing

06:21.520 --> 06:27.920
it. I, so I made my first call today on Ubuntu touch on Ting. How about that? Now tell me

06:27.920 --> 06:32.400
that's not mobile that makes sense. Right? Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. So this is what's

06:32.400 --> 06:36.400
great about Ting is it's, it's a flat $6 a month and then it's just your usage on top

06:36.400 --> 06:39.320
of that. And that's how they bill you. They'll just take your messages, your minutes and

06:39.320 --> 06:42.440
your megabytes. They'll add them up at the end of the month. Whatever bucket you fall

06:42.440 --> 06:46.480
into, that's what you pay. There's no contract, there's no early termination fee and you own

06:46.480 --> 06:50.600
your device outright, which I think is really great. Plus every plan comes with caller ID,

06:50.600 --> 06:53.960
tethering hotspot, three-way calling, call forwarding and all the other features you'd

06:53.960 --> 06:58.200
expect. And it's just your usage. There's no ETF because there's no contract, which

06:58.200 --> 07:01.520
is awesome. So you feel like you have the freedom to move if you need to. They have

07:01.520 --> 07:05.080
a great dashboard. But the other thing I think is really unique about Ting is their customer

07:05.080 --> 07:08.760
service. They have a no hold customer service and they just did a video about how they actually

07:08.760 --> 07:14.440
scale that. And I'll play that for this, for the audience out there.

07:14.440 --> 07:19.480
James M asks one question. How do you do it? I've had to call you once and got a live person

07:19.480 --> 07:23.240
on the first ring who was cheerful and solved my problem. I emailed another time and got

07:23.240 --> 07:27.160
an answer in about 15 minutes. Are you a real company? Could you teach Comcast?

07:27.160 --> 07:32.440
Well, I don't know if we could teach Comcast, but we're definitely a real company. We decided

07:32.440 --> 07:36.800
a long time ago that it was just important to treat our customers the same way that we

07:36.800 --> 07:40.760
like to be treated when we call. Nobody likes being put on hold. Nobody likes waiting two,

07:40.760 --> 07:45.220
three days to get a response to their email. And it certainly happens. We're not perfect.

07:45.220 --> 07:49.000
But we really keep an eye on how many calls we're getting and how many emails we're getting

07:49.000 --> 07:52.760
and how many new customers we're signing up and then do everything that it takes to make

07:52.760 --> 07:57.240
sure we've got enough staff here that are happy and properly trained and motivated in

07:57.240 --> 08:01.680
the right direction to make sure that they can perform up to those levels.

08:01.680 --> 08:05.580
Go to linux.ting.com to take $25 off your first device. If you've got a device that's

08:05.580 --> 08:09.560
compatible with Ting, good news. They'll give you a $25 credit. And if you're like me, that'll

08:09.560 --> 08:13.880
last more than your first month of Ting service. It really is something when you switch over

08:13.880 --> 08:18.400
to Ting and you can go find their savings calculator over at linux.ting.com and see

08:18.400 --> 08:22.040
how much you would save, put in your actual usage, and see what it'd check out to be.

08:22.040 --> 08:26.320
Also check out some of their devices. They've got MiFi-only devices. That's a $6 hotspot.

08:26.320 --> 08:30.360
You get that hotspot and it's just your usage. And if you don't use it very much, then you

08:30.360 --> 08:35.240
don't pay very much. If you use a lot, you pay appropriately. And it makes sense. Linux.ting.com.

08:35.240 --> 08:42.040
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. I made so, I did make that first

08:42.040 --> 08:47.720
phone call on Ubuntu Touch on Ting. And it's a little beta because two things happen. Of

08:47.720 --> 08:53.000
course, now I'm ribbing Ubuntu Touch and we can't get in mobile for Popey to defend it.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.560
So I made the call and it worked flawlessly to make the call. And it was nice because

08:57.560 --> 09:04.080
I didn't really have to hardly set up anything. But then the problem was is when I hung up

09:04.080 --> 09:10.480
the other end, the Ubuntu Touch end never recognized the hang up and then just blew

09:10.480 --> 09:18.220
through half my battery in about two minutes. Wow. Well, as you pointed out, I'll play Popey's

09:18.220 --> 09:22.200
part here. To defend it, I would say it's beta. It's early days. It's like a recent

09:22.200 --> 09:27.040
build too. Yeah, it's a super recent build too. But hey, it works. I'm running Ubuntu

09:27.040 --> 09:31.080
Touch and Firefox OS on the Nexus 5. It's living the dream, man. I'm living the dream.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.520
All right. Russell writes in about high DPI support under Linux. And this is a topic that

09:34.520 --> 09:40.040
we've been tracking because I fancy myself once the monitors come down to a reasonable

09:40.040 --> 09:44.560
price level. I fancy myself running the GNOME desktop on a high DPI display. So he says,

09:44.560 --> 09:47.760
hey, Linux support for high DPI screens has been brought up here and there lately. So

09:47.760 --> 09:51.960
I thought I'd chime in with my experiences. I bought a 4K monitor a month ago and tried

09:51.960 --> 09:58.400
several different desktop environments with it. And the winner by far is Unity. How about

09:58.400 --> 10:04.080
that? He says, I was an Arch user on GNOME. I got my monitor around the same time 3.12

10:04.080 --> 10:09.680
hit the repos. I heard 3.12 had high DPI support, but apparently that wasn't in the binaries

10:09.680 --> 10:14.320
in the repo. And I would have to recompile Cairo and GTK. And I didn't want to get into

10:14.320 --> 10:20.840
that for something that should have just worked. GNOME was bad. KDE was bad. XFCE was better.

10:20.840 --> 10:26.200
But anything lower than that required too much configuration, often on a per application

10:26.200 --> 10:30.840
basis. I tried Ubuntu 14.04 and it looked really good. It has GUIs for setting up the

10:30.840 --> 10:35.000
window and font scaling and everything looks as it should. I'm sure high DPI support will

10:35.000 --> 10:40.080
be more of a priority for desktop environments and distributions as time goes along. But

10:40.080 --> 10:45.960
right now it looks like Ubuntu is the clear winner. Also with a GTX 770 graphics card

10:45.960 --> 10:57.800
on Ubuntu, I'm playing Dota 2 on max settings at 3,840 by 2,160 at 80 frames per second.

10:57.800 --> 11:03.120
That's pretty cool. Keep up the good work, Russell. Holy crap. That is an insane resolution.

11:03.120 --> 11:11.520
3,840 by 2,160 at 80 frames per second. Okay. Yeah, that works. He got a 4K monitor. He

11:11.520 --> 11:16.200
must have dropped a pretty penny on that because I think even the cheap ones are around two

11:16.200 --> 11:22.840
grand right now still. I'm kind of asking, and I'm a little fuddy-dove. What's the,

11:22.840 --> 11:28.400
you know. Hey guys. HD is nice. It's great. Can you visually with human eyeballs really

11:28.400 --> 11:33.840
notice a difference? And the value of this is negative. Yeah, I think you can actually,

11:33.840 --> 11:39.280
but just barely. I mean, I wear glasses and I don't know. I think you barely can, and

11:39.280 --> 11:42.440
I don't think it's worth that kind of money. I think it's like, it's one of those things

11:42.440 --> 11:46.980
where you look at it and you're like, oh man, that text looks particularly good. And that's

11:46.980 --> 11:54.200
kind of it. It's not like when you went from VHS to DVD, it's not that kind of jump. It's

11:54.200 --> 11:59.760
like when you went DVD to Blu-ray, I can sometimes you're like, okay, it does look better, but

11:59.760 --> 12:03.040
it doesn't look that much better, especially if you have a great DVD player and a good

12:03.040 --> 12:07.840
TV. Right. And I think it's kind of the same thing. Like I have a Monoprice Korean display

12:07.840 --> 12:12.560
that's a, it's got a high res, it's like a 2K resolution and it looks all right. You

12:12.560 --> 12:17.680
know, it looks pretty good, but I don't know, Matt, it's coming. It's coming. I just remember

12:17.680 --> 12:22.740
when just LCD screens were $2,000. Oh yeah. No kidding. Well, I still got a plasma set.

12:22.740 --> 12:26.920
That's my main TV. We have an LED TV in the bedroom, but our main sets of plasma and yeah,

12:26.920 --> 12:30.740
I'm happy as a clam with it. Yeah. You know, I don't know. It's like one of those things

12:30.740 --> 12:33.880
to where it's like, I would probably, if I got myself, if I sat in front of it and actually

12:33.880 --> 12:38.400
had a side by side, then I might be sold, but I'm just not there yet. And then again,

12:38.400 --> 12:41.740
I'll probably wait until the prices drop. So yeah, I feel like the prices need to come

12:41.740 --> 12:46.560
down for 4K. I feel like the Linux desktop applications and environment sounds like they

12:46.560 --> 12:51.480
still have some work to do. And I also want something that's like, you know, 22 inches

12:51.480 --> 12:56.880
or 27 inches. I don't want like a 15 inch high DPI display. I want like a big, big screen

12:56.880 --> 13:02.600
that, you know, is going to look awesome. And yeah, I don't know. Maybe, heck, if that's,

13:02.600 --> 13:07.200
if that's a year away, I mean, I'll definitely jump when it's, you know, in the few hundred

13:07.200 --> 13:10.560
dollar range. I think that's when I'm going to pull the trigger when it's like 380 bucks

13:10.560 --> 13:14.240
for a really, you know, like a well-respected brand or something like that that people are

13:14.240 --> 13:18.640
talking all about. And I'm like, okay, I'll jump onto that. Exactly. All right. Our next

13:18.640 --> 13:25.200
email comes in from Dave, AKA Skullplate in the IRC and in the subreddits. He says, I've

13:25.200 --> 13:29.320
been playing with the digital ocean server for a while and finally decided to put it

13:29.320 --> 13:34.480
to work. A short while later, I got my own Debian cloud server, own cloud Debian server

13:34.480 --> 13:38.560
up and running with fail to ban log watch. And I also disabled root login and many other

13:38.560 --> 13:42.280
tips I've picked up listening to the great Jupiter broadcasting podcast. Oh, thanks.

13:42.280 --> 13:46.000
And reading the JV subreddits. He says, most impressive is the performance. I'm getting

13:46.000 --> 13:51.240
the sinking of folders to my digital ocean server easily 10 times faster than Dropbox.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.720
So I just want to say a big thanks to Chris and Matt and the JV community and even Alan

13:54.720 --> 13:58.840
too. It was really easy considering a year ago, I didn't even really know how or how

13:58.840 --> 14:03.920
to use Linux at all. Thanks again, Dave, AKA Skullplate. Yeah. You know what? Go over to

14:03.920 --> 14:10.200
digital ocean.com. Use our promo code snap or I'm sorry, unplugged June, not snap. I

14:10.200 --> 14:14.520
was thinking a text snap because Alan unplugged June for digital ocean. I'll give you a $10

14:14.520 --> 14:19.720
credit. You can try out their $5 rig for two months or you can go hourly and that $10 credit

14:19.720 --> 14:22.520
will get you quite a ways. Are you not familiar with digital ocean? Let me tell you about

14:22.520 --> 14:26.360
it. Digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

14:26.360 --> 14:30.640
and easy way to spin up a cloud server. And I got to tell you, they've nailed it. Users

14:30.640 --> 14:34.360
can create a cloud server in about 55 seconds and pricing plans started only $5 a month

14:34.360 --> 14:40.800
for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer. That's

14:40.800 --> 14:45.520
all for $5. You know exactly what you're going to get for $5. And digital ocean has data

14:45.520 --> 14:51.640
center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, and Amsterdam. Their interface

14:51.640 --> 14:56.480
is amazing. Their control panel is intuitive and power users can replicate that control

14:56.480 --> 15:00.760
panel with their straightforward API. Son, get in there and replicate that. Won't you?

15:00.760 --> 15:05.760
They have a straightforward API and people call it beautiful, a beautiful API. Digital

15:05.760 --> 15:10.080
ocean.com. Use the promo code unplugged June. Go over there and get yourself a droplet.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.520
I've been hearing from folks that use it for an IRC server. An own cloud server seems

15:13.520 --> 15:18.160
to be very popular and recently more and more folks are jumping on digital ocean to deploy

15:18.160 --> 15:23.200
GitLab. Now digital ocean is sitting on top of KVM. They have a droplet system that lets

15:23.200 --> 15:28.840
you manage your instances. You can back them up, replicate them, move them between data

15:28.840 --> 15:34.480
centers, manage your DNS, access the console via their HTML5 console, written in Go, select

15:34.480 --> 15:38.080
your data center anywhere in the world, then choose your distribution, the architecture

15:38.080 --> 15:42.680
of that distribution, and then deploy. And you can do it all in about 55 seconds and

15:42.680 --> 15:45.520
you can be up and running. And with our promo code unplugged June, you can try it out for

15:45.520 --> 15:50.280
two months for absolutely free. Go get yourself an SSD powered server connected to tier one

15:50.280 --> 15:54.760
bandwidth. Partner with the amazing hardware providers that digital ocean has chosen over

15:54.760 --> 15:59.120
digital ocean.com. Use the promo code unplugged June and a big thanks to digital ocean for

15:59.120 --> 16:05.400
sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Yeah. You know, here recently I've been doing this whole WordPress

16:05.400 --> 16:09.720
thing with them, right? Because I've already got a Vidtor sync set up with them. So I set

16:09.720 --> 16:13.240
up another instance because I wanted to try the WordPress thing. Oh my gosh, it's stupid

16:13.240 --> 16:16.400
simple to do. Yeah, it's awesome. I couldn't get it. I couldn't get it. I was like, why

16:16.400 --> 16:20.800
the hell is everybody else doing this with so much more difficulty? This is great. And

16:20.800 --> 16:23.800
you know what I would always just keep in mind? Zombies don't run Linux. So you don't

16:23.800 --> 16:28.580
have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about zombies. Yeah. Okay. So I want

16:28.580 --> 16:31.840
to tell you just before we wrap up the express edition of Linux Unplugged, I want to tell

16:31.840 --> 16:37.680
you about this wizardry that Rekai pulled on my Nexus 5. So I've been having some, I'm

16:37.680 --> 16:41.760
trying not to hate on Android, Matt, but I'm, I just keep having these problems that are

16:41.760 --> 16:45.640
just driving me crazy. And so Rekai just kind of jokingly said, well, why don't you try

16:45.640 --> 16:48.200
it? Or actually I think it was Marissa and the chairman that Rekai do was like, yeah,

16:48.200 --> 16:51.920
do that. Why don't you just try out Firefox OS for a couple of days, Chris, and see what

16:51.920 --> 16:55.560
you think. I was like, oh yeah, well if you can put on my Nexus 5, I'll take the Firefox

16:55.560 --> 17:00.640
OS challenge. Well then guess what? Guess what happened? He put Firefox OS on my Nexus

17:00.640 --> 17:06.680
5. Oh my. Our buddy Jordan has a guide on the XDA forums on one way you can do it. I'll

17:06.680 --> 17:11.400
have links in the show notes too. So if you guys want to follow along it, check this out,

17:11.400 --> 17:15.480
Matt. Now it does require that you root the device, but on the Nexus 5, this isn't like,

17:15.480 --> 17:20.320
that's not like a crazy process. And then once you've rooted the device, you can go

17:20.320 --> 17:24.760
out and get a piece of software that's like a, it's not called ROM manager anymore. I

17:24.760 --> 17:30.160
have a link to it in the show notes. Let me see if I can pull it up for you. Multi-ROM,

17:30.160 --> 17:34.300
that's what it's called. It's called Multi-ROM. This is an app that you install from the Play

17:34.300 --> 17:38.280
Store once you've rooted your device, and I'll have a link to the Play Store in the

17:38.280 --> 17:42.440
show notes. Once you've rooted your device, you install this Multi-ROM and it essentially

17:42.440 --> 17:48.240
is a multi-boot menu. So when I power on now my Nexus 5, if I tap the screen, otherwise

17:48.240 --> 17:51.000
it just boots right into Android, but if I tap the screen when a little prompt comes

17:51.000 --> 17:55.800
up, I get a very nice gooey bootloader where it says, okay, do you want to load Ubuntu

17:55.800 --> 17:59.580
Touch? Do you want to load Firefox OS or do you want to load Android? And then whichever

17:59.580 --> 18:05.640
I choose, that's the OS it boots right into and it rocks. It's full native. It's like

18:05.640 --> 18:10.280
when you partition a PC and you install multiple operating systems and then load a bootloader.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.880
It's not running under emulation. It's not running under Android. It's truly Ubuntu

18:13.880 --> 18:20.520
Touch and truly Firefox OS on the machine on the Nexus 5. It's pretty awesome. It's

18:20.520 --> 18:23.420
pretty cool. It's a good way to play with these things and I think the Nexus 5 is going

18:23.420 --> 18:31.640
to make a killer rig to have because you have things like this Multi-ROM, which right now

18:31.640 --> 18:39.360
only supports the Nexus 5, 4, and 7 series, 2012 and 2013 Nexus 7. The chat room is asking

18:39.360 --> 18:44.000
about space. I have a 32GB Nexus 5, so I think maybe I've got a little more room to play

18:44.000 --> 18:52.360
with than if you had a 16GB. Yeah. But it's pretty good now. I'll tell you, I don't know

18:52.360 --> 18:57.400
if I could live in either one of them. That's why I really like that Android's still there.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.560
You have to wipe the phone too because when you root it and set this up, it wipes all

19:00.560 --> 19:05.440
of them and then you do a recovery and reload Android and you have to set it all up. It

19:05.440 --> 19:10.760
means reconfiguring all my damn apps and all that stuff. But you do it once and then you

19:10.760 --> 19:15.760
have the triple boot forever, which is kind of cool. Well, here's the $10,000 question.

19:15.760 --> 19:19.360
We've got the whole, obviously there's probably some sort of a battery bug or maybe it's not

19:19.360 --> 19:24.360
fully optimized in the Ubuntu OS for the phone and that's fine. But for Firefox OS, what

19:24.360 --> 19:28.080
was your feelings on that? Because that has me curious, especially on the lower spec phones.

19:28.080 --> 19:34.340
Yeah, man. Firefox OS, it's funny in some ways how much is like Android in the way you

19:34.340 --> 19:38.920
pull down the notification tray and there's all your notifications and the way the icons

19:38.920 --> 19:43.740
kind of look and stuff. And it's got some funky stuff too about it. Like the bottom

19:43.740 --> 19:48.920
row has like a home button, but it's not a home icon. It's a worldwide web browser generic

19:48.920 --> 19:56.040
icon. And you push that and it takes you back to the homepage. I was hoping it would perform

19:56.040 --> 20:00.480
better on the Nexus 5 because I've played with it on lower end hardware. And I kind

20:00.480 --> 20:07.000
of assumed perhaps the performance was because it was on low end hardware. And I think that

20:07.000 --> 20:13.200
was part of it, but it also I think is maybe it's just not totally optimized for my device.

20:13.200 --> 20:18.580
Like the camera doesn't work under Firefox OS and it doesn't detect my SIM card. Yeah.

20:18.580 --> 20:23.380
So it could be a driver problem. So I wasn't quite as enamored with it as I was expecting,

20:23.380 --> 20:27.840
but I think maybe if we keep updating it and keep tracking it. Honestly, between the two,

20:27.840 --> 20:31.600
Ubuntu Touch seems like it's in a better state on the Nexus 5. And that's not great. Like

20:31.600 --> 20:36.160
it crashed on me, right? It drained all my battery. So they're both a little ways off,

20:36.160 --> 20:40.300
but it's fun to play with. Interesting. I don't know. Maybe I'll do a video on it in

20:40.300 --> 20:44.480
the future if people are interested. Let me know guys. On the Linux Action Show subreddit,

20:44.480 --> 20:49.080
linuxactionshow.reddit.com. We'll have a thread for this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.080
Let me know if you guys are interested in getting more coverage. I don't really have

20:52.080 --> 20:55.240
a good sense if you guys care about this kind of stuff, but I know we have talked a lot

20:55.240 --> 20:59.240
about Firefox OS. We've talked obviously a lot about Ubuntu Touch. So it's kind of neat

20:59.240 --> 21:04.680
to have one device I can carry with me and play with those right now. So I think that'll

21:04.680 --> 21:08.240
help. I really appreciate like, oh, here's some screenshots of the multi-boot for those

21:08.240 --> 21:12.600
of you watching the video version. So when you boot up the phone, this is the interface

21:12.600 --> 21:16.880
you get. It says auto-boot, but you touch anywhere on the screen to interrupt the auto-boot.

21:16.880 --> 21:22.920
And then when you do that, you can choose your distro or, I'm sorry, I guess, ROM that

21:22.920 --> 21:26.600
you want to boot. And you can see in this case, you could load Tizen on there. You could

21:26.600 --> 21:31.120
even load different like CyanogenMod and different Android ROMs on there too. So it could also

21:31.120 --> 21:34.360
be a way to play with different Android ROMs. It doesn't have to be radically different

21:34.360 --> 21:38.400
operating systems. It's pretty neat. And I think it's another reason to get the Nexus

21:38.400 --> 21:42.920
5 too, because people are able to write that kind of stuff for it.

21:42.920 --> 21:43.920
They're cool.

21:43.920 --> 21:49.640
Yeah, man. Yeah, man. All right. So before we run, since we're doing an express edition,

21:49.640 --> 21:53.720
that way I can wrap up here and tear apart the audio and try to get things like the mumble

21:53.720 --> 21:57.960
room working and a couple other problems that we've currently band-aided over so that way

21:57.960 --> 22:02.440
we can get on air. But you feel like, hey, Chris, not enough show. Not enough show, brah.

22:02.440 --> 22:06.080
Well, then here's what I have for you, brah. Go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com and check

22:06.080 --> 22:13.280
out Tech Talk today. Episode 10 came out. Matt, do you remember an old piece of software

22:13.280 --> 22:17.400
called Pointcast from like the late 90s?

22:17.400 --> 22:18.400
Very vaguely.

22:18.400 --> 22:23.720
The push technology that was going to change the web because the web was too hard to use

22:23.720 --> 22:28.440
and the web was too slow to download multimedia, so you had to do it in batch processing. Well,

22:28.440 --> 22:32.400
because we were having so many problems this morning, I did a retro tech edition of Tech

22:32.400 --> 22:36.600
Talk today and we looked back at Pointcast and the technology that almost shaped the

22:36.600 --> 22:41.160
future of the internet but then petered out and those who bet big and lost. We covered

22:41.160 --> 22:45.580
that on Tech Talk today. And of course, of course, go check out the first two episodes

22:45.580 --> 22:49.200
of How To Linux. Getting that off the ground right now. We'll have more information on

22:49.200 --> 22:52.760
that show very soon as well. So two shows you can go check out right now if there's

22:52.760 --> 22:56.080
not enough show. And I'm sorry that we did have to cut it short, but we do have these

22:56.080 --> 23:00.960
problems. I want to get fixed that way. By the time it's like getting towards TechSnap

23:00.960 --> 23:06.160
and Linux Action Show, hopefully we'll have everything all ironed out. All right, Matt.

23:06.160 --> 23:09.960
Well, heck, guess what? That's it right there. We're going to wrap it up. We're all done.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.560
That was a quick and easy one, huh? Quick and easy.

23:12.560 --> 23:17.440
Yeah, I thought maybe we'd have to bail and do it on Thursday, but I think this worked

23:17.440 --> 23:21.840
out okay. This worked out quite nicely. Now, I do want to encourage all of you to join

23:21.840 --> 23:26.480
us on Sunday over at jblive.tv at 10 a.m. Pacific for the Linux Action Show. You can

23:26.480 --> 23:31.000
go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get all of our live show times. And don't

23:31.000 --> 23:33.760
forget, when you join us live, you get to bang suggests. So chat room, last chance to

23:33.760 --> 23:36.960
get your title suggestions in there. All right, Matt. Well, have a great week. I'll see you

23:36.960 --> 23:37.960
on Sunday, okay?

23:37.960 --> 23:38.960
You too. See you then.

23:38.960 --> 23:42.840
Bye, everybody. Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged. See

23:42.840 --> 24:10.120
you right back here next Tuesday.
