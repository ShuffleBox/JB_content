WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.720
I present to you over at github the fastest website ever ultra fast single TCP packet

00:07.720 --> 00:13.360
audio-visual experience yeah that's right it's a web server and website that

00:13.360 --> 00:19.080
just sends you one packet you can try it at HTTP packet city all right

00:19.080 --> 00:24.200
apparently it's an actual audio-visual experience yeah well they did say yeah

00:24.200 --> 00:31.560
they even have room for 120 bytes of ad space and a single packet that's pretty

00:31.560 --> 00:34.840
impressive that's just some high-quality music yeah I'm gonna mute that right now

00:34.840 --> 00:40.560
because we do not need that let's look at the source though no to be fair that

00:40.560 --> 00:43.280
that music is probably copyrighted and we'll get us pulled down that will

00:43.280 --> 00:50.600
probably get us pulled down yeah not again beard yeah okay this is a pretty

00:50.600 --> 00:55.960
small yeah that's a tiny amount of source code with no formatting with no

00:55.960 --> 00:58.760
formatting whatsoever yeah so you can go you can go check it out they got a

00:58.760 --> 01:03.280
client here index dot HTML just a tiny little thing and I think they just have

01:03.280 --> 01:08.040
a tiny little C web server that sends this to you so if you know your clients

01:08.040 --> 01:12.560
don't want a bloated website who does these days just send them to the fastest

01:12.560 --> 01:17.600
website ever see what they should do is they should figure out how to also send

01:17.600 --> 01:22.840
you a copy of the thing to run it yourself in that same packet oh yeah

01:22.840 --> 01:27.720
yeah that would be like a quine type thing but for a single packet web server

01:27.720 --> 01:33.680
you know getting all meta up in here I like that beard this is Linux unplugged

01:33.680 --> 01:48.680
episode 216 for September 26 2017

01:48.680 --> 01:53.760
welcome to the Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's definitely

01:53.760 --> 01:58.400
not jealous of Chris's awesome New York City adventure my name is Wes and I have

01:58.400 --> 02:03.400
a beard you sure do have a beard we have a great show coming up today we spent

02:03.400 --> 02:06.800
some time with our friends over at Microsoft we catch up with some of our

02:06.800 --> 02:11.480
favorite projects discuss some of the hard details of being a free and open

02:11.480 --> 02:16.000
source software maintainer and get a little quantum with the latest Firefox

02:16.000 --> 02:21.720
quantum beta but before we do all that I think we have at least one friend to

02:21.720 --> 02:25.320
join us we should say hello to and time appropriate screening to our wonderful

02:25.320 --> 02:35.000
mumble room time appropriate greetings oh wonderful to have you mr. mech oh how

02:35.000 --> 02:38.880
are you doing beard thanks for joining me Chris is away he's out in NYC I am

02:38.880 --> 02:44.200
stuffed full of five guys oh yes I am a fan of five guys in my mouth five guys

02:44.200 --> 02:49.760
all up in that mouth yep with a side of fries yeah excellent well we can't be

02:49.760 --> 02:55.560
having as much as fun as Chris but we sure can make a show happen so I guess

02:55.560 --> 03:01.360
we pop over here talk about our first story today which is okay so on the

03:01.360 --> 03:05.080
previous episode we had quite the kerfuffle we were talking about mr. Jim

03:05.080 --> 03:10.400
Zemlin of the Linux Foundation and his his choice of computing hardware device

03:10.400 --> 03:14.840
that was a little contentious right because he was caught not using Linux

03:14.840 --> 03:18.640
how could that be how could that be so I just thought and you know maybe it's a

03:18.640 --> 03:22.520
little fun we poked some fun at the other side Bill Gates now uses an

03:22.520 --> 03:27.080
Android phone at least according to the verge I mean to be fair to him he has

03:27.080 --> 03:31.240
more an excuse because nobody makes Windows phones anymore yeah really yeah

03:31.240 --> 03:35.080
it starts out but you know Windows phone has been dead for a good year now and

03:35.080 --> 03:39.520
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has decided it's also time to move on in the

03:39.520 --> 03:43.120
interview with Fox News Sunday Gates reveals he's now using an Android phone

03:43.120 --> 03:46.840
well Gates doesn't reveal the exact model he does note that it has a lot of

03:46.840 --> 03:51.040
Microsoft software on it which could suggest it's the special Microsoft

03:51.040 --> 03:56.280
edition Samsung Galaxy s8 but who knows I guess he's still not interested in

03:56.280 --> 04:03.360
iPhone though he famously banned iPhones and iPods at home in the past that's

04:03.360 --> 04:07.200
kind of funny I wonder too like is it just because do you think you'd use

04:07.200 --> 04:10.280
Android just because there's probably is it easier to get Microsoft software on

04:10.280 --> 04:15.040
there versus iOS yeah probably but it would you know I don't know who's a

04:15.040 --> 04:18.480
bigger competitor to Microsoft these days Apple or Google I mean Google's

04:18.480 --> 04:23.440
going after their cloud business a lot more yeah but of course Apple has been

04:23.440 --> 04:27.200
there a long time I mean not arrival almost feels wrong clearly they're

04:27.200 --> 04:30.440
beating them in the you know in the mobile world but for a long time Apple

04:30.440 --> 04:33.440
was the underdog does Bill Gates even care anymore no I don't think he does

04:33.440 --> 04:36.600
right that's a lot of it too it's like it just doesn't matter and that's really

04:36.600 --> 04:39.440
what I was trying to get he's just a dude now that happens to also be a

04:39.440 --> 04:42.920
billionaire that people write articles about yeah you know still owns a bunch

04:42.920 --> 04:50.040
of Microsoft but hey that's just what happens okay so moving on then to our

04:50.040 --> 04:54.920
next story today which is an update to lineage OS change lock number 14 brings

04:54.920 --> 04:59.120
burn in protection and changes to privacy guard audio effects and more so

04:59.120 --> 05:04.320
lineage is this something you would ever be interested in mr. beard not really

05:04.320 --> 05:08.880
yeah what do you run on your phone is it just stock yeah it's whatever Samsung

05:08.880 --> 05:15.000
sends me yeah just trust into the old same song well that's fine well I mean

05:15.000 --> 05:18.800
with the Samsung phones if you if you root them breaks the the knocks

05:18.800 --> 05:24.120
protection yeah right yeah so that's no good anyway the lineage OS team has just

05:24.120 --> 05:26.800
released a new change like summarize the most important changes made to the

05:26.800 --> 05:31.200
popular third-party custom ROM in recent weeks originally made every two weeks

05:31.200 --> 05:34.560
change logs now being you know only only when the team teams necessary so I

05:34.560 --> 05:39.280
thought hey this might mean something interesting has changed so there's now

05:39.280 --> 05:42.360
the lineage updater app has been rewritten from the ground up to fix

05:42.360 --> 05:46.080
some long-standing issues doesn't seem very exciting but I think that's one

05:46.080 --> 05:49.440
thing that like if you're gonna have a successful long-running ROM you actually

05:49.440 --> 05:52.200
need to be able to get updates because I can't like the number of times I've had

05:52.200 --> 05:55.440
to install something and then like a few months later been like I just have to

05:55.440 --> 05:59.300
like reflash this phone I don't want to lose everything what what is the

05:59.300 --> 06:04.480
procedure here so if you have like a really official good non buggy simple to

06:04.480 --> 06:07.360
use updating tool I think that goes a long way so is the the update you're

06:07.360 --> 06:14.360
like a utility that you're on your PC or is it an app on the phone you know I'm

06:14.360 --> 06:18.420
not actually sure I imagine it's something you run on your your computer

06:18.420 --> 06:25.380
but let's see let's find out I'm not actually sure cuz uh if we're on the

06:25.380 --> 06:31.100
phone that'd be that would be nice yeah that would be here we go at your change

06:31.100 --> 06:38.640
devices yeah okay it looks like it's a flask app here so that would suggest to

06:38.640 --> 06:41.440
me that you run it on your on your device and then interact with it and then

06:41.440 --> 06:44.840
you know it will then flash your phone or provide the update interesting yeah

06:44.840 --> 06:47.960
you're right if it was right on the phone that would be like first party

06:47.960 --> 06:53.120
level of yep just boom this is official just open the app it's like you got an

06:53.120 --> 06:58.180
update and it downloads it and you reboot and flashes that'd be great so

06:58.180 --> 07:03.760
also they now have burnin protection so if you have an AMOLED screen that you

07:03.760 --> 07:07.480
know a fancy AMOLED screen that you would prefer not to get ruined they now

07:07.480 --> 07:10.280
have burnin protection which shifts the position of the status bar and

07:10.280 --> 07:14.020
navigation bar icons every few minutes you may think you're going crazy if you

07:14.020 --> 07:17.500
haven't read about this you know you just like is my phone my phone changing

07:17.500 --> 07:23.320
on me I didn't do that but hopefully that prevents burnin in those areas so I

07:23.320 --> 07:28.280
guess they actually move at 3 DP horizontally 1 DP vertically subtle

07:28.280 --> 07:31.840
little change and really what was highlighted here is September security

07:31.840 --> 07:35.280
patches have been included and fixes that blue born vulnerability we were

07:35.280 --> 07:39.560
talking about last week as well so that's another good point if you do have

07:39.560 --> 07:43.120
one of these ROMs boom update yourself you've got these patches you don't have

07:43.120 --> 07:45.960
to wait for Google to roll them up into some update that takes however long or

07:45.960 --> 07:51.000
Samsung to do so which will clearly take forever yeah that's really I mean it's

07:51.000 --> 07:55.320
beginning to a point where I don't I'm not that interested I have not even

07:55.320 --> 08:00.960
unlocked my pixel so I which is weird for me I only got Android 7 a month or

08:00.960 --> 08:07.080
two ago hmm which is like many months behind yeah so you're not gonna get Oreo

08:07.080 --> 08:14.160
until 2019 yeah 2019 yikes well then maybe for your next phone consider

08:14.160 --> 08:17.800
something that can run lineage maybe yeah I know somehow I don't see that

08:17.800 --> 08:22.480
happening but you can think about it okay so if you aren't going to do that

08:22.480 --> 08:27.040
you are probably still concerned about security turns out Google is concerned

08:27.040 --> 08:32.100
along with you Google has extending security support for Nexus 6p and Nexus

08:32.100 --> 08:37.040
5x devices until November 2018 this has been one of the more maligned things

08:37.040 --> 08:40.520
about Google's devices I was seeing a you know comparison thread that the

08:40.520 --> 08:44.440
iPhone 5s is still supported and how long that's been compared to the the

08:44.440 --> 08:49.420
support that that Google generally has for their devices so it's nice to see

08:49.420 --> 08:51.840
that maybe maybe you're getting a little more than you expected or a little more

08:51.840 --> 08:55.800
than they've actually promised so since Android is the most used operating

08:55.800 --> 08:59.200
system in the world it also stands to reason that it's also the most attacked

08:59.200 --> 09:01.920
the only way to prevent security problems on mobile devices is to keep

09:01.920 --> 09:06.440
them updated amen see the text that program and this is exactly what Google

09:06.440 --> 09:12.360
is doing up until now the support for both the Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x was until

09:12.360 --> 09:17.480
September 2018 but has been extended until November 2018 adding two more

09:17.480 --> 09:21.400
months this can only be a good thing for Nexus users who can hold on to their

09:21.400 --> 09:26.360
devices a little bit longer fancy scroll in there that's my mistake

09:26.360 --> 09:30.960
don't mistake but you should not mistake security support with software support

09:30.960 --> 09:34.200
it's important to keep in mind that security support only refers to patches

09:34.200 --> 09:40.280
and nothing else software support ended in September 2017 so it's ending right

09:40.280 --> 09:43.440
now which means that no new version of the OS will be provided after this date

09:43.440 --> 09:47.560
that definitely limits the usability but there's a lot of people I think of like

09:47.560 --> 09:51.920
my mom as an example where she doesn't need the latest and greatest you know

09:51.920 --> 09:55.000
like software updates necessarily she just needs a phone that will just keep

09:55.000 --> 09:58.840
working run the same apps that she's had for the past however many months but I

09:58.840 --> 10:01.960
would worry if she was on a phone that was no longer getting updates so that's

10:01.960 --> 10:08.960
nice to see yeah it doesn't really change the like haphazard path haphazard

10:08.960 --> 10:14.800
pace of change hardware change deprecation ending lifespans of phones

10:14.800 --> 10:19.400
after like two years but maybe there's a happy medium somewhere in here well

10:19.400 --> 10:24.520
isn't that um that one project that they announced supposed to help with a lot of

10:24.520 --> 10:30.320
that yes it is man I'm blanking on that come on beard what's it called hey I

10:30.320 --> 10:34.400
covered the project part you get the other part yeah you remember that it's a

10:34.400 --> 10:38.040
project yeah that's true though it does sound like there are some you know

10:38.040 --> 10:41.320
upstream changes going on in Android that will help refine some of that make

10:41.320 --> 10:45.240
it easier for people to have those have all the weirdness of the actual system

10:45.240 --> 10:48.520
on a chip confined at one software layer and then be able to build on top of that

10:48.520 --> 10:53.120
so hopefully this will not be a problem that we see indefinitely in the future

10:53.120 --> 10:58.360
still though I was a little I'm glad to see this I know a lot of people who

10:58.360 --> 11:01.480
still have the 6p several people who have gotten the pixel and kind of missed

11:01.480 --> 11:06.160
their 6p we'll see pixel 2 I guess will be coming out before too long but it's

11:06.160 --> 11:09.760
nice to see Google at least kind of makes you wonder if they're extending it

11:09.760 --> 11:13.680
because of that that new stuff maybe has made it easier for them to extend it oh

11:13.680 --> 11:19.040
that's an interesting idea yeah maybe now it's yeah provides less less you

11:19.040 --> 11:23.080
know lack of momentum less breaking to their bill yeah because you can update

11:23.080 --> 11:27.520
the the OS without also having to update the the baseband and the firmwares and

11:27.520 --> 11:32.120
all that yeah yeah as they end here also we have to remember that Google launched

11:32.120 --> 11:36.320
the Nexus 6p and Nexus 5x back in September 2015 wow that seems like that

11:36.320 --> 11:39.640
ain't a long time ago this means that support for them will end three years

11:39.640 --> 11:44.600
later that's not too bad at all I've done the the math West that is two years

11:44.600 --> 11:52.960
ago yeah I suppose that's not that long but that's a long time in the world yeah

11:52.960 --> 11:57.960
exactly okay so speaking of phones let's just jump right on over to our first

11:57.960 --> 12:03.040
sponsor today and that is our friends over at ting what is ting ting is

12:03.040 --> 12:08.160
mobile that makes sense it's I mean it really it's a smarter way to do mobile

12:08.160 --> 12:13.600
so go to linux.ting.com that will get you a $25 service credit and is my

12:13.600 --> 12:18.400
mobile service provider is it yeah yeah you know what it's mine too I don't

12:18.400 --> 12:21.960
believe it it's true and my parents mobile service provider and just about

12:21.960 --> 12:25.200
anyone I can convince to switch it's a little weird right because you're like

12:25.200 --> 12:29.640
hey can I talk to you about your cell phone plan I don't work for a phone

12:29.640 --> 12:33.240
company but this can save you money but I yeah exactly it's like to that point

12:33.240 --> 12:35.560
where it's like I'm not trying to pressure you I'm just letting you know

12:35.560 --> 12:40.080
that there is a company that does things differently it really is smarter because

12:40.080 --> 12:44.760
okay so it just starts at six dollars a month right so each line six dollars a

12:44.760 --> 12:48.440
month one line two lines but the studio has like three or four lines something

12:48.440 --> 12:52.280
like that yeah even if you have another another phone plan just pick up a sim

12:52.280 --> 12:55.240
and screw around with it on the side for a bit to see if you like it yeah right

12:55.240 --> 12:59.040
that's like one one hamburger a month less and then you have a you have a

12:59.040 --> 13:02.120
phone line you can use as much data as you want yeah sure you pay for it but

13:02.120 --> 13:06.360
you're free to do so which is awesome so head on over to the rates page they'll

13:06.360 --> 13:10.280
make it super easy for you to figure out what you might be paying per month as I

13:10.280 --> 13:13.220
said lines are just six dollars each then you just add up whatever bucket

13:13.220 --> 13:17.440
you fall in so let's say you don't use any minutes because hey why would you no

13:17.440 --> 13:21.200
one wants to call me and so I don't have that problem and you probably don't use

13:21.200 --> 13:25.840
text messages because SMS is really just the worst thing ever so don't use those

13:25.840 --> 13:30.760
either we're still at a whopping six dollars but now you get to data this is

13:30.760 --> 13:34.280
one of the best things about Ting because data is just data tethering yeah

13:34.280 --> 13:38.400
you can tether that's included you want to use a whole bunch of data that's fine

13:38.400 --> 13:41.500
Ting doesn't try to like nickel and dime you with these complicated plans

13:41.500 --> 13:46.400
overage charges none of that just pay for what you use so you know if you just

13:46.400 --> 13:52.520
use a gig a month now we're at $22 maybe use two gigs a month $26 how reasonable

13:52.520 --> 13:57.920
is that seriously $26 a month two gigs of data one phone that's perfect that's

13:57.920 --> 14:02.800
affordable that's why I love Ting plus okay CDMA and GSM you can bring your own

14:02.800 --> 14:06.200
device so maybe you all have got up you know got one of those supported lineage

14:06.200 --> 14:10.400
phones Ting is a perfect place to bring it whether CDMA is better GSM is better

14:10.400 --> 14:13.440
maybe you have a fancy one with like dual sims or you want to switch them out

14:13.440 --> 14:17.800
depending on where you go all kinds of options plus they have an incredible

14:17.800 --> 14:26.120
dashboard great apps and real live human customer service so Linux dot ting

14:26.120 --> 14:32.360
dot-com there you can save a bunch of money on your cell phone plan and thank

14:32.360 --> 14:38.880
Ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program thanks Ting okay so moving on

14:38.880 --> 14:44.440
more Linux to talk about always more Linux can we just like skip the Linux

14:44.440 --> 14:49.880
yeah okay what are you uh I don't know I guess we're going back on I guess we're

14:49.880 --> 14:52.600
okay we're just gonna fall back to Linux anyone else doesn't want to talk about

14:52.600 --> 14:55.760
Linux then I guess I'll be outnumbered I don't have Chris here to back me up

14:55.760 --> 15:01.400
today yeah that's okay though okay so here's something we've talked about

15:01.400 --> 15:08.280
more than a few times on the show and that is the top icons plus extension you

15:08.280 --> 15:11.680
mean the one that the gnome project recently recommended that people use if

15:11.680 --> 15:15.680
they want that stuff yes that that is the one looks like according to an issue

15:15.680 --> 15:22.320
over on their github page development might be pausing or stopping so hey y'all

15:22.320 --> 15:24.880
I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to take some distance with the development of

15:24.880 --> 15:29.880
this extension it's motivated by a couple things one I have not used the

15:29.880 --> 15:33.240
extension myself recently I use less and less extensions that use it and among

15:33.240 --> 15:38.040
them none of them breaks or loses functionality without this to the gnome

15:38.040 --> 15:41.720
project does not give a shit about it and made it public they don't even point

15:41.720 --> 15:45.400
to this extension but to an outdated unmaintained one besides Ubuntu after

15:45.400 --> 15:48.520
making a survey also moves on with its own extension all right we're getting

15:48.520 --> 15:53.120
dramatic here anyway the API is dying it won't be dropped in future GTK updates

15:53.120 --> 15:57.720
documentation is sparse and the development requires considerable effort

15:57.720 --> 16:01.200
also the API is buggy and incomplete so it's impossible to make a reliable

16:01.200 --> 16:07.600
extension or really enhance it of course it will never be fixed for top icons plus

16:07.600 --> 16:12.160
then became a magnet for claims that would be better to be addressed by the

16:12.160 --> 16:16.360
gnome project people fail to understand that the extension depends on an API and

16:16.360 --> 16:21.200
is not capable slash intended to fix the gnome shell service it's extremely

16:21.200 --> 16:26.720
exhausting and five the gnome extension website is awful as there is almost no

16:26.720 --> 16:29.320
maintainer there and validation takes sometimes weeks

16:29.320 --> 16:34.600
meanwhile I get issues from disgruntled users so I came to the conclusion being

16:34.600 --> 16:38.160
also very busy with my job and my life that the hassle is no longer worth it

16:38.160 --> 16:41.760
especially when it requires considerable effort because of the sparse

16:41.760 --> 16:47.480
documentation status icons are dead with gnome shell move on and enjoy gnome

16:47.480 --> 16:54.640
shell or switch your desktop environment oh okay those are some strong words over

16:54.640 --> 16:59.440
there oh I kind of agree with them though like that's kind of what gnome

16:59.440 --> 17:04.560
said that is kind of what gnome said yeah you're right I mean it is and that's

17:04.560 --> 17:08.120
just one of those you know like love it or hate it that's kind of the way gnome

17:08.120 --> 17:12.560
has been going these days right like they stick to their guns they have a set of

17:12.560 --> 17:15.440
principles and philosophy whether or not you agree with it or not or even think

17:15.440 --> 17:19.720
it's consistent they that's that's the way it's a benevolent or not so

17:19.720 --> 17:24.480
benevolent dictator project yes dictator framework Adam I don't know what to call

17:24.480 --> 17:32.720
it but so do you know much I usually use made okay yeah so this was not an

17:32.720 --> 17:36.720
extension that you yourself was we're availing of no Chris uses it though I

17:36.720 --> 17:40.640
think yeah definitely so I wonder what he's going to think about this no no

17:40.640 --> 17:43.560
well right now he's on budget so it doesn't matter yeah right now he's on

17:43.560 --> 17:48.520
budget the budget craze is sweeping the studio and I think the world mmm

17:48.520 --> 17:51.600
probably yeah probably that's that's what seems to happen when those solace

17:51.600 --> 17:55.280
guys get ahold of something and enough enough that I key went full-time yeah

17:55.280 --> 17:59.840
full-time which is incredible it's nice to see that having listened to some of

17:59.840 --> 18:02.520
that coverage do it does seem like you know it could be pain if you if your

18:02.520 --> 18:08.120
development has diverged from what GTK intends it becomes increasingly it

18:08.120 --> 18:13.200
becomes increasingly and increasingly difficult so I definitely have sympathy

18:13.200 --> 18:16.680
with that you know that line of reasoning and you got it especially in

18:16.680 --> 18:20.880
the open source world you just got to do what you can do don't stress out too

18:20.880 --> 18:23.680
much about it and if he's not using it it'd be really hard to maintain

18:23.680 --> 18:26.480
something that much work if you were not actually using it yourself any longer

18:26.480 --> 18:31.960
and the fact that they that he said that the buggy or the API is a buggy and

18:31.960 --> 18:37.240
incomplete kind of probably speaks to how much gnome cares about things that

18:37.240 --> 18:42.800
aren't things they care about exactly yes exactly okay well I don't know if

18:42.800 --> 18:46.200
anyone in the mumbroom wants to chime in but now is the time before we move on to

18:46.200 --> 18:51.200
our next story unless you have something else to add mr. beard no well it's but

18:51.200 --> 18:54.720
she considered to be a lightweight to desktop because I have a rest free

18:54.720 --> 19:00.640
pipeline here around and I would try I would like to try some different

19:00.640 --> 19:06.240
decimal budgie is more lightweight than gnome as far as I can tell at least I

19:06.240 --> 19:12.160
would that seems to be easy yeah well true but I'm not sure where it where it

19:12.160 --> 19:15.640
fits in relevance to the other ones I'd say probably somewhere on the level of

19:15.640 --> 19:22.320
main yeah okay so it would be worth a try and is it it's fully compatible with

19:22.320 --> 19:26.600
weight on the cast I think so yeah I believe so I don't know that I don't

19:26.600 --> 19:31.240
think I've actually run it under Wayland yet on any of my systems but if not I'm

19:31.240 --> 19:35.040
sure that I key guy will come yell at us about it yeah that's the fastest way to

19:35.040 --> 19:38.440
find out or everybody else will go yelling at him oh yeah you're right oh

19:38.440 --> 19:43.800
even better okay that's just fine then by the way I would have a last comment

19:43.800 --> 19:51.000
on the lineage discussion you had a selfish has taken the first steps to do

19:51.000 --> 19:58.280
to to base to have a base on lineage OS until now they had Cyanogen always for

19:58.280 --> 20:04.120
the community ports and so they started to have the first steps to port to port

20:04.120 --> 20:09.240
it to lineage which would be a great improvement because right now the

20:09.240 --> 20:17.880
newest Android base for selfish always is Cyanogen modes 13 so probably there

20:17.880 --> 20:23.520
is a way to go further now and take the energy space yeah I mean it seems like

20:23.520 --> 20:25.840
there's a lot of momentum there so that makes like that seems like it might be a

20:25.840 --> 20:29.960
good choice as something to base yourself on you well it seems to be the

20:29.960 --> 20:34.920
only option now it does kind of seem to be the only option now yeah very true

20:34.920 --> 20:42.480
excellent okay so moving on talking about only options in a way that's not

20:42.480 --> 20:48.640
the button here we go announcing the X free kwin project no it's not X free 86

20:48.640 --> 20:55.520
as you might be thinking but it is kwin running without X support so Martin

20:55.520 --> 20:58.440
writes over the last few weeks I've contradicted concentrated my work on

20:58.440 --> 21:04.040
kwin on what I call the X free kwin project the idea is to be able to start

21:04.040 --> 21:08.840
kwin wayland without X Wayland support well most of the changes required for

21:08.840 --> 21:13.160
it are already in plasma 511 not everything got ready in time but now

21:13.160 --> 21:16.680
everything is under review on fabricator so it's a good point in time to talk

21:16.680 --> 21:22.560
about the project so why an X free kwin you might ask you might wonder why we'd

21:22.560 --> 21:26.780
spend time on this after all we need to provide support for X Wayland anyway to

21:26.780 --> 21:30.160
be able to support legacy applications which are not yet on Wayland yeah I'm

21:30.160 --> 21:33.200
sure a ton of us who are using Wayland are using a lot of X Wayland under the

21:33.200 --> 21:35.480
hood so what's the advantage of a normal

21:35.480 --> 21:40.840
session one needs to start X Wayland anyway well one aspect is that it shows

21:40.840 --> 21:44.440
that our porting efforts to Wayland are finished over the last few years I've

21:44.440 --> 21:48.720
tried to start kwin without X Wayland support for a few times just to find

21:48.720 --> 21:54.120
areas which are not yet ported by being able to run kwin without X 11 support we

21:54.120 --> 21:57.480
know that everything's ported or at least does not hard depend on X 11

21:57.480 --> 22:00.980
anymore hey okay that kind of makes sense yeah we can actually run it all

22:00.980 --> 22:05.520
without this stuff running so hey guys it's good another aspect is obviously

22:05.520 --> 22:09.360
plasma mobile does not really need X Wayland and so it doesn't make much

22:09.360 --> 22:12.920
sense to have a build that includes it and especially like lib hybrid systems

22:12.920 --> 22:16.820
they won't have open GL there so it just it just doesn't make sense so by not

22:16.820 --> 22:22.240
requiring X Wayland we can reduce our runtime and memory costs speaking of

22:22.240 --> 22:26.360
runtime cost not requiring X 11 means that we don't have to wait for X Wayland

22:26.360 --> 22:31.280
during kwin startup instead X Wayland can be started in parallel this means k

22:31.280 --> 22:37.720
win and the complete plasma session starts just a little bit faster and most

22:37.720 --> 22:42.360
important this is an important prerequisite to be able to handle a

22:42.360 --> 22:47.120
crashing X Wayland so far when X Wayland crashed kwin terminated gracefully as k

22:47.120 --> 22:51.080
win depends on X 11 the hope is that when X Wayland crashes we can just

22:51.080 --> 22:55.220
restart it and keep the session running yeah okay that seems like a totally

22:55.220 --> 22:59.760
legit reason to do that I don't want X buggy old X Wayland bringing down my

22:59.760 --> 23:06.280
beautiful pristine new Wayland session makes sense yeah definitely so how it

23:06.280 --> 23:10.800
was done the general idea behind getting here is that the code that isn't loaded

23:10.800 --> 23:15.360
can't interfere kwin uses platform plugins for the various platforms kwin

23:15.360 --> 23:19.360
can run on there's also a platform plug-in for kwin slash X 11 so code

23:19.360 --> 23:23.560
which is only required in that case can be moved into the platform plug-in as

23:23.560 --> 23:27.200
kwin slash Wayland does not load this plug-in we're certain that the code will

23:27.200 --> 23:31.760
not be loaded and thus cannot interfere interesting but how do you find all that

23:31.760 --> 23:35.840
code after all kwin's code base is about a hundred and fifty thousand lines of

23:35.840 --> 23:41.280
code yeah I would just ctrl F and search for X just search for X yeah that'll do

23:41.280 --> 23:47.240
it right X and then separately search for just 11 that will help too or org

23:47.240 --> 23:53.000
or yeah definitely won't find that X 11 is the really really old code really old

23:53.000 --> 23:57.960
code X 12 that's where it's at yeah good help is I guess they have a they have a

23:57.960 --> 24:01.920
pretty good CI system which performs code coverage so kwin's tests mostly are

24:01.920 --> 24:05.640
based on kwin slash Wayland so an area which just does not have any test

24:05.640 --> 24:08.920
coverage is a good candidate for being X 11 specific boy doesn't that say a lot

24:08.920 --> 24:12.320
right there that's why they want to protect it from the bugginess because

24:12.320 --> 24:17.560
it's not tested I mean I'm sure that that's that's totally possible so

24:17.560 --> 24:19.880
anyway like they kind of looked at those things by looking at these areas it was

24:19.880 --> 24:23.120
possible to find patterns which also helped to find more usages so you know

24:23.120 --> 24:27.840
kind of profile oh here's where we have to keep adding X 11 support that's

24:27.840 --> 24:31.360
probably refactored in the same way in other parts of the code base there's

24:31.360 --> 24:35.840
also kwin's internal X 11 API so they were able to find a bunch of those

24:35.840 --> 24:40.480
patterns root those out and then exercise it so now they're able to you

24:40.480 --> 24:44.840
know control it exercise I like that yeah right I mean it's all about it's all

24:44.840 --> 24:48.480
about violence mostly that's how it works when you work with these old code

24:48.480 --> 24:53.520
bases just got them got them got them right out put them back together we have

24:53.520 --> 24:58.480
the technology beard like we just totally do okay so being able to start

24:58.480 --> 25:02.600
and run X kwin slash Wayland without X 11 support is of course only the start

25:02.600 --> 25:06.080
more changes will be required for example the delay loading X Wayland

25:06.080 --> 25:10.040
until an app elation tries to connect to it another area to try to get X win

25:10.040 --> 25:13.120
compiled without excellent support and to move everything required for X Wayland

25:13.120 --> 25:17.200
into a plug-in so be a larger project as it will require much more code movement

25:17.200 --> 25:21.280
and added further abstractions to some areas of kwin but this could be a nice

25:21.280 --> 25:25.480
Google summer of code project as a fast step for especially plus mobile and the

25:25.480 --> 25:28.780
purism Libra and phone which we've talked about there's an if-def now

25:28.780 --> 25:33.600
around the X 11 code so that might be another path forward but the his motive

25:33.600 --> 25:36.580
Martin's real motivation here is handling a crashing X Wayland so I think that

25:36.580 --> 25:39.840
makes sense and it's cool to see I really appreciate these blog posts just

25:39.840 --> 25:44.080
because well I don't always run kwin like I don't have a plasma system going

25:44.080 --> 25:51.040
at the moment it really is a heck of a I mean compositor everything that it is

25:51.040 --> 25:56.560
now right I mean a Wayland desktop yeah so it's cool to get to see this sort of

25:56.560 --> 25:59.280
stuff that's one of the things that's so wonderful about open source is like sure

25:59.280 --> 26:02.000
I remember the old days like Microsoft would have like a tech post about

26:02.000 --> 26:04.920
something they were doing but you didn't get to go look at it whereas we can go

26:04.920 --> 26:08.400
like look at the commits that have changed this I'm probably not going to

26:08.400 --> 26:14.820
on this one because it sounds like it's kind of gross but the fact that we can

26:14.820 --> 26:18.120
that we can learn from it and we get to see the motivation I think that's pretty

26:18.120 --> 26:24.280
awesome what about you are you a plasma plasma fan I actually prefer plasma over

26:24.280 --> 26:30.080
any other desktop I just don't run it because I still find the the settings to

26:30.080 --> 26:35.520
be too over complicated yeah you know I've had that problem myself I actually

26:35.520 --> 26:39.880
I like it a lot and I just but it just had a couple years ago I had it tuned

26:39.880 --> 26:45.240
really nicely it was just perfect I loved it but I that time I did not do a

26:45.240 --> 26:48.120
great job of like remembering what those settings were so the last couple of

26:48.120 --> 26:51.040
times I've used it for like a week or two here and there but I've been in the

26:51.040 --> 26:54.000
same boat where it's like I just don't have the time right now to sit down and

26:54.000 --> 26:58.000
make this perfect when you have to go to three completely separate sections of

26:58.000 --> 27:05.360
your settings to to theme your your your stuff then I think it's a little over

27:05.360 --> 27:09.600
complicated yeah what is this Windows 10 especially since some of them like to

27:09.600 --> 27:14.040
override other ones so you end up going circles you'll never win yeah circular

27:14.040 --> 27:19.440
dependencies that's that's what we need here well okay so maybe that makes you

27:19.440 --> 27:23.200
pretty frustrated beard maybe frustrated enough to just leave this whole planet

27:23.200 --> 27:28.720
behind and join a new spaceborne Linux supercomputer it's now started running

27:28.720 --> 27:34.320
in space achieves one teraflop I'm sure it's pretty warm I can just like lay on

27:34.320 --> 27:38.320
it yeah you can just snuggle up with the supercomputer out there and you won't die

27:38.320 --> 27:42.200
at all yeah it'll be fine okay so we'd heard about this a little bit before I

27:42.200 --> 27:48.120
you were mentioning that that yeah I think this is the same HP supercomputers

27:48.120 --> 27:51.320
that was launched on a SpaceX rocket that recovered a couple weeks ago yes

27:51.320 --> 27:56.440
about one month ago the HPE their new name of course come on it's HPE now they

27:56.440 --> 28:00.520
split Rekai HP Enterprise yeah uh-huh it's serious stuff anyway their

28:00.520 --> 28:03.800
spaceborne computer was launched into the space using the SpaceX Dragon

28:03.800 --> 28:07.960
spacecraft this beast was launched as a result of a partnership between HPE and

28:07.960 --> 28:11.880
NASA to find out how high-performance computers perform in space now the

28:11.880 --> 28:15.240
supercomputer is fully installed and operational on the International Space

28:15.240 --> 28:19.080
Station the performance experiment will be carried out for about a year which is

28:19.080 --> 28:22.160
roughly the time will take for spacecraft to travel to Mars at the

28:22.160 --> 28:24.960
moment lots of calculations for space research projects are carried out on

28:24.960 --> 28:30.360
earth but this brings in an unavoidable factor of latency yeah I imagine your SSH

28:30.360 --> 28:34.320
sessions aren't great when you're going from space to the earth and back huh

28:34.320 --> 28:39.240
yeah we've got some photos here I'm sure it's better than like the the

28:39.240 --> 28:44.000
SSH session to like the satellites we got way out far out looking at planets

28:44.000 --> 28:47.920
enter a keystroke wait six minutes and then check that's when you use a mosh

28:47.920 --> 28:52.280
that's when you use moss yeah okay finally a situation that makes sense

28:52.280 --> 28:57.040
that's great actually I do kind of like mosh so here's a cool picture it looks

28:57.040 --> 29:00.040
like it's getting installed here the hardware which is being talked about

29:00.040 --> 29:05.360
here is an Apollo 40 server with a high-speed HPC interconnect running you

29:05.360 --> 29:11.440
guessed it Windows ME no it's Linux it's a Linux beard come on now it has a

29:11.440 --> 29:14.800
water-cooled enclosure and additional software to take care of the

29:14.800 --> 29:19.000
environmental constraints yeah sounds like this is also a closet gaming box

29:19.000 --> 29:22.440
for the astronauts on onboard that's what I'm picking up here it must have

29:22.440 --> 29:28.800
upgraded from their solaris supercomputer that's great can you

29:28.800 --> 29:31.920
imagine putting together a computer in space though it's hard enough are it's

29:31.920 --> 29:35.320
hard enough yeah your screws are floating all over the place oh that

29:35.320 --> 29:38.840
could be good in some ways yeah you just kind of like set it there over the screw

29:38.840 --> 29:42.720
in the sky yeah maybe you have to I guess I guess magnets would be even more

29:42.720 --> 29:45.840
helpful but be careful don't let the magnet float too close to the computer

29:45.840 --> 29:50.360
now the magnetic screw trays is pretty good too on earth that's true yeah so I

29:50.360 --> 29:53.600
guess it's not so different yeah I will take that challenge though so if anyone

29:53.600 --> 29:57.280
wants to send me pay for a new computer and send me to space to assemble it

29:57.280 --> 30:00.320
sounds like it would make great content just gonna just leaving that there you

30:00.320 --> 30:05.640
should pitch to what's his name Richard Branson yeah okay ask if you can build a

30:05.640 --> 30:08.720
computer on the first version of galactic flight I'm gonna just write

30:08.720 --> 30:13.880
this down right now following up on that after the show anyway this is devices

30:13.880 --> 30:16.720
the first high-performance commercial off-the-shelf computer to run one

30:16.720 --> 30:21.120
teraflop at the ISS for those who don't know one teraflop is 1 trillion

30:21.120 --> 30:25.360
calculations per second which is 30 times faster than a laptop okay that

30:25.360 --> 30:29.280
really doesn't sound that impressive now that I mean like 30 they could have just

30:29.280 --> 30:34.080
taken 30 laptops up there I probably already have like yeah it's really hard

30:34.080 --> 30:37.520
to do like Beowulf cluster yeah that's true and then what if one person's

30:37.520 --> 30:40.600
playing steam and it's really tying up the whole cluster all them Ethernet

30:40.600 --> 30:44.080
cables in space oh yeah that's true you'll get caught up in them that makes

30:44.080 --> 30:49.320
sense okay so according to their technology officer engineers are ready

30:49.320 --> 30:53.080
to launch the multi node high-performance linpack benchmark test

30:53.080 --> 30:55.920
this test will determine the number of multiplication system can produce per

30:55.920 --> 30:59.760
second so now that it's all been doing over the coming months the engineers

30:59.760 --> 31:04.640
will study this installation and its performance so that's kind of cool not

31:04.640 --> 31:07.400
that often you get to hear about Linux in space like we all know it's there

31:07.400 --> 31:10.920
obviously but it's just like do you remember seeing all those pictures from

31:10.920 --> 31:13.920
years ago of you know we still had the space shuttle and seeing astronauts on

31:13.920 --> 31:17.640
there when they got like their ex Windows XP thinkpads running on the

31:17.640 --> 31:21.800
space station yeah so hopefully now they'll have some it does seem like it

31:21.800 --> 31:24.360
would be pretty handy if you're doing it you know they do so much science up

31:24.360 --> 31:27.160
there that just to have your own little supercomputer that you have right there

31:27.160 --> 31:31.600
to go do your workloads on so I guess the supercomputer is inside the the

31:31.600 --> 31:36.160
pressurized area of the place that's what it looked like yeah or at least the

31:36.160 --> 31:39.000
front the way they talked about I thought they were gonna do something

31:39.000 --> 31:43.400
crazy like just have it sit in the vacuum of space to keep it cool yeah I

31:43.400 --> 31:46.120
thought that too like it was just you know it would just be floating maybe

31:46.120 --> 31:51.040
alongside or in a similar orbit I guess they didn't have a way to deal with

31:51.040 --> 31:56.080
potential like any amounts of condensation at all oh yeah okay

31:56.080 --> 32:00.360
interesting and then I guess you have to devise the right kind of like would you

32:00.360 --> 32:04.840
use like a like laser beam or infrared or other type of like line-of-sight

32:04.840 --> 32:09.760
communication to it now you just poke a hole for Ethernet cable and then you

32:09.760 --> 32:13.320
tether it on to that yeah mm-hmm maybe like and then a couple extra ones just

32:13.320 --> 32:17.480
for security sake and then one that's actually the data line yep hmm no that

32:17.480 --> 32:23.160
is an interesting idea there Beardsley how'd you get so smart mm-hmm

32:23.160 --> 32:28.880
who knows okay so I know I've heard that you like video games fact or fiction

32:28.880 --> 32:35.000
hmm well the video games are fiction true that I like them as fact okay how

32:35.000 --> 32:40.320
do you feel about Atari and how do you feel about a new gaming system from

32:40.320 --> 32:47.640
Atari called you've guessed it the Atari box so it's an Atari branded PC I'm

32:47.640 --> 32:53.520
guessing yeah take a look that seems completely pointless yeah doesn't it but

32:53.520 --> 32:58.840
guess what it's Linux based hmm so it will use an AMD customized processor

32:58.840 --> 33:03.720
with the Radeon graphics technology this means a proper CPU so not like an arm

33:03.720 --> 33:07.880
chip that's nice it will run Linux but the they will be providing a customized

33:07.880 --> 33:13.000
interface as it's mainly aimed at using it like a console on a TV even so they

33:13.000 --> 33:17.240
say it will give a full PC experience for the TV so we're back to like

33:17.240 --> 33:21.720
whatever web web TV is that what it was what I'm hearing is that Atari couldn't

33:21.720 --> 33:25.920
make a deal with Steam to make another steam is exactly what it sounds like but

33:25.920 --> 33:30.080
you will apparently get full access to the underlying Linux system so it might

33:30.080 --> 33:33.800
be possible to have you know buy this and then put your favorite OS on it why

33:33.800 --> 33:37.680
you would do that I don't really know maybe it'll be maybe that's subsidized

33:37.680 --> 33:42.560
somehow so it'll be cheap like Xboxes of old I'm not sure I wonder if the the

33:42.560 --> 33:48.800
modules for the the custom PC chip are publicly available I wonder that too

33:48.800 --> 33:52.520
yeah it sounds like it's going to remain quite open as they say you will be able

33:52.520 --> 33:56.660
to access game purchased from other content platforms as long as it's Linux

33:56.660 --> 34:00.640
compatible so it sounds like installing Steam might just be possible so this

34:00.640 --> 34:04.200
really is like a weird side loaded steam you're gonna get it's just gonna be like

34:04.200 --> 34:09.320
Ubuntu with an Atari wallpaper yeah Ubuntu Atari wallpaper and Steam

34:09.320 --> 34:12.440
pre-installed and then Steam pre-installed yes and then maybe a

34:12.440 --> 34:16.580
couple other game platforms oh we'll come preloaded with classic Atari games

34:16.580 --> 34:20.280
and even some current titles from a range of different studios it'll be

34:20.280 --> 34:23.120
interesting to see if these current titles are games already on Linux or are

34:23.120 --> 34:26.720
they gonna have some actually ported games especially for this I'm gonna

34:26.720 --> 34:29.600
guess they're already on Linux I would bet so I don't know how much they're

34:29.600 --> 34:35.480
actually gonna try to outlay on this yeah so it will launch on IndieGoGo soon

34:35.480 --> 34:38.720
they say this fall it might seem strange for a bigger company to go with

34:38.720 --> 34:42.920
crowdfunding yeah it is kind of strange I didn't know Atari is broke yeah but

34:42.920 --> 34:45.320
they say this because they want the community to be part of the launch

34:45.320 --> 34:48.760
Rekind not because they're broke yeah they want part of the community's money

34:48.760 --> 34:52.160
to be part of the launch yeah you're probably right though honestly though

34:52.160 --> 34:55.560
it's mainly so there's less risk involved for them but because Atari is

34:55.560 --> 34:59.640
broke because Atari is broke but maybe it's a good way for them to gauge real

34:59.640 --> 35:04.380
interest I don't know as for the proper launch it'll be late spring 2018 with a

35:04.380 --> 35:08.080
price aimed between 250 and 300 dollars depending on the addition and

35:08.080 --> 35:13.800
configuration Atari is still reeling from the the whole ET cartridge fiasco

35:13.800 --> 35:21.760
back in the 80s yeah you're right about that okay but what do you think about it

35:21.760 --> 35:27.600
this is apparently not a render it's a real unit with real wood involved the

35:27.600 --> 35:34.400
wood edition it just seems like another steam machine with less everything yeah

35:34.400 --> 35:37.220
and I haven't heard like this hasn't talked much about like what is the

35:37.220 --> 35:40.220
controller gonna look like will there be controller are people putting keyboard

35:40.220 --> 35:44.080
and mouse hooking up to this is it just USB ports on the back like it doesn't

35:44.080 --> 35:50.760
really excite me because it's a it's just a slightly more proprietary PC that

35:50.760 --> 35:57.560
happens to support Linux but so don't all non proprietary PCs yeah okay that's

35:57.560 --> 36:02.300
fair that's fair yeah no that's about now if they announce that it's some

36:02.300 --> 36:06.120
absurdly cheap price and it has good performance maybe I'll change your mind

36:06.120 --> 36:11.560
but I doubt it yeah I'm with you okay well I guess I do have something that

36:11.560 --> 36:15.280
you might get excited about and that's our next sponsor today which is our

36:15.280 --> 36:20.320
friends over a digital ocean it's hard not to get excited but yeah exactly

36:20.320 --> 36:24.840
have you heard about their new spaces a beautifully simple and scalable object

36:24.840 --> 36:28.880
storage service hmm yeah so if you listen to if you listen to tech stamp

36:28.880 --> 36:31.760
you hear about all kinds of people always getting hacked because they leave

36:31.760 --> 36:35.400
their s3 buckets open to the public don't make that mistake just hop on over

36:35.400 --> 36:39.840
digital ocean they've just launched basis you can get in on it I think

36:39.840 --> 36:44.280
you'll find the price is very competitive and kick your bucket get a

36:44.280 --> 36:49.640
space get a space yeah exactly and I mean digital ocean makes it so simple

36:49.640 --> 36:53.920
you don't have to fight through the always confusing AWS API's you can use

36:53.920 --> 36:59.360
digital oceans amazing super simple API the well not to mention the the web

36:59.360 --> 37:05.040
interface for AWS is so confusing convoluted especially compared to

37:05.040 --> 37:08.040
digital ocean where you just click click and you're done or like have you ever

37:08.040 --> 37:12.320
tried to like find out what you might expect to pay for your your AWS oh no

37:12.320 --> 37:17.080
you find out what you expect to pay when you get the bill for what you pay yeah

37:17.080 --> 37:21.280
so head on over to digital oceans pricing page and you'll see the

37:21.280 --> 37:24.960
difference because like look at this oh look oh yeah it's just the prices per

37:24.960 --> 37:29.340
month or per hour whatever you want and you can switch between them you can

37:29.340 --> 37:33.840
switch between them yeah which is also like a huge feature so I like this

37:33.840 --> 37:38.880
$10 a month one because you get one gig of memory one CPU 30 gigs of SSD disk

37:38.880 --> 37:43.480
and it's all SSD des over digital ocean and two terabytes of transfer and this

37:43.480 --> 37:47.880
transfer is not this is not your grandma's transfer this is not 56k it's

37:47.880 --> 37:52.880
not some single bod modem this is like 40 gigabit e straight to that KVM

37:52.880 --> 37:58.480
hypervisor go run like a couple apt-get updates go pull down some files you will

37:58.480 --> 38:02.400
see that this is real transfer I use it all the time when I'm like trying to

38:02.400 --> 38:06.160
connect to a server in Europe and my ISP just doesn't seem to have great peering

38:06.160 --> 38:09.680
across the Atlantic but digital ocean sure does that's because they have data

38:09.680 --> 38:14.800
centers all over places like London and Frankfurt and then a bunch here NYC San

38:14.800 --> 38:17.940
Fran and they keep expanding so there's almost certainly one near you if you

38:17.940 --> 38:20.760
have two droplets in the same data center you can get private networking

38:20.760 --> 38:26.080
between them you can use our promo code do unplugged that will get you a $10

38:26.080 --> 38:29.120
credit so that will pay for your first month or you know you probably don't

38:29.120 --> 38:32.840
really need that whopping droplet so just just downsize just downsize five

38:32.840 --> 38:38.640
dollars a month or seven tenths of a cent per hour isn't that insane it's

38:38.640 --> 38:43.240
insane so it's so cheap run an IRC bouncer run a server of any kind start

38:43.240 --> 38:46.920
hosting your own website you can use their attachable block storage so if you

38:46.920 --> 38:49.960
need to do some backups up there plus they've got stuff like monitoring load

38:49.960 --> 38:54.480
balancing cloud firewalls all the all the bells and whistles you've come to

38:54.480 --> 38:58.000
expect from those big-name competitors for way better prices way simpler

38:58.000 --> 39:03.360
interface and way better API go to digital digital ocean comm our promo

39:03.360 --> 39:07.600
code do unplugged go get yourself a droplet and join the cool kids club so

39:07.600 --> 39:15.640
easy to remember that we forgot it that is exactly how easy do unplugged okay so

39:15.640 --> 39:19.640
talking about talking about do and therefore we had to talk about AWS

39:19.640 --> 39:25.520
because they're just you know AWS some yeah they're just exactly up exactly

39:25.520 --> 39:31.600
mm-hmm you're just trying to get them to sponsor you aren't you beard yeah right

39:31.600 --> 39:34.840
so they're a big competitor another big competitor in that space is our friends

39:34.840 --> 39:40.720
over at Microsoft I don't know if this is relevant or not but Microsoft and

39:40.720 --> 39:45.120
Facebook have just teamed up and laid a hundred and sixty terabit per second

39:45.120 --> 39:49.840
cable four thousand one hundred miles across the Atlantic I love that the

39:49.840 --> 39:52.960
verge feels it's necessary to tell you how many videos you can stream on that

39:52.960 --> 39:58.600
but that's 71 million HD videos at the same time so that's HD that's only 1080p

39:58.600 --> 40:03.160
yeah 1080p man I mean yeah might even be 720 if they're like skimping on you why

40:03.160 --> 40:06.400
aren't they telling us like 4k Netflix streaming I don't know yeah that's

40:06.400 --> 40:10.560
what's relevant for the future anyway Microsoft Facebook and the telecoms

40:10.560 --> 40:15.400
infrastructure company tell Telxius have announced the completion of the highest

40:15.400 --> 40:19.960
capacity subsea cable to ever cross the Atlantic Ocean the cables type of wolf

40:19.960 --> 40:23.400
transmitting 160 terabits of data per second that's terabits so that's an

40:23.400 --> 40:28.240
important important point there and is 16 million times faster than an average

40:28.240 --> 40:31.720
home internet connection ouch it's trying to make us feel bad now Microsoft

40:31.720 --> 40:37.920
we all get it you have gigabit apparently the cable be operational by

40:37.920 --> 40:44.000
early 2018 called the Maria which is Spanish for tide the 4,000 mile long

40:44.000 --> 40:48.440
subsea cable lies 17,000 feet below the ocean surface and extends between

40:48.440 --> 40:53.720
Virginia Beach Virginia and the city of Bilbo in Spain it also stretches

40:53.720 --> 40:57.920
route south of most existing transatlantic cables because of this

40:57.920 --> 41:00.640
Microsoft says the cable provide resiliency for those living in the u.s.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.560
and Europe by safeguarding against natural disasters or other major events

41:03.560 --> 41:07.520
that might cause disruptions that's nice but where's our Pacific cable yeah where

41:07.520 --> 41:10.480
is that I want to have high-speed transfer to Singapore I'm trying to

41:10.480 --> 41:13.760
download some sushi right direct from Japan and it just doesn't fit over these

41:13.760 --> 41:20.320
low bandwidth pipes we've got I like my sushi okay don't judge me I guess it

41:20.320 --> 41:23.000
comes at a pretty critical time submarine cables in the Atlantic already

41:23.000 --> 41:27.520
carry 55% more data than trans-pacific routes ouch gosh well maybe that's

41:27.520 --> 41:30.960
okay you're not putting down the cables yeah we need more cables and 40% more

41:30.960 --> 41:33.840
data than between the US and Latin America there is no question that the

41:33.840 --> 41:37.360
demand for data flows across the Atlantic will continue to decrease I

41:37.360 --> 41:41.400
suppose there's a lot probably a lot of financial transactions and others oh yeah

41:41.400 --> 41:45.360
I wonder why it's so different in the Pacific for most of the route the cable

41:45.360 --> 41:49.080
made up of eight pairs of fiber optic cables enclosed by copper lays on the

41:49.080 --> 41:52.520
ocean floor some parts are buried to protect from shipping traffic usually in

41:52.520 --> 41:56.820
areas closer to the shore in a blog post Microsoft said the project was

41:56.820 --> 42:00.280
completed nearly three times faster than usual in under two years maybe it was

42:00.280 --> 42:04.080
even under budget who knows they are an open design which allow it to evolve as

42:04.080 --> 42:07.240
technology does and as the population of internet users around the world

42:07.240 --> 42:12.400
continues to increase so anyway I don't know what their exact like why they

42:12.400 --> 42:15.360
Facebook and them had to be involved are they going to get some sort of are they

42:15.360 --> 42:18.520
gonna get a bunch of this lease here are they immediately buying transit across

42:18.520 --> 42:23.400
this cable or ownership are getting data collection rights or they're just

42:23.400 --> 42:28.960
kidding yeah so if your connection goes across this cable it instantly has ads

42:28.960 --> 42:33.800
so just watch out for that but it is just really cool that this is something

42:33.800 --> 42:36.480
that we can do you know you like you don't we don't really get to talk much

42:36.480 --> 42:40.000
about these undersea cables but turns out a lot of the internet and backbone

42:40.000 --> 42:46.000
of it needs them and it boggles my mind like 17,000 feet and somehow from the

42:46.000 --> 42:51.160
surface we can just like lay giant cable on the on the bottom of the ocean I

42:51.160 --> 42:57.760
couldn't do that it's probably like titanium reinforced or something you're

42:57.760 --> 43:01.000
right probably probably titanium reinforced beard you just know

43:01.000 --> 43:06.840
everything well that way the the lobsters can't cut the cable I can't

43:06.840 --> 43:10.440
even with you I can't even with you we're moving on and I know this will

43:10.440 --> 43:15.120
make you upset so Microsoft ignite sequel server 2017 for Linux goes live

43:15.120 --> 43:21.040
you know or Windows if you want and then get this the preview Docker image has

43:21.040 --> 43:25.960
already been fetched two million times Microsoft's just like full-on hipster

43:25.960 --> 43:30.240
DevOps up in here I didn't realize that not only is sequel server popular what

43:30.240 --> 43:34.240
it's popular in the Linux not yet popular under Linux and despite everyone

43:34.240 --> 43:36.800
who likes to say you should never run a database and a container that you can

43:36.800 --> 43:38.960
have the Docker container obviously that's not for production I'm just

43:38.960 --> 43:42.720
kidding but it's interesting I mean I know Microsoft's on like a ton of work

43:42.720 --> 43:46.360
with Docker to make Docker on Windows work clearly they embrace it on the

43:46.360 --> 43:51.320
Linux side too so I guess yeah sequel server 2017 is now generally available

43:51.320 --> 43:54.680
today's release is a remarkable step in sequel service history because it's not

43:54.680 --> 43:57.720
just a release for Windows today makes the general availability of the sequel

43:57.720 --> 44:01.000
server for the Linux there's also a containerized version for deployment

44:01.000 --> 44:05.440
using Docker it was announced March of last year to widespread surprise yeah

44:05.440 --> 44:09.880
amen sequel server as they say here at ours

44:09.880 --> 44:13.280
technico sequel server is the kind of software that shifts Windows licenses

44:13.280 --> 44:17.440
people buy Windows Server for the express purpose of running sequel server

44:17.440 --> 44:20.880
supported to the Linux world is really forfeiting a huge amount of Windows

44:20.880 --> 44:25.720
server potential revenue Scott Guthrie executive vice president for cloud

44:25.720 --> 44:28.640
enterprise acknowledged that risk but felt that it was offset by the

44:28.640 --> 44:31.880
opportunity sequel server for Linux presented sequel server has a rich

44:31.880 --> 44:34.840
feature set and potential customers were telling Microsoft that they'd love to

44:34.840 --> 44:37.520
use it but they were Linux shops or were dependent on Docker and

44:37.520 --> 44:41.120
containerization as such being Windows only prevented sales to these customers

44:41.120 --> 44:45.880
so it really does kind of to me it feels like the organization of Microsoft is

44:45.880 --> 44:49.720
like really realizing that they have to like they can't just compete at this OS

44:49.720 --> 44:54.560
level anymore they can't let the OS drag back their other products so they have

44:54.560 --> 44:57.640
to they just have to make it available and you know sequel server is great I

44:57.640 --> 45:00.960
haven't used it a ton but I know a lot of people who really like it and find it

45:00.960 --> 45:06.200
sometimes the only acceptable alternative to Oracle database Postgres

45:06.200 --> 45:08.840
obviously has come a long way but sequel server has been like a dominant force in

45:08.840 --> 45:11.520
the industry for a long time and I'm sure there's a lot of people are like

45:11.520 --> 45:15.560
yes I can run it on Linux now and you wonder too is it just good for them to

45:15.560 --> 45:18.560
have more people familiar with it so that you know there's more devs who can

45:18.560 --> 45:22.600
use it there's more devs trained to use it well it might not mean that they have

45:22.600 --> 45:26.080
to buy Windows it might make it easier if they're already into the sequel

45:26.080 --> 45:28.720
server enterprise if Microsoft can be like hey here's your cheap Windows

45:28.720 --> 45:32.760
license or here's why it runs better under Windows I don't know that it does

45:32.760 --> 45:35.440
in fact in the early builds we'd seen some articles stating that it was

45:35.440 --> 45:39.560
running better under Linux than it did under Windows but maybe that's part of

45:39.560 --> 45:43.520
their play here bringing the Windows dependent software to Linux made use of

45:43.520 --> 45:47.120
a Microsoft research project named drawbridge that investigated new

45:47.120 --> 45:50.640
approaches to virtualization and software isolation it happened that

45:50.640 --> 45:53.680
this research work already aligned neatly with the way sequel server itself

45:53.680 --> 45:56.800
was was engineered so they were able to just kind of stack those two

45:56.800 --> 46:01.240
technologies together abstract away the host OS levels and make this work on

46:01.240 --> 46:05.840
Linux it's kind of wild like Microsoft's they might be better at Linux than

46:05.840 --> 46:08.640
Linux is now I don't know about how you feel about that

46:08.640 --> 46:12.040
well aren't they one of the top kernel contributors they're not I don't think

46:12.040 --> 46:15.120
they are in the current cycles they were for a while I think that was at a time

46:15.120 --> 46:19.040
when they were doing a lot of work to get like better hyper-v support and

46:19.040 --> 46:22.520
stuff for Azure but they certainly have you know they've certainly contributed

46:22.520 --> 46:29.360
to it so we'll see I'm not gonna use it but it does seem like it further cements

46:29.360 --> 46:33.280
Linux dominance in the server world

46:33.520 --> 46:38.200
okay so one more little Microsoft update here just our little Microsoft check-in

46:38.200 --> 46:42.560
in today's show because you know Microsoft loves Linux they love it so

46:42.560 --> 46:48.240
much canonical Microsoft have now teamed up to make an Azure tailored Linux

46:48.240 --> 46:54.480
kernel yeah that's right custom kernel customized by Microsoft actually this

46:54.480 --> 46:59.840
isn't too surprising Microsoft runs Gentoo Microsoft runs Gentoo yeah baby

46:59.840 --> 47:05.000
emerge world it kind of makes sense like there's already extensions you can do it

47:05.000 --> 47:08.160
for better you know better virtualization support pair of

47:08.160 --> 47:11.800
virtualization stuff on AWS so this basically adds a bunch of those options

47:11.800 --> 47:16.080
to the Azure world so canonical has announced that it is joining forces with

47:16.080 --> 47:20.080
the Microsoft Azure team to build an Azure tailored Linux curl for Ubuntu

47:20.080 --> 47:23.840
cloud images of Ubuntu 1604 the new kernel will receive the same level of

47:23.840 --> 47:26.840
support and security maintenance offered to supported kernels but is not yet

47:26.840 --> 47:29.920
compatible with the canonical live patch service if that doesn't matter to you

47:29.920 --> 47:33.000
then you'll be able to enjoy the improvements right along the kernel is

47:33.000 --> 47:36.800
provided by the Linux as your kernel package and here are the highlights from

47:36.800 --> 47:41.480
right from canonical infinite band and RDMA capability so you'll have more high

47:41.480 --> 47:45.440
performance networking options available to you full support for accelerated

47:45.440 --> 47:49.080
networking and Azure this is a huge one direct access to the PCI device provides

47:49.080 --> 47:52.200
gains and overall network performance offering the highest throughput and

47:52.200 --> 47:58.600
lowest latency for guests in Azure they have basically basically it's all of

47:58.600 --> 48:02.040
these sorts of things right to make your virtualization less expensive 18%

48:02.040 --> 48:06.600
reduction in kernel size hyper V socket capability and the very latest hyper V

48:06.600 --> 48:10.320
device drivers and feature support available so it will now be used by

48:10.320 --> 48:15.880
default if you spin up any Ubuntu 1604 LTS images on Azure but if you you can

48:15.880 --> 48:19.000
check just you name dash are that will show that has a dash Azure in the name

48:19.000 --> 48:22.520
if you don't want to use it you can install the regular stock kernel just

48:22.520 --> 48:27.080
fine you just won't get those performance increases so you can also

48:27.080 --> 48:31.000
still get support from canonical so really just business as usual but a

48:31.000 --> 48:34.360
little bit more better tailored for Azure so that makes sense to you got to

48:34.360 --> 48:37.320
be competitive it is interesting though like canonicals done they've been

48:37.320 --> 48:41.240
working a lot with Microsoft between running on Azure the Windows

48:41.240 --> 48:44.960
subsystem for Linux all that I'm sure they're not doing out of the kindness of

48:44.960 --> 48:49.640
their heart a little bit of money a little bit of money on the sides here

48:49.640 --> 48:54.080
yeah I know I see some speculation that maybe a bunch of wants to get wants to

48:54.080 --> 48:59.120
get bought by Microsoft I don't know if that's the case or not but is there a

48:59.120 --> 49:04.560
reason Microsoft wouldn't buy canonical I don't know all their stuff is Linux

49:04.560 --> 49:10.040
focus so yeah unless Microsoft really really loves Microsoft loves Linux and I

49:10.040 --> 49:14.640
think the real thing is Microsoft loves developers and Ubuntu has a lot of

49:14.640 --> 49:18.920
developers how many of those tutorials you know you see by default that are

49:18.920 --> 49:26.040
just boom right here right now okay so that's it for our Microsoft coverage

49:26.040 --> 49:33.360
today but so we do have a little update just in the world of like Microsoft

49:33.360 --> 49:38.560
loves next links is open source open source can be difficult so Rika are you

49:38.560 --> 49:45.920
familiar with caddy no okay so caddy every site on HTTPS caddy is the HTTP

49:45.920 --> 49:53.320
slash 2 which is the new version of HTTP it's a HTTP HTTP slash 2 web server with

49:53.320 --> 49:59.040
automatic HTTPS so it's like a modern modern open source web server

49:59.040 --> 50:04.200
lightweight recommended by experts it has secure defaults so unlike a lot of

50:04.200 --> 50:08.920
you know you can install engine X even or like old Apache and have to do a lot

50:08.920 --> 50:15.040
of work to get from like web 1.0 open everywhere port 82 I'm running a secure

50:15.040 --> 50:20.720
modern patch web server caddy aims to make that just like you start it up it'll

50:20.720 --> 50:24.000
serve your files it can integrate with let's encrypt to automatically get it

50:24.000 --> 50:29.640
HTTPS enabled it has secure ciphers enabled by default all that stuff and so

50:29.640 --> 50:35.600
it's been you know it's been praised by experts at usenix and NYU lug ACM all

50:35.600 --> 50:39.000
kinds of stuff it's free for personal use there's commercial licenses available

50:39.000 --> 50:42.240
and there's open source so you can go to their site caddy server comm you want to

50:42.240 --> 50:46.520
find out more about actually using it but we are here to talk about a recent

50:46.520 --> 50:53.840
blog post by Matt so this is titled the realities of being a FOSS maintainer

50:53.840 --> 50:57.040
authors note here this is a more intimate look into what it's like to be

50:57.040 --> 51:00.400
a maintainer of a popular open source software it's written by me personally

51:00.400 --> 51:04.080
and not as a representative of the company I'm going down on a limb here so

51:04.080 --> 51:09.800
try to be nice okay we'll try Matt don't worry so over the past few days I've

51:09.800 --> 51:13.680
been inundated with well over 1,000 comments tweets emails messages and even

51:13.680 --> 51:17.680
phone calls about Wednesday's announcement so what he's hearing is

51:17.680 --> 51:22.920
that they've announced caddy commercial licenses so they were pleased to unveil

51:22.920 --> 51:26.480
that we've been working digitally on fast past few months on caddy commercial

51:26.480 --> 51:29.320
licenses the change has decided to accommodate the needs of the growing

51:29.320 --> 51:31.920
caddy community and user base with commercial licenses were able to offer

51:31.920 --> 51:36.000
exclusive features and services that parts key to our business users that we

51:36.000 --> 51:38.720
couldn't do before while sustaining caddies open source

51:38.720 --> 51:41.880
development we're even starting today with one new service for our customers

51:41.880 --> 51:46.720
and more plan so you can read more about that if you want they have some like you

51:46.720 --> 51:50.200
know if you use caddy for personal academic or nonprofit purposes not much

51:50.200 --> 51:54.360
is different just a new response header that gives tribute to our sponsors it's

51:54.360 --> 51:59.960
one part that was contentious if you use or distribute official caddy binaries

51:59.960 --> 52:04.120
at work or as part of a product service you will need to a commercial license

52:04.120 --> 52:08.160
based on how many instances you want to run concurrently official binaries are

52:08.160 --> 52:11.960
produced by our build server I this website and get caddy comm with a commercial

52:11.960 --> 52:14.240
license you can use this website to seamlessly download official caddy

52:14.240 --> 52:18.400
builds blah blah blah if you automate installations or use direct download

52:18.400 --> 52:21.880
links the URL syntax is changing slightly so that's like it right they

52:21.880 --> 52:25.560
are now trying to like paywall basically there'll be a commercial license for

52:25.560 --> 52:28.920
some features and services and their limitations for how you can use the

52:28.920 --> 52:33.600
official binaries freemium freemium yeah totally so that's one you know that's a

52:33.600 --> 52:37.920
model we've seen before so anyway lots of feedback interestingly most of the

52:37.920 --> 52:41.320
positive reactions came from individuals who have met met me in person who are at

52:41.320 --> 52:45.520
least somewhat acquainted with me online whereas every one of the negative

52:45.520 --> 52:48.520
reactions stem from someone who has never met me or interacted with me in

52:48.520 --> 52:50.560
other words there was not a single person who responded negatively or

52:50.560 --> 52:54.880
unreasonably whom I knew or who could recall prior interactions with so if you

52:54.880 --> 52:57.520
ever find yourself in a similar situation look at this statistic it

52:57.520 --> 53:02.800
might give you some relief not everyone you know hates you okay so right after

53:02.800 --> 53:05.520
right after this announcement he went on a research lab to retreat the mountains

53:05.520 --> 53:09.240
had no internet connections so got some nice time away from the internet which

53:09.240 --> 53:13.640
is always nice Matt's back now I want to take a few minutes to respond personally

53:13.640 --> 53:18.360
and candidly about everything that's going on what he's learned what the

53:18.360 --> 53:23.880
reactions have been like and just kind of a reflection so announcement day he

53:23.880 --> 53:27.480
posted it on hacker news within nine minutes after someone had they posted on

53:27.480 --> 53:31.160
Twitter after it was tweeted it was right on hacker news right at the top

53:31.160 --> 53:37.040
the at that kind of that kind of makes sense right so it became very popular

53:37.040 --> 53:41.320
he talks about forks here too so forking is a normal part of open source it's

53:41.320 --> 53:44.080
allowed by the Apache license which is the license as long as you give

53:44.080 --> 53:48.440
attribution and state all changes when one fork started a spinoff project on

53:48.440 --> 53:51.760
Wednesday my co-founder Cory reminded me reminded them to remove the caddy name

53:51.760 --> 53:54.400
and logo from the repo to avoid confusion with the caddy brand that's

53:54.400 --> 53:57.320
also an important part of that spinoff was quick to change the name and leave

53:57.320 --> 53:59.840
attribution and within minutes the issue was resolved and closed

53:59.840 --> 54:04.120
unfortunately the response to this by spectators has largely been less than

54:04.120 --> 54:07.880
professional and I think is along with some other reactions I discussed below

54:07.880 --> 54:11.680
exposes a glaring community flaw in our open source community there was no

54:11.680 --> 54:14.800
hostility in Cory's comments nor those of the projects maintainer both Cory and

54:14.800 --> 54:18.280
the maintainer did the right things as has been seen so many times before

54:18.280 --> 54:22.600
toxicity festers in open source because it's all too common for forks to ground

54:22.600 --> 54:26.200
their motivation and enmity towards other projects this obviously isn't

54:26.200 --> 54:28.960
healthy and we hope that the open source community will figure out a better way

54:28.960 --> 54:34.800
to deal with negative sentiment than by creating new communities rooted in it so

54:34.800 --> 54:37.360
they also removed the header basically had a header that would send back

54:37.360 --> 54:41.080
thanking the sponsors of the server a lot of people just were like I don't

54:41.080 --> 54:44.560
want these weird headers on every response that I send out of my web

54:44.560 --> 54:48.960
server they say that although they did ask their sponsors about it before this

54:48.960 --> 54:52.560
is implemented they didn't get any response so add this to the list of

54:52.560 --> 54:55.000
things we're learning we'll do better over communicating with our sponsors in

54:55.000 --> 55:00.120
the future sorry I don't know what else to say about this I guess there was a

55:00.120 --> 55:05.200
lot of confusion as well around the EULA and the caddy binaries so really what at

55:05.200 --> 55:08.840
the end is the open source code of the software's

55:08.840 --> 55:12.800
licensed under Apache 2 and not under the end-user agreement so caddy is

55:12.800 --> 55:15.680
still open source we go to extra effort to provide you with convenient binaries

55:15.680 --> 55:18.560
customized just for you so the official binaries are licensed either for

55:18.560 --> 55:24.280
personal or commercial use under this EULA so you get like the commercial ones

55:24.280 --> 55:28.000
have like private plugin hosting and the future maybe some other features this is

55:28.000 --> 55:31.880
really something we've seen before the build server is also not going to be

55:31.880 --> 55:35.640
open source because it's just it only works for caddy and that's what they're

55:35.640 --> 55:40.280
using to produce these binaries so some reflections one phone call I received

55:40.280 --> 55:43.840
was from a friendly company it had associates associations with offering

55:43.840 --> 55:47.440
their support and congratulations for the bold move it was much appreciated

55:47.440 --> 55:51.680
I also have received dozens of tweets and DMs mostly from friends to those who

55:51.680 --> 55:54.840
took a side were supportive thank you you didn't have to and it helped us

55:54.840 --> 55:57.840
weather the storm from one human being struggling with the daily realities of

55:57.840 --> 56:02.920
life to another thank you yeah I can I can that's nice sentiment there well if

56:02.920 --> 56:06.240
you had criticisms of the change all of those were reasonable but none of them

56:06.240 --> 56:10.460
could quite been down what it was that made the changes wrong to quote one but

56:10.460 --> 56:13.760
the whole affair has made me extremely uneasy for a variety of reasons that are

56:13.760 --> 56:17.720
really hard to put a finger on the crux of the opposition even according the

56:17.720 --> 56:21.640
most well reasoned arguments was missing the best we could find is that was that

56:21.640 --> 56:24.280
a commercial license out of reach of small startups that are bootstrapping or

56:24.280 --> 56:27.440
don't have revenue yet we agree Cory and I are looking to a good way to handle

56:27.440 --> 56:30.400
this so for now we encourage some startups to simply contact us with their

56:30.400 --> 56:35.160
needs and ask about special pricing okay that's somewhat reasonable now we get to

56:35.160 --> 56:40.280
the bad some feedback read opinions and advice we received had good intentions

56:40.280 --> 56:43.080
but wasn't very well thought out or didn't have the necessary perspective of

56:43.080 --> 56:46.520
project owner or maintainer to hold any water here I address some of them

56:46.520 --> 56:50.640
candidly so why not offer a comprehensive support package instead we

56:50.640 --> 56:53.680
tried this nobody bought it why not offer an enterprise solution or

56:53.680 --> 56:56.560
consulting service we're two resource-constrained we could probably do it

56:56.560 --> 56:59.560
but that would stifle almost all caddy development as well as my graduate

56:59.560 --> 57:04.380
schooling and research so I have to pay to remove ads from my web server no your

57:04.380 --> 57:06.800
company is required to pay for commercial use of official pre-compiled

57:06.800 --> 57:10.720
pad caddy binaries not further removal of the caddy sponsors header you could

57:10.720 --> 57:13.880
do that on your own anyway because the source is still Apache licensed further

57:13.880 --> 57:17.000
our sponsors don't pay us for advertising the pay us for its ongoing development

57:17.000 --> 57:19.720
to make the web better to support our customers who benefit from good web

57:19.720 --> 57:23.520
servers and to keep caddy free for you to use the license frankly had nothing

57:23.520 --> 57:29.200
to do with the header limit the free features instead and things like but

57:29.200 --> 57:32.120
then I have to build from source to get what I want and yes that's the point

57:32.120 --> 57:35.600
welcome to open source I do find it ironic that the open source community is

57:35.600 --> 57:39.400
so irate about having to compile software from source to customize it the

57:39.400 --> 57:44.360
way they want so he kind of just goes through talks about a bunch of the you

57:44.360 --> 57:49.440
know a bunch of the problems just take donations then it really comes back to

57:49.440 --> 57:54.240
how do we support how do you want to support open source this is how he

57:54.240 --> 57:57.240
touches on this a little bit with the ugly I really don't want to focus on

57:57.240 --> 57:59.720
this but now it must be talked about I've been balling these things up for

57:59.720 --> 58:03.380
years I think the worst thing I saw this week was twofold the overwhelming

58:03.380 --> 58:07.400
illusion of entitlement and subtle emotional manipulation based on a

58:07.400 --> 58:12.320
misconception so there's like there's a lot more here it's a pretty long article

58:12.320 --> 58:15.800
of his really is just mapping very candid they kind of talk about more the

58:15.800 --> 58:18.800
pain here the emotional manipulation the entitlement that we're talking about

58:18.800 --> 58:24.240
but they end with it with one final note here just want to emphasize how great so

58:24.240 --> 58:27.600
many people have been several dozen individuals reached out over many

58:27.600 --> 58:32.360
mediums to express their appreciation and even congratulations thank you thank

58:32.360 --> 58:35.000
you for showing me the human side of an industry that is often dehumanized by

58:35.000 --> 58:39.160
long distances screens and texting we expected some pushback as usual but the

58:39.160 --> 58:44.160
extreme controversy this created was unforeseen sorry about that thank you to

58:44.160 --> 58:46.940
all who responded quickly but at least reasoned out their comments before

58:46.940 --> 58:50.320
writing them here's looking forward to what's next and we hope you'll be a

58:50.320 --> 58:54.680
part of it with me so that was that was heartfelt whether you agree or disagree

58:54.680 --> 58:59.400
whether you think that it's a good business model or not I think we should

58:59.400 --> 59:06.560
talk about that but it's interesting to see such a candid response we could talk

59:06.560 --> 59:09.320
about that a little bit before I do I just wanted to pop on over to the Linux

59:09.320 --> 59:12.040
subreddit where there's also a discussion going along that sounds like

59:12.040 --> 59:16.520
Synergy 2.0 is going closed source Synergy was one of those projects maybe

59:16.520 --> 59:20.120
you've used it beard I don't know yeah a lot of people have you know especially

59:20.120 --> 59:22.760
if you have a Windows or a Mac and you also have a Linux you want to share your

59:22.760 --> 59:26.600
mouse and keyboard between those systems really works pretty great or even just

59:26.600 --> 59:30.480
multiple Linux boxes or just multiple Linux boxes yeah I think for a long time

59:30.480 --> 59:35.080
now not forever but for the past couple years Synergy kind of had the same thing

59:35.080 --> 59:38.920
where you could pay and they would give you pre-compiled binaries but if you

59:38.920 --> 59:43.600
didn't you know you had to build it from source yourself some distributions still

59:43.600 --> 59:47.840
have it I think arch has it there's a couple other ones Debian maybe but you

59:47.840 --> 59:51.040
know and I don't I've actually built it as well not a big deal I think what was

59:51.040 --> 59:53.840
harder is like I don't know how to build that for Windows so it's a little more

59:53.840 --> 59:57.520
difficult I don't have a Windows build build chain installed that sort of thing

59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.600
it sounds like now for Synergy 2.0 they're removing some things from the

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.680
open source and the GUI will no longer be open source so if you want to pay and

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.720
support Synergy which if you use it I mean you definitely should consider

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:14.480
doing it sounds like the core will remain open source so you can still use

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.720
it it would probably be command line only you'll have to like write your

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:21.320
Synergy configuration file yourself I don't know I imagine this will still be

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.840
the same setup where you're gonna have to compile it yourself get Synergy core

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:29.520
check it out from github build it and then run it so there's definitely I

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.400
mean you can go check that out on reddit as well or the hacker news discussion

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.680
thread I'm sure we'll see some of the same elements that we just talked about

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.480
in the caddy post about entitlement about about changes there's one little

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.320
note though that there is a program called x2x which is apparently a pretty

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:49.280
decent alternative for X sessions who knows about Wayland though so I don't

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.840
know what are your what are your thoughts on this how do you stand are you the

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.480
type of person that doesn't want to ever pay for software do you do you know I

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.000
think currently pay for software I think if software is good it's worth paying

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:08.040
for yeah that's nice and simple yeah no I mean and it's like I can feel that too

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.680
because I think a lot of times things start open source check I'm scratching

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.680
my own itch or an itch I see in the community you start doing it things take

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:21.500
off like crazy like that's kind of what happened to caddy and then just like it

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.880
makes so much sense to me that you'll want to go like I want to go make that

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.720
my life like if you get so into this project you're spending so much time on

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.160
that you really want that to be the thing that you can work on day in and day

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:33.920
out or at least a part of that time you end up needing to have some sort of

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:40.120
revenue model and it's great when you can make that in a way that people seem

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:44.000
to like like support packages donations patreon's it seems like are pretty

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.800
popular in the open source community yeah but at the end of the day if you

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.760
like use and value this software it has to be whatever whatever is gonna work

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.160
both for you the users you the potential population that's going to be buying it

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.400
and for the actual maintainers and developers of it because they're gonna

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.360
have to spend all their time doing support and not be able to just you know

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.640
make the project better that might not be what's in everyone's best interest

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:11.840
and it depends on you know it's not everyone's red hat so may I jump in

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:18.480
absolutely so if I had a project that needs some of these premium features of

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:24.600
caddy I would probably jump on the caddy wedding as you said I'm ready to pay for

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:29.440
software if it's good otherwise if I have a basic project and all of a sudden

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.760
my project grows and I'm confronted to the situation that I have to pay for

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.360
per instance and so on maybe I would try to avoid this kind of software and it

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:43.840
would start with a software I know or because you're working as you said

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.960
you're working for a long time with a web server for example and if all of a

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.560
sudden you come to a point where you have to pay for instances if you launch

01:02:52.560 --> 01:03:00.120
your server then maybe it's not a good choice for me oh yeah no that's that's

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:05.480
fair but I appreciate that attitude of you know you're happy to pay for what

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:09.320
you use if you can but it may depend on what that you know what the distribution

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.800
model what the use of it how that looks in terms of like your actual

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:19.480
application workflows so that make that that makes a lot of sense

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:23.720
anything else you'd like to chime in there Mr. Minimac thank you for joining

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:31.240
us today we certainly appreciate you thanks okay so if you are now super

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.240
thrilled by all the possibilities of open source software and not so open

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:38.320
source but you know between Microsoft support between all the great projects

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.560
that exist for Linux Linux is a better platform than other to use so if you

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.800
want to become a part of it our last sponsor tonight is probably the best

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:50.320
possible way that is our friends over at Linux Academy head on over to Linux

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.160
Academy comm slash unplugged there and you will find just about the best

01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.320
resource possible on the web to learn about Linux so you can just you'll go

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.480
there just sign up what are you gonna get when you sign up well you're gonna

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.460
find this is not one of those sites that will teach you just about anything right

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.880
that's crazy now this is a site that will teach you about Linux and related

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.640
technologies you don't have to worry about hey am I gonna learn how to do

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.240
underwater basket weaving crochet any of that no they don't do that because

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:22.200
they're Linux experts and that's why all the features that they have show so like

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.280
one thing I use all the time nuggets I love those nuggets not only are they

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.960
delicious fried golden and tasty but they're like little tiny morsels of easy

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.760
to plan around time that just teaches you like one I mean some of them are

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.920
kind of big some of them are pretty small but you just get like one solid

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.280
new skill or command-line tool or you know whatever that concept is and the

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.080
way Linux Academy does it it makes it like they have they make it super easy

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.400
just but you know schedule and budget your time they tell you right up front

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:53.040
how long these things are gonna take and it's all customized to the OS that you

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.000
need so whether you're trying to learn CentOS for some reason maybe you've been

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.160
listening to Noah way too much or you're using Ubuntu like a sane person it

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.320
doesn't matter they're gonna customize the courseware automatically for you

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.720
which is awesome you have unlimited access to the courses they've got six

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.680
different cloud servers hands-on labs and exercises in-depth certification

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:16.920
training that's one of the best parts right there is like if you need to go

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:20.000
get a certificate sign up for Linux Academy they have great courses to help

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.080
prepare you for it they have real mentors and stuff that you can talk to

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.040
like humans and get help on your projects plus it's stacked full of JB

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:31.200
community members and they've got like team options too so you know if you have

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.120
a training budget at work Linux Academy is a great option managers can sign up

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.200
for it sign up whole teams it makes it really easy to track people you know

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.960
make sure that people are doing their courses see how far they've gone verify

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.120
that they are learning the skills that you're you know paying for that to be

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:49.400
used so whether you're big or small next Academy is a great option check out

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:53.840
their courses because they have like a ton of stuff AWS Google Cloud they've

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.720
got a ton of the Red Hat tests Linux professional Institute exams on here

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.840
maybe you want to learn OpenStack turns out it's super complicated maybe you

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.960
want to learn about Azure because you've just been so hyped up about our awesome

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.680
Microsoft coverage here on the Linux unplugged show or you just want to learn

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.000
all about DevOps so you can become a certified Jenkins engineer a Nagios

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.960
certified professional or take puppet 204 system administration using puppet it

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:21.840
really has become one of the go-to trusted places on the internet something

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:25.000
you can put on your resume they even have you know an easy way for you to have a

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.800
personal page that will show your accomplishments so if you are looking

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.080
for a job Linux Academy can be one of your best partners so head on over to

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:38.640
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and they can get started join us over in the

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:44.440
awesome Linux Academy community it sure is a lot of fun and you can learn a lot

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.800
of things about Linux I know Chris talks about a lot but when you will teach

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:51.120
yourself Linux sometimes you miss like random commands there's just so many in

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.800
core utils and others that like it's nice to sometimes go through like a

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.360
really structured course and you're like oh nice refresher that's how I do that

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:03.520
yeah exactly ah so talking about oldies and goodies here

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:12.000
introducing Firefox quantum it's now two times faster on the speedometer 2.0

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.960
benchmark I don't know what that benchmark is but that sounds really

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.760
freaking fast I don't know about you beard sounds like a JavaScript benchmark

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:22.440
maybe yeah it does so start your engines Firefox quantum lands in beta developer

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:27.040
edition engines are important both in cars and in browsers I don't know if you

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:31.200
know about that but that's why we're so revved up Mozilla writes because we're

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:36.200
releasing the beta of a whole new Firefox the version number 57 can't

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.800
really convey the magnitude of the changes we've made not since they copied

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.960
Chrome's crazy version in any way and how much faster this new Firefox is

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.960
that's why we're calling it Firefox quantum last October they announced

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.080
project quantum an effort to create a next-generation engine for modern

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:55.520
computers by leveraging technology from the servo research project which is the

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.480
project that partially helped create rust it has uses rust and is there a

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:03.320
next-generation browser so now we're finally seeing some developments of that

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:08.320
the R&D arm pays off since then the engineering team has been relentless in

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.480
their focus on making Firefox incredibly fast so there's already been

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:15.120
a ton of you know Firefox improvements we've talked about that a little bit

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:19.200
things like those containers speed improvements I remember Chris and I both

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.040
installing Firefox 55 and being pretty impressed with how much faster it was so

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.920
you know they're trying to run for example we've transformed Firefox to run

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.720
using multiple processes trying to strike just the right balance between

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.720
speed and memory usage plus they've got new things like web VR and web assembly

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:38.200
trying to make you know games other heavy what should be desktop apps but

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:42.320
now run in the web browser which I can only assume is good for Linux in the

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:47.160
long run Firefox quantum is also a big leap forward in that it's much faster on

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:50.220
many top websites so just like browsing your favorites I can think probably like

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:54.480
heavy fit websites like Facebook and other things is a way that you can

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.440
notice that and it turns out you can measure Firefox quantum speed too so

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.840
they're kind of obsessed with this data driven approach maybe you've heard of it

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.880
but you can go check out speedometer 2.0 which is a still in development

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.440
benchmark that simulates modern web application results vary based on the

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.480
computer and the apps that you're actively using but one thing that's

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.920
relatively consistent is that Firefox quantum is about two times faster than

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.080
Firefox of a year ago wow all right that's actually that's that's pretty

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.480
actually significant I think so take your own we can make your own

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.040
comparisons go try it out this is just the beta release but if you care about

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.240
this if you want Firefox to be better or you just are a big Firefox user you can

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:43.680
go check it out they even have a little video here oh come on Chrome that's so

01:09:43.680 --> 01:10:02.720
slow happy Firefox quantum music

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:21.800
yeah all right so uh it's not like a it's not a blowout but I would say it

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:30.880
certainly seems pretty competitive with Chrome these days so there you go

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.000
Firefox quantum I don't know about that name I mean quantum is a fun words and

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.880
all I don't know that I mean quantum doesn't really mean fast I don't really

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:43.760
know well well when they speed it up enough they can call it a Firefox

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:49.160
quantum leap oh that's definitely where they're going and I think Scott Bakula

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.240
will be there up on stage to help announce that when it happens so we can

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:56.120
look forward to that anyway we have a couple more links about Firefox I

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.000
figured we'd round out the show today with Firefox coverage honestly I've been

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.360
using a lot of Firefox at work Chrome has all of my personal stuff and I

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:07.120
didn't really feel like making a separate profile profile just for like

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:12.080
work stuff so I was like I'll just have a separate browser for a long time you

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.200
know it's just like stock Firefox from up on 216 that wasn't really cutting it

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.440
I was used to a lot of niceties from Chrome but once I installed it's actually

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.320
really easy I just downloaded the tar from Firefox extracted it under slash

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:28.600
opt now it self updates super easy to sideload it's kind of it's kind of

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.240
awesome there's a lot of nice features I've definitely noticed the process the

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.120
multiple process improvement there's still some like UX changes between

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.880
Chrome and Firefox that get me like I really like that Chrome has the

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:43.080
duplicate tab functionality that comes up helpful way more often than I would

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.200
have ever thought there's probably a Firefox add-on that gives you that I

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.640
don't know I haven't looked at anyway we have a few more links just to round it

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:56.600
out so like they do a deep dive here over at e rom org Eric roms blog

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:02.300
Firefox memory usage in the quantum era so as a continuation of the are they

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:08.960
slim yet series Firefox release 57 has a huge focus on performance as we've just

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.920
heard so we've quantum all the things but we haven't really talked about

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.360
memory usage which is something that often falls by the wayside in the

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.880
pursuit of performance but honestly like especially these days like when I'm on

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.280
not that nice of a laptop or frequently on smaller devices memory usage is one

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.920
of the things I actually care about a lot and I know you were kind of like me

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.960
beard and we have quite a few tabs open at one time do we not true yeah so

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.040
Firefox actually does a pretty good job of suspending them I use the great

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:39.960
suspender in Chrome to do that too so it's but it's like I would almost I

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:45.840
would almost rather have better memory usage sometimes then speed because half

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:48.760
the time I load one page and I'm gonna be on that page for a couple minutes

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.560
yeah and so it doesn't I appreciate speed but I would definitely take

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:55.920
memory usage first so it's interesting to see them talking about it so this is

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.440
kind of a it's like a little bit technical blog post they've got some

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:03.480
nice nice styling here to show you what's going on

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:11.640
so I'm really excited to see these changes in Firefox I mean if you see the

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:19.040
last changes you see in 40 54 55 really exciting and they continue to do that

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:24.080
it's really cool I'm an all-time Firefox user I mean my first five books really

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:31.000
was called firebirds if you're yes I do if I remember it was a one-man

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.280
development at the start and then they took over and then Firefox has become

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:44.160
their browser and I really love it and I won't change I have chromium aside but

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:49.760
my all-time browser is Firefox oh yeah nice yeah it's nice to it's nice to see

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.240
that I you know I remember back in the day convincing people that like

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.920
Firefox was something they should check out hey get away from that evil

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:59.680
Internet Explorer and it definitely felt like you know Chrome's a great browser

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:05.000
they've done a lot of they've done a lot of great things I was recently reading

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.160
about some like fuzzing of the Dom Chrome with their new with their web kit

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.920
for blink has added a lot of security but Firefox you know there was a time

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:17.400
where it really felt pretty stagnant and that kind of upset me and I had really

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.960
sort of started preparing for a time where Firefox wasn't gonna be brought

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.600
up that much but yeah it's true it became heavy at the time and then and

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:31.080
now they have made some changes and and the last month you see the development

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.880
and it's going in a good direction yeah exactly but I couldn't say that better

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.080
so now I see some hope some momentum and hey I don't have to be ashamed to be a

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:43.000
Firefox user I don't think I mean I'm also a crime user right who you don't

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.840
have to limit yourself to one browser these days it's just nice to have

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.160
competition so looks like they've done some good work here they've got some

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.880
stats you can check out on various platforms memory usage tests but boy

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:59.000
looks pretty great especially on Linux apparently edge has the highest memory

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.320
usage on Windows which is a little bit strange because you think that would be

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:06.280
exclusively what they could optimize for and Safari also doesn't doesn't look

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.680
like it's doing so great in memory usage on Mac either that kind of surprises me

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:16.960
Chrome is a hog we kind of all know that but it looks like on Firefox on a bunch

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:22.720
of 16 is doing pretty great so overall they're pretty happy with other at but

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.320
now our big performance pushes over they'd like to spend some more time

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.960
focusing on dropping memory usage so we can start pushing up the number of

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.320
content processes they'd also like to see like Mac OS was kind of a big

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.760
regression for them in this so they're gonna spend some time investigating that

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:37.680
as well which is always nice while I'm not a Mac user it's nice to see the true

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:43.960
multi OS first class kind of support for this open source project one more I

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:47.800
guess two more and then we'll get out of here today looks like there's a little

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:54.880
sneak peek here client-side decorations will be coming to Firefox yeah so I

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.120
don't know how you feel about client-side decorations but maybe

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:05.680
Firefox is getting hip now meh yeah man okay fine beard I was trying to get you

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:12.600
all riled up okay well then this last one this one's just for you oh there's

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.600
two more things what am I doing there's just too much news today anyway Mozilla

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:22.080
adds tracking protection to Firefox for iOS and focus gets multitasking focus is

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:26.440
that new browser of theirs that's supposed to be lean and trim fast and

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:31.040
just simple for focused reading while you're on your your device so yeah

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:37.920
Firefox for iOS version 9.0 now available iPhone iPad etc they'll also

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.180
have an automatic add and content blocking with private browsing mode as

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:45.980
well as tracking protection in regular so that's great at the fees feature uses

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:49.320
the same ad blocking technology and as Firefox focus for Android and iOS

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:52.840
Firefox desktop and Firefox for Android so it's nice to see that they've really

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.520
like kind of pulled up the stops here there's also better sync functionality

01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:01.640
and a bunch of other fixes and maybe the bigger thing Firefox focus now has

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:06.440
multitask so multitasking capabilities that allow users to browse multiple

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:10.040
websites simultaneously using tabs it seems silly that this is how we're now

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.240
at and I think focus what a big focuses big thing was like didn't really have

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.080
that you were focused on it I don't know if that like does this break kind of

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:21.600
what they were doing or is it just a simple and pragmatic change that keeps

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.200
things light and minimal but gives power users like a little bit more of what

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.800
they're used to I'm not sure but it should not interfere with your private

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.080
browsing experience nothing else should really change you just get tabs now so

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:39.480
hey you one thing I was I don't actually use it right now because I just use

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:44.640
Chrome but when I was on my Nexus 5 still I was using Firefox I was really

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.240
pleased I like the Firefox for Android it's pretty snappy it was a lot faster

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:52.760
than Chrome at the time I liked the way it did tabs I was kind of surprised

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.880
because I hadn't really never really considered it as a real option as a for

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.640
a mobile browser before what about you are you just Chrome through and through

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:05.880
I'm Chrome everywhere all the Chrome desktop mobile everywhere yeah well so

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.360
you're what you're telling me is that you're not even going to consider our

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:14.360
final story for the day which is a new release of pale moon this is a major

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.720
update further in general development of the pale moon browser so you can head on

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:23.360
over to pale moon org slash release notes release notes dot s HTML go check

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.440
those out for yourself maybe you're not familiar with pale moon pale moon is an

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.360
open source go on a based web browser available for Microsoft Windows and

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.520
Linux with other operating systems in development focusing on efficiency and

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:38.640
ease of use pale moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.840
completely built from its own independently developed source that has

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:46.520
been forked off from Mozilla Firefox code a number of years ago with carefully

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:49.440
selected features and optimizations to improve the browser stability and user

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:52.960
experience while offering full customization and a growing collection

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:58.480
of extensions and themes to make the browser truly your own so I wonder if

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.120
that mean they probably won't be getting those EME extensions we're all worried

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:07.240
I'm so worried about I guess not yeah have you ever used pale moon nope yeah

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.760
so you're probably not gonna be yeah I'm not gonna be checking out this new

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:15.280
new release mmm probably not I don't know 2750 it's almost feels like old

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:21.560
style Firefox versions there's got got a nice stuff improved MPE MP3 metadata

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:25.320
parsing change window stuff bunch of user interface fixes a bunch of DOM

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:30.800
improvements so I don't use it either but it's kind of nice to see that their

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:34.240
development is proceeding according to plans it sounds like it's a big release

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.880
I'm not gonna use it but it's just a testament I think today's theme might be

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:43.000
hey open source is hard we all need encouragement so yeah here's to you pale

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.320
moon I think with that that's that's it for

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.960
Linux unplugged today beard thank you so much for joining me I've had like a ton

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:58.360
of fun today and thank you to all of our viewers our wonderful bumble room come

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:04.200
join us there you can head on over to Jupiter broadcasting comm you can find a

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:08.080
whole bunch more of Linux unplugged you can find a whole bunch of other shows

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:12.520
there's also Linux unplugged dot reddit comm that's the wonderful subreddit

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.360
beard if they want to see more of you where they should they go oh they can go

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:20.800
to twitter comm slash for Kyle P or rec net if they want to see my stream

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:25.160
wrecked on net and I am at West Payne or you can check me out on the tech snap

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:30.960
program thank you very much for joining us and we'll see you next week

01:20:55.160 --> 01:21:19.520
all right what time for the potion post show all right where's all my screens up

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:27.440
in here you got us some titles yeah we got to find some titles Jimmy titles

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:34.440
calm everybody I saw thirty titles that's awesome I would hope that you can

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:39.040
disable this client-side decorations in the browser because I in my desktop

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:45.600
manager I can roll up roll on the the browser window and with client-side

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.800
decorations I can't do that oh yeah yeah that's like a lot of people were

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:55.240
hoping that it would be you know set by a preference so yeah yeah just a

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:59.640
preference settings and I'm good oh yeah okay here it looks like in looks like

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:03.800
you need to set widget dot allow dash client-side decoration to true in about

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:07.120
config we'll have the tweet linked about that so in the show notes you can say

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:12.920
this is perfect it's very sad we had three people who wanted to join the show

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:17.880
but there was no one who was capable to care push them in yeah well we

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:23.900
unfortunately we can't stage people while you're in the show so I see the

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:28.920
problem I see the problem so today it was a problem you know well we

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.280
certainly appreciate you mr. mini Mac for joining us that was it that was good

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:37.240
fun it was my pleasure I try to give some comments if I have some that is

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:40.120
awesome okay so everyone else we can go vote at

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:44.680
JBtitles.com and we can pick ourselves a title for today's here the example of

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:52.880
program I kind of like open source is hard yeah I do too that's not bad I'm

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:59.080
just gonna just give that a vote here a little votey vote voting all the votes I

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.840
say we just go with open source is hard it's right at the top right at the top

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:10.080
okay thank you a kick much appreciated and thank you for everyone for joining

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:13.600
us here on the Linux unproductive program Chris was away but he'll be back

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:17.000
in time for next week's show I do believe so we'll have the hair master

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.120
back in here regaliness of stories of Ubuntu the East Coast and I'm sure how

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:26.360
scary and confusing New York City is we actually recorded an episode of user

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:30.300
error today at the end of the week that will cover some of that as well awesome

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:34.560
man there's just so much good JB content coming out so and I'm sure Chris

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.400
will also talk about it on next Linux action news I think anywhere that will

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:44.760
give him he's back in time if he's not I might oh cool so everyone stay tuned

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:48.840
Linux action news 21 will be exciting no matter what happens indeed here's

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:52.600
Poland for beard thank you all very much for joining us and sticking around for

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:58.440
today's fun day of broadcasting we'll see you next week and JB reruns coming

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:03.760
right up think the the next live show we should be bs now oh yeah that makes

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:06.880
sense and there might be a whole crap load of coder at the end of the week

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:12.440
whole crap load of coder so get ready for that apparently I just didn't do our

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:16.640
post show here but whatever that's fine chromium will let you browse the web in

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.040
VR with the daydream view headset so that's something I don't even know what

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.680
that means really but I guess it just means that you can take your daydream

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:28.680
headset hook it up to chromium and then a big wall of a browser a big browser

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:34.560
wall yeah I think there was a new 3d file system a relatively new actively

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:39.200
developed like that old Unix II one from Jurassic Park so that just feels like

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:45.400
that I find it really amusing that they they they they hype the stuff when it's

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:50.760
it's trying to put something that's inherently 2d in a 3d space yeah oh man I

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:54.600
can see the corners of your website bro your website is basically a poster in a

01:24:54.600 --> 01:25:05.360
virtual world yeah right exactly
