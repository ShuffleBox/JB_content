1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
I don't think any of us had this in our predictions,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,060
and that was just last week,

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,880
but Canonical has a job posting up on their careers page

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,680
for a quote, Linux desktop gaming product manager.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,720
And the description reads,

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,060
we're excited to create the role

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,760
of desktop gaming product manager

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,080
to make Ubuntu the best Linux desktop for gaming.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,480
We will work with partners in the Silicon world

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,520
to ensure the latest graphic drivers and tweaks

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,540
are built in for optimal frame rates and latency,

12
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,420
as well as with partners in the gaming industry

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,000
to ensure that mechanisms such as anti-cheat capabilities

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,560
are available to ensure fairness and product availability.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
Where is this coming from, first of all?

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,740
And second of all, what strikes me about this

17
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,580
is I was just thinking,

18
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,120
we're getting awfully close to the deck

19
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,400
and no major game has announced anti-cheat compatibility.

20
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,560
Does this feel like a response

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,200
to the deck being arch, you think?

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,760
Oh, I don't know.

23
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,440
Response seems like maybe a lot.

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,740
You know, you'd think there'd have to be a little more

25
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,840
going on behind the scenes than just that,

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,960
but it certainly feels like maybe it's pulling into

27
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,920
more of these machinations we don't quite see

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,480
behind the various curtains.

29
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,080
It is weird the way this job post is written.

30
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,600
Like, you know, half of it's talking about

31
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,880
some of those like this graphic stuff

32
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,960
and software development,

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,120
but then there's also a lot of the phrase go-to markets.

34
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,120
How do you find someone who's software development

35
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,160
experience, really interested in open source of that,

36
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,760
and then also has an MBA?

37
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,960
I guess that's what you need.

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:29,240
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

39
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,680
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

40
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,040
And my name is Brent. Hello, gentlemen.

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,960
Welcome to our first Sunday episode.

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
We're here together.

43
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,600
It's nice to see your smiling faces.

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,440
Coming up on the show today, we've been waiting all summer.

45
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,760
It's a new year and it's time for a new server

46
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,840
with some essential help from our community.

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,600
We are starting off on a major migration.

48
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,640
We're going to tell you more about it.

49
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,920
You know some of it.

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,360
We're going to tell you the complete picture in this episode.

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,200
We've got two servers, new networking,

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,960
a totally new balls to the walls,

53
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,480
don't do as we do kind of setup.

54
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,120
So you're joining us today mid-gallop into a migration,

55
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,440
and we'll give you our first major progress report.

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,240
Then we'll round out the show with the emails and the pics.

57
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,440
You know, we've gone through and done our pre-show discussion

58
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,200
on what would be the right pic.

59
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,920
I think I have one that's going to be good for the timing.

60
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,240
So I'm vouching for this week's pic.

61
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,200
Oh, wow. Okay.

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,560
I mean, the first pic of a new year is serious business.

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,480
Yeah. Yeah.

64
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,680
So before we go any further,

65
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,400
we've got to do the business of the show.

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,840
We've got to say hello to our virtual lug.

67
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,760
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,800
Hello, hello.

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,640
Hello.

70
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,480
Good evening.

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,680
Hello.

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,800
Namaskaram.

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,640
Sunday.

74
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,480
Hello.

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,800
Welcome to the Sunday episode.

76
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,040
We're trying out the old jitzy today.

77
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,880
Should be interesting to see how that goes.

78
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,280
Nice to see some of their faces.

79
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,120
They're like real people.

80
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,960
It is, wow.

81
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,760
And I mean, they did not bat an eye

82
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,360
at following us right over here.

83
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,520
Yeah, well, it helped that we kept dropping

84
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
our connection to Mumble.

85
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,280
That didn't change it.

86
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,640
As you probably guessed, I'm out of the woods.

87
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,480
Made it out of the woods.

88
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,720
Yeah, you didn't die.

89
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,160
Yeah. A nicey death. Good work.

90
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,640
So if you didn't catch last week's episode,

91
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,880
I got stranded out in the woods

92
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,560
after the Pacific Northwest got slammed

93
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,880
with an unusually cold winter storm

94
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,400
and didn't have enough fuel, didn't have enough propane,

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,480
didn't have enough water, tanks were full.

96
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,920
I was freezing my, you know what's off.

97
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,000
And our ideal scenario is we were gonna get out of there

98
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,200
after last week's show on Tuesday.

99
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
We didn't make it out till Thursday.

100
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Ooh.

101
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,440
Yeah.

102
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Now, the nice thing was is the longer we stayed out

103
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,720
in the woods, the more we kind of learned to live out there.

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,160
Still real hard on the rig.

105
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,160
And there has been damage to our water system.

106
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,000
But what happened is a bunch of ice formed

107
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,400
on top of our slides, like thick ice,

108
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,960
much thicker than I realized.

109
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,800
And it must've been a combination of just melt

110
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,400
and then refreezing that just made this thing huge over time.

111
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,760
And so it was hours per slide to get that ice out.

112
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,960
Wow.

113
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,080
Took forever.

114
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,240
Of course, I tried to not do it and just saw it,

115
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,760
see, well, maybe it'll break when it comes in.

116
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,480
No, no, you could drive a car on this ice.

117
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,040
So it was like that thick.

118
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,880
So we had to like chip each slide.

119
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,960
It took hours and you know, it's 20 degrees,

120
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,560
15 degrees outside.

121
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,160
There's only so many, and it's right at winter solstice too.

122
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,480
So there's only so many hours of daylight.

123
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,400
You've got a few hours of daylight

124
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,480
to do the work out there.

125
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,000
You can only be out in the cold for so long.

126
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,160
We're making no solar, right?

127
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,040
It was just worst case scenario.

128
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,280
And so we didn't actually make it out till Thursday.

129
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,960
And then that evening, another huge snowstorm came in.

130
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,920
If we hadn't made it out that day,

131
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,320
we would have been trapped again that evening.

132
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,000
It was like down to the wire.

133
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,240
Yeah, you probably would have just gotten out now.

134
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,440
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

135
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,480
Cause it's just now gone,

136
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,600
for the first time since Christmas,

137
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,480
it's gone above freezing.

138
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,560
So yeah.

139
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,680
But then, you know, fast forward,

140
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
like we're here at the studio Saturday,

141
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,520
last night, day after New Year's,

142
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,040
even though Wes has friends in town,

143
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,880
he still came, spent the day up here,

144
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,800
brought Brent up.

145
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,760
Brent's in from town.

146
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,440
Wait, Brent's in from out of town.

147
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,280
Nice to have Brent here.

148
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,120
Out of country.

149
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,960
Right, right.

150
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,160
And you had quite the experience.

151
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
I had a saga.

152
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,320
I think it's a podcast length story in itself

153
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,640
that I won't go into details,

154
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,280
but it took me, let's say two days to get here.

155
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Yeah, you had to end up crossing the border

156
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
a total of five times.

157
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,080
Yeah, yeah, I did.

158
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,800
Customs got to know me really well.

159
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,840
And that's not usually a good thing.

160
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,880
Also, you learned almost the hard way

161
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,960
that if you buy something in the duty-free store

162
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,920
and then bring it back into your own country,

163
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,080
there's like a 200% fee for that.

164
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,400
Yeah, it turns out they don't tell you that

165
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,520
when you buy these things.

166
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,720
I guess it's an edge case.

167
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,320
Yeah, so just be aware of that, listener.

168
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,560
Brent'll save you some money there.

169
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,360
So before we get into our service stuff today,

170
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,720
I just wanna mention that we do have a meetup

171
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,000
on the 30th planned at the studio here

172
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,680
in the Seattle area, it's up in the town of Arlington.

173
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,160
So it's about 45, 50 minutes North of Seattle.

174
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,440
And we're gonna do phase two of the server launch.

175
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,000
We're gonna have a get together potluck here,

176
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,560
just have a good old time, do a live lup

177
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,960
and hang out at the JB studio,

178
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,000
assuming that it's safe to do so.

179
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,640
You know, we just will watch all that,

180
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,000
but so we'll have more information on that soon.

181
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,200
But if you're in the Pacific Northwest area,

182
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,920
start making your plans for that.

183
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,480
But all right, let's talk about server stuff

184
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,320
because you guys know that if you've been listening

185
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
to the show for a while,

186
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,600
we have this really super reliable, super micro box

187
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,480
that has been around forever.

188
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,600
We bought it used.

189
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,400
It's really done good work for us, right?

190
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,280
I mean- Sure has.

191
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,560
In the bedrock of the studio for a few years now.

192
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,960
And it's lived through some real hot summers

193
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,600
because it's a garage that has an exposed roof

194
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,120
and it's also where the afternoon sun is.

195
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,000
So it gets really hot in there, even for the Seattle area.

196
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,480
You know, it could be over a hundred and something degrees

197
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,520
in there in the summer.

198
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,960
Survived multiple OS transitions, many Arch updates.

199
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
Yeah, it started life as a FreeNAS box,

200
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
then it became a Fedora box,

201
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,720
and then it became an Arch box.

202
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,800
And there are legacy artifacts of that

203
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,520
going all the way back to the FreeNAS installation.

204
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,600
It's pretty funny.

205
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,320
And Alan Jude set up our original ZFS setup on FreeNAS.

206
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,480
And so that has been carried forward

207
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,320
through all those installs as well,

208
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,240
which is something we're gonna kind of finally modernize

209
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,560
and update on, which we'll get into that in a little bit.

210
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,440
But I mean, it really has served us well.

211
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,400
It's loud, it takes a ton of power,

212
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,280
and it's been through a lot of seasons.

213
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,320
And this last summer,

214
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,800
it started hard locking on us a few times.

215
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
Probably the most fatal one

216
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,960
was during the final few weeks of the road trip

217
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,960
when we were all AFK and it went down

218
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,080
and I had like some backup infrastructure on Linode

219
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,560
because we knew it was sketch.

220
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,400
And that was the only thing

221
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,200
that kind of saved the day on that.

222
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,280
So we realized goal number one

223
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,840
when we go for a new server is stability.

224
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,760
We gotta make sure this thing's not locking up on us.

225
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,480
We wanna have remote management.

226
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,680
We wanna be able to figure out what's happening

227
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,960
even when we're not in the studio.

228
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,800
And along with that,

229
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,360
we wanna build like a cooling box for it in the spring

230
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,800
and all that kind of stuff.

231
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,920
That was like, and probably, obviously,

232
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,720
something that's just will last us a few more years too.

233
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,960
It's not just reliability,

234
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,560
it's also sustainability for a few more years.

235
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,440
Yeah, right, we're kind of getting some work in now

236
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,440
to forestall having to do this again sometime soon.

237
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,640
Yeah, I love getting four or five years

238
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,600
out of something like this if we can't even longer,

239
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,200
which we definitely did with this last box.

240
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,560
So that's like 50% of our goals right there.

241
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,280
The other 50% of our goal

242
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,640
is to increase the available storage that we have.

243
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,240
We archive FLAC versions of our show productions on there.

244
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
We archive special projects on there.

245
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,400
Anytime we go to a community event,

246
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,680
if we record audio or we film it,

247
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,000
we archive all the source material on there.

248
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,600
There's also a media collection

249
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,960
for people in the studio that's on there.

250
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,200
I have some family stuff on there,

251
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,640
like videos and things like that.

252
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,640
There's a ton of our archives

253
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,280
from the object storage up in Linode.

254
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,360
You guys, we've talked about this before,

255
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,320
but just as a recap,

256
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,080
we run Nextcloud up on Linode.

257
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,280
Object storage is the backend.

258
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,960
And then to prevent excessive growth,

259
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,480
we just carve off every few months some of that

260
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,200
and we throw it on the physical server here in the studio

261
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,920
that has this.

262
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,960
And that way we keep what's in object storage

263
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,000
to like three or four months.

264
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,720
And then anything older than that lives in an archive storage

265
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,960
kind of like a cold storage here at the studio.

266
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,440
Then we run Nextcloud on each of them

267
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,800
and it helps us manage that and it's really nice.

268
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,560
And so we need to be able to grow that as well.

269
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,720
So right now the current system has two terabytes free.

270
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,120
It's running Arch.

271
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,560
We haven't updated it since the last time

272
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,880
we updated it on the show.

273
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,040
That's been a few months.

274
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,840
It's like, it's definitely due for some updates.

275
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,680
Yeah, I think so.

276
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,120
Let's just see here.

277
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,960
How many?

278
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,120
You think, you know,

279
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,600
it'd be really dumb to do one more update

280
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
just because we're in the middle of a migration.

281
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,720
Yeah, no, we don't need to update it.

282
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,440
But boy, I tell you what, there was a second there.

283
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,280
I'm like, let's do it.

284
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,320
Let's kick off the millionaire.

285
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,240
Let's update this sucker.

286
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,280
But no, no, this is not that time.

287
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,760
So we wanted to move over to something

288
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,320
that gave us additional capacity,

289
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
some runway for storage.

290
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,760
Ideally, although this is a long shot,

291
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,000
ideally something that gets us through the rest of the year

292
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,160
because buying high capacity SAS hard drives right now

293
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,320
is like buying them made out of gold or Bitcoin even.

294
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,680
It's ridiculous.

295
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,000
We were looking at prices last night

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,760
for even just, you know, maybe two terabytes.

297
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,520
Some of the drives are going for nearly $800 right now.

298
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,760
It's just not happening.

299
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,600
Too much.

300
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,360
So we wanted to try to get as much storage runway

301
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,440
as possible with this migration.

302
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,720
And did you get the updates there, the number there?

303
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,640
Oh, yeah.

304
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,360
Oh, you know, hey, net upgrade size only 24 megs,

305
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,800
but 229 packages, three gigs of updates.

306
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,240
Three gigs of updates and a 24 megabyte net size.

307
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,520
That just makes me smile.

308
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,120
You know, that's just so damn impressive.

309
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,040
We'll miss you, Arch.

310
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,000
Mm-hmm.

311
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,760
So it really was a matter of getting new hardware,

312
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,320
trying to get the right price to performance ratio,

313
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,840
and then finding time to set it up

314
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,280
and finding a new physical spot to put it

315
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,800
that we could build a box around later.

316
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,440
You know, as with a lot of these things,

317
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,120
it's an exercise in engineering compromises, right?

318
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,160
Like, we have the resources we have entirely, you know,

319
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,400
thanks to the amazing community that we have.

320
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,680
And we're trying to figure out, like,

321
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,720
for our particular needs, which, you know,

322
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,400
it's kind of an odd combination of things.

323
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,000
And it's not necessarily,

324
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,480
it's not the thing hosting the shows.

325
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,440
It's not the stuff, you know, if something happens

326
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,480
or we need to do some work on it, that's okay.

327
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,160
But it is still, you know, important to the studio.

328
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,840
Yeah, it's not in the pipeline of production,

329
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,400
but it's in the support area of, like, infrastructure,

330
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,920
which is, like, a second tier of infrastructure.

331
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,120
So it works kind of good for this sort of thing.

332
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,560
It's definitely, and it's something

333
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,520
we definitely have in production,

334
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,480
so if it breaks it, you know, we feel it.

335
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,320
When I was looking at buying something, you know,

336
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,480
I was looking at, like, a $1,000, $2,000 rig, you know.

337
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
I was, you know, looking at something budget-friendly

338
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,520
because I knew I was gonna have to put

339
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,840
a bunch of money into storage.

340
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,080
But, like Wes said, like,

341
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
we have a f****** amazing community.

342
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,040
It's, like, you can't put it down as an asset

343
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,560
on a balance sheet, but it has gotta be

344
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,440
one of the strongest assets of this company

345
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,960
because we had two different individuals step up

346
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,960
and hook us up with incredible hardware

347
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,960
that is really, it changed the focus

348
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,280
from, like, how the hell are we gonna afford this

349
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,680
to, like, let's get some storage and focus on the setup.

350
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,600
Both of these servers that were donated to us

351
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,040
are nicer than I would have bought.

352
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Right? No kidding.

353
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,600
Like, you know, we could have got something decent,

354
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,120
but not this.

355
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,400
Yeah, and both servers, one came with no disk

356
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,880
and one came with disk, but both servers

357
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,600
ended up having 48 terabytes of total storage available.

358
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,720
Ironically, like, they both,

359
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,960
that's where it worked out to be, is 48 terabytes.

360
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,640
Which is interesting because right now

361
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,160
we have about 20 terabytes, and we have two terabytes free

362
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,080
in our current system.

363
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,520
One is a set of spinning disks that I picked up

364
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,680
from two different vendors on eBay,

365
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,120
and the other came with 24 low-right threshold SSDs.

366
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,640
But they're all SSDs, and man, is that a thing of beauty.

367
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,560
So when we saw this, what we saw was a real opportunity

368
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,640
here for us to play with disaster recovery

369
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,400
and failover setups over time.

370
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,880
Especially, not maybe so much from, like,

371
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,840
an OS hot standby standpoint,

372
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,160
but more, like, from a data recovery.

373
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,680
For some of these really big, you know,

374
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,560
archived files of productions and stuff

375
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,000
that right now they're just not properly backed up

376
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,520
because it's difficult to do so.

377
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,560
Yeah, it's a lot of storage.

378
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,240
So how do you do that?

379
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,520
And especially when you have a Comcast connection

380
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,280
that has, like, a kind of crappy upload speed

381
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,880
and stuff like that.

382
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,280
So we're gonna talk more about that.

383
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,000
That's more down the road.

384
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,720
What we're gonna focus on today is the box

385
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,200
that has 24 SSDs in it.

386
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,280
And that's gonna be the first box we deploy in this

387
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,280
because it's got some great CPUs in it.

388
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,280
It has got a couple of Intel E5-2667 Xeons,

389
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,960
clocked at 3.6 gigahertz.

390
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,320
And these are just beautiful CPUs.

391
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,360
And there's 16 cores total here.

392
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,480
And it has 755 gigabytes of usable RAM.

393
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,440
It's just, we're using, like, something like 0.4% right now

394
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,160
just in the base setup, it's insane.

395
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,440
Yeah, we're talking RAM disk here.

396
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,260
We're gonna be getting there.

397
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,260
So it's a Dell R730 XD, and it's a hell of a box,

398
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,780
but it was a little bit above my pay grade.

399
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,700
Yeah, I gotta say, our community once again stepped up.

400
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,260
And joining us this Saturday, we had a listener

401
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,140
who helped gave the hardware a once over

402
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,940
and get things rolling.

403
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,140
Just don't confuse them with old Wes.

404
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,540
My name's Wesley.

405
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,540
I'll go by that, just we're not confusing me with Wes Payne.

406
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,660
But yeah, so I'm kind of local here to the Seattle area.

407
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,100
And when I heard Chris say that he would love

408
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,580
to have some extra help, I was like,

409
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,700
I'm a guy who lives in Seattle, the Seattle area,

410
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,260
and I would love to help you guys.

411
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,460
So yeah, I'll come on down and see what I can do.

412
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,160
I actually told new Wes, don't come.

413
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,380
I said, don't show up.

414
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,540
The roads are frozen.

415
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,380
It's a two hour drive from where you're at.

416
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,420
Plus we're having to get together on the 30th.

417
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,980
That's just too much work, that's crazy.

418
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,020
Don't come.

419
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,460
It's no, it's just not, we're not worth it.

420
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,100
But he didn't listen to me.

421
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,620
He headed out and he really, really knows this particular

422
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,740
line of Dell hardware in and out.

423
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,560
So that worked out like perfectly

424
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,140
because it's what he deals with his day job.

425
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,380
No kidding, he could not ask for anything better.

426
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,180
Now, Seuss on the other hand,

427
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,740
well, we're all kind of on the same page there.

428
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,300
Yeah, I knew it was a distro

429
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,960
and that's about the level that I had.

430
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,800
Yeah.

431
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,620
We had some fun moments.

432
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,220
I think that's how we feel sometimes too.

433
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,040
We're slowly learning.

434
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,020
The net install had some learning curves for us.

435
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,260
Yeah.

436
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,540
We also chatted about how much of a great deal

437
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,220
you can get from used server hardware.

438
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,500
I think that is really the gold point here

439
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,360
is everything we got is used.

440
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,900
And yet it's still amazing for what we need to use it for.

441
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,200
And maybe something people should consider more often.

442
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,500
Absolutely, it's very affordable

443
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,260
because you got companies who, you know,

444
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,180
they go through their stock,

445
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,980
a third of their servers at a time, they do upgrades.

446
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,660
And they'll go for like 700 bucks, 800 bucks.

447
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,860
Yeah, and they're ridiculously powerful for that too.

448
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,180
Yeah, they also have a nice feature

449
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,060
that I think we're excited about, IPMI, right?

450
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,340
But NUEST wanted to warn us and tell us to be careful.

451
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,700
Oh yeah, IPMI is great.

452
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,460
It's easily one of the best things

453
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,380
about sort of enterprise hardware.

454
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,420
There is a downside though, of course, as with everything.

455
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,380
There's a major security component there

456
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,060
because it's its own separate board before

457
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,900
the rest of the motherboard.

458
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,540
That's how you can turn the server on while it's off.

459
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,540
It's because it's its own own board

460
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,140
that has the ability to control the server remotely.

461
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,900
And so when you expose this over IP, right,

462
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
which is how you want to for convenience,

463
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,500
now you've got this huge attack surface

464
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,460
that has the ability to control your entire box.

465
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,580
That's definitely something we'll have to keep in mind.

466
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,420
Definitely.

467
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
Because I think a big part of this for us was IPMI,

468
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,180
getting some kind of remote management.

469
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,340
You can really think of it as a computer inside your server.

470
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,860
And so I think what we'll probably do is lock down

471
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,420
what IPs can connect to it and that kind of stuff.

472
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,940
But it also was why we did this.

473
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,940
Because if I had IPMI while I was on that road trip,

474
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,300
I could have rebooted the server

475
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,820
and got it back up and running again.

476
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,860
And it wouldn't have been out for a few weeks.

477
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,820
So just, I mean, a huge thank you to NUEST

478
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,060
for making it all the way up here

479
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,740
and helping us get the ball rolling on this.

480
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,860
We really kind of needed that

481
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,260
because I ended up way behind on getting this going

482
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,340
because I got stuck out in the woods

483
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,420
for a week longer than I intended to.

484
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,700
So all the time after Christmas,

485
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,300
between Christmas and New Year's,

486
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,500
was when I was gonna be working on it.

487
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
And I was stuck.

488
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,180
And there were a lot of different moving pieces,

489
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,140
which is why it's having extra hands around too, right?

490
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,660
Because like, okay, there was the physical setup

491
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,240
in the studio, getting that wired up,

492
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,660
plugged into the network, up and going.

493
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,900
Then there was actually getting the OS installed.

494
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,260
And we still needed to figure out like disk layouts

495
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,900
and operating system configuration,

496
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,740
and all kinds of things.

497
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,620
Even just having his knowledge there on the BIOS,

498
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,300
because he knew those BIOSes in and out

499
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,500
and what we wanted to do with it.

500
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,340
Yeah, that could have been a rabbit hole.

501
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,820
We wasted way too much time on it.

502
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,660
Right.

503
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,540
And also a big thank you to those of you

504
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,060
who donated the hardware.

505
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,380
Real Zombie Geek hooked us up

506
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,820
with one of these awesome servers.

507
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,700
That's the one we'll be telling you more about soon.

508
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,940
We had anonymous listener give us the one with the SSDs

509
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,300
that we put into production now.

510
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,160
And it's great for us because it allows us

511
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,660
to just get to work and get back to making the shows

512
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,100
and learning this stuff

513
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,480
and be able to relay that to you guys.

514
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,160
So let's talk about what we're excited about

515
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,000
with this server.

516
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,140
It's definitely IPMI.

517
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,580
That's a big game changer for us,

518
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,640
but there's a ton in this box.

519
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,780
A lot of it we haven't even told you about.

520
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,780
Linode.com slash unplugged.

521
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,960
Boy, have I really just gained a whole new appreciation

522
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,640
for Linode this week.

523
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,260
I don't want to do any more of these.

524
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,460
Setting up an actual physical server is a lot of work.

525
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,700
Yeah, no kidding, right?

526
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,180
Just even the physical aspects of it.

527
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,620
Rather than just clicking a button in a web UI, perhaps.

528
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,820
And I honestly wouldn't be surprised

529
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,540
if the power draw of that server

530
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,220
is probably about the cost of a base Linode, right?

531
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,780
But then that base Linode is gonna be in their data center

532
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,740
with their screaming fast connections

533
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,820
and their awesome hardware

534
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,100
and also 11 data centers I could pick from.

535
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,540
Plus they can handle the backups if you want.

536
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,180
Yeah, I mean, it's really just a whole other ball game.

537
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,520
And it's honestly why we have 98% of our infrastructure

538
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,700
up on Linode.

539
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,220
That's how we really deploy everything.

540
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,340
Anything that the team uses,

541
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,940
anything that our listeners interface with,

542
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,460
that's what we use Linode for.

543
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,580
But I hear from so many of you out there

544
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,420
that have tried it out for something like Nextcloud

545
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,020
or replaced Zoom with Jitsi

546
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,380
or have decided to migrate to GitLab

547
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,900
and you put that on Linode.

548
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,340
You're just having that peace of mind

549
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,060
that you've got the root password.

550
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,740
You can make a backup when you want it.

551
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,500
You can get your data when you need it.

552
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,820
You can have full control over that setup.

553
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,620
I think that's worth a lot.

554
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,780
It's a kind of peace of mind

555
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,300
or almost a stress that gets lifted off your shoulders

556
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,740
when you move to that kind of setup.

557
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,300
And then the great thing about Linode

558
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,780
is they give you all the tools to manage that

559
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,260
in a way that's not super complicated.

560
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,180
It's not gonna be overwhelming.

561
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,100
So if you wanna take steps in this direction,

562
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,820
but you've never done it before,

563
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,820
you're not gonna get scared by their horrible interface

564
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,860
or their complicated UI.

565
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,500
Like I picture something like the big hyperscalers,

566
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,100
that is its own ecosystem, right?

567
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,000
That is its own language.

568
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,420
That's its own tooling.

569
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,700
There are people that can become specialists

570
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,580
in those hyperscalers that can't do anything else.

571
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,620
It's not necessarily a good or bad thing.

572
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,900
It's just not where I wanna invest my time.

573
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,180
It's not where I wanna develop my skillset.

574
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,020
And it's also, it's not gonna enable me

575
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,860
to use multiple cloud providers should I ever need to.

576
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,380
And Linode then has all these great tools

577
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,600
like APIs and command line tools you can use as well

578
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
or integrate with Kubernetes or Terraform.

579
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,940
So it's just like, it's sort of sitting in this perfect spot

580
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,660
for people that really are advanced

581
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,100
with their infrastructure management

582
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,500
or for people that just need a $5 Linode.

583
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,220
And their pricing is 30 to 50% less

584
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,180
than the major hyperscalers.

585
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,660
So go try it out, get $100 and really kick the tires.

586
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,820
And you support the show.

587
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,940
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

588
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,380
You go there, you get $100 in 60 day credit

589
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,220
and you support the show.

590
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,860
What a great way to start the year.

591
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,020
Linode.com slash unplugged.

592
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,580
Well, after new West put in a lot of hard work

593
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,140
getting us all set up and configure,

594
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,180
you know, the OS was installed.

595
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,420
Then we realized, oh right,

596
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,660
I've got to set up this new disk array.

597
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,500
And we hadn't really gotten quite that far in our planning.

598
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,160
Yeah, this was tricky too

599
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,580
because we had to make a couple of decisions.

600
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,400
And one of the things we seriously gave consideration to

601
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,900
was doing everything in ButterFS.

602
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,980
Traditionally, we have the root file system in ButterFS

603
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,220
and then we have the data pool in ZFS.

604
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,700
And we thought this time,

605
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,900
perhaps we just ButterFS the entire thing.

606
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,420
And we didn't really have like a hard line

607
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,340
on like requirements.

608
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,020
So we had to actually hash out,

609
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,540
well, what do we actually want to do?

610
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,900
How much storage do we actually want available?

611
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,340
And by having that conversation,

612
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,140
we kind of whittled it down to ultimately,

613
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,340
well, we're going to actually end up using ZFS.

614
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,380
You know, it was interesting though.

615
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,380
It was a fun discussion and thought experience

616
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,220
in some sense, you know,

617
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,620
it kind of showed what things, you know,

618
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,260
what parts worked well in a world

619
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,140
where it was all in on ButterFS

620
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,100
and kind of unified some of the tooling we could have used.

621
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,340
But, you know, it came down to just the available features

622
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,500
and the amount of the pool we could actually use

623
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,820
because at the end of the day,

624
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,160
if we just had the same amount of space,

625
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,020
that's still an improvement,

626
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,340
but we were kind of running into issues

627
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,940
down the road in 2022

628
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,740
that we would just have to immediately address.

629
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,620
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised

630
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,380
if we wouldn't have made it more than three months

631
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,820
with what we have available on the current system.

632
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,500
And with the price of storage right now,

633
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,660
I just can't really see us being able to

634
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,720
replace a bunch of those disks right away.

635
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,220
Right, and so if we, you know,

636
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,980
if we had kind of copied a similar setup,

637
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,140
the current array was set up by Alan back in the day,

638
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,180
and it's set up with a bunch of mirrors in the pool.

639
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,540
Probably a sensible way to do it.

640
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,820
Totally, yeah, you know, Alan and Jim over the years

641
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,860
have shared a lot of great stuff.

642
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,020
There's some good wisdom on how you might want to set up CFS,

643
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,500
in particular, what kind of use case you've got

644
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,240
and, you know, what uptime reliability

645
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,780
and how much data protection you need.

646
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,100
But with mirrors, you know, you're making a copy there.

647
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,220
You're mirroring that data over,

648
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,260
and that means that you're only gonna get 50% utilization.

649
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,060
So we ended up with exactly the amount of free space

650
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,220
our current system has.

651
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,860
Yeah, and you, when we told you that,

652
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,060
you looked over at the calculator,

653
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,020
and you weren't exactly happy.

654
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,340
I'm like, we just can't do this.

655
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,220
Like, we should, especially because these are-

656
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,540
We kept reading all the arguments, you know,

657
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,500
we went and looked up all these kind of guides,

658
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,340
I'm like, how do I think about

659
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,900
setting up your CFS storage and stuff,

660
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,900
and be like, yeah, okay, yeah, I mean, that argument,

661
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,020
I can't say that's not good reasoning.

662
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,940
Right, I like PMed Neil on Matrix last night,

663
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,300
I'm like, Neil, what do you think about this too?

664
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,700
Cause we were in this, we were all sitting here

665
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,500
in the studio trying to decide what to do about it.

666
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,660
And, you know, you throw out a couple of options

667
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,400
we could use to try to get some available storage

668
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,340
out of a ButterFS setup, which was very helpful.

669
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,400
Thank you for taking the time to do that.

670
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,600
When we were talking about it, it was,

671
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,420
the main constraint you had was,

672
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,040
you didn't foresee expanding your physical topology

673
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,920
within this year, right?

674
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,980
That was the constraint that you ultimately put down to me.

675
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,780
And I said, the main concern you should make sure

676
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,380
you think about is avoiding a topology

677
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,820
which can lead to cascade disk failure.

678
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,300
Because if you're relying, for example, on parity rate

679
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,340
and you say, all right, I'm okay with accepting

680
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,620
two disks failing, you have to make sure

681
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,140
your rate configuration is set up

682
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,740
so that you reduce the likelihood

683
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,580
that two disks will fail at the same time, right?

684
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,300
And because you can't replace the disks

685
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,500
and you can't afford and you can't figure out

686
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,340
whether those disks were bought at the same time

687
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,580
or if they're different times,

688
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,500
you have to go with the worst case assumption

689
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
that they're all bought at the same time.

690
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,840
And that means that they will all fail at the same time

691
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,040
when they get to failing.

692
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,360
I expect that to be the case.

693
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,200
You're right.

694
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,460
So expect that to be the case and design it accordingly.

695
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,800
Like I recommended, for everyone else,

696
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,140
if you're doing Butterfess, I recommend using a RAID 10

697
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,500
and using Z standard compression

698
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,340
to increase the available space

699
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,340
to be somewhere closer to what you would get

700
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,940
with the RAID 6 arraignment

701
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,380
because the RAID 10 configuration

702
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,180
is less punishing to disks than the other options.

703
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,660
With ZFS, you can do an equivalent configuration

704
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,700
with you putting mirrors

705
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,220
and then striping the mirrors on top

706
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,920
because that's essentially what a RAID 10 is.

707
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,540
It's a striped mirror.

708
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,180
But don't do RAID Z or parity RAID

709
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,400
because with the higher density disks that exist today,

710
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,860
the likelihood of cascade disk failure goes up.

711
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,500
I have personally experienced this at work

712
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,640
and in my home setups.

713
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,860
And I basically don't use parity RAID

714
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,180
unless I absolutely have to.

715
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,900
So don't, if you can avoid it.

716
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,740
Yeah.

717
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,540
And to make it more poignant,

718
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,340
these are low right SSDs to begin with.

719
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,500
So they have a lower life cycle than an average SSD.

720
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,520
So they will fail sooner than an average SSD as well.

721
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,360
Right.

722
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,940
And so like, this is where if you're using Butterfess

723
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,660
and like what I told Chris,

724
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,220
and I'll say it repeated again for everyone else,

725
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,900
is make a separate Butterfess pool

726
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,100
for your data with your disks

727
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,540
and configure it differently

728
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,980
than how you would set up your OS pool

729
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,520
so that it's optimized for those characteristics.

730
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,800
So for example, set it up so that discard is async,

731
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,000
set it up so you use Z standard compression,

732
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,480
probably at a higher compression level

733
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,180
because you're willing to eat more CPU cycles

734
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,660
in return for less IO on disk,

735
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,420
set it up with RAID 10,

736
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,860
make sure that you've got proper monitoring and alerting

737
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,620
to catch the warning signs quick, those kinds of things.

738
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,460
Thank you.

739
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,380
Thank you for taking the time.

740
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,740
That's some great advice.

741
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,620
And that is exactly the kind of rational setup

742
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,740
everyone should follow.

743
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,420
And I wanna be clear,

744
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,260
what we ended up with is nowhere as good as that.

745
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,260
And it is better than what we had on the whiteboard

746
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,140
for quite a while, which was simply YOLO.

747
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,900
And it was just a JBOD with no RAID at all,

748
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,100
which we ultimately decided against.

749
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,780
But what we chose seems a little more rational

750
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,820
when you consider we considered no RAID at all.

751
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,700
But I will also remind you that we have a server

752
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,980
with the identical amount of storage

753
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,260
that we have as a failover box.

754
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,460
So that ultimately played a role in our decision.

755
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,980
So we decided to go with ButterFS on the root,

756
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,740
which is a hardware RAID one using the Dell RAID controller.

757
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,980
It's got these two drive slots in the arse of the box

758
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,360
back where the ports are.

759
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,300
There's two disks in there that run the OS.

760
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,740
Then we've got 24 solid state disks

761
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,940
that are getting passed through on the controller.

762
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,820
And we're going with ZFS.

763
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,520
And because you should never do like what we do,

764
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,340
we are doing RAID Z2.

765
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,580
And like you should never do like we do,

766
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,820
we're doing one big VDEV, which you should never do,

767
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,740
especially with 24 disks, right?

768
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,580
So don't do that.

769
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,180
We basically tried to read all the advice we could get

770
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,340
and then not do it.

771
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,540
I mean, it seems pretty rational, right?

772
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,380
I mean, no one-

773
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,280
But you liked the number when we said you could get,

774
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,740
we had like 82.5% capacity.

775
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,580
That was the number you liked, I think, right?

776
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,620
That's what it came down to, right?

777
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,440
Is this migration just doesn't happen

778
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,100
if we don't have more storage.

779
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,780
So ultimately we wanted as much storage

780
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,900
available as possible.

781
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,540
So we went with a parity RAID,

782
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,820
which we're really gonna be screwed

783
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,580
if we have a couple of more than two disks fail

784
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,860
at any point in time.

785
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,820
And it's extra screwy because the time it's gonna take

786
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,260
to get a replacement disk will probably be

787
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,420
about the amount of time it takes for a third disk to fail.

788
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,360
So we're really kind of going down to the wire

789
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,420
with the idea being that we have the second box

790
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,940
that will have an identical copy of everything

791
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,700
that we could do like a ZFS send to recover should we need.

792
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,460
The IRC thinks we hate our data.

793
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,300
They might be right.

794
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,620
I mean, we did almost YOLO this whole thing, right?

795
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,100
You know what's been fascinating to me

796
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,020
watching all of these discussions happen, Chris,

797
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,300
is just your, the difference in your capacity

798
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,500
to accept risk.

799
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,960
And it was basically Wes for a few hours

800
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,420
just trying to bring you back from those cliffs there.

801
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,260
So-

802
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,140
You know, I'm not trying to,

803
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,740
it's more just to make sure we presented the facts

804
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,580
as they may be.

805
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,400
I appreciate it.

806
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,320
So one of the things you kind of workshopped

807
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,780
on your laptop was we were curious,

808
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,820
like what happens if you just do a big ass

809
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,500
ButterFest volume with 24 disks

810
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,940
and a couple of those disks pop off,

811
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,300
like how does ButterFest handle that?

812
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,340
So Wes kind of replicated that on a smaller scale

813
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,160
on his laptop.

814
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,000
Tell us what you did.

815
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,740
Oh yeah, it was just fun playing around with ButterFest

816
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,900
and ZFS and you can set up some loopback devices,

817
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,380
you know, just make some raw files you treat as disks

818
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,160
with the loopback system in Linux,

819
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,900
which is super handy to play with.

820
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,760
You know, it's the Mount-O-Loop option

821
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,040
you may be familiar with.

822
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,500
And then yeah, you can set them up

823
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,920
and then play with whatever type of raid configuration

824
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,940
you might want, right?

825
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,620
Great way to start learning on ButterFest or ZFS tooling

826
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,140
without necessarily touching your real disks.

827
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,140
Yeah, and no big loss

828
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,940
if one of those loopback devices disappears

829
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,780
and you want to see how the system reacts.

830
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,060
Yeah, right, that's also, so yeah, exactly.

831
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,200
And then you can sort of modify things.

832
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,220
You can just write arbitrarily to it without worry

833
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,060
or take it offline entirely and see what happens.

834
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,620
And you know, ButterFest, it did degrade,

835
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,060
but we would have had to do like a full restore from backup,

836
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,760
which, you know, isn't, we should be able to do.

837
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,220
That's the point of having the backup,

838
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,900
but ultimately we decided that probably wasn't reasonable.

839
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,860
So why only one VDEV?

840
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,860
Because we did actually,

841
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,060
didn't we initially do four VDEV, six sticks?

842
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,220
Well, so it was basically just trying to figure out

843
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,620
what storage, right?

844
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,380
It ended up being the storage capacity metric.

845
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,460
Yes, right.

846
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,940
And so if we were splitting it up,

847
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,820
that just meant there were more total parity disks.

848
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,540
More parity disks, so there's less available space.

849
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,540
But with the amount of disks we have,

850
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,700
it actually would make a lot of sense

851
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,060
to split it up into multiple VDEVs

852
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,260
because then it kind of isolates

853
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,620
like the rebuild degradations to that VDEV

854
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,220
and doesn't screw with the entire.

855
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,380
Yeah, you can find some tips out there

856
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,760
for just how many you should stick to

857
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,740
for the various rate levels

858
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,340
and how to take your total desists

859
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,940
and place them up into VDEVs that'll perform nicely.

860
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,460
And then there's also of course concerns around

861
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,460
if you're trying to optimize for IOPS and stuff like that.

862
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,060
That wasn't our concern in this case,

863
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,020
but it gets complicated

864
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,260
and you definitely shouldn't do like we're doing.

865
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,180
Don't do it like we're doing.

866
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,100
Now here's something that you might wanna consider

867
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,860
and we're gonna just be honest with you

868
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,780
on how this part goes.

869
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,320
And we kind of have a luxury

870
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,860
because the old server hasn't crashed recently.

871
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,400
Doesn't mean we wanna take our time doing this,

872
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,500
but it means instead of just like whole hog

873
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,860
picking up the Docker environment

874
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,820
and dropping it on the new server,

875
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,860
which was what plan A was,

876
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,140
now we're thinking because they're both running,

877
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,900
why don't we do a application migration to Podman?

878
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,860
So we'll go from Docker in this migration

879
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,380
to Podman running on the openSUSE Tumbleweed

880
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,220
in the new setup.

881
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,300
We thought we didn't have enough to learn

882
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,100
with a new server operating system,

883
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,860
so why not introduce something new into the mix?

884
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,660
You know, really we've been, you know, I've been playing

885
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,660
with Podman a little bit on the side.

886
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,500
I think you have too, and it's come a long way.

887
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,060
It's been exciting to watch its development.

888
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,860
There's a lot of stuff to like about it,

889
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,820
especially with the mixed sort of changes

890
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,340
that the Docker test top world has been seeing lately.

891
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,780
So kind of felt like maybe this was just the excuse

892
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,460
we needed to really see.

893
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,740
You know, it's not, again, as we said,

894
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,420
like there's some stuff that needs to run,

895
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,820
but it's not exactly business critical day to day.

896
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,620
So we can have a little time here to try to figure out

897
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,420
and learn, frankly, learn a lot more about Podman

898
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,700
is also what we need to do here.

899
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,540
And then we have the luxury

900
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,140
that the production implementation is still running.

901
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,000
So we're gonna start with like a simple applications

902
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,020
and then kind of work our way up.

903
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,420
Eventually we get to a bunch of applications

904
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,380
that are all kind of intertwined

905
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,920
with a whole bunch of storage and all that kind of stuff.

906
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,480
And that's where we're gonna have to just move

907
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,140
like three or four things at a time.

908
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,060
But I think, although we haven't actually,

909
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,180
have we tried this yet?

910
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,420
I don't know, cause you might've been plugging away

911
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,340
at this before the show started,

912
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,620
but we're thinking because we were using

913
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,820
the Docker ZFS driver on Arch,

914
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,740
we have a sub volume for each Docker container.

915
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,700
Yeah, we've got, there's a lot of sub volumes.

916
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,020
So there's both the layer of, there's the volume layer

917
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,020
and a lot of ours are set up on that setup.

918
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,060
And then there's the sort of container storage layer

919
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,900
for the images and the current setup,

920
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,660
those are both on ZFS.

921
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,060
And so should we just be able to ZFS

922
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,460
send those to the new box?

923
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,460
Yeah, so the application data we can just do.

924
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,520
Yeah, that's gonna be nice.

925
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,900
And then it'll be a matter of starting the app in Podman

926
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,480
and just connecting it to its moved data, hopefully.

927
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,560
I mean, Podman's come a long way

928
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,740
in some of the Docker compatibility

929
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,020
and I have not really used it in anger or in production.

930
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,900
I don't think either of us have.

931
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,660
So that's, I think that's gonna be what's interesting

932
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,580
is to figure out what pieces move easily

933
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,460
because we've tested a few simple apps in the new setup

934
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,620
and they seem to be working just fine,

935
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,380
but nothing with complicated interdependencies

936
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,940
and networking and a whole bunch of state

937
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,980
that we're trying to migrate.

938
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,660
Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be interesting,

939
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,780
but I think it'll be good to learn and try something new.

940
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,380
No, I'll also be learning the Tumbleweed tooling

941
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,160
along at the same time.

942
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,620
So there's quite a bit actually,

943
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,940
there's a lot of moving parts to it.

944
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,860
It has been neat to see some of that integration though.

945
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,620
You know, like for instance, Podman has its EFS driver,

946
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,220
but it also has a ButterFS driver

947
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,500
and Tumbleweed has that set up for you out of the box.

948
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,140
Yeah, well, of course.

949
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,380
And so it's just been interesting

950
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,620
since we've kind of been, you know,

951
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,100
like we hacked on Snapper to our Arch setup.

952
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,500
And so it's one thing I'm excited to explore

953
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,260
in this new world is just some of those pieces

954
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,900
in a system that someone else has been thinking about

955
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,900
how to compose those pieces and work with ButterFS

956
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,700
and not just the stuff that we've come up with.

957
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,660
Then phase two-ish, I suppose,

958
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,900
after we get everything migrated

959
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,500
is going to be attacking this DR box.

960
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,700
We have a couple of routes we could go there.

961
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,700
We could do another Tumbleweed box

962
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,780
and just kind of keep them in sync,

963
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,100
or we could Proxmox that machine

964
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,800
and allocate a VM to be like a backup server

965
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,100
and do like some cron jobs to ZFS send.

966
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,780
I don't know if we have a complete picture

967
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,700
of how we wanna do that yet.

968
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,700
Like one thing we're considering is like sync it up here

969
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,940
and then Wes takes to his house

970
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,100
and it runs there as an actual legit

971
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,700
for realsies offsite backup.

972
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,540
What an idea!

973
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,700
That would be a big step up for that data.

974
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
There is like some stuff that we've just decided

975
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,900
like if a disaster strikes,

976
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,020
I guess we're just gonna lose this

977
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,660
because I mean, where do you wanna pay

978
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,100
for 20 terabytes of backup storage?

979
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,300
And we're adding to it every single episode.

980
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,540
Like it just gets crazy, right?

981
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,700
So this is a real solution for us now.

982
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,380
So if you have ideas or suggestions,

983
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,980
nicksonplug.com slash contact for that.

984
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,900
Oh yeah, I'm sure you guys have some very clever ideas.

985
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,400
Now that being said,

986
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,720
that seems like a pretty performant box

987
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,100
to just be doing backups.

988
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,380
Wes, do you think you'll have other plans for this thing?

989
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,220
Yeah, we got it right.

990
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,620
Something tells me we'll find some use cases.

991
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,260
That's kind of why I was thinking Proxmox

992
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,460
because you could have a lot of the storage

993
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,980
and like a tumbleweed VM

994
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,340
and then you slice off like the other stuff

995
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,620
because the other box that we're not using,

996
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,100
it has four Xeons in it.

997
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,820
And another like 700 gigs of RAM or something,

998
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,900
just a crazy amount of RAM.

999
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,660
Something tells me it doesn't need all of those

1000
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,300
for copying bytes off the network.

1001
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,260
Especially when they're gonna become one

1002
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,980
over at Comcast connection.

1003
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,000
So it does make me think like,

1004
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,220
one of the things Wes and I were talking about

1005
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,680
is offloading the CPU video encoding

1006
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,100
that we do in the cloud right now to one of those boxes.

1007
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,700
They also, these Dells let you set power caps,

1008
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,540
which is fascinating.

1009
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,580
So you can say, just don't let the system

1010
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,460
use more than 600 Watts or something.

1011
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,300
That's pretty nice.

1012
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,420
Maybe you don't always want that,

1013
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,240
but it's cool to have some of these more,

1014
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,540
you know, customizable options down at the firmware level.

1015
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,180
I noticed an option in there while we were playing

1016
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,020
to cap it by BTUs as well,

1017
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,460
which I thought was really fascinating.

1018
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:10,060
Yeah, I gotta say the SSD box is quite enough

1019
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
that you could have it on your desk

1020
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,900
when it's not under load.

1021
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,380
That's been pretty surprising too, yeah.

1022
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,620
It's also big enough to be your desk.

1023
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,580
That's true.

1024
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,180
It is a monster and they're heavy.

1025
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,480
That is a thing, but it's up and running.

1026
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,660
The migration is in progress.

1027
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,860
We're starting with like network test pinging applications,

1028
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,540
stuff that just as really simple,

1029
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,380
but has obvious application data history

1030
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,020
so we can verify that the migration worked correctly.

1031
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,120
And then we'll start moving over

1032
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,580
the more integrated tooling,

1033
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,160
things like NextCloud and our production tools

1034
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,820
and workflow things and media stuff.

1035
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:43,740
And I imagine we'll have it probably done

1036
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,700
within a couple of weeks.

1037
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,380
I mean, we're not in a rush,

1038
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,480
but once you get one or two of them going,

1039
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,460
it's just sort of rinse and repeat.

1040
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,620
Yeah, definitely.

1041
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,460
All right then, how about just a spot of housekeeping.

00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,260
at linuxunplugged.com slash matrix.

1056
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,340
Our matrix server is colony.jupyterbroadcasting.com.

1057
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,220
And you know, if matrix isn't your thing,

1058
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,540
we have a telegram group.

1059
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,660
It's always going, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

1060
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,180
We'd love to have you there.

1061
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,060
And don't forget our virtual lug meets on Sundays

1062
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,020
before the show.

1063
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,280
And we're going to be meeting on Tuesdays

1064
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,660
at the old showtime too.

1065
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,260
So go get your mumble set up, which is actually jitzy.

1066
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,580
This is practice, practice both, right?

1067
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,140
You know, get mumble installed.

1068
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,300
Maybe get your mic working.

1069
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,980
For goodness sake, it's 2022.

1070
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,540
Probably also install an audio editor,

1071
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,900
something you can record your mic

1072
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,340
and then listen back to and make sure you sound all right.

1073
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,260
Yeah, Audacity.

1074
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,100
There you go.

1075
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,920
It's free.

1076
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,760
Try it out.

1077
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,100
Goodness sake, it's 2022.

1078
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,940
Goodness sake.

1079
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,080
We've gotten a lot of great feedback.

1080
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,260
Here's a quick one that we can get into.

1081
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,460
Bedrick wrote in, he says, dear Linux Unplugged,

1082
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,100
you've talked about monetizing Linux desktop apps

1083
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,980
in Linux Unplugged 4.3.8.

1084
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,140
I would like to pay for applications I use,

1085
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,020
but I personally dislike the feeling of being forced to.

1086
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,540
My new year's resolution is yet again

1087
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,660
to go over the open source projects I use

1088
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,240
and set up donations.

1089
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,420
What I would personally like to see

1090
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,340
is a tool that makes it easier to donate

1091
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:39,500
without the hassle with individual project payment details.

1092
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,420
I imagine a GNOME software welcome screen

1093
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,220
to set up credit card details

1094
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,500
as a flat hub account or something similar

1095
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,740
and an autopay option with an opt out possibility.

1096
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,880
This autopay option would be default,

1097
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,860
regularly pay the recommended price

1098
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,380
for all apps installed on my system

1099
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,480
that satisfy a few defined conditions.

1100
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,220
One, the app is already installed

1101
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,180
for some minimum amount of time,

1102
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,740
so longer than a trial period, for instance,

1103
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,460
and is used frequently enough to be useful,

1104
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,020
like at least once a year or something.

1105
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,100
Some additional configuration would be appreciated,

1106
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,260
like global and per app configuration for the price

1107
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,260
as an absolute value or a factor of the recommended price,

1108
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,020
configuration of the trial period and usage frequency

1109
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,060
and some payment breakdowns.

1110
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,020
I feel like the Linux desktop community

1111
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,780
needs to feel in control and not be forced to.

1112
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,540
You know, I think we've seen various takes

1113
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,680
on some pieces of that.

1114
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,180
Nothing that's quite got all of it

1115
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,700
but more so really seems to have taken off.

1116
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,860
Yeah, open collective comes to mind,

1117
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,340
but it doesn't quite do it at this level.

1118
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,260
The days of what, Flatter, was it?

1119
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,700
Yeah, yeah, right.

1120
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,020
There's a few out there,

1121
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,340
and I don't think I'd want something,

1122
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,220
much like he doesn't want to feel forced to pay.

1123
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,680
I don't know if I agree with that take,

1124
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,580
but I understand the sentiment.

1125
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,460
I wouldn't really want this to be a GNOME software solution.

1126
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,060
Try as I might, I still struggle to use GNOME software,

1127
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,300
and I wouldn't want it to be something

1128
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,300
that only could be done in GNOME software.

1129
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,420
Now, Chris, you and I this morning

1130
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:10,660
were throwing around ideas around podcast networks

1131
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,460
and how they could monetize shows.

1132
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,820
Do you see any of that being applicable in this case?

1133
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,540
So next week, Dave Jones is gonna join us on the show,

1134
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,660
and Dave works with the Podcast Index

1135
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,980
and Podcasting 2.0 Initiatives.

1136
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,900
And one of the things Dave's gonna talk to us about

1137
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,860
is how they use the Bitcoin Lightning Network

1138
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,300
to pay content creators.

1139
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,580
And the idea is roughly,

1140
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,460
he's gonna tell us more about it,

1141
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,460
but from my rough understanding,

1142
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,860
you say you have a podcast app, an open source podcast app,

1143
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,500
and it's got a Bitcoin wallet in there.

1144
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,300
And what you do is you throw like 30 bucks of Satoshis

1145
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,000
in that wallet that's built into the podcast catcher.

1146
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,620
And then you go in there and you say,

1147
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,940
you send this amount to Jupiter Broadcasting,

1148
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,700
you send this amount to name your favorite podcast,

1149
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,980
and kind of like you might with a Patreon

1150
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,780
where you can kind of subscribe at different tiers.

1151
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,780
And then what the app does is it uses the Lightning Network

1152
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,780
to kind of stream Satoshis to the creator as you listen.

1153
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,060
So you set a threshold and you set a total amount,

1154
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,700
and then based on your listening,

1155
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,100
it funds the creators you're actively listening to,

1156
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,340
which I think is a really interesting thing

1157
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,160
because it's part of what they call a value for value model.

1158
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,900
And it could be applied to free software as well,

1159
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,340
I would think.

1160
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,260
I don't know if people wanna pay

1161
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,420
by their hour usage of software,

1162
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,260
but there could be something in there that says,

1163
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,900
hey, you used this editor for eight hours this week,

1164
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,060
or this month, or this year.

1165
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,580
Or you launched it 28 times this month,

1166
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,420
something like that.

1167
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,940
Would you like to send the average amount?

1168
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,820
Yeah, ways to lower that barrier in a practical way.

1169
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,340
Because then yeah, many of us mean well, right?

1170
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,680
But even when you are intentional enough

1171
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,500
to maybe think like, oh yeah, year-end things,

1172
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,140
I wanna donate and such,

1173
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,120
you might think about nonprofits in years,

1174
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,420
but how often are you also thinking of software?

1175
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,200
It just doesn't always easily happen

1176
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,460
if you don't actively do it.

1177
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,460
I like this idea of the Bitcoin wallet in the podcast app

1178
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,860
using the Lightning Network,

1179
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,000
because it's all free software, the entire stack,

1180
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,540
even the payment system is free software, all of it.

1181
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,620
And yeah, there's scammers out there

1182
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,640
that use this same stuff,

1183
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,740
but that's true for cash and everything else.

1184
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,100
And so there's something interesting there

1185
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,240
about monetizing free software

1186
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,380
with a free software currency

1187
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,980
that tends to grow in value over time.

1188
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,400
And doing it in a way that is transparent

1189
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,580
because everything on the blockchain is transparent.

1190
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,860
And so the project by the very use

1191
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,740
of a blockchain payment system is held accountable,

1192
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,380
or a podcast network is held accountable, right?

1193
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,860
Because it's all of the accounting

1194
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,300
is there on the blockchain.

1195
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,060
And there's something about free currency,

1196
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,900
free software, and a public ledger

1197
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,100
that seems like there's probably some kind of,

1198
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,300
as they would say, synergy

1199
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,060
that we just haven't really fully explored yet.

1200
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,620
Do you feel like these tools are ready

1201
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:07,860
for prime time action, like the Lightning Network and?

1202
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,760
Oh, sure, yeah.

1203
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,600
Oh, yeah.

1204
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,140
So well-tested and totally ready

1205
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:11,980
for us to take it on full speed?

1206
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,720
Yeah, I mean, like with the podcasting index,

1207
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,220
like that monetization system's

1208
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,580
been in practice for a bit now.

1209
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,400
Nice.

1210
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,740
Yeah, so maybe.

1211
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,020
Yeah, you never know.

1212
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,600
We could see something there or nothing, absolutely.

1213
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,560
It all happens and we still struggle

1214
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,940
to pay free software developers.

1215
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,380
Yeah, I mean, I think you're just trying to lobby

1216
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,940
to get people to implement your prediction.

1217
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,460
That's what's going on here.

1218
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,340
Oh, yeah, that's right, right.

1219
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:38,220
Although I didn't work NFTs, you see, that was, yeah.

1220
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,940
All right, so I have a pick that I feel like is

1221
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,520
the kind of pick you only really do on the show

1222
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,580
right after the holidays

1223
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,860
where people may have gotten a Kindle.

1224
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,860
So what I wanted to link in the show notes,

1225
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,640
and I know it's not for everybody,

1226
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,140
but it's a Kindle comic converter.

1227
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:55,100
It'll take like a JPEG or a PNG or a PDF

1228
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,100
of your comic that you might be reading,

1229
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,580
probably a Star Trek comic,

1230
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,540
and then it will convert it to a format that is readable

1231
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,100
on your new Kindle that you got

1232
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,280
without having to go through like some Kindle Cloud

1233
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,860
or Amazon authorization.

1234
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,220
And it's simply called Kindle Comic Converter.

1235
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,020
We'll have a link to the website

1236
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,940
or we'll have a link to the Flat Hub as well.

1237
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,080
Isn't the Kindle just one of those things,

1238
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,980
like so many of those that were,

1239
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,880
I'm sure there's plenty of open source behind it

1240
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,240
and the device works pretty nicely.

1241
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,100
I have one, I use it, I like eBooks,

1242
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,700
but it's just, I'm so grateful for open source things

1243
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,480
like this that can put you a little bit more in control

1244
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,500
because otherwise it's really very much feels

1245
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,820
like a locked-in ecosystem.

1246
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,140
I wonder if I could find our old

1247
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,100
Linux Action Show Kindle review.

1248
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,060
That was pretty rough.

1249
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,720
Linux Action Show is the very first Kindle.

1250
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,420
Yep, there it is, 13 years ago, there's us.

1251
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:48,460
I'm gonna put a link to this into the show notes.

1252
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,420
Wow, it's only two minutes long.

1253
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,700
I think it was an outtake, so it's not the full review,

1254
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,960
but it's pretty bad.

1255
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,340
I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

1256
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,740
Oh boy, I don't think I've seen this one.

1257
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,640
12 years ago, we were talking about

1258
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,460
the very first Kindle on the Linux Action Show.

1259
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,900
Season two.

1260
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,100
Yeah, that was just after we started calling it Seasons,

1261
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,480
which I think was around 100 episodes, I think.

1262
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,420
I don't remember for sure.

1263
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,260
So it was like 100 episodes in when we started.

1264
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,100
The whole thing is...

1265
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,380
Definitely a system that makes sense.

1266
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,980
Very foggy, it's very, very foggy.

1267
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,480
I have to be honest with you.

1268
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,980
Well, thankfully you documented it,

1269
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,020
so you can review it later.

1270
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,640
I look back and I go, who are those people?

1271
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,480
Who are they?

1272
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,020
What are they talking about?

1273
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,420
And every now and then I find myself agreeing

1274
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,100
with my past self and I realize,

1275
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,700
oh, I'm just like a robot.

1276
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,740
If you give me the same input,

1277
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,460
I pretty much give you the same output.

1278
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,820
Is that a good sign or a bad sign?

1279
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,980
I guess you're consistent.

1280
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,940
Yeah, I suppose on some things.

1281
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,540
Although you can find some reviews of me

1282
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,380
really dogging on Butterfess and Fedora,

1283
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,260
so some things do change.

1284
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,020
And more recent ones about Seuss,

1285
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,420
now that I think about it.

1286
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,300
If you'd like more show,

1287
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,580
remember that we do have a log

1288
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,740
that gets together every Sunday

1289
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,540
and now on Tuesdays at noon Pacific.

1290
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,620
If you're in the tech industry,

1291
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,280
make sure you're not missing linuxactionnews.com.

1292
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,180
There's a lot going on there

1293
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,940
that doesn't make it into this show.

1294
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,300
But now we have a new Same Bat Time.

1295
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,220
It's Sundays now at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1296
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,500
See you next week.

1297
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,820
Same Bat Time, Same Bat Station.

1298
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,660
There you have it.

1299
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,920
Of course, the show will just kind of come out

1300
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,120
like a little bit earlier in the feed,

1301
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,540
so for most of you out there, just a little bit sooner.

1302
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,220
Linux Action News will be towards the end of your week now,

1303
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,780
so make sure you're at linuxactionnews.com

1304
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,340
slash subscribe for that.

1305
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,900
Links to the things that we talked about,

1306
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,700
which is not much, not much,

1307
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,620
because it's, you know, it's a special episode.

1308
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:26,780
But we'll have those at linuxunplug.com slash 439.

1309
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,380
Yeah, anything else, gentlemen?

1310
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,220
No.

1311
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,140
It's been good.

1312
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:30,980
Good work, guys.

1313
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,820
Well, thank you.

1314
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,640
We got ourselves a new server.

1315
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,140
Yeah, and a new day.

1316
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,040
A new year.

1317
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,200
All right, everybody, thanks so much for joining us

1318
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,900
on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1319
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,700
See you right back here next Sunday.

1320
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:56,700
We'll be right back with another episode of Unplugged.

1321
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:22,580
All right, jbtitles.com, let's go vote, everybody.

1322
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,340
Go pick your title.

1323
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,180
You got something there, Bryn?

1324
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,420
What you got?

1325
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,020
Throughout all this discussion, I got really curious.

1326
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,060
Two things, I think.

1327
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,180
Okay.

1328
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,700
Maybe I'll throw them at you one at a time.

1329
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,540
Go for it, go for it.

1330
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,740
Okay, number one, what's gonna happen to the old server?

1331
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,020
Well, we've had someone who's requested it,

1332
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,420
so we might donate it to a listener.

1333
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,420
Oh, well, that's nice.

1334
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:43,860
It's like a full circle kind of thing.

1335
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,700
I like that.

1336
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,340
Yeah, so that's sort of plan A,

1337
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,420
although if they don't want it,

1338
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,420
then I haven't really figured out plan B yet.

1339
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,660
But that's plan A.

1340
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,780
Okay, I like plan A.

1341
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,620
All right, let's question two.

1342
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,980
Okay, question number two.

1343
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,720
It's a good question.

1344
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,940
How's Arch been?

1345
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,940
What's the debrief?

1346
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,660
Like, are you feeling like it did what it needed to?

1347
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,580
We should have done an Arch exit interview.

1348
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,500
Yeah, really.

1349
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,380
We should have done that,

1350
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,180
because I think it worked better than we expected.

1351
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,660
And we thought it'd be okay,

1352
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,580
but I think it was solid as hell,

1353
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,320
and it's not going out of production

1354
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,240
because of any Arch issue.

1355
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,380
It's because the hardware's dying.

1356
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,220
Yeah, really, right.

1357
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,700
We could have kept this train rolling.

1358
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,100
The will of the community in our vote.

1359
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,180
Yeah, and stepping up and saying,

1360
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,740
yes, you're gonna go this direction in the polls,

1361
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,980
so we're doing it,

1362
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,400
even though the lizards may have conspired

1363
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,760
to make sure the poll went their direction.

1364
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,860
I will say, you know, it was one of the,

1365
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,740
I've had a few personal Arch servers

1366
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,220
or similar type things in the past,

1367
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,380
but I think this was the lowest touch of those,

1368
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,500
which is not generally necessarily

1369
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,180
maybe what you think of in the Arch setup.

1370
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,840
So it was kind of a test of that kind of stability as well,

1371
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,500
because it was maybe monthly

1372
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,940
or maybe sometimes a little less on those updates

1373
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,780
that we did.

1374
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,600
Someone can do the math.

1375
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,820
But yeah, I think that worked pretty well too.

1376
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:54,160
I mean, I think just to recap,

1377
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,940
what made it work well was,

1378
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,000
we say it all the time,

1379
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,380
but put our FS on the route and not ZFS,

1380
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,780
because when the ZFS module a couple of,

1381
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,260
maybe three times on us,

1382
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,280
failed to build or install correctly,

1383
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,120
we could still boot the system.

1384
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,260
That could have been catastrophic otherwise.

1385
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,020
You fixed a little timing issue,

1386
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,380
so that way ZFS got mounted before the containers start.

1387
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,460
Oh yeah, just to make sure

1388
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,940
that was gonna play nicely together, yeah.

1389
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,420
Because, you know, that's the thing about Arch,

1390
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,020
is like, there's no distro maintainer,

1391
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,420
like, you know, kind of making sure that works.

1392
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,380
Like we had to figure that out on our own,

1393
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,380
because sometimes the Docker containers would start

1394
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:28,580
and the pool wouldn't be available,

1395
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,220
and they'd be like, where's my storage?

1396
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,260
And then things would be broken,

1397
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,420
but the applications would be running,

1398
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,220
so it's not immediately available or obvious.

1399
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,500
Yeah, but like, you know, we tweaked that ages ago.

1400
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Yeah, it just stayed.

1401
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,340
It just worked.

1402
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,380
It was never a problem again.

1403
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,140
And then I think the LTS kernel helped.

1404
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,160
We weren't taking advantage

1405
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,540
of the cutting edge kernel features.

1406
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,540
Not in that box.

1407
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,200
It got updated more than I expected,

1408
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,620
but it was point updates.

1409
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,340
And then I think, obviously,

1410
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,580
having our applications in containers

1411
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:59,060
and not like installed from the AUR or the Arch repository

1412
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:03,020
meant that the OS could pretty much roll independently

1413
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,740
and not affect the applications.

1414
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:08,260
And so we didn't have things like AUR installs breaking

1415
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,380
that no longer updated or anything like that.

1416
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,620
And I think that also contributed

1417
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,260
to being a successful Arch box.

1418
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,700
Are we gonna do some occasional like zipper live updates?

1419
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,600
Oh yeah, I think we should,

1420
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,020
because I mean, the whole thing is holding it accountable.

1421
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,660
And if it, you know, and not sugarcoating if it breaks

1422
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,880
and not hiding if it's been a big success

1423
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,460
and if it's been really great and, you know,

1424
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,940
we have to own that, then we own it.

1425
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,540
Either way, I think we do it publicly

1426
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,340
as a, you know, as sort of an example

1427
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,820
of how to run something so you don't have to, right?

1428
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,900
It's sort of how I always looked at it.

1429
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,180
Like we'll try this and we'll try it with something

1430
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,740
that really matters to us.

1431
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,580
So that way you listening can do it the right way

1432
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,100
and don't do like we do.

1433
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,540
And I think there's some value in that.

1434
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,940
We've gotten quite a bit of feedback

1435
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,900
in the last several months of people saying,

1436
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,460
oh yeah, I remember, you know,

1437
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,060
when I first caught some Linux unplugged

1438
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,180
and the thing that really grabbed me

1439
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,500
was you guys doing live Arch updates.

1440
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,180
We've gotten that so many times

1441
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,020
and it feels like it's both memorable

1442
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,020
and really valuable, perhaps.

1443
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,860
We'll see.

1444
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,980
Hopefully it's also fun and valuable with the SUSE setup.

1445
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,140
And I actually, I could imagine if it, you know,

1446
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,020
if it actually failed on us,

1447
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,900
it would like wreck the rest of the show.

1448
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,720
Like, what are we gonna do?

1449
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,900
Just keep on doing the show?

1450
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,180
That's a bummer, yeah.

1451
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,140
Yeah, we're bummed out.

1452
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,340
Like at worst, like we stop the show and fix the server

1453
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,300
and at best we keep going knowing the server's busted

1454
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,980
and we got a big job after the show.

1455
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,900
Wes will just do like his tap dance routine

1456
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,980
to fill the extra waves that we gotta fill for the show.

1457
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,460
You know, we should probably just set up a mic

1458
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,900
in the garage directly already.

1459
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,940
One of us just moves out there.

1460
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,700
You better get your finger on the beat button.

1461
00:51:43,700 --> 00:52:03,700
All right.
