1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,240
Do you guys remember your 2022 predictions we made?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,980
I try to blank those out just immediately after making them.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,580
That way, I'm surprised next year as well.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,380
Yeah, I feel like that's what I do.

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,680
But I don't I don't say I do it on purpose.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,220
It's just what happens.

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,620
I'm pretty sure, though, I predicted that Flat Hub would monetize.

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,260
Right. Didn't. Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,020
You sounds vaguely familiar.

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,460
Yeah. On that one for a while.

11
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,700
I guess I just wanted to bring that up so that way I could get an attaboy.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,440
But we're getting we're getting a real preview of what that's going to look like.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,000
And we're seeing some code from Purism and others to actually build in

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,400
purchasing capabilities in the GNOME software.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,400
And there is a beta version of Flat Hub that you can check out right now

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,540
if you want to see what it's like.

17
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,620
It's just a beta flat hub dot org.

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,640
And it's a new design.

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,120
And it's kind of more GNOME software ish for better or worse.

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,920
For example, let's look at the authenticator app, which helps you generate

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,100
two factor authentication codes.

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,760
When you scroll down, it has a layout and a feature set

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,740
and description set very similar to the way GNOME software does.

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,600
Not awful, because this aspect of GNOME software, I actually kind of like.

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,980
But it's yeah, it's a it's a change for sure.

26
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,740
But they're they're working towards making it possible for transactions.

27
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,840
And it seems like there's going to be a at least a somewhat

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,420
of support for pay for what you want model for Flat Hub to.

29
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,420
That's just right around the corner. That's pretty cool.

30
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,420
But do they have a dark mode?

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,900
They well, you know, they better.

32
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,960
I want me some dark mode, dark mode purchases.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,540
I could activate my dark reader.

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,700
You ready? This will this will make you feel better.

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll just go over there and I'll activate my own dark mode.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,600
Wow. There you go. Dark reader. Thanks, Chris. Much better.

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:59,880
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

38
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,020
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. And my name is Brent.

39
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,560
Hi, guys. Hello, gentlemen.

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,220
Oh, hi. Oh, there. Hello. Oh, that's good.

41
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,800
Oh, I'm glad you're here because we got a big show.

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,540
We have really spent the summer looking at these immutable Linux distributions.

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,020
Your silver blues, your Nix's after this summer, spending some time with these.

44
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,080
We think there's a good shot that this is the future of mainstream Linux.

45
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,980
I don't know about enthusiast Linux, but I think there's a good chance

46
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,460
this is what your average Linux user will get when they install Linux,

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,620
let's say, five, 10 years down the road.

48
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,420
But nothing is so perfect.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,360
It cannot be criticized, a wise man once said.

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,420
So today we'll tell you the five problems you can expect

51
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,140
when trying out Nix OS or another immutable Linux type distro like silver blue.

52
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,640
And there's some good. Obviously, we've talked about that.

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,780
But after spending some time with it, there's some things

54
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,000
we should probably tell you about, too.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,280
We have to give you the good and the bad.

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,580
Plus, after all of that, the breaking change that has Linux developers

57
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,180
so frustrated, one is actually saying the logical solution

58
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,320
is just to target wine when you want to build a Linux app.

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,780
Oh, no. We'll talk about that.

60
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,860
Yeah, then we'll round it all out with some boosts and picks and a lot more.

61
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,860
So before we go any further, let's bring in that virtual lug

62
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,800
time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

63
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,100
Hello, hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

64
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,300
Hi, Chris. Hi, Bryson. Hi, Brent.

65
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,360
Hello. If you'd like to join our mumble room, it's Linux unplugged.com

66
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,900
slash mumble for the info.

67
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,140
And then we're live Sundays, noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

68
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,540
Eastern. You can pop in there and get your thoughts on the show.

69
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,180
You just take me to the chat room.

70
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,540
Also, I'd love to say good morning to tail scale.

71
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,920
Have you tried out tail scale yet?

72
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,380
It's the best mesh VPN out there protected by WireGuard.

73
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,560
Oh, man, I have I have I have tail scale on everything.

74
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,400
I have tail scale on absolutely everything.

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,760
And I have turned off all inbound ports on my firewalls completely.

76
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,300
No more inbound ports. I love it.

77
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,500
It's going to change your networking game.

78
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,600
Go try it out for free on 20 devices.

79
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,380
Tail scale dot com and tell them some plugs that you go say good morning.

80
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,640
OK, so we talked about this a little bit on Linux action news,

81
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,840
but I wanted to expand the discussion here.

82
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,920
This is a tricky situation.

83
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,760
It involves G lib C and a new version was released.

84
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,060
And of course, the rolling distros get it first, like your arches.

85
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,220
Mm hmm. And it wasn't long after a new version of G lib

86
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,960
C, which just about all software on Linux depends on.

87
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,260
It wasn't long after that new release came out that ARCH users were discovering

88
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,080
that their video games with anti cheat were no longer working.

89
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,840
And Weston involves changes in this hash section of G lib C.

90
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,220
Right. Yeah, as as part of once you've got like got things linked up,

91
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,220
you've got your L file written on disk.

92
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,720
Well, you want to be able to quickly find the symbols contained there.

93
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,560
And so there's a nice little hash table, an ability to go quickly, look those things up.

94
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,660
There's an older style DT underscore hash, and then there's a new version DT underscore

95
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,460
Gnu underscore hash that's been around for a long time.

96
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,200
And at this point is sort of the de facto standard for most things compiled with

97
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,080
G lib C and the way most things have been shipping. But up until recently,

98
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,880
the way configuration was run at various build times and library distros and upstream,

99
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,080
it meant you would get both versions of that hash table by default in a recent version.

100
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,160
They were dropping the old style one. It was like, hey, look, it seems like

101
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,200
everyone's been adding our new version for ages now.

102
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,200
It's been over a decade. We don't really let you know, saves a little bit of disk space.

103
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,000
We can just drop it. We're not interested in maintaining this here.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,500
Any longer, at least not have it as a default option.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,900
And then we find out that, yeah, it turns out some things were still using it.

106
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,900
Yeah, specifically vidya games, probably other ones, too, though.

107
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,920
We know about a library that was broken that also involves graphics.

108
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,220
But the reality is, is that when it does ship to all the other distributions out there,

109
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,620
we'll discover more things that break. Right.

110
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,920
The guess what? A lot of a lot of gamers like Arch these days.

111
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,120
So the rolling distros got it first. But no doubt other software will break as well.

112
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Well, and you know, Arch also is usually it doesn't they're not carrying a lot of changes and things.

113
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,420
So when an upstream default does change, they don't often have like a ton of patch sets against that.

114
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,620
Right. So it's whatever whatever happens upstream.

115
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,420
Yeah, although that'll be changing. They will be carrying their own patch set for this.

116
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:16,120
Other distributions will have to as well. It's part of a bigger discussion.

117
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Valve even offered to help with some of this because obviously they're concerned it breaks a lot of their stuff.

118
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:29,220
And it actually touches on what makes Linux good and bad as a platform to ship applications on.

119
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,620
And we often talk about breaking changes from the kernel's perspective.

120
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,020
And we talk about Linus's strong stance on never breaking user space.

121
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:44,120
That matters. But if some of the other fundamental things like G Lib C don't follow that same philosophy,

122
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,620
you can't really tell application developers it's a great stable platform with non-breaking changes.

123
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,620
And so you'll see this is where distributions play a role in the Linux ecosystem.

124
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,620
Distributions are going to have to step up and start patching G Lib C to support both the original version

125
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,620
and the GNU version of this hash section.

126
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,120
And that'll just be one more thing they have to maintain now because upstream isn't really interested in maintaining the old thing.

127
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,620
And these anti-cheat software makers who are mostly Windows developers,

128
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,620
they're not interested in making a change for the way G Lib C now does things.

129
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,620
Like it's just a total non-starter for them.

130
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,620
And so this has led one of the Proton developers who's well respected to just come out and say,

131
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,620
the only logical thing to target Linux when you're an application developer,

132
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:41,620
if you want to guarantee years of compatibility, is target the Win32 API on Linux and use one.

133
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,620
They say, these problems just happen all the time on Linux.

134
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,620
Different parts of the Linux stack will break.

135
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,620
This is most likely never going to change.

136
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:59,620
And so therefore, Win32, aka Wine, is the only stable ABI on Linux.

137
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,620
And they kind of wrap it all up with some final thoughts.

138
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,620
They say, I think this whole situation shows why creating native games for Linux is challenging.

139
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,620
It's hard to blame developers for targeting Windows and then relying on Wine and Friends.

140
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,620
It's just more stable and much less likely to break and stay broken.

141
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,620
That's pretty damning.

142
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,620
And it's hard not to say they're wrong when this whole breakage situation is going down right now.

143
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
I mean, who knows how it'll end up.

144
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,620
Yeah, although I mean, I think maybe we should be careful about what kind of applications we're talking about.

145
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,620
It's not like this broke a whole bunch of these common Linux apps.

146
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,620
There are some.

147
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,620
In one sense, it's almost not surprising, right?

148
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,620
Like a lot of this, we're not used to shipping this kind of application on Linux distribution.

149
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,620
I mean, we're getting there and it's getting better.

150
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,620
And this definitely is causing problems.

151
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,620
But we're used to just having software come from distros where things get built consistently, right?

152
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,620
That they all get integrated together.

153
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:02,620
And so having compatibility for random binary applications across time has not always been the same kind of focus

154
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,620
that admittedly and we should give credit to Microsoft has had in the Windows world.

155
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,620
Again, not as a judgment, just like in this sense, to me, it's not really that surprising because it's kind of a, you know,

156
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,620
it's just not what people have really thought about.

157
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:22,620
You could understand how Windows developers specifically in the gaming area might be a little unfamiliar with this type of approach

158
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,620
where they are a little bit more familiar with Microsoft's type of approach, which has been maybe more accommodating.

159
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620
And I think you could argue both.

160
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:39,620
This is a decade old hash function that has been replaced and literally just about everything else in the world is not using this.

161
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,620
But Brent, don't you think this is sort of like a clear indicator?

162
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,620
When we've had all of these discussions about is the distro still necessary?

163
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,620
Can people just build it from scratch if there's an enthusiast?

164
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,620
What's the role of the Linux distribution with containers and all of that?

165
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,620
To me, this seems like pretty clear.

166
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,620
There's still a role for distribution maintainers to play here.

167
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:04,620
Well, and I wonder if that role, you know, has it seen a bit less attention these days?

168
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,620
Like I know flat packs and stuff solve similar ish problems by bundling libraries and stuff.

169
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,620
So I wonder, do we have less maintainers kind of looking at stuff?

170
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:21,620
Or is this a problem of like using some kind of deprecated software for something that maybe you should have targeted differently?

171
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,620
I wonder if that's the case, too.

172
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:30,620
I mean, it seems like there's a lot of those aspects, it seems also that, you know, we're used to working within a sort of larger free software community.

173
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:37,620
So it might be clear for distro maintainers or people who work with like the GNU folks or things that like, oh, yeah, of course, this is the standard that is now being used.

174
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:46,620
But if you're some third party who just went and found some like, you know, sysv, compact, you know, general guide to working with this libc, oh, I need to go look up some symbols.

175
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,620
Oh, yeah, GT hash, that seems like the thing that's been here forever.

176
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,620
I'm going to use that.

177
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:56,620
You're not really plugged in on the same level. And so our normal methods of sort of like, look, we we added this, we gave you all a decade.

178
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,620
It seemed like we were cool. We'd given you a time for backwards compatibility.

179
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:06,620
And then also with some things, this is not maybe for anti cheap, but just in games in general, sort of class of application that just gets made.

180
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,620
And then there's not once the update stop, that game is just done.

181
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,620
And that's another thing that you don't just don't run that many things like that.

182
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:20,620
Well, and developers have, you know, such a reputation for just voluntarily adopting new technologies and new functions without being forced to do it like that's the thing.

183
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,620
Of course, if they didn't have to, they didn't stop using it. Why would they make that change?

184
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,620
It's just that's the sort of thing that is just foregone conclusion in the world of development.

185
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:37,620
I actually think there is something to this win 32 is the only stable ABI, but I think it's actually less and less of a problem than ever.

186
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,620
And I think, Brent, you just touched on it there with Flatpak, and I will admit to an ignorance here.

187
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,620
And so if someone knows that's listening, maybe they're in the live chat or boosted in.

188
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,620
If I'm using the Flatpak version of Steam and Proton.

189
00:11:51,620 --> 00:12:03,620
Are they or could they just ship their own version of Gillib C or is Gillib C such a fundamental library to the way everything works that that's outside the scope of Flatpak?

190
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:11,620
I think I saw that they had an older one still, so I hadn't gotten to this version yet, at least in the race of this time of this most recent discussion.

191
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,620
The runtime ship is on Gillib C as well as Mesa and generally everything else.

192
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,620
Everything from Gillib C, everything apart of the kernel is been from scratch on the ground up.

193
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,620
So this thing wouldn't happen.

194
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:35,620
You wouldn't have an issue running against a new Gillib C on the host as long that you could like start namespace and stuff.

195
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,620
So I could be OK since I'm using a Flatpak version of Steam.

196
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:52,620
Yes, totally. It's still I think in the 22 of 08 release that's about to be released like in a couple of days when we will update also the Steam Flatpak.

197
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,620
Because it's one of the main things we test when we release new runtimes.

198
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,620
We are sticking to Gillib C 2.35 and that was like way before any of this broke up.

199
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,620
Just like didn't manage to update on time.

200
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,620
You know, I have to say and this isn't like a fanboy based decision and this is totally just made out of practicality.

201
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:21,620
But my mentality now, especially when I'm building the next OS based desktop is there has to be a justification why I wouldn't use a Flatpak.

202
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,620
Because they've worked so well for me and they're so easy to update and maintain.

203
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,620
And Flat Hub is such a quick resource to go collect everything really quick and install it all.

204
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,620
And especially once you've hit a critical mass of like I'm using enough Flatpak.

205
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,620
It's like, well, I'm always installing Flatpaks now. So, of course, I've got Flathub configured.

206
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,620
It's all just ready to go. Click, click, click, click.

207
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,620
And so I mean, I guess I'm shocked how well Steam has worked.

208
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:46,620
But I have run into problems and we will get to that when we get to our five issues with Nix.

209
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:54,620
Now, Chris, did this affect the Steam Deck at all? Because you mentioned it showed up on Archverse and I wondered, was that a thing on the Deck?

210
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,620
No. And doesn't this kind of even underscore why Valve chose to just make their own distribution?

211
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,620
Is to avoid just these kinds of problems.

212
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,620
They'll never ship this issue in Steam OS. So the Deck will never have this problem.

213
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:15,620
It's incredible what Proton and Wine have done so that we can, you know, we can just steal the stability of another platform's implementation stuff to run on our own.

214
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,620
And have it work and paper over some of our own native issues.

215
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:26,620
But we've also got kind of the confluence of other technologies like, you know, various containerizations and namespacing that makes it somewhat easier to have these things.

216
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,620
You know, you can have the whole Steam environment. You can have Flatpaks containing this stuff.

217
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,620
Like, we just have a lot of options now.

218
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,620
Yeah. Minimac, you think that Windows isn't necessarily immune from this type of problem?

219
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
Yeah, that was a question I had.

220
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:47,620
Couldn't that happen in the Windows environment too? But the big difference is that every company is publishing their software in Windows.

221
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,620
They just get a notice before and they can adapt before that change happens.

222
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:57,620
Yeah, I suppose there probably is a more formalized developer notification and outreach.

223
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,620
That's just not really a scalable solution in free software, right?

224
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:08,620
Because the GLibc maintainers are probably not even thinking about anti-cheat when they're making this change.

225
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:19,620
And they're not really at a nine-to-five job where they're going to reach out to the stakeholders and hold a meeting where they can all jump on Zoom and discuss each one of their key points.

226
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,620
That's just not going to happen in this environment.

227
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:29,620
Well, and there's some nuance there too, you know, that some of them on the mailing list point do try to point out that like, look, we do generally take ABI breaks seriously.

228
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,620
It's not that we're against, you know, we just hadn't really thought of this in that way before.

229
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,620
You know, like the way that the ELF ends up on the disk was not really part of what we thought of as the GLibc ABI in the past.

230
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,620
And then there's some questions about like, OK, well, does that prevent us to add another possible hash scheme in the future?

231
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:55,620
If EAC were to update to DT GNU underscore hash, and then how would you handle a similar, like, can we give it another 15 years and then switch that out to an even better implementation or are we stuck like totally frozen forever?

232
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:03,620
I mean, OK, so to their credit, they do seem to be listening. But to Minimac's point, I do think a company would probably have communicated this better.

233
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,620
So that's probably a good way to frame it. It's not that this thing would never happen on Windows.

234
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,620
We see these kinds of changes. It's just there's maybe Mac OS as a good example, right?

235
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,620
They drop things, make you shift to new APIs all the time.

236
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,620
Yeah, but I think they'd probably announce that at WWDC, right?

237
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,620
So you'd have the summer to update your app. And for a lot of developers, that's not enough time.

238
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:30,620
But there is that window there. And I think everyone has has plainly said that clearly there's like not some not great docs on this.

239
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:39,620
And like clarity around what the upstream considers as like the standards, even if it's implicitly known in the community, probably should do a better job there, too.

240
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,620
Yeah. So if you're on a distribution that updates frequently and you like your steam games, just keep your eyes out for this.

241
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,620
Distribution maintainers are already kind of adapting, but it's just something you need to be aware of.

242
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,620
And if you're on an LTS or something like that, then you get to sit back and laugh at the rollers for a little bit.

243
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,620
Enjoy this for a moment.

244
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,620
Linode.com slash unplugged. Go there to get a hundred dollars and support the show.

245
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,620
It's a great way to really get started and deploy something you've been meaning to try for a long time.

246
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,620
No judgment there. We've all got projects we've been meaning to get to.

247
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,620
And Linode's probably one of the best places you could consider to deploy.

248
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:25,620
So they started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing back before you called it cloud computing kids.

249
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,620
And now nearly 19 years later, they're rocking harder than ever.

250
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,620
They've got 11 global data centers. They've got the fastest machines in the biz.

251
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,620
In fact, they recently did MVME upgrades.

252
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,620
And I still am getting emails from listeners out there that are just completely blown away.

253
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:47,620
I think the email usually starts with, holy crap, I had no idea how much better things would be with an MVME drive.

254
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,620
You know, I get it because you think it's a web server. I'm connecting over, you know, a slow Internet connection.

255
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,620
How how much better could it be? Oh, no, no. Oh, no. More IOPS is always better.

256
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,620
That's where they get the AMD epic processors, too. They are their own ISP.

257
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,620
The list really goes on when it comes to Linode.

258
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:13,620
I think I could sit here and I could just say I could sum up like the key thing that Linode does is they run Linux really well in the cloud.

259
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,620
That's like the key thing. And then they build a bunch of stuff around that that makes it even better.

260
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,620
I absolutely love their cloud dashboard.

261
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,620
I think it's the best in the business combined with the best API in the business with a command line client with a ton of libraries.

262
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,620
So you could just use Python or I don't know, maybe you're a Rust person.

263
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,620
Yeah, they got a gorgeous API with lots of libraries ready to go.

264
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,620
But you guys, if you listen to the show, you know what's up.

265
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,620
You know how much I love the S3 compatible object storage.

266
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,620
We use it as the back end for next cloud. We use it as the back end for our Jupiter tube.

267
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,620
We just use it as the back end for all kinds of stuff, just even moving files around.

268
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,620
Like when we go to an event and we record a bunch of audio or video, we sort that all out and put it up on the object storage.

269
00:18:52,620 --> 00:19:00,620
They got cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager, Kubernetes support, Ansible support, Terraform support.

270
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,620
I mean, it's just on and on. And it starts at like one click deployment type stuff.

271
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,620
If that's what you're comfortable with all the way down to Nuke and Pave and build it up from the ground yourself.

272
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:16,620
They've even got physical boxes and they have pricing 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the other major cloud providers out there.

273
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:24,620
And if you ever run into any trouble, they've got the best support in the business by phone or by ticket 24 seven three sixty five.

274
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,620
No other cloud providers architected in a way to make that sustainable.

275
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:33,620
But Linode is. Go try it for yourself. See why we've been raving about it. Get 100 bucks and support the show.

276
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,620
You do that by going to Linode dot com slash unplugged.

277
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,620
Get 100 dollars for 60 days to try it out to see what we've been talking about.

278
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:47,620
One more time, support the show by going to Linode dot com slash unplugged.

279
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,620
It's been a minute since we've cleaned up around here, so we have a few things to tend to.

280
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,620
Why is there so much straw on the floor?

281
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:03,620
The last few days to get your name in the hat for the JPL tour, like literally, if you're listening to this as we publish only a few days left,

282
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:12,620
we're going to be rolling the dice and picking 15 names to join us at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory September 29th as the finale.

283
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,620
Actually, not quite the finale because we have we have two meetups after that.

284
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,620
But a key moment in our road trip. Nice save. Nice save, Chris.

285
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,620
I imagine we probably have more than 15 people who have submitted, but not more.

286
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,620
I wouldn't expect a ton more because you have to be in the area. So how many responses have we gotten so far?

287
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,620
Forty nine as of whatever, five minutes before we started the show today.

288
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,620
Those are pretty good odds. That is pretty good.

289
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,620
Those are. So you still got to eat like if you're listening when we're live, you got a couple more days.

290
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,620
What do you pick a day?

291
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:47,620
I feel like Wednesday when you and I are recording land, we'll we'll we'll run the bot to do the pick.

292
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,620
Well, all right. We'll do the computations. So you have till Wednesday the week.

293
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,620
This is publishing Wednesday, the 24th. Yes. Linux unplugged dot com slash JPL for that.

294
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:02,620
But we have a bunch of other meetups. Portland area, Southern Oregon area, Northern California area.

295
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,620
We'll have another meetup in Southern California. So we'll also have micro meetups if you're in the area when we're driving around.

296
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,620
So meetup dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting for all that.

297
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,620
And then if you're a local and you want to chat about details or you have suggestions

298
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,620
or you want to get the four one one on what's really going on, some Brent gossip.

299
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:26,620
Go to bit dot l y slash West Coast crew. That's our matrix room dedicated to the West Coast.

300
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,620
Then also just a little production note for next week.

301
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:34,620
We're wrapping up our tour of Immutable Linux distros with a look at endless OS and a special guest.

302
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,620
So if you'd like to chat endless OS, maybe join the Mumble Room and come in here and toss your thoughts.

303
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:48,620
Yeah. Yeah. Go grab it. We'll be chatting about it next week. Little heads up on the program and notes right there.

304
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,620
And with that, we have something new. We're going to do our baller boosts right here.

305
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,620
We're changing up the way we do boosts on the show in a big way.

306
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,620
I will tell you more about that in a little bit.

307
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,620
But I wanted to start with a couple of baller boosts that came into the show this week.

308
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,620
And our first one is the largest boost I think the show's ever received.

309
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:11,620
It was actually spread across five amazing boosts. But one of the things we're trying to do is make this a little tighter, a little more condensed.

310
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:17,620
So I added it all up. Lo Palm boosted in with two hundred and fifty thousand sacks.

311
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:22,620
Because I'm a back home baller in pajamas that cost ten dollars.

312
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,620
Tell my mother that I love her more than any freaking other. That's the life of a back home baller.

313
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,620
All right. Officially a back home baller in our report. That is impressive.

314
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:37,620
Lo Palm also signs all of his boosts with a lull face and a palm tree, which I like a lot.

315
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,620
I didn't put them all in here, but there was a lot of palm trees in our boost feed this week.

316
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,620
Lo Palm writes, Thanks for covering Nick's. It made me really check it out this time and I love it.

317
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,620
I also wanted to chip in some gas money for Brent.

318
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,620
Oh, thanks.

319
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,620
He notes that he normally uses Pocket Cast. That's a really popular one.

320
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,620
But I'm trying out Breeze for the boosts.

321
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,620
And now I've even figured out how to set my username. I hope it shows up in the boosts.

322
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,620
It does, Lo Palm. Thank you very much.

323
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:10,620
I like I think he added the emojis because earlier he hadn't figured out how to change his username.

324
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,620
So I'll just sign. Yeah, it's my signature move. I like it.

325
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,620
I'm also glad that putting emojis in there doesn't break the system.

326
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:22,620
You know, I think that's also it's nice to know. I wasn't sure.

327
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,620
So now we do know. And then we got one other baller boost this week from TomatoDeer, 46,000 sats.

328
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,620
Because I'm a back home baller. If I want something, I just holler.

329
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,620
He wanted to boost in and support the show and also pass along his perfect Linux setup.

330
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,620
So you ready for this, gentlemen? I think I'm ready.

331
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,620
Yeah, lay it on us.

332
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,620
Starts with a GNU slash Linux base. Oh, great. Of course.

333
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:48,620
Add a little wire guard. Oh, OK.

334
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:54,620
Put a little jellyfin on there. Bitwarden. Oh, plasma desktop. MPV for your media.

335
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,620
Definitely. Emacs and Vim. Why not both? Sure.

336
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,620
Yeah, I guess. Right. Oh, throw a nano in the mix, too. Oh, Galatarian.

337
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:08,620
OK, OK. One Chris over right there. You know what? Let's be honest.

338
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,620
That's how it should be. Why not all three? Right.

339
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,620
I don't have to be text editor monogamous, but a little VSCode on there, too.

340
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,620
Now I just want to know how much disk space nano is taking up on my box all the time.

341
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,620
And then, yeah, you know it, of course. He's also got SSH on there.

342
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,620
That, he says, is the perfect Linux stack.

343
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
Lean and mean. I like it.

344
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,620
Thank you, Ballers.

345
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,620
All right, so let's talk about five problems that we've come across while using Nix OS.

346
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,620
And I think these are probably almost universally true for all immutable Linux's.

347
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,620
And it's something you should be aware of.

348
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,620
A couple of these might be Nix specific, but, you know, like we've talked a lot about the positives.

349
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
And on the whole, we are very happy.

350
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,620
You know, been gushing a bit, you might say.

351
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,620
But I feel like we also should be honest and talk about where things can be a little different.

352
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,620
I think this is the most obvious one, but it's the one we should start with.

353
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,620
You got to configure, like, everything.

354
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,620
Isn't that the feature as well?

355
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,620
They do have a graphical installer, which will set up some of the basics.

356
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,620
But, like, every application.

357
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
I'm still impressed that's possible, even.

358
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,620
Yeah, every service, everything you install will just be defaults in each setup.

359
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,620
And sometimes this bites you, like I installed Plasma.

360
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,620
And, you know, I was a little underwhelmed with the look.

361
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,620
The fonts didn't look quite right.

362
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,620
It just didn't seem like any, well, nobody really touched it, for better or for worse.

363
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:32,620
I was surprised, especially in Nix OS itself, how some things were kind of left like that.

364
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,620
And then a few others were very thoughtfully integrated.

365
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,620
You know, like some of the system level plumbing, I guess, gets the, is often like, you know,

366
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,620
you don't have to worry about, it's not archery.

367
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,620
You've installed something and you're manually enabling stuff, right?

368
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,620
You just sort of tell Nix OS, like, hey, I want this thing both installed and to be operating.

369
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,620
Yeah, right.

370
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:56,620
But then, as you say, there's a lot of, like, the user level stuff that just is not, hasn't been pre-configured for you

371
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,620
in the way that, like, a desktop focused distribution often does, I guess.

372
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
Yeah.

373
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:07,620
So there's that element, although there's generally guides for most of this stuff, for better or for worse.

374
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,620
I don't know if the documentation I'd say is great.

375
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,620
I think the ArchWiki is actually much more effective as a tool for getting the system configured.

376
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,620
There's extensive documentation for Nix, but in my opinion, it kind of lives in that uncanny valley

377
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:28,620
where it gets a lot, but then it just says things and has terms where if you're not familiar with Nix,

378
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,620
you're like, I don't know what that means.

379
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,620
I don't know what to do next.

380
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,620
I literally have, I feel like there's almost always some assumed knowledge in every single one of the guides

381
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,620
where I get to it, I'm like, OK, so now I've got to go figure out what they're talking about here

382
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,620
by reading, like, three other forum posts, that way I get an average of what everybody's saying

383
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,620
so I can kind of try to get the right thing and then come back and continue.

384
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
And I find that really frustrating.

385
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,620
Also, like, there'll often be examples and it's just an example in a vacuum and doesn't consider, like,

386
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,620
what else you might have set up and configured and doesn't work in, like, most production scenarios.

387
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,620
And then so the example isn't really any good.

388
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,620
So those two things combined that you have to configure everything and the documentation is good,

389
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,620
but, like, that final 10% is really missing.

390
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,620
I think there's, like, a certain spikiness sometimes to the difficulty where, like, most of the time,

391
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,620
and it seems to be just getting a lot better, especially recently, you know, it's like, oh, this is real easy,

392
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:23,620
I'm on the happy path, I just, you know, I just type that I wanted this in and it's working and it's all set up

393
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,620
and robust and great, and then occasionally you just hit a pothole and then you're, like,

394
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:32,620
falling six layers down the abstraction stack and you're learning about this functional language

395
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,620
to define your builds and then sometimes if you're doing something weird or cross-compiling,

396
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:42,620
like, you have to remember that compilers are involved and build tool chains and that's just another,

397
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,620
it's all great and very powerful and it enables clearly a lot of, like, the magic of Nix,

398
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,620
but sometimes that's not really what you want.

399
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:55,620
Yeah. The Nix Nerds Matrix chat room has saved me in those situations several times.

400
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,620
We are very lucky to have that, that's for sure.

401
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:04,620
All right, this next one. This is going to sound weird, but if you've never used Nix, you might not expect this.

402
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,620
You can't just download a binary file and run it. Like, you don't just download something,

403
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,620
make it executable, and then run it.

404
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
You mean my curl pipe bash is broken?

405
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,620
That ain't going to work because, like, this thing is living in basically a blank environment.

406
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,620
It doesn't even know what loader to use to launch the binary.

407
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,620
It is, because it hasn't been defined by the overall Nix system, it exists basically in a vacuum.

408
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:33,620
And there are a lot of ways to solve this problem, including ways to spin up environments on the fly,

409
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,620
on demand, that do have everything you need.

410
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:41,620
But it seems that the, like, just sort of lazy practical way that a lot of Nix users have solved this,

411
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:48,620
which isn't ideal, but oddly works well, is they've just installed the Steam Dash run package.

412
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:53,620
Steam Dash run, as you would expect, is basically a little mini environment

413
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,620
that has all the essentials you need to run a binary on Linux.

414
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,620
And so you Steam run binaries that you download, doesn't have to be games,

415
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,620
doesn't have to do anything with Steam, you don't even have to have Steam installed.

416
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,620
You just need Steam run.

417
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,620
And then you can run any binary you want, but it's not really the blessed way.

418
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,620
You're not really supposed to be doing it that way, and the documentation covers this.

419
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,620
You don't say.

420
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,620
But I have to tell you, I understand why.

421
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,620
But boy, was I a little dumbfounded the first time I downloaded a binary.

422
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,620
I think it was something for production that we use that isn't packaged.

423
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,620
And I can't remember, because Reaper is packaged, so I can't remember what it is.

424
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,620
And I downloaded it, and it just doesn't work.

425
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,620
You try to run it, you're like, what?

426
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,620
And, you know, of course, the first thing I do is check the permission.

427
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Does it have the executable bit?

428
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,620
Yes, it does.

429
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,620
All right.

430
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,620
Okay.

431
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,620
All right.

432
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,620
So I start going over to Google.

433
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,620
You know, can't run binary, and then it auto completes in Nix OS.

434
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,620
And I'm like, uh.

435
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,620
Yeah.

436
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,620
This is a thing.

437
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,620
So that's a problem.

438
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,620
It's totally solvable.

439
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,620
You'll understand why once you get into Nix.

440
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,620
It is a thing, but it'll throw a curveball at you.

441
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,620
Right.

442
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,620
And if you don't need it, you know, there's also containers that are easily supported

443
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,620
if you're doing something on the server side.

444
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,620
Yeah.

445
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:15,620
And honestly, 90% ish of everything I'm using is flat packs these days.

446
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,620
And those are fine.

447
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Just zero problem there.

448
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,620
So instead of learning how to use Nix and write Nix expressions, you've just learned

449
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,620
how to make flat packs.

450
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,620
Well, I had to learn for VS Code because VS Code I tried as a flat pack, and I had to

451
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,620
give it the old thumbs down.

452
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,620
Yeah, that one's tricky in a flat pack, unfortunately.

453
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,620
For basic stuff, obviously, it works just great.

454
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,620
But once you need some, you know, certain runtimes or fancy config stuff.

455
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,620
And this is true for like VS Codeium as well, if you're trying to use the non-Microsoft

456
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,620
version, if there is such a thing.

457
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,620
The less Microsoft.

458
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,620
And this one is like, choose your compromise.

459
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,620
And if you're a big VS Code user, this is really frustrating.

460
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,620
So it doesn't work great as a flat pack because there's certain things you don't get access

461
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,620
to, certain plugins, certain file system things.

462
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,620
Whatever, no big deal, install it as a package.

463
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,620
Well, that's not going to work so great, Chief.

464
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,620
Like, say you want to install a plugin using the VS Code built-in plugin stuff.

465
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,620
I do.

466
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,620
There's a lot of nice plugins in there.

467
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Yeah, those extensions and whatnot.

468
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,620
Yeah, that's not going to work, Chief.

469
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,620
Sorry about that.

470
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,620
You're not going to do that.

471
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,620
In fact, if you do, you'll install some stuff that doesn't work correctly with the underlying

472
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,620
Nix system and it's just going to get really, really shaky, really fast.

473
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,620
There's two ways you can solve this.

474
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,620
One that I did first and worked for a long time was just there is a VS Code with a bunch

475
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,620
of great extensions installed and ready to go.

476
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,620
Ready to go.

477
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,620
Good stuff.

478
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:41,620
And then if you have, like I have the VS Code sync set up, if you sync it and it supports

479
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,620
those extensions, they'll sync over, they'll get set up on you.

480
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,620
I had most everything I wanted.

481
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,620
But then I got crazy and I wanted to do things like I wanted to add an extension to support

482
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,620
.desktop files and things like that.

483
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,620
Look at you wanting a polished system over there.

484
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,620
Mm-hmm.

485
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,620
And so for a moment it was all good.

486
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,620
I installed the extension to edit.desktop files.

487
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,620
I closed VS Code, opened it again, and the extension was gone.

488
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,620
And I thought, oh, I thought I installed that.

489
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,620
That's funny.

490
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,620
Huh.

491
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,620
No desktop file.

492
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,620
I had to install that.

493
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,620
Okay.

494
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,620
Good.

495
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,620
All right.

496
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,620
There it is.

497
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,620
Sweet.

498
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,620
All right.

499
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,620
So I close VS Code.

500
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,620
I open it up again.

501
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,620
The extension's gone.

502
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,620
What the?

503
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,620
All right.

504
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,620
Go over to Google.

505
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,620
VS Code Nix OS extensions not and it automatically shows not staying installed or whatever.

506
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,620
Like, oh, okay.

507
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,620
Once again, this is a thing, of course.

508
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:35,060
So then I discovered there is a VS Code FHS compatible package.

509
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:40,740
And the FHS compatible package, which is like a file system hierarchy standard or something

510
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,740
like that.

511
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,740
Mm-hmm.

512
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,820
That will let you install any extension you want, any old arbitrary way you want, just

513
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,620
like you would on a regular system.

514
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,300
But, you know, it's little things like that that you have to catch and adapt to.

515
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,860
And today it's VS Code.

516
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,260
Tomorrow it might be Reaper, right?

517
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
We'll just see.

518
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,260
We'll see how that goes.

519
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,780
It's just that element of it.

520
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:06,900
My final issue, and I'm curious to know what you guys think about this one, because I feel

521
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,060
like this is both a problem with Nix and perhaps, like, it suffers from this the least out of

522
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,100
all the Linux distros.

523
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,420
I'm genuinely concerned that I'm going to build up a server environment in the future

524
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,060
around Nix OS that will deploy a bunch of stuff.

525
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,940
I'll deploy a bunch of systems, even studio systems.

526
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,380
And then, and I know this about myself, three, four years later, I come back to them and

527
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,440
I cannot remember a thing about them.

528
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,860
I can't remember anything about them.

529
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,660
I can't remember how I put it together.

530
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,700
I just got it set.

531
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,220
It's locked down.

532
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,220
It passes the build check every single time.

533
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,220
So I just went about my day and I'm worried in a year plus I won't remember how any of

534
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,380
this actually works.

535
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:52,600
It seems like that's the downside to sort of this define it once and then leave it forever

536
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,420
approach is if you're a guy like me who doesn't remember how this stuff worked in a year to

537
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,220
systems a bit of a black box to you.

538
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,980
I mean, that means it's working.

539
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,440
I mean, I don't know if having a server you have to touch all the time is really worth

540
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,380
the cost of, oh, I remember how to configure a server.

541
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,660
If like you don't actually need to be configured servers all the time, which is maybe the problem.

542
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
I guess it's not a bad problem to have, right?

543
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,860
Oh gosh, it's worked so well.

544
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,460
I haven't touched it in years.

545
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,420
You're worried about success, which is a funny thing.

546
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
Yeah, I suppose.

547
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,740
You know, Chris, I think I'm going to catch you here.

548
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:30,280
I was listening recently, very recently, in fact, in the last week or two, uh, to self

549
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,400
hosted 67, which is the no container theory where you introduced to the self hosted audience,

550
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:43,480
your idea of using Nix and this like new containerization and you said exactly the opposite of a sentence

551
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,560
you just said, which was, Hey, I'd love to be able, you know, one of the main problems

552
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,200
I have right now is I set up, I don't know, uh, home assistant and then it sits there

553
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,040
for five years and I don't remember how I did it.

554
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,480
So it takes me, you know, a whole day to get back to it.

555
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:04,400
But it feels like that's partly what, you know, Nix OS is solving is that you get to

556
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,860
configure it in a way that's readable and that you don't have to rebuild every time

557
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,120
you just kind of run it.

558
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,040
That's why I was thinking when I kind of couch it as maybe it's the district that suffers

559
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,640
from this the least, because ultimately I just go look at my configuration files.

560
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,080
I know this will not last.

561
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,180
This is still the new Nix user in me.

562
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:27,960
I am bending over backwards to keep everything in one configuration file because I like that

563
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,400
idea.

564
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,160
But I realize all the documentation, everybody who's been using Nix for a while says, nah,

565
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,960
nah, break it out into sub files, break it out in individual dot Nix files.

566
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,200
I have not done that yet, but it also means I go to one file and I can see everything

567
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,040
about my system, everything from user groups to virtualization support to what packages

568
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
are installed, right?

569
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,560
And time zone and host name.

570
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
It's everything.

571
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,920
I also feel like, Chris, if you deploy this in more areas, especially on the server and

572
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,180
things like that, I think you'll just be more practiced at it and you'll have to touch things,

573
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,880
you know, maybe even the best case scenario, like once a month, let's say.

574
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,440
And so I don't know if that knowledge or that practice will kind of atrophy for you if you

575
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,400
have it deployed more often.

576
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,300
So what you're saying is the solution is more Nix.

577
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,320
That's basically what I just said, yeah.

578
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,460
I'm thinking, yeah, we configure our Nix setup to make sure that it places like a README

579
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,700
file on the box, you know, and then that just tells you the sort of common things you might

580
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
want to do in the future.

581
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,240
Like, oh, here's how you do updates.

582
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,940
Here's how you, you know, you're trying to add a package real quick.

583
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,940
Don't do it this way.

584
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,440
I don't know if you're joking, but I actually think that's a great idea.

585
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,680
I can't tell, but I like it.

586
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,760
And remember that, you know, Nick Slang supports comments.

587
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,640
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

588
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,360
Go there to get started with a free trial for a team or yourself and support the show.

589
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,160
It's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

590
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,800
If you're not using Bitwarden, I'm a little concerned about you because it is the easiest

591
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,520
way out there for an individual or a business to store, share and sync sensitive data.

592
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,600
They have a really secure system.

593
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
It's all open source.

594
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,080
It's trusted by a community of millions.

595
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,480
It's what Wes and I use to manage our passwords, our two factor codes, you know, other sensitive

596
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,200
data like Element has a recovery key component.

597
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Some of my wallets do.

598
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,380
You can put those in there too.

599
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,480
Bitwarden also has super slick account switching support so I can switch between my work stuff

600
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,560
and my personal stuff.

601
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,520
And one of the things that gives me confidence to use Bitwarden is there is a self hosting

602
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,960
option if you would need it that is maintained by the community, but Bitwarden works upstream

603
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,640
with them too.

604
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,600
The great thing is though, I've never really felt the need.

605
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,520
I think Bitwarden is such a great value and such an obvious service and they do client

606
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,600
side encryption.

607
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,640
To me it's just always made a lot of sense to just go with Bitwarden directly, but I

608
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,920
think the value proposition with Bitwarden is a no brainer.

609
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,720
I was able to import super easily and they've been adding features that I think are fantastic

610
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,100
like the username generator.

611
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,400
And did you know that they have vault health reports that are available for just about

612
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,840
any kind of plan?

613
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,240
These health reports can be used to evaluate the security of your setup or maybe your entire

614
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
organizational vault.

615
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,400
They're always thinking about these kinds of things.

616
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,280
It's their job 24-7 to make this work better.

617
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,040
To make Bitwarden work for you, to make Bitwarden work for your family, or your business.

618
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
So go try it out.

619
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,320
Get started at bitwarden.com slash linux.

620
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,920
Go see why we like it.

621
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,080
You can import from your existing password manager, most likely, I was able to with no

622
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,640
problem at all.

623
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,800
Play around with the username generator and the email generator that they have now too.

624
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,000
Create secure usernames, passwords, and email addresses for every site and service you use

625
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,360
and then sync it across all your platforms.

626
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,800
See what I've been talking about by going to bitwarden.com slash linux.

627
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:51,480
One more time to support the show, bitwarden.com slash linux.

628
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,680
We got some great feedback again this week.

629
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,840
Two letters specifically that came in about last week's episode.

630
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,240
Blooming Strong had some advice about our old server.

631
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,360
They said, I really feel you when you say you had not finished migrating all the things

632
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,520
off that old server.

633
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,280
May it rest in cotton peace.

634
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,240
Six months after getting my new server, I am still trying to migrate from the Windows

635
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,400
box I had hosting everything, Docker Desktop, WSL, etc.

636
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,280
And there's just a few things that are simply too hard or not interesting enough for me

637
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
to have done yet.

638
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,480
The migration struggle is real.

639
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,760
I hear that.

640
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,240
And then I also thought, you know, this could be a great opportunity to like maybe I keep

641
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:43,760
my private stuff on the old server and I just put work stuff on the new server.

642
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,320
Separation of work and personal, you know.

643
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,920
And then honestly, I'm not going to lie to you, I'm not going to lie to you.

644
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,520
The whole OpenSUSE, Nix OS thing, it just, it threw us for a loop.

645
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,320
We started down the path of the lizards and then we discovered the gospel of Nix.

646
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,040
We all accepted Nix into our hearts and now it's like accidentally deflated the lizard

647
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
path.

648
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
It's not intentional.

649
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,320
No, no, it just, it took us to a different place and that just put a whole pause on the

650
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,820
thing while we just sort of reconnoitered about the whole situation.

651
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,640
And then next thing you know, it's the summer and we got cottonwood problems, you know.

652
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,200
A guy just didn't foresee it.

653
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,240
Not to mention some stray cats.

654
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,560
Yeah, don't remind me.

655
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,520
Jotaroid in it as well with some advice and some rather strong disagreement.

656
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,800
Regarding searching out the colo for the servers, I tend to disagree with Chris for your use

657
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
case.

658
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,480
I was in a small business that had three racks in a colo and have some insights to share.

659
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,520
Here are some things to consider.

660
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,240
One, will you have after hours access?

661
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:56,240
Two, likely you'll have to provide your own internet circus into the colo or if not, I'm

662
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,800
sure you'll end up paying for bandwidth.

663
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,520
Three, need something done?

664
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,480
Well smart hands in quotes will cost you.

665
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,560
Number four, you'll want a KVM so you can access the console remotely in the event the

666
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,480
server doesn't power on, even if you have a ILO or equivalent.

667
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,200
Five, you'll need some switches in there also and some ports as you'll now need more ports

668
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,640
for the KVM, ILO ports, etc.

669
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,440
Six, it's going to take you several days to move all the equipment and get it set up.

670
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,160
Seven, and likely to get a good deal, you'll either be in a sketch part of town or be with

671
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:36,360
a small provider and what happens if or when they lose their lease.

672
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Number eight, don't forget a label maker.

673
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,040
You'll want things clearly labeled so you can help either Brent or Wes or someone who's

674
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,480
helping troubleshoot remotely or the smart hands at the colo to do things.

675
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,860
And lastly, number nine, rack elevation diagrams become critical as you'll have a lot less

676
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,480
access to the equipment.

677
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,340
Instead, I recommend spending the time and money on adding AC and fans and filters to

678
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,720
your existing rack and close the door to not let the cats in.

679
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:14,300
Okay, all right, geez, I have to say that gave me a lot of flashbacks, Joe, to life

680
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,300
in colo town.

681
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,520
Now, I didn't have to go to a bad part of town, so I didn't have that experience.

682
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:26,320
Downtown Everett had a really great data center back in my day, but literally everything else

683
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,400
you said rings 100% true.

684
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,680
I forgot what a pain in the neck it used to be.

685
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:41,320
And I thought, I just assumed like an animal, by 2022, you weren't having to pay separately

686
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,840
for your power and your bandwidth in a colo anymore, because I remember a time when we

687
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,360
were paying like a thousand bucks a month for a megabit.

688
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,360
It was bad.

689
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,480
And then, yeah, you have to pay for your power.

690
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
You do need a KVM.

691
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,080
You do need everything labeled.

692
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,160
I got a label maker, so we're good there, but okay, all right, so we got one thing figured

693
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
out.

694
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Yeah.

695
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,440
I've also just made peace with offloading bits to Linode and to LadyJupes.

696
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:16,160
But LadyJupes, the data center on LadyJupes is a booth in a dinette, okay?

697
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,080
And it's probably, I don't know, I could look it up, I could actually tell you right now

698
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,840
as we're doing the show, but it gets hot in there, even on a cool day when it's not that

699
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
hot out.

700
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,880
It can take days for the temperature of that thing to come down.

701
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,080
All right, so we're going to need to rig up a micro AC unit just for the booth.

702
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,520
Yeah, or some sort of vent.

703
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,520
I don't know.

704
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,040
I'll look it up right now as we're doing the show.

705
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:50,560
My server room temperature in LadyJupes is 86.9 degrees with a high of 88.1 at 11 PM.

706
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,080
So that's pretty good considering, because if you go look at the longer history, you

707
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,960
can see she's been averaging around 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

708
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,960
It's not been good.

709
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,120
That's a little toasty.

710
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,320
It's not been good at all.

711
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:08,240
And so these devices, like if they are x86, I don't know if they can handle that, right?

712
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,040
But these Raspberry Pis, they keep going, right?

713
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,600
So I've moved some of my media functionality directly into Jupes, and then some of the

714
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,040
batch processing functionality I put on Linode, and we have, it's back.

715
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,460
The system is back.

716
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,500
It seems to be functional.

717
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,320
The updates passed from last week's episode.

718
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,320
They sure did.

719
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,440
But we have it off because it's still 80-ish out there, and so we're just leaving it off

720
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,040
for now, now that I've set up other stuff.

721
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,760
But as the temps come back down, which they will here in the Pacific Northwest, we'll

722
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,680
bring things back locally.

723
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,760
Maybe I'll put a pause on the colo idea because Joe literally just scared the crap out of

724
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,760
me.

725
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,720
There's a lot to manage, yeah, definitely.

726
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,280
Joe even had one last idea for us, a little bonus idea.

727
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:52,720
He said, hey, you should include some of the cottonwood cotton in your geocaches.

728
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,720
That's hilarious.

729
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,260
We totally have enough.

730
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,200
Go wipe the drives, you know?

731
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,040
Let's get that JB server set.

732
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,040
It could.

733
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,520
Well, given what you said, I don't think it's a good one.

734
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,520
No, it just depends on which batch you get.

735
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,000
You got to get it from the right section.

736
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Lots of fresh stuff.

737
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,160
Yeah, not the stuff in that one corner.

738
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,360
Andrew wrote in as well with a quick little note as a new fan.

739
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,400
Just discovered your podcast, loving this.

740
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:29,480
I'm ye olde Unix user, started in 82 with the source code to V7 on a 1200 BPI tape and

741
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,640
a new copy of K&R.

742
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,280
I found my tribe.

743
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,720
Oh, nice.

744
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,720
That's great.

745
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,720
Welcome, Andrew.

746
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,720
Welcome in, Andrew.

747
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,200
You know, I don't even really have references for any of what he just said, so I feel lost.

748
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,320
He should join the matrix and explain it to you.

749
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,320
Smithy wrote in as well, hey, your new open source community website on GitHub is a fantastic

750
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,360
project.

751
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,000
Thank you very much, which is going great, by the way.

752
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,820
Why don't you really walk the talk and do your community engagement with real open source

753
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:04,680
platforms like diaspora, friendica, mastodon, rather than convenient restricted platforms

754
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,520
like Discord or matrix?

755
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,520
Is matrix restricted?

756
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,440
Well, that's one of my questions there.

757
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,320
We run our own matrix, is that restricted?

758
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,400
That feels pretty good to me, actually, feels pretty good.

759
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,160
I included this, and Chris, there's a little triggering note here for you.

760
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,760
The email they wrote in on was postmaster at localhost.local, so of course I wasn't

761
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,580
able to send a thoughtful reply, which I think is a note.

762
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:39,000
We sometimes get feedback like this from people who discourage the back and forth dialogue.

763
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,320
I want to have a real conversation and to suggest reasons why, of course, we've thought

764
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:48,160
of this stuff and made certain choices.

765
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,200
So unfortunately, I can't do that, but I guess we'll do it here.

766
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,920
Any quick thoughts, gentlemen?

767
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,200
So I don't know if I agree on matrix.

768
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,880
I think that's probably fine.

769
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:04,360
I like mastodon, but I have found that I don't really like mastodon as a social, just general

770
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,360
website.

771
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,160
I found it to be really useful when it's project specific.

772
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,400
I've been around, tried out mastodon over the years, never really stuck until finally

773
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,640
I joined the podcasting 2.0 mastodon, where it's really kind of mission specific.

774
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,400
That makes sense to me for a social media platform.

775
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,840
I don't really have any need to have a JB mastodon.

776
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,240
I don't really think it's necessary.

777
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,920
There's plenty of other ones out there, so it's just not something we've really engaged

778
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,920
in.

779
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,920
We've put our focus on matrix.

780
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,920
Right.

781
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,920
Yeah, we don't really...

782
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:37,320
There's not, at the moment anyway, a JB social, you know, like a dedicated staff member whose

783
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,520
job it is to manage the JB social.

784
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,320
So it's just really not like a platform that ends up where we are super, right?

785
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,440
Because there's, I mean, we have an awesome telegram room.

786
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,000
We've got, there's an awesome self hosted discord room.

787
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,680
There's a thriving matrix community.

788
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,120
And there's already too many notifications there for me to keep up with.

789
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,020
Plus we've got booths, we've got emails.

790
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,760
So hopefully there's good ways for people to reach us and have dialogues when interested.

791
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,160
And then we just kind of have to make some practical choices of where are the most people,

792
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,000
where's the best place we can get that good experience and get to engage with the audience,

793
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,440
but still make the most effective use of time.

794
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
Yeah.

795
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,880
And I think that also is the logic behind the choice of using something like GitHub

796
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,060
over GitLab or something like that.

797
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,320
We want to reach the most amount of people for that particular project.

798
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,840
And we think that's how our influence and reach can be best served.

799
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,240
But the nice thing is, is we're also pretty comfortable with the idea that if we're ever,

800
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,800
I don't know, motivated, we would just move off of GitHub.

801
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,880
I don't think that would take us more than an afternoon.

802
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,000
So we're not particularly worried about it.

803
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
What are your thoughts, Brent?

804
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,360
Yeah, I think you hit it with the GitHub stuff.

805
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:48,000
I was relatively new to GitHub when we first started this project and they didn't mention

806
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,680
this directly, but I think that was kind of, you know, between the lines was, well, why'd

807
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,600
you choose GitHub as well?

808
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,400
And we've touched on this previously, I think possibly in office hours.

809
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,520
And it was really balancing, you know, the ideals that we may have, because of course

810
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,560
we have some, and we somewhat feel the same way, but with where the people are.

811
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:14,340
And in GitHub's case, I think also like a skill that you can get, a really great skill

812
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,500
that you can add to your employment experience.

813
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,840
That's one of the perks of our community, you know, contributors, is they're working

814
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,920
on something they can put on a resume.

815
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,440
And so to best serve that and then, you know, GitHub is the place you can send recruiters

816
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,680
to get your own GitLab or instance like that.

817
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,160
But there's like, you know, not a lot of culture and community adoption in the hiring practices

818
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,160
around that.

819
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
I would think.

820
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160
I think everybody's tuned for GitHub.

821
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,160
I mean, yes and no.

822
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,720
I think that's a, that's part of the filter on the larger part.

823
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,920
I don't think if you're actually talking to a hiring manager, then no, a link to a project

824
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,920
is probably what's effective.

825
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,920
Sure, sure, yeah.

826
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,920
Right, I'm thinking like when you're...

827
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,120
That's a great way to say, look at these interactions with the community where looking at pull requests

828
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,240
and issues is quite common.

829
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,280
If somebody is just like looking at your resume, right, and they're casually googling you,

830
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,460
right, they're going to look at GitHub links and stuff.

831
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,460
That's my thought.

832
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:10,740
And so as a bit of value that the community gets by spending time working on our open

833
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:15,000
source projects, they can then demonstrate, hey, look, this is real work I did.

834
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Here's the actual commits.

835
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,840
Like, that's super valuable for them.

836
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,840
Yeah, and for us.

837
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:25,040
Well, and I also feel like it's a neat experiment from our perspective to see sort of what Microsoft

838
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,880
has done with what was, you know, an open source safe haven for so many projects and

839
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,200
what are they doing now?

840
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,540
What have they integrated into it that could inform maybe some of our content as well?

841
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,320
So I'm seeing it from that angle sometimes.

842
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,880
It did force us all to kind of refresh our familiarity with GitHub.

843
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,880
That's been...

844
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,300
Yeah, but good questions.

845
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:50,200
If you'd like to send in an email, go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

846
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,080
And now it is time for the boost.

847
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,280
So we're trying something new.

848
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,660
You know, the boosts are a brand new segment and we're always adapting.

849
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,620
This is a concept that came up in office hours that we're trying out for a bit.

850
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:04,560
We're going to do like the top boosts, not really based on the amount you boost in, but

851
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,920
it'll just be, we'll read all of the boosts, 100% of them, and then we'll select a few

852
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,240
to come onto the show, you know, a good signal.

853
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,520
And we just want to say thank you to everybody who does boost in.

854
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,680
And then we'll also, as you heard earlier, we'll read the baller boost separately in

855
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,640
the show, kind of break it up, keep things moving.

856
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:27,560
And our first boost came in from a guy named Dude with 10,001 sets.

857
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,200
Coming in hot with the boost.

858
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,160
He says, I hereby suggest that there should be a 10,000 set minimum for guaranteed reads

859
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,160
on the show.

860
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,280
So this has been something we've been thinking about and this is where the top four, top

861
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,560
five boosts, and we'll pull a few in every episode.

862
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,640
We'll read all of them.

863
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,820
We're also, just so you guys know, behind the scenes, we're going to work on systems

864
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:51,200
to make sure that every host sees every boost that comes in for each one of the shows.

865
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,220
They're all still coming into myself and Brent right now because he is still getting a split.

866
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,980
So we see all of those as well.

867
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,880
And so instead of setting it based on a 10,000 set minimum, maybe we'll try that one day.

868
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,680
We're just going to base it on quality of boost.

869
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,440
And then we just hope that you contribute the amount that you think represents the value

870
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,280
you get from the show.

871
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:16,680
Like Optimus Gray did with a row of Mic Ducks, 22,222 sats.

872
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,400
This old duck still got it.

873
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,800
He says, oh my, now I have a great Jupiter.2 portable system.

874
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,800
Get ready for this.

875
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,800
This is brilliant.

876
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
I'm going to try this.

877
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,840
The Steam Deck, the speakers are nice.

878
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,680
The screen is great.

879
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,280
It's got a built in trackpad mouse.

880
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,080
It's got a keyboard.

881
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:41,160
He uses it for SSH as well and he just added Jupiter.2 to his launcher, which that's the

882
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,180
magic sauce I hadn't thought of.

883
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,920
That's a great idea because it's got a full Chromium based browser on there.

884
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,640
He could participate in the P2P stream from a Steam Deck.

885
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,640
That's great.

886
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,720
He says, I also just submitted a ticket for tail scale to get tail scale running on the

887
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,720
Steam Deck.

888
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,720
Yeah.

889
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,720
Hmm.

890
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,560
I don't think I'll install Bitwarden, but he could.

891
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,560
Yeah.

892
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,560
You know, any flat pack.

893
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,920
I feel like I haven't done it yet because I've just been, I don't know this sounds weird,

894
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,680
but I've just been using the Steam Deck to play video games and I haven't really felt

895
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,200
super compelled to tinker with it beyond getting emulators on there.

896
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,680
I thought you were going to install Windows.

897
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,600
It did for like 22 seconds cross my mind.

898
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,600
Just to try it.

899
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,600
Just to try it.

900
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,840
But then I thought, you know, it would be, it would be, it would be kind of great to

901
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,240
try to get the Nix package manager on here.

902
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,040
I saw that coming.

903
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,440
I haven't done it yet.

904
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,600
I think that might be the next thing that I do, but we'll see right now.

905
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,360
I'm just going to play video games for a bit and enjoy it for that.

906
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:41,560
Well our next boost is from Mississippi Mayhem with a row of ducks.

907
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,560
Hey all.

908
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,920
I've been a huge fan since way back when a certain someone lost a bet and had to wear

909
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,480
a certain costume for the show.

910
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,280
If you know, you know on that one.

911
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,000
In all that time, I don't remember ever having a JB meetup within a day's drive.

912
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Oh gosh.

913
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Sorry, Mississippi.

914
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
That's, that's too bad.

915
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
So Mississippi goes on to ask, how many people when I have to get together to convince y'all

916
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,840
to do an official Mississippi JB meetup?

917
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,880
Best wishes from Mississippi.

918
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,800
And a little PS for you here, Chris.

919
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,760
PS, unfilter, reboot when?

920
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,520
Oh man, all my, all my non-JB energy right now has been going into Bitcoin dad pod.

921
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,880
That's really where I've been focused because I feel like a lot of the macro stuff we talk

922
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,640
about in Bitcoin dad pod is really what I would have been talking about in unfilter

923
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,120
anyways, but it just now is based on economics and macro picture and not so much just like

924
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,120
the news cycle.

925
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,680
Well there, if you need a little more Chris Fisher, B dad pod's the place to go.

926
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,520
You know, Patrick also boosted in, in the greater Nashville area saying he'd be down

927
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,520
for a meetup.

928
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,280
This is something Brett and I have been noticing is we're getting more and more people writing

929
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,800
in saying they'd be willing to just meet up even if the JB crew can't make it.

930
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,080
And so we've started a conversation in office hours on like, how the hell do we facilitate

931
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,080
this?

932
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,080
Cause this is a brilliant idea.

933
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,160
These meetups are awesome and they can, you know, like they can really be just recharging

934
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
for your work.

935
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,560
Like if you're in IT, you're in the tech spec, you're a developer, you're just in the sector

936
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:10,280
and you're a little burned out, you go to these meetups, you really kind of get recharged

937
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,100
and I don't know, I feel like that would be a great social service if we could help organize

938
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,100
that kind of stuff.

939
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,100
Yeah, right.

940
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,960
Network, recharge, just be around some, some people who have the same interests as you

941
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,080
and want to talk about it.

942
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,080
It's so nice.

943
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,920
We need a platform because obviously going through us on air, that's not going to scale.

944
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,920
That's not going to scale, no.

945
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,160
So we need a way, we would do like a webpage or something that people go to, they register

946
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,960
their area, register their willingness to like do a meetup.

947
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,720
People can organize, swipe left, I don't know what it is, but you know, something that they

948
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,680
could do to kind of self organize.

949
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,800
I think that'd be really what we need next.

950
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,700
So if anybody has any ideas, let us know.

951
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:44,920
So we got folks in the Mississippi area and we got folks in the Nashville area.

952
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,280
We've also, we've also heard from some folks in the Raleigh area that would like to continue

953
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,840
meetups going, the London area.

954
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,600
So there's a lot of different areas.

955
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,320
We just need to get it all kind of figured out because these can be really, really beneficial

956
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,320
for the community.

957
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:04,160
Well, boosting on, CERBIC boosts in with another row of ducks.

958
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,680
Thanks for another awesome show.

959
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:10,080
As someone who's looking to put together a home server in a pretty warm part of the world,

960
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:14,560
I feel for you going through all the woes, but I'm also thankful that I can learn from

961
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,560
it all.

962
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Yeah.

963
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,040
Hopefully you're learning what not to do on that one there.

964
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,040
Yeah.

965
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:24,280
You know what, building for the heat, you know what's even trickier?

966
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,920
Is building something that works really great in the freezing cold and something that works

967
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,240
really great in the super hot.

968
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,240
That is very tricky for extreme weather.

969
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,240
Okay.

970
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,080
And another boost this time from our friend Nev with 6,258 sats.

971
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,080
Boost!

972
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,080
Okay.

973
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:43,800
So this is in response to us figuring out boost amounts to read on the show and his

974
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,240
process for deciding how much to boost.

975
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,240
Yeah.

976
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,240
Okay.

977
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:53,960
So 6,258 is equal to the number of pies I have that are running Slackware.

978
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:58,640
Which if you divide 6,258 is equal to the approximate total number of physical floppies

979
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,160
you need a single copy of to install every version of Slackware Linux from initial to

980
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,160
5.0.

981
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,760
Don't ask me how accurate I am here.

982
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,080
I'm guessing, I'm going to say he's accurate.

983
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,560
I feels right.

984
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:17,480
Also 6,258 is special because it's 1993 times 3.14 rounded to the nearest whole number.

985
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,480
Okay.

986
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,480
Expect more in the future.

987
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,480
Is that a threat?

988
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,480
It's something.

989
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,480
I think so.

990
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,480
Thanks Nev.

991
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:28,440
Nev that's way more complicated than I expected but I love it and I appreciate you rolling

992
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,440
with the curveballs as we send those in.

993
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,580
We got a lot of boosts that did make it on air this week but I do want to just shout

994
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,580
out to a few.

995
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,840
These are not all of them that did not make it but we did read all of them.

996
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,920
But we got 4,096 sats from 412 Linux.

997
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,600
He was thanking us for an extra long live stream.

998
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,520
He's a member who boosts in from time to time.

999
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,080
We felt irresponsible but glad you liked it.

1000
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,400
I think it was three hours or something last week.

1001
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,400
Yeah.

1002
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,400
There's a lot of show.

1003
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,360
We don't always do them that long but every now and then they go pretty long.

1004
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,980
I thought we had a really great discussion about the Pine64 Manjaro situation in our

1005
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,080
member feed this week.

1006
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:08,200
We got 9,216 sats from the Mad Hatter who was sending Brent burnout money.

1007
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,720
Does that mean I get a new car?

1008
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,720
You just get a little extra gas for you to drive crazy I think.

1009
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,720
Oh alright.

1010
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,920
It's a little heavier on the pedal.

1011
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,140
And replace them tires.

1012
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,280
We got a few boosts in that were for Brent gas money that just didn't make it on the

1013
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,280
air.

1014
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,280
Thank you.

1015
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,080
But I was researching last night how we're going to do this, like how you're actually

1016
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,600
going to convert the sats that are sitting on your node into actual gasoline.

1017
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,760
I think I've come up with a really easy workflow.

1018
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,760
Does it involve a Pi?

1019
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,360
Oh I was hoping for a weird, complicated workflow.

1020
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,360
I also have that.

1021
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,360
Okay.

1022
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,360
Yeah.

1023
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,360
I've come up with like three routes that we can take.

1024
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,360
Let's hear it.

1025
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:45,400
No, I'll discuss them with you after the show because we got to keep moving, but yeah.

1026
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,760
I got them figured out.

1027
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:52,380
I wanted to just call out SU or CD who boosted in with just 222 sats, we love all mounts,

1028
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,380
and he's using Boost CLI.

1029
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,380
Oh, look at you.

1030
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,380
Yeah.

1031
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:59,280
I mean that's a command line client, you got to have your own node, it's very, very, very

1032
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,280
geeky.

1033
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:07,280
2,222 sats with no message from RustaCastaVersa, but I just wanted to make sure he remembered.

1034
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,680
I am now pronouncing it that way officially.

1035
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,280
We also got a row of ducks from Mr. Quackers.

1036
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,240
Quacka Wacka, it's a treasure.

1037
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,240
Yippee.

1038
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,000
And then we got a long time listener who boosted him from Finland with his first boost ever.

1039
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Nice to see you.

1040
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
How great is that?

1041
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,240
And then another 2,000 sats came in from MegaStrike for some Brent Gas Money because yes, the

1042
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,480
split is still set up.

1043
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,680
I'll probably be rearranging the splits in the future.

1044
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:37,640
I'll keep Brent in the split, but I'm looking at some more open source free software foundations

1045
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,080
and projects that we can add to our splits.

1046
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,240
So we'll be rearranging the splits in the near future and some of the splits will be

1047
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:47,240
going to a deserving project, which is under evaluation.

1048
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:51,040
So if you have any ideas of projects of lightning addresses, give me their names by boosting

1049
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,040
them in.

1050
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,160
Feel free to go check out some new podcasting 2.0 apps.

1051
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,000
Some of the great features include boostagrams, chapters, hosts, info, sat streaming, search

1052
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,320
value and clips as well.

1053
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:06,220
And a quick note, if you search hard in our GitHub projects, someone's working on some

1054
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,640
translations that might show up there too.

1055
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,960
So those are great.

1056
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,400
And if you're interested in being super geeky with Boost CLI, you can use the command line

1057
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,040
tool to send and review podcasting 2.0 value as well.

1058
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,960
And I'm sure Chris will call out your name for using that.

1059
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,400
I do love to see it.

1060
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,920
Newpodcastapps.com for a list of them, including apps that don't require you switch your MP3

1061
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,920
player.

1062
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,960
Although I've been hearing from a lot of people trying out Podverse and Fountain.

1063
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,520
I think people are loving them.

1064
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,520
Okay.

1065
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,520
How about picks?

1066
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,960
I got some picks for you.

1067
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,840
I had a hard time this week because I tried to go on theme, but I just really couldn't

1068
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,400
find anything that we haven't already done that I thought was worth talking about for

1069
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,400
this particular theme.

1070
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,520
So I decided to break from the theme and this is a pick for you, Westpain.

1071
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,520
Oh, for me?

1072
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,240
This is a personal pick for you.

1073
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,240
Personal pick.

1074
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,240
I'm honored.

1075
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,240
Maybe other people will be benefited.

1076
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,240
Maybe they'll benefit from this.

1077
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,240
I don't know.

1078
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:06,760
You and I were talking recently and you said something that caught my ears and that was,

1079
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,760
you know, maybe I ought to try building a gaming rig and maybe I ought to use Nyx as

1080
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,760
the base.

1081
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,760
Remember?

1082
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,760
Well, I remember asking you, you know, for thoughts on what distribution I should put

1083
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,760
it.

1084
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,760
And I said you should use Nyx.

1085
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,760
Yeah.

1086
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,760
You didn't volunteer that.

1087
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,760
And I didn't object.

1088
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,760
I did not object.

1089
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:23,760
Yeah.

1090
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,760
Yeah.

1091
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,760
Okay.

1092
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,760
So yeah, I remember that.

1093
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:27,760
Fair.

1094
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,760
And I said I actually think you would like it because I've been trying it and I've been

1095
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:33,160
living the Flatpak lifestyle with Steam and there's another tool that I'm making a personal

1096
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,480
pick for you.

1097
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,380
It's the Heroic Games Launcher.

1098
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:42,480
And what I love about this is it combines Epic Games and GOG Games in one launcher.

1099
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,120
You don't have to go get their individual Windows apps or run them under WINE.

1100
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,760
Because I don't really want to do that.

1101
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,760
Right.

1102
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,800
It's one app to manage all of them.

1103
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,640
There's several tools like this for Linux gaming and of course there is a Flatpak for

1104
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,880
this so you can get it installed in just mere moments.

1105
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,080
Yeah, that makes it easy.

1106
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,760
You connect it to your Epic Games account if you have such a thing, which they have

1107
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,160
some good games, or your GOG account which you I'm sure have.

1108
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,160
I do.

1109
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,160
It syncs it.

1110
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,600
It downloads and installs it just like their own launchers do and then you just run it

1111
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,160
there on your box.

1112
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,240
It is the heroicgameslauncher.com and we'll have a link in the show notes for that.

1113
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,840
And it's just one of the things that just makes it really easy, immutable distro or

1114
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:22,520
not, to just get all your games installed for things that are just outside of Steam.

1115
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,000
Because it turns out Steam doesn't have all the games.

1116
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
It's not everything.

1117
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,120
It's like most things these days, but it's not quite everything.

1118
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,840
And of course there's other great launchers out there that do other things.

1119
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,480
But this is the one we're going to give a little love to this week.

1120
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,560
But if you've got one you'd like to suggest, you can boost it in or go to linuxunplug.com

1121
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,740
slash contact and let us know.

1122
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,740
Well thanks for the pick.

1123
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:42,740
Yeah.

1124
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:45,300
I'll definitely give it a try and I guess thanks for helping me waste a little more

1125
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,420
of my own time.

1126
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,600
I think it'd be great to see you build a gaming rig.

1127
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:51,200
Would you go high-end graphics?

1128
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,200
I'm tempted.

1129
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,200
Are you?

1130
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,840
I mean it seems like maybe now might be the time the graphics cards, you know, is a little

1131
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,840
more normal.

1132
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,840
Coming down a little bit.

1133
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,840
Not crazy anymore.

1134
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,840
Not as crazy anymore.

1135
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,840
Yeah.

1136
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,840
Hmm.

1137
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,760
I'd really, well if you do, you got to let us know how it goes and tell us, you know,

1138
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,560
tell us what you decided to do.

1139
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,820
We'd love to have you join us live.

1140
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:14,480
We get together every single Sunday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern over at jupyter.tube.

1141
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,800
Also thank you to our members.

1142
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,520
You can become a member at unpluggedcore.com.

1143
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:22,800
They keep us oriented towards our audience, not only from like a host standpoint, but

1144
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,880
from a business standpoint.

1145
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,880
It's sort of like the peanut butter and the jelly that go together.

1146
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,320
And so they are immensely valuable.

1147
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,300
As a thank you, we make some feeds available to them.

1148
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,200
We make an ad-free fully produced version that Drew puts together and we make a live

1149
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,440
feed version, which is all the mistakes.

1150
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,440
There's a lot of those.

1151
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,200
All the screw-ups if they happen, you know, us getting connected with people if they're

1152
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,200
joining us this week.

1153
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:50,180
And then a big part of it is the pre and post show, which is like a whole other show really.

1154
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,540
And we make that available to our members, unpluggedcore.com.

1155
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:56,080
Or you can support all the shows on the network.

1156
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,600
Get access to all of the benefits for all the shows and get Linux action news ad-free

1157
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,600
at jupyter.party.

1158
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,160
Come join the party.

1159
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,160
Yeah.

1160
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,160
It's a party over there, right?

1161
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,160
Wes is there.

1162
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,160
He's partying.

1163
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:10,560
He's also in that Linux action news, which always covers some stuff you need to know

1164
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,560
about.

1165
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,840
We focus really on the stuff that we feel is the most important to get captured.

1166
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:21,780
And then we try to break it down and explain it in a no nonsense, no fooling, no tomfoolery,

1167
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,280
just what you need to know in and out.

1168
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,280
That's Linux action news.

1169
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,280
We don't let ourselves laugh.

1170
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,280
That's the whole rule.

1171
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,560
There is no fun in Linux action news.

1172
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,800
We cut out all the laughing awkwardly.

1173
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,440
So that way you know we laughed, but we didn't want you to hear it.

1174
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,180
So we cut it mid-laugh.

1175
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,720
And that's why this show is so serious.

1176
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,000
But the jokes are still there, right?

1177
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,040
Well, yeah, but we explain them so that way they don't sound funny.

1178
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,200
Because it's a news show, Brad.

1179
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,200
Yeah.

1180
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,200
Jokes.

1181
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,200
Jokes.

1182
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,200
All right.

1183
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,200
To find out if we're telling the truth or not, linuxactionnews.com.

1184
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,800
All right.

1185
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,000
That brings us to the end of this week's broadcast.

1186
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,460
Links to what this here show talked about while that's over at our linuxunplugged.com

1187
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,600
slash what is this 472?

1188
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,600
Yes, sir.

1189
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,600
Oh my God.

1190
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,600
I got it right.

1191
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,600
Wow.

1192
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,600
Yeah, I know.

1193
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,600
That's weird.

1194
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,600
We paid attention today.

1195
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,600
I think it's that giant counter on the wall in front of you.

1196
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,600
It's been working well.

1197
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,840
We're going to get back from the West Coast meetups and it's going to be like time to

1198
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,600
plan episode 500 time.

1199
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:17,000
Maybe we should survey the folks at the meetups for what we should do for our 500.

1200
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
They'll help us out.

1201
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Yeah.

1202
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And send us some ideas too if you're out there.

1203
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Let us know what you think.

1204
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
All right.

1205
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,280
Well, thank you very much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1206
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:51,560
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1207
01:05:54,280 --> 01:06:06,080
I presume blue wallet is available in Canada.

1208
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:10,660
I'm not positive, but I think that's a big presumption.

1209
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,720
I think it's available everywhere, but I'm not sure.

1210
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,720
Yeah.

1211
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,600
Anyways, an American would say that we need one of the many wallets.

1212
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,620
There are many, but we need, I think blue wallet would be the way to go, but we need

1213
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:24,440
many wallets, one of many wallets that can connect directly to your node.

1214
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,440
Yeah.

1215
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,440
Okay.

1216
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,920
And then they use the node's balance as their balance.

1217
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,400
Well, that sounds reasonable.

1218
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:39,560
And then what we can do is we can go to bitrefill.com and there's a couple of ways you can do this,

1219
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:44,680
but you can buy basically a gift card for anything with lightning SATs.

1220
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:51,240
So like Texas, Chevron, and then one of the Canadian gas companies up there, I forget

1221
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,240
which one.

1222
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,240
We have some.

1223
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,240
Yeah.

1224
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,240
There's a standard one.

1225
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,160
They have gift cards you can buy with Satoshis.

1226
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,160
Okay.

1227
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,720
Like the Chevron one requires you use their app.

1228
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:02,720
Weird.

1229
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,840
So you got to like, you redeem it, you know?

1230
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,840
You redeem it.

1231
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,840
All right.

1232
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:07,840
Yeah.

1233
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,840
Yeah.

1234
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,840
I know.

1235
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,840
So there's several options there.

1236
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,680
One of three, but that's probably the one that would be like the most, like you just take

1237
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,760
the SATs from the node and then you just buy the gas card and then you use the gas card

1238
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,760
at the gas pump.

1239
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,760
That's not so bad.

1240
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:26,560
And then you just have access to it like a bank account essentially, which is kind of

1241
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,560
a neat idea.

1242
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:30,560
And I mean, I suppose there's other things that you could turn tricks, you know?

1243
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,560
You could do things like that.

1244
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,560
Oh gosh.

1245
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:39,880
We'll just further enable what you're already doing with the new way of monetizing.

1246
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:45,520
I mean, I think now the new betting pool is not when is Brent going to leave Alex's.

1247
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,440
Is Brent going to make it home and get enough time at home to make it down here?

1248
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,440
And it's okay if you don't.

1249
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,440
It's all right.

1250
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,440
I won't be mad.

1251
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,320
But I think that's the new bet is will he make it for the road trip?

1252
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,840
Will he stay at Alex's and he gets home and then he doesn't, you know, something might

1253
01:07:58,840 --> 01:07:59,840
happen.

1254
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,840
We're getting into that window now.

1255
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:01,840
Oh yeah.

1256
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,840
I see what you're saying.

1257
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:06,200
My understanding is he does have some cats that probably want some time with him.

1258
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,200
Right.

1259
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,600
Or he decorated and they probably got a new roommate already.

1260
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:15,420
So I think we could I think we could get odds going on if Brent makes it for the road trip.

1261
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,920
You know, I mean, I don't want it to not happen.

1262
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:23,000
But if it makes it I'd like to monetize it is like rather than meeting you on route somewhere.

1263
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,880
He's here for like the leaving from the studio area.

1264
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,880
Yeah.

1265
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,880
Yeah.

1266
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,880
Yeah.

1267
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,880
Yeah.

1268
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:30,880
Yeah.

1269
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,040
See, I don't even consider that a possibility of not happening.

1270
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,040
No.

1271
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,040
All right.

1272
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,040
That's like a 100 percent.

1273
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,040
The biggest question for me is taking up your bet.

1274
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,040
All right.

1275
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,040
So this is what I'm thinking.

1276
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,520
This makes these this is odds that are worth that.

1277
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,520
All right.

1278
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,520
All right.

1279
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:50,280
But I think maybe a second question is, will I make it back home before that trip or will

1280
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:51,280
I just go straight from?

1281
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,280
Oh, sure.

1282
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,280
Yeah.

1283
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,280
That's a possibility as well.

1284
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,280
Hmm.

1285
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,280
Yeah, there's that's true.

1286
01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:00,080
I don't know how much time you've got left on your America allowance punch card.

1287
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,280
It's a I get a I got a free six months.

1288
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,280
I think I'm into month.

1289
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,400
How long have I been here?

1290
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,400
I don't know.

1291
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,400
Three months.

1292
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,400
I don't know.

1293
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,400
No, it's been what?

1294
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,400
Two months.

1295
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,160
I think it's like six weeks.

1296
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,160
I don't remember.

1297
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,160
So after this.

1298
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,160
Right.

1299
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,880
And so I think I have time left.

1300
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,280
The real question is, how long will you want me to stay at the studio either before or

1301
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,280
after?

1302
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,280
Oh, right.

1303
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:29,640
Because if we're clever, we have after time to like edit what we get to work on some projects.

1304
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,640
Yeah, that's true.

1305
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,640
Yeah.

1306
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,640
Mm hmm.

1307
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,360
Well, you know, I mean, plus Wes and I have to go for Thai food.

1308
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,360
We do.

1309
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,360
Yeah, that's true.

1310
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:41,880
So we just got to make sure we don't get you in trouble with, you know, your punch card.

1311
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,480
But yeah, this I just feel like there's a lot of odds we could bet here on.

1312
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,480
I don't know.

1313
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,480
There's opportunity.

1314
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,920
Maybe, you know, maybe we just take some on.

1315
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,920
Yeah.

1316
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,920
Do some gambling.

1317
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,920
Best case.

1318
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:53,920
We see Brent.

1319
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,920
I like it.

1320
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,160
I'm not saying I want to turn into a degenerate gambler, but.

1321
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:12,760
Turn into.
