WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.180
Before we start talking about Linux today,

00:02.180 --> 00:03.660
we have to talk about storage.

00:03.660 --> 00:06.220
Brent found this story about optical media

00:06.220 --> 00:09.180
making a strong comeback.

00:09.180 --> 00:12.420
Researchers at the University of Southampton

00:12.420 --> 00:16.900
are showcasing a new nano-structured glass disk

00:16.900 --> 00:21.540
that has the ability to store data for billions of years

00:21.540 --> 00:22.460
with a laser writer.

00:22.460 --> 00:24.220
So it's like optical media is back, Wes.

00:24.220 --> 00:29.060
Well, I mean, of course Brent would be promoting optical media.

00:29.060 --> 00:31.060
Not only can you store it forever,

00:31.060 --> 00:36.540
but you can put a lot on there, like 360 terabytes of data.

00:36.540 --> 00:39.180
I mean, we all want more data all the time, right?

00:39.180 --> 00:42.820
Yeah, and not only that, but how about them temperatures, too?

00:42.820 --> 00:47.020
1,000 degrees Celsius, that's 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:47.020 --> 00:49.580
It'll remain stable in up to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:49.580 --> 00:51.540
That's a good archival media right now.

00:51.540 --> 00:55.220
13.8 billion years at room temp.

00:55.220 --> 00:58.140
It's like the next evolution of microfilm, but way better.

00:58.140 --> 01:02.460
Maybe they'll be able to fit a single 8K video on there.

01:02.460 --> 01:03.880
I assume they're eventually going

01:03.880 --> 01:06.060
to get to where the original Superman movie where

01:06.060 --> 01:08.060
they have the crystals that they put in and have

01:08.060 --> 01:09.820
all the data in the Fortress of Solitude.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.500
I think they're eventually going to get there.

01:11.500 --> 01:12.900
That's absolutely what these are,

01:12.900 --> 01:16.780
isolinear chips, Superman crystals, they're glass data.

01:16.780 --> 01:19.700
And they show up a bit, like in the show notes,

01:19.700 --> 01:21.740
we'll have a link to a video they have in there.

01:21.740 --> 01:23.580
And they're holding it up, it's translucent.

01:23.580 --> 01:24.860
It just looks like a piece of glass

01:24.860 --> 01:26.900
where they've etched a title onto it, but they didn't need to.

01:26.900 --> 01:27.940
That's just for looks.

01:27.940 --> 01:29.780
I'd like all of Star Trek just on one

01:29.780 --> 01:31.700
of those sitting on a shelf on the wall.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.860
I think you'd have no problem fitting all of Star

01:33.860 --> 01:34.860
Trek on one of those.

01:34.860 --> 01:35.620
No.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.700
You know what, actually, kind of ironically,

01:37.700 --> 01:39.100
in like 15 years from now, somebody

01:39.100 --> 01:41.420
could listen back to this and be like, oh, that's so quaint.

01:41.420 --> 01:44.540
It'll be like the Computer Chronicles is to us now.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.300
No doubt.

01:46.300 --> 01:51.500
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 307 for June 25, 2019.

01:51.500 --> 02:05.780
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

02:05.780 --> 02:06.500
My name is Chris.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.420
My name is Wes.

02:07.420 --> 02:08.060
Hello, Wes.

02:08.060 --> 02:09.380
Looking very dapper today.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.100
And are you ready to talk about Mixcloud?

02:11.100 --> 02:12.140
Oh, I'm excited.

02:12.140 --> 02:15.260
Yeah, we have an episode that we've been

02:15.260 --> 02:17.660
prepping for in the most real sense.

02:17.660 --> 02:20.380
You may recall we've recently reloaded our main server here

02:20.380 --> 02:23.140
at the JB Studios.

02:23.140 --> 02:25.300
And we have put it to good use.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.300
Immediately.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.740
Yeah, we will tell you about those adventures today.

02:28.740 --> 02:31.420
But before we can get that far, we

02:31.420 --> 02:34.860
got to do the one, the only introductions.

02:34.860 --> 02:36.440
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:36.440 --> 02:36.940
Hello.

02:36.940 --> 02:37.440
Hello.

02:37.440 --> 02:37.940
Hi there.

02:37.940 --> 02:38.440
Hello.

02:38.440 --> 02:38.940
Hello.

02:38.940 --> 02:42.260
And of course, Alex, Drew, and Cheese are here as well.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.140
Hello, hello.

02:43.140 --> 02:44.780
Good day, everybody.

02:44.780 --> 02:45.300
Hi there.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.300
Hi there, everyone.

02:46.300 --> 02:50.140
Well, we have a real panel of knowledge experts on this one.

02:50.140 --> 02:51.060
We're going to need them today.

02:51.060 --> 02:52.220
There's a lot going on.

02:52.220 --> 02:54.620
You just heard from a whole bunch of Nextcloud users there.

02:54.620 --> 02:56.820
This is really going to be, I don't know,

02:56.820 --> 02:58.820
I feel like the one where I finally nailed it.

02:58.820 --> 03:00.980
I am so excited to talk about this.

03:00.980 --> 03:03.440
After many years of failed attempts

03:03.440 --> 03:06.060
to move away from Dropbox to implement Nextcloud,

03:06.060 --> 03:10.060
only to go back and have to eat crow right here on the air,

03:10.060 --> 03:12.740
I feel like we have finally nailed it.

03:12.740 --> 03:15.020
And I cannot wait to share our setup with you.

03:15.020 --> 03:17.940
Dropbox, they finally just did it with this last update

03:17.940 --> 03:19.660
where they want to take over everything

03:19.660 --> 03:21.700
and they want to be like your online file system

03:21.700 --> 03:24.740
and ship Electron as part of the Dropbox sync client.

03:24.740 --> 03:28.180
I thought, OK, all right, maybe not.

03:28.180 --> 03:29.500
Let's look somewhere else.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.260
But before we get there, let's start

03:31.260 --> 03:34.380
with some outrageously great community news today as well.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.340
A round of applause to the Raspberry Pi folks

03:36.340 --> 03:37.340
for tricking us all.

03:37.340 --> 03:41.820
The rumors were we wouldn't see anything this cool

03:41.820 --> 03:43.100
until like next year.

03:43.100 --> 03:45.220
And so we kind of just thought, all right,

03:45.220 --> 03:46.620
well, we got what we got.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.380
And well, wait.

03:48.380 --> 03:52.580
But yesterday, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B was launched.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.420
And it's actually a pretty decent upgrade

03:55.420 --> 04:00.060
from the Pi 3, which they're saying this new device can now

04:00.060 --> 04:03.780
provide desktop performance comparable to an entry level

04:03.780 --> 04:05.540
x86 PC system.

04:05.540 --> 04:06.700
Oh, that's exciting.

04:06.700 --> 04:09.700
OK, but how does it perform as a server, right?

04:09.700 --> 04:11.820
Could we replace this new box we've got?

04:11.820 --> 04:13.420
Could we have just waited a little bit

04:13.420 --> 04:16.860
and got this new Raspberry Pi?

04:16.860 --> 04:19.980
No, it basically, while it's a huge upgrade,

04:19.980 --> 04:23.180
it's still a Raspberry Pi at its heart.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.220
Although, there's a lot to like, right?

04:25.220 --> 04:28.820
So DDR2 RAM, that's been upgraded to DDR4.

04:28.820 --> 04:32.340
And the new Cortex A72 CPU is anywhere

04:32.340 --> 04:37.340
from double to quadruple the speed of the older A53.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.260
Plus, there's gigabit ethernet that

04:39.260 --> 04:43.080
isn't hamstrung by that darn USB 2.0 bus

04:43.080 --> 04:46.300
that everyone's been ragging on for years.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.420
You can actually saturate some traffic now.

04:48.420 --> 04:51.100
Yeah, genuine gigabit ethernet is a big deal.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.900
And keep in mind, all of that is still

04:53.900 --> 04:56.700
at the starting price of $35, which is still

04:56.700 --> 04:58.580
a pretty good deal.

04:58.580 --> 05:01.000
One of the things they're doing differently now, though,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.380
is they're including different SKUs, three different SKUs,

05:03.380 --> 05:06.980
up to 4 gigabytes of RAM, which is the model I purchased.

05:06.980 --> 05:09.460
Did you get the 4 gig?

05:09.460 --> 05:10.100
I got the 4.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.700
I mean, you're going to say no to that.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.580
And it's only, I mean, what was it, like $55?

05:13.580 --> 05:14.620
Not that much more.

05:14.620 --> 05:17.060
Cheese, did you pull the trigger?

05:17.060 --> 05:20.260
I haven't purchased one yet, but I plan on it.

05:20.260 --> 05:23.800
Alex, you were probably too busy on vacay to pull the trigger.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.380
I was.

05:24.380 --> 05:26.660
I use a Pi to run my 3D printer.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.220
I have a 3B plus right now.

05:29.220 --> 05:30.780
I think a 4 will be in my future.

05:30.780 --> 05:35.740
I'm going to see if this 8 gig rumor shakes out, though.

05:35.740 --> 05:38.060
There is a rumor in the manual.

05:38.060 --> 05:40.380
They talk about an 8 gig model, which

05:40.380 --> 05:42.860
that might be what we see in, oh, boy, 2020.

05:42.860 --> 05:44.700
Drew, are you a Raspberry Pi fan?

05:44.700 --> 05:46.780
Yeah, I've got a few lying around the house,

05:46.780 --> 05:49.660
but I think they're all 1s and 2s.

05:49.660 --> 05:51.820
I didn't actually buy any 3s.

05:51.820 --> 05:55.740
Thinking about the 4, but I don't know.

05:55.740 --> 05:59.300
I mean, I don't have a project for it yet,

05:59.300 --> 06:00.700
except that it's cool.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.620
Yeah, I bought it because I'm going to try it as a desktop.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.060
I'm going to test this claim.

06:04.060 --> 06:06.660
You know, I'm going with reasonable expectations.

06:06.660 --> 06:09.540
I'll tell you one thing it will be really great for.

06:09.540 --> 06:13.340
It has x265 hardware decoding.

06:13.340 --> 06:17.940
So we've all had h264 for years and years.

06:17.940 --> 06:21.220
And now x265 offers significantly smaller files,

06:21.220 --> 06:22.900
and this thing has hardware decoding.

06:22.900 --> 06:26.500
So it will make an absolutely great media box.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.700
They're also saying potentially 4K video out.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.100
Early benchmarks, seems like some of the reviewers

06:32.100 --> 06:35.860
have had issue getting that 4K video to actually work,

06:35.860 --> 06:38.620
but jury's out in my opinion on that one.

06:38.620 --> 06:40.860
I think something else they did with the announcement

06:40.860 --> 06:43.300
is they had a little bit of a,

06:43.300 --> 06:45.700
is it fair to call it a publicity stunt

06:45.700 --> 06:48.300
or would it be a proof of concept?

06:48.300 --> 06:49.460
Proof of concept, I don't know.

06:49.460 --> 06:51.140
I think it's just a fun thing to do.

06:51.140 --> 06:53.540
The launch site for the new model

06:53.540 --> 06:58.740
is mostly running on a cluster of 18 Raspberry Pis themselves.

06:58.740 --> 07:02.580
So why not self-host it with the product you're selling?

07:02.580 --> 07:06.980
14 handle PHP code execution, two more serve static files,

07:06.980 --> 07:10.700
and then two run our old friend memcached.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.260
Of course.

07:12.260 --> 07:14.220
Of course, that's all sitting behind Cloudflare.

07:14.220 --> 07:15.660
As you do. Which is caching.

07:15.660 --> 07:19.940
And also, I think the databases aren't on that cluster either.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.140
But if you're serving cached content, it still worked.

07:23.140 --> 07:23.620
It's legit.

07:23.620 --> 07:26.820
I think the way to look at it is not really proving anything.

07:26.820 --> 07:29.820
It's just saying, look, these are capable little devices.

07:29.820 --> 07:31.280
Maybe don't use them for production,

07:31.280 --> 07:33.260
but they're great for small little tasks.

07:33.260 --> 07:35.860
Yeah, I see quite a few people on Home Lab

07:35.860 --> 07:38.780
and all that kind of thing on Reddit using three, four,

07:38.780 --> 07:41.660
five different Pis to run small Kubernetes clusters.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.940
So there are definitely use cases for that kind of thing.

07:44.940 --> 07:49.220
I'm kind of feeling that the Raspberry Pi, as time goes on,

07:49.220 --> 07:54.620
is becoming sort of the universal Linux computer.

07:54.620 --> 07:57.420
The Raspberry Pi 4B now kind of makes

07:57.420 --> 07:59.260
it competitive with a lot of the other boxes

07:59.260 --> 08:02.220
that are out there at a pretty competitive price point.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.620
This isn't the fastest.

08:03.620 --> 08:06.580
But Raspberry Pi is a brand.

08:06.580 --> 08:07.940
It's an ecosystem.

08:07.940 --> 08:09.620
It is a standard now.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.740
It's integrated in production equipment.

08:11.740 --> 08:15.780
And it's also in classrooms with students tinkering.

08:15.780 --> 08:19.860
And it's at an accessible price that a massive range of people

08:19.860 --> 08:20.900
can afford.

08:20.900 --> 08:24.220
And the sort of pop a disk in, like a floppy disk,

08:24.220 --> 08:26.660
and boot off of an operating system approach

08:26.660 --> 08:28.620
where you can flash it from a Windows or a Mac

08:28.620 --> 08:31.060
and then just pop it into a little Raspberry Pi

08:31.060 --> 08:32.420
is approachable.

08:32.420 --> 08:34.940
It's just so easy, and you get such leverage

08:34.940 --> 08:37.020
for such a low entry fee.

08:37.020 --> 08:39.060
And it brings something that we so rarely

08:39.060 --> 08:40.260
have to the Linux desktop.

08:40.260 --> 08:43.420
And that's why I'd really love to see as the Raspberry develops

08:43.420 --> 08:46.380
when the 5 and the 6 come out, maybe one day

08:46.380 --> 08:47.820
we'll even have a Raspberry Pi 10.

08:47.820 --> 08:52.620
Could you only imagine what that thing's going to be for $35?

08:52.620 --> 08:56.300
I just think it's something that Linux doesn't typically have,

08:56.300 --> 08:59.860
and that is a single problem domain for the desktop.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.500
It's the opposite of fragmentation.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.340
It's one company, one product, and we're not locked into it.

09:05.340 --> 09:06.600
That's what's so great about it.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.580
It's available to us.

09:08.580 --> 09:11.380
And because of its brand, and its ecosystem, and its user

09:11.380 --> 09:15.860
base, it's becoming this common platform.

09:15.860 --> 09:19.580
It's not the Apple style where only one company makes

09:19.580 --> 09:21.900
all of the hardware, and only their operating system

09:21.900 --> 09:22.740
runs on all of that hardware.

09:22.740 --> 09:24.820
It's like it's Linux still available to everybody.

09:24.820 --> 09:26.580
I really like where the Raspberry Pi is

09:26.580 --> 09:28.500
going as a broader product.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.620
When you look at it individually with the different boards

09:30.620 --> 09:32.820
and stuff, you can argue about which one's technically

09:32.820 --> 09:33.540
superior.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.980
But when you zoom out and look at it

09:34.980 --> 09:37.140
as a platform and an ecosystem, it's

09:37.140 --> 09:40.420
creating something for Linux as it becomes powerful enough

09:40.420 --> 09:41.380
for the desktop.

09:41.380 --> 09:44.100
It's creating something we've never had, in my opinion.

09:44.100 --> 09:44.980
Very excited about it.

09:44.980 --> 09:48.900
So that's why I ordered what they call their desktop kit.

09:48.900 --> 09:53.940
You get the Pi 4B with a keyboard and mouse,

09:53.940 --> 09:57.380
and you get that micro HDMI adapter.

09:57.380 --> 09:58.740
Wish they hadn't done micro HDMI.

09:58.740 --> 10:00.940
That's the one thing I'm not really a big fan of.

10:00.940 --> 10:04.380
And they've added two micro HDMI outs.

10:04.380 --> 10:04.900
Yeah.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.860
I would have loved some kind of a SATA interface

10:07.860 --> 10:12.820
instead of a second HDMI port, but maybe that's just me.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.820
You know, it's going to give it ethernet.

10:14.820 --> 10:17.900
There's a lot of ways I can get storage onto that Pi now.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.660
I think one of the original issues, too,

10:20.660 --> 10:24.300
is that with the original CPU, you were tied down

10:24.300 --> 10:28.740
to USB 2.0 throughput, so that's why you could never really get

10:28.740 --> 10:30.500
gigabit speeds out of it.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.420
And now that it's upgraded, with USB 3.0,

10:33.420 --> 10:35.060
obviously, yeah, you can get that speed out of it,

10:35.060 --> 10:35.540
no problem.

10:35.540 --> 10:37.940
And I mean, there are tests that have been run out there

10:37.940 --> 10:40.980
that actually show that they're able to get their full gigabit

10:40.980 --> 10:41.820
speed out of it.

10:41.820 --> 10:42.860
Are you happy with this?

10:42.860 --> 10:45.700
You follow these types of boxes, or I guess boards,

10:45.700 --> 10:46.540
pretty closely.

10:46.540 --> 10:48.140
Are you happy with this release?

10:48.140 --> 10:51.580
Yeah, I mean, I own several of these.

10:51.580 --> 10:54.980
I own Raspberry Pis, Orange Pis, Nano Pis,

10:54.980 --> 10:57.100
you name single board computer.

10:57.100 --> 11:01.900
I probably have one of them from one company or the other.

11:01.900 --> 11:05.580
I think it's a great step for the Raspberry Pi foundation.

11:05.580 --> 11:10.220
This is obviously a response to the popular RK, the Rockchip

11:10.220 --> 11:14.100
3399 that's in some of the other boards out there,

11:14.100 --> 11:16.660
and set top boxes and stuff.

11:16.660 --> 11:18.780
It seems to stack up pretty well.

11:18.780 --> 11:24.580
I will say, though, that that cluster that they set up,

11:24.580 --> 11:26.100
the photo that they tweeted out of that

11:26.100 --> 11:29.180
just drove me crazy because of the cable management and the.

11:29.180 --> 11:29.820
Don't look, man.

11:29.820 --> 11:30.060
Don't look.

11:30.060 --> 11:30.860
Yeah, just don't look.

11:30.860 --> 11:31.860
It's a nightmare.

11:31.860 --> 11:33.340
But no, I mean, I think this is going

11:33.340 --> 11:36.660
to be a really good board, and it's going to be something,

11:36.660 --> 11:37.300
like you said.

11:37.300 --> 11:41.140
I mean, Raspberry Pi already has an ecosystem built around it.

11:41.140 --> 11:44.300
There are so many companies that produce Raspberry Pi hats that

11:44.300 --> 11:46.740
are continuing to do that.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.380
And I think that this is just going to be a continually

11:49.380 --> 11:58.140
growing project from them, where I think they focus more,

11:58.140 --> 11:59.980
kind of take that Debian approach,

11:59.980 --> 12:05.740
and focus more on reliable tried-and-true hardware

12:05.740 --> 12:08.020
before they just step off into the next thing.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.340
Like you have some of these other single-board computer

12:10.340 --> 12:14.500
manufacturers, OrangePod to name one,

12:14.500 --> 12:17.220
that just iterate so quickly on these boards.

12:17.220 --> 12:19.500
And they're all over the place.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.660
They've saturated the market with these different boards

12:22.660 --> 12:23.180
and stuff.

12:23.180 --> 12:24.100
Some of them are good.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.900
Some of them aren't.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.740
But it just kind of dilutes the whole thing.

12:27.740 --> 12:30.220
So it's really nice to see Raspberry Pi just chugging

12:30.220 --> 12:32.300
away, doing what it does, coming out

12:32.300 --> 12:35.140
with what's sure to be a great board once it gets out

12:35.140 --> 12:36.940
on the scene and everybody starts using it.

12:36.940 --> 12:40.460
So I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.620
Man, I can't even imagine a Raspberry Pi 10,

12:42.620 --> 12:46.300
what that's going to entail.

12:46.300 --> 12:49.660
A couple of use cases that I haven't super seriously

12:49.660 --> 12:54.780
considered the Raspberry Pi 3 or previous Raspberry PIs for.

12:54.780 --> 12:57.740
Number one now is, to me, this seems like a clear contender

12:57.740 --> 12:58.980
for a Codibox.

12:58.980 --> 13:02.900
You've got real performance on this thing now, real ethernet,

13:02.900 --> 13:07.540
real HDMI out, and it just seems like a clear contender.

13:07.540 --> 13:09.420
So that's something I'm going to have to try.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.120
And then also, you and I were just

13:11.120 --> 13:12.820
talking about this a couple of days ago.

13:12.820 --> 13:18.060
We kind of need a computer that is low noise, low heat,

13:18.060 --> 13:19.540
doesn't have to be super powerful.

13:19.540 --> 13:23.700
We just need to show graphs and different inputs

13:23.700 --> 13:27.180
and different meters and just readouts of different data

13:27.180 --> 13:28.420
that we have.

13:28.420 --> 13:33.660
And a Raspberry Pi that can run two monitors,

13:33.660 --> 13:35.060
that would be perfect.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.780
That could be exactly what we need.

13:36.780 --> 13:41.420
And it could take the job of a louder, more power hungry

13:41.420 --> 13:44.460
x86 PC easily.

13:44.460 --> 13:45.380
That's kind of cool.

13:45.380 --> 13:47.340
You know, I just thought of another use case,

13:47.340 --> 13:50.380
too, is considering that these are fanless,

13:50.380 --> 13:53.420
this would not be a bad choice for something

13:53.420 --> 13:58.100
to run Reaper on in a little mini recording booth.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.260
Yeah, that's got to be tried, I think.

14:00.260 --> 14:01.580
They do have an ARM version.

14:01.580 --> 14:02.220
They do.

14:02.220 --> 14:06.780
And also, our mixer makes the mixer's GUI software

14:06.780 --> 14:08.540
for the Linux ARM as well.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.580
Yeah, that's why I said we could get meters right

14:10.580 --> 14:12.740
off the mixer on a Raspberry Pi.

14:12.740 --> 14:13.900
It's pretty great.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.360
There's also a link in the show notes

14:15.360 --> 14:17.380
to CNX Software, which got one of these units

14:17.380 --> 14:20.340
and did a series of benchmarks on it.

14:20.340 --> 14:22.260
I don't really know what to take from this.

14:22.260 --> 14:23.540
A couple of temperature benchmarks.

14:23.540 --> 14:24.560
Remember, there's ambient.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.360
There's other things you have to consider.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.580
But at idle, it ran at 62 Celsius.

14:29.580 --> 14:32.060
And then when the benchmarks were being downloaded and loaded,

14:32.060 --> 14:35.140
you know, accessing disk and network, 64 Celsius.

14:35.140 --> 14:38.660
And then when John the Ripper was ripping, 73 Celsius.

14:38.660 --> 14:42.540
And he appears to observe some CPU throttling

14:42.540 --> 14:44.700
as temperatures have gone up.

14:44.700 --> 14:47.900
He kind of describes it as a particular type

14:47.900 --> 14:51.100
of peak performance, bursting performance, I guess.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.020
Yeah, it'll operate perfectly fine.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.020
You don't need extra cooling.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.020
It's designed for sprint performance, right?

14:57.020 --> 14:59.580
You're going to get a few extra workloads done here and there,

14:59.580 --> 15:01.580
but you're not loading it all the time.

15:01.580 --> 15:04.180
If you are keeping the CPUs ramped up,

15:04.180 --> 15:06.220
you'll probably want some extra cooling.

15:06.220 --> 15:07.380
Yeah, yeah.

15:07.380 --> 15:10.700
Otherwise, passive cooling does seem to be sufficient.

15:10.700 --> 15:13.300
And he also did test that gigabit ethernet

15:13.300 --> 15:16.740
and was getting pretty reasonable transfer speeds,

15:16.740 --> 15:19.660
you know, between 95 megabytes a second,

15:19.660 --> 15:21.660
93 megabytes a second on the send and receive,

15:21.660 --> 15:25.140
which is perfectly, perfectly good.

15:25.140 --> 15:28.180
And did run into some 4K video playback issues.

15:28.180 --> 15:30.300
But again, early days on that.

15:30.300 --> 15:31.980
So I'm going to wait and see on that one.

15:31.980 --> 15:35.700
I'm tempted to pick one up, 3D print a little housing

15:35.700 --> 15:39.020
for a USB hard drive, and then just send it

15:39.020 --> 15:40.980
to my parents' house, plug it into the network,

15:40.980 --> 15:44.860
and then just use BitTorrent Sync as a remote endpoint.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.380
Oh, yeah, great little management,

15:46.380 --> 15:48.420
whenever I'm having something in someone's house.

15:48.420 --> 15:49.980
I could definitely see it being a little Sync endpoint,

15:49.980 --> 15:52.540
or a little Nextcloud endpoint, potentially, as well.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.620
Well, we have to move on because, of course, there

15:54.620 --> 15:57.740
was some dramatic breaking news.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.820
Everybody freak out.

16:00.820 --> 16:03.500
Ubuntu is dropping I-386 architecture support.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.140
Oh, no.

16:04.140 --> 16:07.660
Yep, if you are on a Intel series processor,

16:07.660 --> 16:09.260
no longer will there be 32 support.

16:09.260 --> 16:12.940
Steam is pulling out all support for Ubuntu.

16:12.940 --> 16:15.380
And Valve developers are upset.

16:15.380 --> 16:17.340
And Wine developers are, wait, what's that?

16:17.340 --> 16:18.940
It's the Linux gaming apocalypse?

16:18.940 --> 16:19.740
I'm sorry.

16:19.740 --> 16:21.980
I'm sorry, I was just going off an article that was posted

16:21.980 --> 16:25.540
by PC Gamer just 20 hours ago.

16:25.540 --> 16:26.740
Hold on, Wes, just one second.

16:26.740 --> 16:29.660
I'm getting, I'm getting, I've got to get, I'm sorry.

16:29.660 --> 16:30.860
I've got to get pulled aside.

16:30.860 --> 16:31.940
Apparently, there's an update.

16:31.940 --> 16:32.820
The Cone of Silence.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.980
OK, what's going on?

16:36.980 --> 16:40.180
So I'm getting word here that all of this

16:40.180 --> 16:41.800
is a complete overreaction.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.300
Oh, yeah, there's some updates.

16:43.300 --> 16:43.800
Oh.

16:43.800 --> 16:44.800
We should get into them.

16:44.800 --> 16:45.300
Oh, OK.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.660
All right, well, maybe we'll just cut all that out, OK?

16:47.660 --> 16:48.900
All right, let's go.

16:48.900 --> 16:53.020
Yeah, so this week, there was a big upset

16:53.020 --> 16:56.580
when it appeared that Canonical would be removing support

16:56.580 --> 17:02.980
for i36 packages in Ubuntu 19.10, and subsequently, 20.04 LTS.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.480
So kind of the series of events is,

17:04.480 --> 17:07.320
this is something that's been discussed for quite a while.

17:07.320 --> 17:09.060
We covered the timeline on LAN a little bit.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.420
But from what I can kind of see, it

17:10.420 --> 17:12.920
seems like you really kind of see the conversation kick off

17:12.920 --> 17:14.180
around May of 2018.

17:14.180 --> 17:16.080
And we've seen other distributions

17:16.080 --> 17:17.500
make similar moves already.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.740
Yeah, in fact, OpenMandriva just announced they're dropping.

17:20.740 --> 17:24.360
Now, arm architecture, you've got arms keeping 32-bit.

17:24.360 --> 17:25.660
That's not going away.

17:25.660 --> 17:30.040
This is just for the Intel x86 side of the camp.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.220
And so you see conversations.

17:32.220 --> 17:35.900
And the message really seems to be from the Ubuntu developers

17:35.900 --> 17:40.360
is, our sense is, kind of I'm paraphrasing for them,

17:40.360 --> 17:42.780
our sense is that these packages are not well-maintained.

17:42.780 --> 17:44.740
They don't really have a lot of eyes on them.

17:44.740 --> 17:46.940
There is security issues that they're

17:46.940 --> 17:49.540
known to be vulnerable to, like Spectre and Meltdown,

17:49.540 --> 17:51.140
that they're not receiving mitigations

17:51.140 --> 17:53.500
for, amongst other issues.

17:53.500 --> 17:56.580
And we kind of think to protect the overall platform,

17:56.580 --> 17:58.500
moving forward, we should remove these packages

17:58.500 --> 18:00.740
because they're likely a security risk.

18:00.740 --> 18:03.020
Although we can't prove it, they likely are.

18:03.020 --> 18:05.660
Conoco didn't want to come out and scare everyone.

18:05.660 --> 18:07.740
But in their own way, that's essentially

18:07.740 --> 18:09.380
the message they were relaying is, hey, nobody's

18:09.380 --> 18:10.340
really looking at these.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.620
I mean, we're shipping them.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.980
And we're putting the work to package them and make

18:14.980 --> 18:17.700
sure they're built against your current distro.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.340
And we're making sure they're in the repo.

18:19.340 --> 18:22.300
And that's all good, but they might not

18:22.300 --> 18:24.780
be very well-maintained.

18:24.780 --> 18:29.340
And that conversation sort of went off from the mailing list

18:29.340 --> 18:31.820
onto the web and then onto podcasts.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.700
We've talked about it a little bit.

18:33.700 --> 18:38.300
And then this last Tuesday, just after the show wrapped up,

18:38.300 --> 18:42.420
Ubuntu desktop lead developer or manager, Will Cook,

18:42.420 --> 18:44.980
went onto their community Discord and our discourse

18:44.980 --> 18:47.780
and said, here's the plan.

18:47.780 --> 18:50.980
We're going to start officially deprecating support for I36.

18:50.980 --> 18:52.620
A couple of days go by, nobody really

18:52.620 --> 18:54.300
says much except for a few other people

18:54.300 --> 18:56.700
from Canonical chime in on the conversation.

18:56.700 --> 19:00.760
And then on Friday, a staffer from Valve

19:00.760 --> 19:04.100
posts on Twitter that the removal of I36 support

19:04.100 --> 19:06.900
would be untenable and that Steam

19:06.900 --> 19:10.380
would have to look at dropping support for Ubuntu moving

19:10.380 --> 19:12.300
forward in 1910 on.

19:12.300 --> 19:15.020
Yikes.

19:15.020 --> 19:19.140
That was the moment that really set the internet on fire.

19:19.140 --> 19:21.260
Because all of a sudden, it looked like Steam

19:21.260 --> 19:22.180
was dropping support.

19:22.180 --> 19:25.660
So then you immediately had half a dozen articles go live saying

19:25.660 --> 19:29.420
that Valve was officially dropping support for Ubuntu.

19:29.420 --> 19:31.900
And within a short time after that,

19:31.900 --> 19:35.260
a change.org petition was created to force Canonical

19:35.260 --> 19:38.900
to keep 32-bit support in the distribution.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.760
And there was sort of a back and forth

19:40.760 --> 19:43.700
about if this was good or not for the longevity of Linux

19:43.700 --> 19:44.640
desktop.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.780
And by Sunday, Canonical had decided

19:47.780 --> 19:49.380
they would walk it back a bit.

19:49.380 --> 19:53.140
And then on Monday morning, they made an official announcement

19:53.140 --> 19:57.860
that they would be keeping the 32-bit I36 packages for Ubuntu.

19:57.860 --> 19:59.820
They wrote, thanks to a huge amount of feedback

19:59.820 --> 20:02.500
this weekend, that's how they start the blog

20:02.500 --> 20:04.580
post on their Canonical blog.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.620
And then later on, they say, community discussions

20:06.620 --> 20:08.300
can sometimes take unexpected turns.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.340
Ain't that true?

20:09.340 --> 20:10.940
And then they later write, we also

20:10.940 --> 20:13.060
look forward to working with Wine, Ubuntu Studio,

20:13.060 --> 20:15.440
and gaming communities to use container technologies

20:15.440 --> 20:17.940
to address the ultimate end of 32-bit libraries.

20:17.940 --> 20:19.860
And that's important right there.

20:19.860 --> 20:20.580
Yeah.

20:20.580 --> 20:22.260
So I want to continue this conversation.

20:22.260 --> 20:23.840
But I thought maybe what we should do

20:23.840 --> 20:25.460
is not a lot of people are really

20:25.460 --> 20:31.980
discussing what it takes to run a 32-bit x86 program

20:31.980 --> 20:35.480
on a 64-bit x86 Linux system.

20:35.480 --> 20:39.500
So suppose that you have a modern 64-bit x86 Linux system

20:39.500 --> 20:42.100
and that you want to run an old 32-bit program on it.

20:42.100 --> 20:42.580
I do.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.020
Maybe a game or something like that.

20:44.020 --> 20:45.060
It's got some libraries.

20:45.060 --> 20:47.540
So what does it require from an overall system,

20:47.540 --> 20:50.020
both from the kernel and the rest of the environment,

20:50.020 --> 20:54.220
to actually run a 32-bit application on a 64-bit box?

20:54.220 --> 20:55.900
All right, well, at a minimum, that

20:55.900 --> 20:58.860
requires your 64-bit kernel to support programs

20:58.860 --> 21:03.340
running in 32-bit mode and making 32-bit kernel calls.

21:03.340 --> 21:04.760
OK, so there's some kernel stuff.

21:04.760 --> 21:05.620
Oh, yeah, of course.

21:05.620 --> 21:08.700
And supporting those calls is not always easy

21:08.700 --> 21:11.820
because there's all kinds of different structures involved.

21:11.820 --> 21:14.380
And those structures have to be translated back and forth

21:14.380 --> 21:16.780
between the native 64-bit version

21:16.780 --> 21:18.500
and the emulated 32-bit version.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.540
Wow, imagine when you're playing a Windows Proton

21:21.540 --> 21:24.340
game that's 32-bit on Linux.

21:24.340 --> 21:27.540
There's so many layers of translation happening there.

21:27.540 --> 21:28.660
Oh, yes.

21:28.660 --> 21:31.060
And a lot of those, they're not always pretty.

21:31.060 --> 21:33.140
I'm sure there's many in the kernel community who

21:33.140 --> 21:35.060
wish that it would just be kind of simpler.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.660
It'd be cleaner not to do this.

21:36.660 --> 21:39.180
There's more complications around eye octals

21:39.180 --> 21:41.300
and dealing with pseudo terminals

21:41.300 --> 21:43.100
and other sorts of devices like that.

21:43.100 --> 21:47.460
And more complications with the VDSO,

21:47.460 --> 21:49.460
where you have stuff that gets mapped into just

21:49.460 --> 21:51.300
about every program running, even

21:51.300 --> 21:53.680
for statically linked programs that don't necessarily

21:53.680 --> 21:56.040
make use of nice sorts of optimizations

21:56.040 --> 21:57.580
for dynamically linked programs.

21:57.580 --> 21:58.900
System doesn't know, so it's just got to load it.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.500
Yes, and that means the kernel has

22:01.500 --> 22:05.060
to carry around another 32-bit ELF image, which

22:05.060 --> 22:07.160
has to be generated somewhere.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.340
And that's where a lot of this stuff

22:09.340 --> 22:11.260
gets the most complicated, I think,

22:11.260 --> 22:13.780
because you have to get all of these programs.

22:13.780 --> 22:16.500
You have to make all of these shared libraries.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.500
You have to generate and compile all this stuff,

22:18.500 --> 22:20.020
and that's never going to be simple.

22:20.020 --> 22:22.660
Well, and it gets even significantly more complicated

22:22.660 --> 22:25.620
because it's a little simpler if the 32-bit application,

22:25.620 --> 22:27.340
like you were saying, is statically linked.

22:27.340 --> 22:30.860
However, if it's a dynamically linked 32-bit application,

22:30.860 --> 22:35.680
then there needs to be 32-bit libraries all the way down,

22:35.680 --> 22:38.860
and they're all loading all of this extra baggage and crap

22:38.860 --> 22:41.140
all the way down, including if you

22:41.140 --> 22:43.580
have an application that needs to do a name lookup.

22:43.580 --> 22:45.700
There needs to be a 32-bit name lookup library.

22:45.700 --> 22:50.020
Oh, yeah, all those NSS modules you have in nsswitch.com.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.820
Yeah, you've got to take care of those.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.680
There's lots of complications with glibc.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.140
Maybe there's some other libraries

22:55.140 --> 22:57.620
you have, stuff like Curses or X11,

22:57.620 --> 23:00.940
or the standard library for, say, C++.

23:00.940 --> 23:03.340
There's just lots of stuff lurking all over,

23:03.340 --> 23:07.580
and a lot of it might need a 32-bit compiler or toolchain.

23:07.580 --> 23:09.700
Now, in theory, it's often possible

23:09.700 --> 23:11.340
that you can do cross-compilation,

23:11.340 --> 23:13.660
but it's just a lot of infrastructure

23:13.660 --> 23:14.980
that actually has to be supported

23:14.980 --> 23:16.860
to make all of this work at the level

23:16.860 --> 23:18.380
that you expect on a modern Linux desktop.

23:18.380 --> 23:20.980
Well, if you try to file a bug against a 32-bit application

23:20.980 --> 23:22.700
that was built on a 64-bit system,

23:22.700 --> 23:24.460
they'll tell you to go screw yourself.

23:24.460 --> 23:26.620
You're supposed to, if it's going to work in production,

23:26.620 --> 23:29.220
you build a 32-bit app on a 32-bit system.

23:29.220 --> 23:32.100
I mean, it is possible, but in practice, there's problems.

23:32.100 --> 23:34.020
On top of that, many build systems just

23:34.020 --> 23:36.940
don't really even support it, so there's that as well.

23:36.940 --> 23:39.700
So forgive my perhaps ignorant question,

23:39.700 --> 23:43.060
why do Valve care so much about the 32-bit thing?

23:43.060 --> 23:45.700
Is Steam a 32-bit app or something?

23:45.700 --> 23:47.620
Keep in mind, this was an employee at Valve.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.580
This wasn't an official Valve announcement

23:49.580 --> 23:50.740
about a Valve partner.

23:50.740 --> 23:53.140
This was an employee venting on Twitter.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.300
But it's the games.

23:55.300 --> 23:56.060
It's the games.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.340
The games need the 32-bit libraries,

23:58.340 --> 24:00.140
because a lot of the games are 32-bit.

24:00.140 --> 24:02.900
And everybody that has played a handful of Steam games

24:02.900 --> 24:04.020
has definitely run into this.

24:04.020 --> 24:06.020
I mean, I know I have 32-bit libraries on my system

24:06.020 --> 24:09.020
right now just for Steam games.

24:09.020 --> 24:11.420
Canonical's Insight data that they

24:11.420 --> 24:14.780
get from the surveys that people opt into in 1804

24:14.780 --> 24:18.340
shows that less than 3% are getting the 32-bit version

24:18.340 --> 24:19.900
of the ISO.

24:19.900 --> 24:20.660
That's the ISO.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.000
Doesn't tell you how many of them

24:22.000 --> 24:24.180
are 64-bit systems running 32-bit libraries,

24:24.180 --> 24:26.180
but that tells you how many people are going directly

24:26.180 --> 24:27.500
to 32-bit.

24:27.500 --> 24:28.900
It tells you, really, as a whole,

24:28.900 --> 24:31.100
it affects your entire system to run a single 32-bit

24:31.100 --> 24:31.660
application.

24:31.660 --> 24:33.900
We'll have a great breakdown linked in the show notes

24:33.900 --> 24:36.860
if you want to dive into just everything that has to go on.

24:36.860 --> 24:38.220
There's a real technical cost.

24:38.220 --> 24:39.980
There's a genuine technical cost.

24:39.980 --> 24:41.440
And sure, we all have memory to burn,

24:41.440 --> 24:43.140
and we all have processor to burn these days.

24:43.140 --> 24:44.280
But I don't know.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.380
I like my system to be as efficient as possible.

24:46.380 --> 24:46.780
Right.

24:46.780 --> 24:48.100
As always, supporting this stuff,

24:48.100 --> 24:49.420
it's a cost-benefit analysis.

24:49.420 --> 24:51.420
And if people are using it, and it's useful to have,

24:51.420 --> 24:53.420
then you should do it, but it's never free.

24:53.420 --> 24:54.940
Somebody tell me if I'm wrong.

24:54.940 --> 24:57.740
But let's just pretend we live in a world where

24:57.740 --> 25:00.860
internet outrage didn't drive immediate reaction

25:00.860 --> 25:02.340
by corporations.

25:02.340 --> 25:04.540
And Canonical really stuck to their guns on this.

25:04.540 --> 25:06.240
And they said, no, no, no, no.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.140
You don't understand.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.500
We're going to maintain the libraries in 1804.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.300
There'll be ways to get those libraries on 1910.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.220
It's not a big deal.

25:14.220 --> 25:15.940
The libraries aren't changing that much.

25:15.940 --> 25:18.120
We'll be backporting security fixes.

25:18.120 --> 25:19.940
You just get it that way.

25:19.940 --> 25:21.380
What if they had done that?

25:21.380 --> 25:23.140
Because to me, it seems like, because that

25:23.140 --> 25:25.140
was the original proposal, to me, I

25:25.140 --> 25:28.060
see a few ways that problem could have been solved.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.860
We could have had our cake and eat it, too.

25:29.860 --> 25:34.820
We could keep 1910 64-bit pure, and then wrap all this stuff up

25:34.820 --> 25:35.700
in a snap.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.860
One Steam snap that has all the 32-bit libraries you need.

25:38.860 --> 25:42.300
Or how about the flat pack that literally already exists?

25:42.300 --> 25:44.140
There is a flat pack already that you

25:44.140 --> 25:46.340
can install on a pure 64-bit system,

25:46.340 --> 25:48.140
and you can play 32-bit games.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.540
It exists today.

25:49.540 --> 25:50.460
Of course it does.

25:50.460 --> 25:51.580
What about a PPA?

25:51.580 --> 25:54.980
How about a PPA that just installs the 1804 libraries?

25:54.980 --> 25:56.180
Could have done that.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.220
Valve could update the Steam runtime

25:58.220 --> 26:01.380
to just simply include the now missing 32-bit libraries.

26:01.380 --> 26:04.380
They have chosen certain libraries to include already,

26:04.380 --> 26:06.620
but then opted to allow the OS vendor

26:06.620 --> 26:10.100
to supply the rest that they consider to be less important.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.460
Perhaps Valve could reconsider.

26:11.460 --> 26:13.820
It seems like the community does think they're important.

26:13.820 --> 26:15.460
Perhaps they could just package them up

26:15.460 --> 26:18.980
like they've been already packaging a lot of libraries.

26:18.980 --> 26:20.820
So what I don't quite understand,

26:20.820 --> 26:23.020
and I'm genuinely seeking feedback here,

26:23.020 --> 26:27.860
is what was the risk?

26:27.860 --> 26:29.520
It seemed like there was always going

26:29.520 --> 26:30.940
to be a pretty solid solution.

26:30.940 --> 26:33.540
In fact, some that are already working today.

26:33.540 --> 26:37.340
So I don't quite understand what the upset was about,

26:37.340 --> 26:39.700
why we needed a change.org petition,

26:39.700 --> 26:46.540
why we harassed canonical employees over the weekend

26:46.540 --> 26:47.780
about this.

26:47.780 --> 26:51.060
PC Gamer just posted an article this morning,

26:51.060 --> 26:53.820
even after canonical clarified, just

26:53.820 --> 26:57.260
trying to get clicks and drive controversy.

26:57.260 --> 26:59.580
You had people that were trying to get others

26:59.580 --> 27:00.940
to switch distributions.

27:00.940 --> 27:02.780
Come to Manjaro, it'll solve your problems.

27:02.780 --> 27:05.060
I mean, that was all over the place.

27:05.060 --> 27:09.280
And I don't understand why we, as a fairly technical community,

27:09.280 --> 27:11.420
are susceptible to this, because it seems like,

27:11.420 --> 27:12.960
and I guess maybe I'm just idealist,

27:12.960 --> 27:15.540
but it seems like the immediate conversation should be,

27:15.540 --> 27:17.780
all right, well, how do we solve this with technology?

27:17.780 --> 27:19.500
How do we get together as a community

27:19.500 --> 27:21.180
and collaboratively solve this problem?

27:21.180 --> 27:23.860
Right, or at least maybe the beginnings of, hey,

27:23.860 --> 27:25.540
this could cause problems for us.

27:25.540 --> 27:26.460
What are our avenues?

27:26.460 --> 27:29.140
Do you have, how can we migrate our software?

27:29.140 --> 27:33.100
Because usually, and I know this is true for canonical,

27:33.100 --> 27:35.380
people care about others running their software,

27:35.380 --> 27:36.660
and they want to help, right?

27:36.660 --> 27:38.500
You could be a part of this in a positive way

27:38.500 --> 27:41.340
and engage and have help from canonical

27:41.340 --> 27:43.140
to find the best solution.

27:43.140 --> 27:45.660
It's harder to do when you start in such an aggressive tone.

27:45.660 --> 27:47.580
Well, what I don't understand is that people

27:47.580 --> 27:51.020
are so up in arms over this now, where

27:51.020 --> 27:53.380
this is something that's been talked about for quite a while

27:53.380 --> 27:53.860
now.

27:53.860 --> 27:56.300
Yeah, I think it was that developer at Valve's tweet

27:56.300 --> 27:58.820
that sort of, that kicked off the headlines.

27:58.820 --> 28:02.180
Why are we taking faith in this guy's statement

28:02.180 --> 28:04.780
when it's not a direct statement from Valve?

28:04.780 --> 28:07.580
I mean, I've gone to Valve's blog.

28:07.580 --> 28:09.900
They've stated nothing about any of this.

28:09.900 --> 28:12.220
I guess to be fair, there was also

28:12.220 --> 28:15.740
a conversation going on on the wine development mailing list,

28:15.740 --> 28:18.220
too, about some serious, right?

28:18.220 --> 28:21.740
But yeah, again, I come back to there were ways,

28:21.740 --> 28:25.700
there always was going to be ways to solve this.

28:25.700 --> 28:27.940
And at some point, we do need to move forward.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.740
Just for funsies, was it you that

28:29.740 --> 28:31.980
went and dug up the original announcement

28:31.980 --> 28:33.900
about transitioning to 64-bit?

28:33.900 --> 28:35.740
Yeah, way back in the day over at Linux.com.

28:35.740 --> 28:39.100
And it's quaint, because it's written in a way where they

28:39.100 --> 28:40.420
clearly don't think we'll be.

28:40.420 --> 28:43.740
The 32-bit support's like a transitional technology.

28:43.740 --> 28:46.140
These will hang around for a while and then be gone.

28:46.140 --> 28:47.660
Yeah.

28:47.660 --> 28:49.660
Like, no, here we are in 2019.

28:49.660 --> 28:51.260
Yeah, almost like 15 years later.

28:51.260 --> 28:53.020
Yeah.

28:53.020 --> 28:54.940
You do kind of wonder, when is it time to go?

28:54.940 --> 28:56.220
And I know the elephant in the room here

28:56.220 --> 29:00.220
is that Mac OS Catalina drops in the fall, and it's 64-bit only.

29:00.220 --> 29:02.500
And Apple's like, just shut up and make it work.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.620
Deal with it.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.060
And they don't even have the same technical.

29:05.060 --> 29:07.460
They don't have the Snaps, Flatpaks, Docker images.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.180
They don't have Chirrut environments.

29:09.180 --> 29:12.420
We have a lot of ways to solve this problem.

29:12.420 --> 29:13.980
I think what kind of gets me, I'm

29:13.980 --> 29:15.420
going to just take this moment to remind everybody,

29:15.420 --> 29:18.780
currently a very happy Fedora user on my daily driver,

29:18.780 --> 29:21.340
and just moved my server over to Fedora.

29:21.340 --> 29:24.900
However, you have to acknowledge that Canonical takes it

29:24.900 --> 29:27.140
in the face on this stuff all the time.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.260
They move something forward like this

29:29.260 --> 29:31.700
that maybe is a little bit earlier than anybody else,

29:31.700 --> 29:34.500
or because of the size of their user base,

29:34.500 --> 29:37.540
it's genuinely the first time it matters.

29:37.540 --> 29:40.260
They take the brunt of the reaction.

29:40.260 --> 29:41.900
And then in a year when Fedora announces

29:41.900 --> 29:45.380
they're going 64-bit only, crickets.

29:45.380 --> 29:48.940
The day OpenMandriva announces it, crickets.

29:48.940 --> 29:52.300
Canonical's reputation constantly takes it

29:52.300 --> 29:55.140
as they move this stuff forward.

29:55.140 --> 29:59.020
And people love to trot out old wounds like Mirin Upstart.

29:59.020 --> 30:01.220
It even came up on the YouTube comments.

30:01.220 --> 30:02.260
Pulsatio.

30:02.260 --> 30:02.860
Yeah.

30:02.860 --> 30:07.860
And at what point do you go, you have

30:07.860 --> 30:09.460
to weigh the good with the bad.

30:09.460 --> 30:12.100
They make a decision, they listen to the feedback,

30:12.100 --> 30:14.500
and they change it.

30:14.500 --> 30:15.780
That seems to be the balance.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.240
That seems to be the right balance.

30:17.240 --> 30:20.500
And in this particular instance, I

30:20.500 --> 30:22.820
kind of wish they'd stuck a little more to their guns,

30:22.820 --> 30:25.380
because you've got to think about the long-term picture

30:25.380 --> 30:26.180
here.

30:26.180 --> 30:29.860
These distributions, like 2020, the LTS version,

30:29.860 --> 30:34.420
are going to be supported until, what, 2025?

30:34.420 --> 30:36.040
And then and now they're doing 10 years,

30:36.040 --> 30:38.180
so it could be even longer.

30:38.180 --> 30:40.860
So when they commit to shipping these 32-bit libraries

30:40.860 --> 30:43.340
in these LTS distributions, they're

30:43.340 --> 30:46.460
committing to paying staff to maintain those libraries,

30:46.460 --> 30:48.900
even if they import them from Debian once a cycle.

30:48.900 --> 30:52.180
Yeah, that's still a lot of money, time, and effort.

30:52.180 --> 30:53.760
For years.

30:53.760 --> 30:56.820
So they have to cut at some point,

30:56.820 --> 30:58.940
because there is a knock-on effect for years.

30:58.940 --> 30:59.780
A long tail, yes.

30:59.780 --> 31:01.780
A very long tail here.

31:01.780 --> 31:03.260
And somebody's got to do it eventually.

31:03.260 --> 31:04.780
That's what makes it so funny, too.

31:04.780 --> 31:07.580
We had this discussion in such a rapid, quote, unquote,

31:07.580 --> 31:09.620
discussion, in such a rapid-fire manner,

31:09.620 --> 31:12.620
when this is all stuff happening over months and years

31:12.620 --> 31:13.220
of timeline.

31:13.220 --> 31:14.980
So there's plenty of time to figure it out.

31:14.980 --> 31:18.820
The fervor really kind of started Saturday morning,

31:18.820 --> 31:21.660
London time, which is where Canonical's offices are.

31:21.660 --> 31:22.900
Saturday morning.

31:22.900 --> 31:25.380
And they had provided clarification

31:25.380 --> 31:29.980
by Monday morning, PST, Pacific time.

31:29.980 --> 31:32.400
That's a very, very small window of time

31:32.400 --> 31:34.380
to respond, to come to a consensus,

31:34.380 --> 31:35.740
and then issue a statement.

31:35.740 --> 31:36.820
Which is funny, because a lot of people

31:36.820 --> 31:38.660
are getting on them for not responding faster.

31:38.660 --> 31:40.060
What do you expect?

31:40.060 --> 31:42.060
You need to go watch our video on burnout,

31:42.060 --> 31:44.020
because this is getting ridiculous.

31:44.020 --> 31:47.540
Anyways, so yeah, the end result is essentially

31:47.540 --> 31:50.480
they're backpedaling to a degree.

31:50.480 --> 31:54.940
And they do leave a line in the second to last paragraph

31:54.940 --> 31:57.180
in their update, they write, there

31:57.180 --> 31:59.660
is a real risk to anybody who is running

31:59.660 --> 32:03.340
a body of software that gets little testing.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.620
Again, they're trying to tell you in a professional,

32:05.620 --> 32:09.600
non-fearmongering way that they don't think, in their opinion,

32:09.600 --> 32:12.560
that these are safe libraries, that this stuff is not

32:12.560 --> 32:14.380
getting enough attention, and they really

32:14.380 --> 32:16.140
recommend that we stop using it.

32:16.140 --> 32:18.460
And we're kind of forcing them to continue to ship it.

32:18.460 --> 32:19.540
That sucks.

32:19.540 --> 32:21.820
Yeah, it must be pretty frustrating.

32:21.820 --> 32:23.140
We've been thinking about it.

32:23.140 --> 32:24.420
It's not like they rushed into this.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.060
You might say that they did, or that they

32:26.060 --> 32:27.780
could have done some things better,

32:27.780 --> 32:30.660
or communicated more, or whatever.

32:30.660 --> 32:32.200
It really wasn't rushed into you.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.340
It's just silly.

32:33.340 --> 32:33.980
All right.

32:33.980 --> 32:35.940
I know by the time people are listening to this,

32:35.940 --> 32:37.100
it's probably been talked to death.

32:37.100 --> 32:39.420
So if you have thoughts in the Mumble Room you want to chime

32:39.420 --> 32:40.460
in, let's do it in the post-show,

32:40.460 --> 32:42.700
because I know people are probably sick of the topic.

32:42.700 --> 32:47.100
But that's where it stands of us right now, at least.

32:47.100 --> 32:48.100
Any other thoughts?

32:48.100 --> 32:48.600
Yeah.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.300
Maybe just go play some games on your sweet gaming Linux rig.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.860
I'm going to go play some 32-bit games while I still can.

32:53.860 --> 32:56.380
I actually thought it would be kind of a laugh

32:56.380 --> 33:00.260
to start a change.org petition that demanded that Canonical

33:00.260 --> 33:02.020
goes all 64-bit.

33:02.020 --> 33:02.860
Do the opposite.

33:02.860 --> 33:04.620
Get that gross 32 off my system.

33:04.620 --> 33:06.660
Promote it here in the show, and get quadruple

33:06.660 --> 33:09.220
the amount of signatures.

33:09.220 --> 33:10.380
But I thought, you know what?

33:10.380 --> 33:12.140
Canonical's probably just ready to move the F on.

33:12.140 --> 33:13.560
They don't need me trolling them.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.060
I am too.

33:14.060 --> 33:17.140
Yeah, me too.

33:17.140 --> 33:19.940
All right, and with that, let's do a little housekeeping.

33:19.940 --> 33:21.460
We've got some good stuff.

33:21.460 --> 33:22.860
We won't be doing the Friday stream.

33:22.860 --> 33:24.540
I mention that here because a lot of times

33:24.540 --> 33:27.260
the crew here on this show is who's on the Friday stream.

33:27.260 --> 33:30.220
So it's like a sneaky second Linux Unplugged.

33:30.220 --> 33:31.940
But this week we're going to be in Texas,

33:31.940 --> 33:33.780
so no Friday stream this week.

33:33.780 --> 33:35.020
But Friday 8 just came out.

33:35.020 --> 33:37.140
Best thing about a Monday, Friday stream comes out.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.020
Random access memories.

33:39.020 --> 33:39.980
Wes is there.

33:39.980 --> 33:40.780
Drew's there.

33:40.780 --> 33:42.340
Cheese is there, I'm there.

33:42.340 --> 33:45.820
And we share the stories of our very first PCs.

33:45.820 --> 33:47.980
Yeah, it's a retro show.

33:47.980 --> 33:49.060
It's all sentimental.

33:49.060 --> 33:51.220
It's a lot of nostalgia, a lot of fun.

33:51.220 --> 33:53.420
We solve some problems for the world.

33:53.420 --> 33:54.380
Of course we do.

33:54.380 --> 33:57.200
And I won't spoil it, but there is a competition

33:57.200 --> 34:00.340
to give away a game in the show.

34:00.340 --> 34:02.380
And one of the hosts here on the show wins.

34:02.380 --> 34:03.460
We won't say anymore.

34:03.460 --> 34:04.620
We won't say anymore.

34:04.620 --> 34:07.540
Fridaystream.com is a really, really fun episode.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.020
Go check that out.

34:09.020 --> 34:11.180
And then catch up while we have an off week.

34:11.180 --> 34:12.140
Why not, right?

34:12.140 --> 34:13.260
Oh, yeah, that's a great tip.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.820
We're doing it at 1 PM Pacific time.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.220
Check out meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting, too.

34:17.220 --> 34:18.980
We have a security meetup coming.

34:18.980 --> 34:21.540
We just had our burnout, understanding burnout,

34:21.540 --> 34:22.140
I should say.

34:22.140 --> 34:23.140
What's actually the name?

34:23.140 --> 34:24.860
The understanding burnout meetup.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.580
And it was really good.

34:26.580 --> 34:27.340
Really good.

34:27.340 --> 34:28.140
Fantastic.

34:28.140 --> 34:30.020
I mean, Drew's got a heck of a file he's got to go through.

34:30.020 --> 34:32.100
But once we get a chance to process it and all that,

34:32.100 --> 34:33.540
we'll get it up on the YouTube channel.

34:33.540 --> 34:34.100
It's a lot, Drew.

34:34.100 --> 34:34.580
I'm sorry.

34:34.580 --> 34:35.900
It's a long one.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.060
But it's so good.

34:37.060 --> 34:38.020
It's really good.

34:38.020 --> 34:40.060
This is an instance where the Mumble Room showed up.

34:40.060 --> 34:43.420
We had just a really great participation.

34:43.420 --> 34:44.740
And just, ah, so good.

34:44.740 --> 34:46.380
And organic, helpful discussions.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.620
We'll have a link to that in a future Linux Unplugged.

34:48.620 --> 34:51.340
Or just keep an eye out at meetup.com slash Jupiter

34:51.340 --> 34:53.940
broadcasting for that.

34:53.940 --> 34:56.220
Also, a little sneaky tip.

34:56.220 --> 34:57.380
This is a little birdie.

34:57.380 --> 34:59.740
This isn't an official feature, but I

34:59.740 --> 35:01.300
think you guys might like to know.

35:01.300 --> 35:04.060
Linux Academy is going to be soft-rolling out

35:04.060 --> 35:07.020
transcripts on the platform over the next couple of days

35:07.020 --> 35:08.060
or the videos.

35:08.060 --> 35:10.100
Killer feature when you're trying to study.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.660
Now, it's just going to be initially in some videos.

35:11.660 --> 35:12.420
They're working out the tech.

35:12.420 --> 35:13.580
You know, they want it to be really solid.

35:13.580 --> 35:14.080
Of course.

35:14.080 --> 35:15.260
I've seen the demos, though.

35:15.260 --> 35:16.220
It's nice.

35:16.220 --> 35:17.380
The implementation is solid.

35:17.380 --> 35:18.580
The tech is good.

35:18.580 --> 35:21.180
But they're going to be measured about how they roll it out.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.180
But a little sneaky little insider tip.

35:23.180 --> 35:24.140
I notice that's rolling out soon.

35:24.140 --> 35:25.620
I know people have asked in the audience.

35:25.620 --> 35:26.540
Yeah, that's nice to have.

35:26.540 --> 35:27.620
It's really nice to have that.

35:27.620 --> 35:27.780
All right.

35:27.780 --> 35:31.580
Anything else we want to mention in the housekeeping?

35:31.580 --> 35:33.260
All right.

35:33.260 --> 35:35.100
I'm calling it then.

35:35.100 --> 35:37.020
So you probably heard in the last few episodes,

35:37.020 --> 35:38.980
if you've been listening, that we

35:38.980 --> 35:41.860
did a hot swap, a live swap, of our free NAS

35:41.860 --> 35:43.860
box to a Fedora box.

35:43.860 --> 35:45.620
At the time, we said, don't do what we did.

35:45.620 --> 35:46.460
But it actually worked great.

35:46.460 --> 35:47.180
So maybe you should.

35:47.180 --> 35:48.340
Jeez, it's been good.

35:48.340 --> 35:50.380
And we'll keep you, you know, if it goes wrong, we'll tell you.

35:50.380 --> 35:50.880
Of course.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.180
Of course.

35:52.180 --> 35:53.020
Oh, my gosh.

35:53.020 --> 35:55.140
It's been so good.

35:55.140 --> 35:57.500
Because we really took the philosophy

35:57.500 --> 36:00.300
of put all of the applications we're running

36:00.300 --> 36:02.180
on this thing in a container.

36:02.180 --> 36:03.780
Is NetData in a container, or is that actually

36:03.780 --> 36:04.660
installed on the host system?

36:04.660 --> 36:05.360
That's on the host.

36:05.360 --> 36:05.860
All right.

36:05.860 --> 36:07.860
So that might be the one app that is actually

36:07.860 --> 36:08.820
installed locally.

36:08.820 --> 36:11.780
But otherwise, it's pretty much just a pure Fedora server

36:11.780 --> 36:13.900
install.

36:13.900 --> 36:18.180
And then we have begun standing up back-end services

36:18.180 --> 36:20.740
that I am already so elated over.

36:20.740 --> 36:23.460
But the one that was sort of number one

36:23.460 --> 36:26.660
with a bullet on our list was replacing Dropbox.

36:26.660 --> 36:28.260
So it's not a, you know, as a business,

36:28.260 --> 36:31.140
it's not the end of the world to pay $1,000 a year for storage.

36:31.140 --> 36:32.340
But it's a big chunk of change.

36:32.340 --> 36:33.220
And it's sizable.

36:33.220 --> 36:34.340
You have to think about it.

36:34.340 --> 36:35.580
It's not on the accounting.

36:35.580 --> 36:36.260
Yeah.

36:36.260 --> 36:39.180
Well, you know, $1,000 a year in hard drives

36:39.180 --> 36:41.540
would be a much better investment, in my opinion.

36:41.540 --> 36:44.660
And this is so silly.

36:44.660 --> 36:47.580
Because now, I disagree with past Chris.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.620
Past Chris is such an idiot, you know?

36:49.620 --> 36:51.540
Future Chris, you don't know about that guy.

36:51.540 --> 36:53.700
But present Chris is really, he's got to figure it out.

36:53.700 --> 36:54.780
I'm hopeful for future Chris.

36:54.780 --> 36:55.860
He's going to come through for us.

36:55.860 --> 36:56.060
Right.

36:56.060 --> 36:57.580
But present Chris, I really feel like he's

36:57.580 --> 36:58.660
got everything figured out.

36:58.660 --> 37:00.820
You know, he really knows what's going on.

37:00.820 --> 37:03.980
And he had came to a realization that the reason why

37:03.980 --> 37:06.580
he was sticking with Dropbox was really

37:06.580 --> 37:09.700
because I just wanted something that was fundamentally

37:09.700 --> 37:13.700
really good file sync technology that I could generate a web

37:13.700 --> 37:16.300
URL so people that don't have an account

37:16.300 --> 37:18.260
or don't have the software installed

37:18.260 --> 37:20.140
could still get access to resources.

37:20.140 --> 37:20.980
It's a combo, right?

37:20.980 --> 37:23.900
It's this everywhere file system that follows you around.

37:23.900 --> 37:27.140
And you can easily get stuff from it whenever you want.

37:27.140 --> 37:29.080
And sort of sneaking up on me, I didn't even

37:29.080 --> 37:32.140
realize what's happening, Wes, is it turns out

37:32.140 --> 37:34.460
like a good mobile app matters.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.340
Yeah, it does.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.220
When I started file sync, it didn't matter.

37:37.220 --> 37:41.540
But now here in the 2019s, I want a good mobile app.

37:41.540 --> 37:42.740
You do stuff on your phone.

37:42.740 --> 37:44.940
And the better it is, the more you can do.

37:44.940 --> 37:48.700
So when Dropbox announced their latest update where

37:48.700 --> 37:51.140
they would be packaging the Electron Runtime

37:51.140 --> 37:53.500
and integrating with Google Docs and Google Sheets

37:53.500 --> 37:56.820
and trying to connect all of your different online systems

37:56.820 --> 38:00.020
together in one activity dashboard

38:00.020 --> 38:02.100
that you could share with your colleagues,

38:02.100 --> 38:06.700
I realized if the dropping of everything but Extended For

38:06.700 --> 38:08.940
wasn't enough, this was it.

38:08.940 --> 38:10.320
It's not your Dropbox anymore.

38:10.320 --> 38:12.260
It's just not a product for me anymore.

38:12.260 --> 38:12.860
It's not.

38:12.860 --> 38:16.300
And I thought Nextcloud wasn't for me

38:16.300 --> 38:19.540
because I didn't want the overhead of a whole website

38:19.540 --> 38:20.960
and all of the collaborative stuff.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.220
I just wanted file sync.

38:22.220 --> 38:24.820
So I was convinced I would go with Sync Thing or Resilio

38:24.820 --> 38:26.220
Sync.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.180
I tried them all out.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.620
And I thought about it from a collaborative space.

38:29.620 --> 38:31.980
And I realized how important some of the mobile app features

38:31.980 --> 38:33.740
were and the web interface was.

38:33.740 --> 38:36.260
And in the end, Nextcloud won out.

38:36.260 --> 38:37.300
So I came to you, Wes Payne.

38:37.300 --> 38:42.420
I said, Wes, bestow upon us a Nextcloud instance.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.580
That's how he talks all the time in real life, yeah.

38:44.580 --> 38:45.220
It's weird.

38:45.220 --> 38:47.820
And Wes, grant us with the performance

38:47.820 --> 38:50.340
that only a dedicated database can provide.

38:50.340 --> 38:52.660
These are the words that I conveyed to you.

38:52.660 --> 38:57.580
And you came back to me with a multi-container setup

38:57.580 --> 38:58.740
on our fake net.

38:58.740 --> 39:00.460
So can you walk us through our setup a little bit?

39:00.460 --> 39:01.860
And then we'll get into everybody else's setup.

39:01.860 --> 39:04.300
Yeah, actually, Nextcloud provides

39:04.300 --> 39:09.660
some pretty handy Docker Compose YAML files ready to go up

39:09.660 --> 39:10.980
in their repositories on GitHub.

39:10.980 --> 39:13.220
We'll have that linked, of course.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.220
So you can get it set up.

39:14.220 --> 39:15.840
There's all kinds of ways.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.240
It's a blessing and a curse with Nextcloud.

39:18.240 --> 39:21.380
There's also a really handy Linux server I.O. image

39:21.380 --> 39:22.820
we also have linked.

39:22.820 --> 39:24.300
And there's a snap.

39:24.300 --> 39:26.780
So there's all kinds of ways to get Nextcloud installed.

39:26.780 --> 39:30.300
Well, to that end, we'll hear from each of those

39:30.300 --> 39:31.060
in a moment.

39:31.060 --> 39:32.980
But you went with the official.

39:32.980 --> 39:34.620
Yeah, I thought we might as well give it a try, right?

39:34.620 --> 39:35.820
See what that road was like.

39:35.820 --> 39:38.540
And we ran into a few snafus, because I

39:38.540 --> 39:41.780
wanted to use Postgres, which is my database of choice.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.620
And we ran into an issue with using

39:43.620 --> 39:46.460
some of the automated setup to sort of populate our stuff,

39:46.460 --> 39:48.740
set up an admin user right out of the box.

39:48.740 --> 39:50.740
Had to do a little tinkering with the database.

39:50.740 --> 39:52.380
Were they expecting you to use a different database?

39:52.380 --> 39:54.660
Well, no, it just seems like that bug

39:54.660 --> 39:56.900
was only affecting Postgres, because you can also

39:56.900 --> 39:59.940
use MariaDB or SQLite.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.780
But we wanted good database performance,

40:01.780 --> 40:04.180
as that's supposedly quite important for doing

40:04.180 --> 40:07.620
heavy file syncing of large media files.

40:07.620 --> 40:10.500
Once we got through that, through all the configuration

40:10.500 --> 40:12.580
stuff, it's working great.

40:12.580 --> 40:14.500
So we have Redis in there.

40:14.500 --> 40:18.240
We have a Postgres container, the actual web container

40:18.240 --> 40:21.340
that has all the app and has PHP FPM running,

40:21.340 --> 40:23.540
and then some proxies in front of it that are handling

40:23.540 --> 40:25.180
lots of encryption, all the rest.

40:25.180 --> 40:28.060
Yeah, and it works beautifully, and the performance

40:28.060 --> 40:29.700
seems to be actually pretty wonderful.

40:29.700 --> 40:32.300
While we're talking the container method, though,

40:32.300 --> 40:34.460
Alex, do you know what would be the advantage of going

40:34.460 --> 40:37.740
with the Linux server IO container over the project's

40:37.740 --> 40:38.380
main container?

40:38.380 --> 40:40.860
This is an aspect of Docker that bewilders me.

40:40.860 --> 40:42.900
So full disclosure, Linux server IO

40:42.900 --> 40:45.660
is a website that I helped found several years ago.

40:45.660 --> 40:48.900
But the reason that I run the Linux server

40:48.900 --> 40:51.220
image instead of the upstream Nextcloud image

40:51.220 --> 40:54.580
is the permissions mapping that the Linux server images do.

40:54.580 --> 40:58.540
So the user that is running inside of a container

40:58.540 --> 41:01.580
will probably have a different UID and GID

41:01.580 --> 41:04.060
to that on the host.

41:04.060 --> 41:06.820
So we allow, through environment variables,

41:06.820 --> 41:09.660
which are specified at runtime, you

41:09.660 --> 41:12.580
can specify a specific user and group

41:12.580 --> 41:15.740
ID that matches that that's running inside the container.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.700
So it just makes permissions a lot more simple.

41:18.700 --> 41:20.060
All right, very good.

41:20.060 --> 41:21.540
A lot of the other things, almost all

41:21.540 --> 41:22.500
of the other things we're running

41:22.500 --> 41:23.380
are Linux server IO images.

41:23.380 --> 41:23.860
Oh, yeah.

41:23.860 --> 41:25.500
There's, I don't know, 10 of them on there.

41:25.500 --> 41:26.420
Yeah, that has been really good.

41:26.420 --> 41:29.140
Well, I expect nothing less, Chris.

41:29.140 --> 41:31.780
Well, that way, I know who to yell at if it doesn't work.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.780
I'm going to treat that.

41:33.780 --> 41:36.260
OK, so Cheesy, you did the snap method, right?

41:36.260 --> 41:42.900
Yeah, I did the snap method in super simple snap install,

41:42.900 --> 41:46.220
setting up your let's encrypt certs.

41:46.220 --> 41:50.420
I'd spoken with Wimpy at Linux Fest Northwest,

41:50.420 --> 41:53.420
and I told him how snaps are just kind of freaky to me

41:53.420 --> 41:56.100
because I'm used to being a little more hands-on

41:56.100 --> 41:59.860
with my setup and going through and editing files

41:59.860 --> 42:02.300
and setting up the configuration and everything.

42:02.300 --> 42:05.460
So it's just weird that literally just one command can

42:05.460 --> 42:07.900
pull it down and get it working.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.300
So that's what I've done.

42:09.300 --> 42:13.860
But one thing that I did notice with that particular snap image

42:13.860 --> 42:17.740
is that it's based on Nextcloud 15.

42:17.740 --> 42:22.780
I wanted to run 16, and you can do that.

42:22.780 --> 42:25.820
It took a little bit of a Google foo getting around

42:25.820 --> 42:27.580
and just reading some of the documentation

42:27.580 --> 42:29.060
there for the snap.

42:29.060 --> 42:34.900
But doing a snap refresh package name,

42:34.900 --> 42:40.420
tac-tac channel equals 16 forward slash candidate,

42:40.420 --> 42:44.300
then you can pull down the latest 16 and give it a go.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.940
You can even pull down edge versions or nightly builds.

42:46.940 --> 42:48.860
Yeah, and you can revert as well if it screws up.

42:48.860 --> 42:50.260
I've played a little bit with the snap as well.

42:50.260 --> 42:50.980
It's pretty nice.

42:50.980 --> 42:52.620
Yeah, it's super painless.

42:52.620 --> 42:57.140
And then what I've done is I've gone through and connected

42:57.140 --> 43:01.980
to some block storage elsewhere so that all of my data

43:01.980 --> 43:05.180
basically resides in that storage

43:05.180 --> 43:08.400
so that if I need to nuke or do something different

43:08.400 --> 43:13.580
with the snap or if I wanted to flip it over

43:13.580 --> 43:18.140
to being a Linux server.io Docker container,

43:18.140 --> 43:18.820
I could do that.

43:18.820 --> 43:19.980
Right, the data's still there.

43:19.980 --> 43:21.380
And my data's still there.

43:21.380 --> 43:22.460
Yeah.

43:22.460 --> 43:26.180
Chris and I, we were talking about how good a time

43:26.180 --> 43:28.100
it is to be running some of these server side

43:28.100 --> 43:32.140
apps on Linux because it's easy to reason about

43:32.140 --> 43:33.660
and it's safe because all of them

43:33.660 --> 43:35.740
have these nice mechanisms for protecting your data.

43:35.740 --> 43:38.500
Yeah, I mean, multiple times yesterday,

43:38.500 --> 43:40.540
we would just completely destroy a container

43:40.540 --> 43:43.060
and then stand it back up and just reattach it to the data.

43:43.060 --> 43:44.500
And it's like nothing changed.

43:44.500 --> 43:46.060
It's just incredible.

43:46.060 --> 43:48.260
Several years ago, I was pretty anti-Docker.

43:48.260 --> 43:50.260
I thought it was going to be a flash in the pan

43:50.260 --> 43:53.720
and a waste of time and just the next kind of noise

43:53.720 --> 43:56.140
in the industry, really.

43:56.140 --> 43:58.460
And then I started using, this was when I was using Unraid,

43:58.460 --> 44:01.580
so it was probably five years ago now.

44:01.580 --> 44:04.500
Docker was like 0.3 or 0.4 or something.

44:04.500 --> 44:06.820
It was a while ago.

44:06.820 --> 44:13.700
And I blew away probably 15 apps worth of configuration

44:13.700 --> 44:15.700
by mistake.

44:15.700 --> 44:17.380
However, it turned out that Unraid

44:17.380 --> 44:21.180
had mapped my volumes to a persistent storage somewhere.

44:21.180 --> 44:22.600
And I hadn't really realized what

44:22.600 --> 44:26.660
I'd done to set it up because I was a complete novice.

44:26.660 --> 44:30.420
I reinstalled Unraid and came back and had all of my apps

44:30.420 --> 44:33.420
exactly as they were within five minutes.

44:33.420 --> 44:35.580
And I'll tell you what, that single thing alone

44:35.580 --> 44:37.140
was just like a light bulb going off

44:37.140 --> 44:39.700
in my head of just to say, yes, containers.

44:39.700 --> 44:43.540
But storing the state outside of the application runtime,

44:43.540 --> 44:45.220
I am 100% on board with this.

44:45.220 --> 44:46.820
This is fantastic.

44:46.820 --> 44:49.500
So Drew, we haven't asked you yet.

44:49.500 --> 44:52.020
So we've got a couple of container-based installs.

44:52.020 --> 44:53.100
We've got a Snap installed.

44:53.100 --> 44:55.340
Have you done a traditional install for your Nextcloud?

44:55.340 --> 44:57.540
Or are you also a container guy now?

44:57.540 --> 44:58.620
Container all the way.

44:58.620 --> 45:00.900
Mine is set up very similar to the way

45:00.900 --> 45:04.060
Wes set up the Studio instance in that I've

45:04.060 --> 45:09.340
got Docker running Nextcloud, Redis, and PostgreSQL all

45:09.340 --> 45:10.900
behind a reverse proxy.

45:10.900 --> 45:12.420
So very, very similar.

45:12.420 --> 45:12.940
Wow.

45:12.940 --> 45:15.180
None of us have done a traditional package

45:15.180 --> 45:16.300
install or anything.

45:16.300 --> 45:17.020
I don't want to.

45:17.020 --> 45:22.260
I mean, especially for a PHP sort of app like Nextcloud,

45:22.260 --> 45:22.900
unpleasant.

45:22.900 --> 45:24.460
I literally never would.

45:24.460 --> 45:26.540
After this experience, I just never would.

45:26.540 --> 45:28.860
And I think my takeaway advice is,

45:28.860 --> 45:30.940
if you're running an instance for a group of people,

45:30.940 --> 45:33.740
like a small office, or a couple, or a family,

45:33.740 --> 45:36.060
the Snap version is really solid.

45:36.060 --> 45:38.020
I've experimented with it, used it myself.

45:38.020 --> 45:40.540
And if you're going for a larger team instance,

45:40.540 --> 45:42.700
like we're using here, then something

45:42.700 --> 45:44.620
with a traditional Postgres database

45:44.620 --> 45:46.940
is a better setup using a container, where

45:46.940 --> 45:48.700
you have a little bit of flexibility,

45:48.700 --> 45:51.780
because it is a fast-moving project that needs updates.

45:51.780 --> 45:53.180
And that's kind of the nice thing,

45:53.180 --> 45:55.060
is we can just track now.

45:55.060 --> 45:57.300
And if things go wrong, we'll just go back.

45:57.300 --> 45:57.820
Go back.

45:57.820 --> 45:58.340
Go back.

45:58.340 --> 46:00.220
Just a heads up for other listeners,

46:00.220 --> 46:02.060
MySQL works just fine as well, if you

46:02.060 --> 46:04.260
prefer that for your database.

46:04.260 --> 46:04.820
There you go.

46:04.820 --> 46:05.300
Yeah.

46:05.300 --> 46:06.540
Yeah.

46:06.540 --> 46:09.380
So there's a lot you can do with Nextcloud besides file sync.

46:09.380 --> 46:11.940
But that's how I came at it.

46:11.940 --> 46:15.340
I've always really been primarily interested in that.

46:15.340 --> 46:18.020
But I started now to look at it more as like a team

46:18.020 --> 46:20.300
collaboration piece of software.

46:20.300 --> 46:23.220
And when I changed my perspective to that,

46:23.220 --> 46:24.980
I think I started, that's really for me

46:24.980 --> 46:26.020
when I started to click.

46:26.020 --> 46:29.180
I started to see in a different light.

46:29.180 --> 46:32.940
And I've been watching how Drew and Cheese

46:32.940 --> 46:35.340
use Nextcloud quite a bit.

46:35.340 --> 46:38.140
You guys have really kind of integrated it quite a bit.

46:38.140 --> 46:41.540
I have a sense maybe you're one of the longer Nextcloud

46:41.540 --> 46:43.420
users on the show.

46:43.420 --> 46:44.580
I'm not sure, though.

46:44.580 --> 46:46.100
I get that sense, though.

46:46.100 --> 46:47.540
Six months, maybe.

46:47.540 --> 46:48.180
OK.

46:48.180 --> 46:50.340
Cheese, how long have you been running Nextcloud now?

46:50.340 --> 46:52.940
Probably three, four months.

46:52.940 --> 46:53.460
OK.

46:53.460 --> 46:54.540
So we're all kind of new to it.

46:54.540 --> 46:55.100
What about you, Alex?

46:55.100 --> 46:57.380
So I guess maybe, Alex, you're probably the longest term.

46:57.380 --> 46:58.540
Over a year.

46:58.540 --> 47:01.700
Before I emigrated, I digitized every single document

47:01.700 --> 47:02.340
in my house.

47:02.340 --> 47:06.620
And I have to say, when I was emigrating across the ocean,

47:06.620 --> 47:08.660
just being able to pull up a scan of this bill

47:08.660 --> 47:11.100
or that piece of ID at a moment's notice on my phone

47:11.100 --> 47:13.300
was so unbelievably useful.

47:13.300 --> 47:14.220
That sounds wonderful.

47:14.220 --> 47:14.780
Yeah.

47:14.780 --> 47:19.340
So when I started looking at it, and we're obviously the newest

47:19.340 --> 47:21.700
because we've only been running it for a week.

47:21.700 --> 47:24.060
So it's still very new to us.

47:24.060 --> 47:27.300
But I've ran Nextcloud on and off for years now.

47:27.300 --> 47:29.100
And now that I'm looking at it, it's

47:29.100 --> 47:31.020
more of like a team collaboration tool.

47:31.020 --> 47:32.500
These apps are starting to make sense.

47:32.500 --> 47:33.900
One that I'm looking into right now

47:33.900 --> 47:36.020
is called Workflow External Scripts.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.800
I'll put a link to this in the show notes.

47:37.800 --> 47:40.740
And this just allows you to pass files through this.

47:40.740 --> 47:44.020
And depending on the type of file and set of defined rules,

47:44.020 --> 47:45.260
it will take different actions.

47:45.260 --> 47:47.700
So I was imagining we could have a Nextcloud drop

47:47.700 --> 47:50.340
folder where this would be set up.

47:50.340 --> 47:53.620
And it would read the file name and then take actions based on

47:53.620 --> 47:54.340
and what type of file it is.

47:54.340 --> 47:54.940
Where it needs to go.

47:54.940 --> 47:56.620
Oh, that's a great idea.

47:56.620 --> 47:58.700
Absolutely something we could use, right?

47:58.700 --> 47:59.940
So that I put in there.

47:59.940 --> 48:02.620
The other one that I installed, but it sounds like maybe

48:02.620 --> 48:04.540
isn't so great, is there's an audio player

48:04.540 --> 48:06.020
that I thought would be great for us

48:06.020 --> 48:08.660
because we have a lot of media content in there.

48:08.660 --> 48:09.860
That's hit and miss.

48:09.860 --> 48:11.660
Doesn't seem to be working, does it, cheese?

48:11.660 --> 48:15.380
Well, I tried out the latest version of that audio player

48:15.380 --> 48:18.020
plug-in or app, as they call it.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.620
And on my particular instance, which

48:19.620 --> 48:22.800
is just a DigitalOcean droplet with one CPU

48:22.800 --> 48:29.860
and two gigs of RAM, there was this crazy runaway PHP FPM

48:29.860 --> 48:33.860
process that I can only associate with that player.

48:33.860 --> 48:36.140
That I guess, I don't know exactly what it was,

48:36.140 --> 48:39.100
but it pegged the CPU at 100%.

48:39.100 --> 48:41.940
So I mean, I think that there are still,

48:41.940 --> 48:44.900
maybe on the particular instance that you have set up,

48:44.900 --> 48:46.220
it might not be a big deal.

48:46.220 --> 48:47.980
You're the guy trashing the server now.

48:47.980 --> 48:48.740
Yeah.

48:48.740 --> 48:50.740
No, that's always me.

48:50.740 --> 48:52.620
I'm always the guy that's just totally soaking up

48:52.620 --> 48:53.420
the CPU.

48:53.420 --> 48:55.700
Yeah, some of these apps are a little hit and miss.

48:55.700 --> 48:58.340
And you do have to kind of check how they went.

48:58.340 --> 49:00.940
Sometimes you have side effects.

49:00.940 --> 49:04.020
There's something that Nextcloud doesn't do by default

49:04.020 --> 49:07.100
that seems sort of necessary for what our use case is,

49:07.100 --> 49:09.420
because we'll often be inviting people in,

49:09.420 --> 49:12.300
is it doesn't have registration on by default.

49:12.300 --> 49:13.780
When you go to Nextcloud, you just

49:13.780 --> 49:15.100
kind of have to have an account or someone

49:15.100 --> 49:16.460
has to have made one for you.

49:16.460 --> 49:18.340
And again, that's nice for like a small team.

49:18.340 --> 49:19.780
Yeah, private, right?

49:19.780 --> 49:21.380
So I turned on the registration app,

49:21.380 --> 49:23.860
and I said, if your email is this domain,

49:23.860 --> 49:25.860
you can register, essentially, is what I did.

49:25.860 --> 49:26.340
And that works.

49:26.340 --> 49:28.380
That's a great little feature for small teams.

49:28.380 --> 49:30.420
And you can make sure it goes into this group.

49:30.420 --> 49:31.900
You can turn on two factors as well.

49:31.900 --> 49:34.220
But here's, I wanted to find something kind of cool

49:34.220 --> 49:36.020
that you could never have in Dropbox.

49:36.020 --> 49:38.900
I turned this on for the whole team, because I'm that guy.

49:38.900 --> 49:40.580
It's called Keep or Sweep.

49:40.580 --> 49:42.100
Keep or Sweep.

49:42.100 --> 49:45.660
It's Tinder for your files, essentially.

49:45.660 --> 49:47.340
When you get bored and you're in Nextcloud,

49:47.340 --> 49:49.740
you hit this little random button that's up in the toolbar,

49:49.740 --> 49:52.380
and it'll just bring up a random file in your Drop,

49:52.380 --> 49:54.500
in your Nextcloud, almost a Dropbox.

49:54.500 --> 49:56.660
It'll bring up a random file in your Nextcloud,

49:56.660 --> 49:59.100
and it will ask you if you want to keep it or delete it.

49:59.100 --> 50:00.140
Oh, that's kind of handy.

50:00.140 --> 50:02.060
And you can sweep it or keep it.

50:02.060 --> 50:04.420
And I sat there, and I went through.

50:04.420 --> 50:06.460
And I started going through some old pictures.

50:06.460 --> 50:07.980
I don't need that picture anymore.

50:07.980 --> 50:09.060
Sweep it.

50:09.060 --> 50:10.100
Yeah, yeah.

50:10.100 --> 50:12.500
Speaking of pictures, I'm looking forward

50:12.500 --> 50:14.920
to when we go to events, turning on the phone auto upload

50:14.920 --> 50:15.740
feature in the app.

50:15.740 --> 50:17.740
And just have it like, as I'm taking pictures at events,

50:17.740 --> 50:20.620
just put them all up on Nextcloud automatically.

50:20.620 --> 50:22.900
But this one is a game changer.

50:22.900 --> 50:26.340
Now, this, I admit, is not applicable to all teams,

50:26.340 --> 50:29.780
or even probably anyone else on our team.

50:29.780 --> 50:31.420
But this one I'm very excited about.

50:31.420 --> 50:32.340
It's PhoneTrack.

50:32.340 --> 50:35.780
People might be familiar that I have a Rover tracker in the RV.

50:35.780 --> 50:38.300
And he likes everyone to know where he is all the time.

50:38.300 --> 50:41.580
I really only turn it on when I'm on trips, typically.

50:41.580 --> 50:45.620
Every now and then, we went somewhere in Oregon,

50:45.620 --> 50:47.140
and I turned it on.

50:47.140 --> 50:48.100
And somebody noticed.

50:48.100 --> 50:49.380
That was kind of cool.

50:49.380 --> 50:52.180
Because it is always up at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash

50:52.180 --> 50:53.680
Rover, at least the tracker is.

50:53.680 --> 50:54.620
But I pay for that.

50:54.620 --> 50:56.740
And it uses a proprietary service.

50:56.740 --> 50:58.340
And it has a hardware device.

50:58.340 --> 51:00.420
You've got like a dongle hanging around you.

51:00.420 --> 51:03.780
So PhoneTrack is an application for Nextcloud

51:03.780 --> 51:05.580
that will generate links that you can plug

51:05.580 --> 51:10.420
into corresponding apps on a phone or hardware device.

51:10.420 --> 51:13.380
And it will supply location data to this Nextcloud

51:13.380 --> 51:14.380
application.

51:14.380 --> 51:16.740
And then it will generate a real time map

51:16.740 --> 51:18.660
using OpenStreetMaps.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.060
And it looks really good.

51:20.060 --> 51:21.460
And you can get history.

51:21.460 --> 51:24.200
You can create an entire tracking session.

51:24.200 --> 51:26.660
You can display location history if you want.

51:26.660 --> 51:30.260
You can check distances and points.

51:30.260 --> 51:33.100
You can display session statistics.

51:33.100 --> 51:36.420
And of course, you can also make it public if you want.

51:36.420 --> 51:40.020
It'll generate a public page that I could make available,

51:40.020 --> 51:41.180
which is kind of neat.

51:41.180 --> 51:43.900
So we wouldn't necessarily have to use the proprietary tracking

51:43.900 --> 51:44.340
service.

51:44.340 --> 51:46.100
We could use this.

51:46.100 --> 51:47.580
That is a great application.

51:47.580 --> 51:48.220
I tried it out.

51:48.220 --> 51:49.700
I loaded an app on the old iPhone

51:49.700 --> 51:52.060
and said allow background tracking.

51:52.060 --> 51:54.740
And sure enough, it's accurate.

51:54.740 --> 51:57.100
It's very accurate.

51:57.100 --> 51:59.820
And I was able to then share the link with the team.

51:59.820 --> 52:01.420
It could be useful, too, though, right?

52:01.420 --> 52:02.700
If you're trying to coordinate or maybe we're

52:02.700 --> 52:04.300
all going to the same meetup or event

52:04.300 --> 52:06.300
and keeping track of one another.

52:06.300 --> 52:08.420
I actually think it'd be a great way for a meetup

52:08.420 --> 52:11.540
to tweet out, here, this is where we're at.

52:11.540 --> 52:14.000
Especially if we were at some sort of large event

52:14.000 --> 52:15.180
where you're moving around.

52:15.180 --> 52:16.460
Oh, right.

52:16.460 --> 52:19.340
Or if I'm on the road.

52:19.340 --> 52:21.620
The main reason I've used the Rover tracker so far

52:21.620 --> 52:23.540
is because people watch where I'm going.

52:23.540 --> 52:24.340
And they send me emails.

52:24.340 --> 52:25.500
And they're like, hey, man, if you're in my town,

52:25.500 --> 52:28.260
stop by and say hi.

52:28.260 --> 52:29.620
Let's go get dinner or something.

52:29.620 --> 52:31.460
And so that's really neat because people

52:31.460 --> 52:33.180
can kind of anticipate where I'm going to go next if they're

52:33.180 --> 52:34.340
looking at the map and stuff.

52:34.340 --> 52:35.140
Right.

52:35.140 --> 52:36.460
I'll be in this in two hours.

52:36.460 --> 52:37.340
Yeah, right.

52:37.340 --> 52:38.740
Now it's just on Next Class.

52:38.740 --> 52:39.620
Just on Next Class.

52:39.620 --> 52:41.260
I think the thing that we have now

52:41.260 --> 52:45.020
is something like it's close to $90 a month for the service.

52:45.020 --> 52:45.900
Shh.

52:45.900 --> 52:48.460
It's meant for fleets that have trucks

52:48.460 --> 52:50.180
that they want to track and stuff.

52:50.180 --> 52:52.620
It's not really meant for the industrial grade solution.

52:52.620 --> 52:55.780
It's not meant for a podcaster in his RV.

52:55.780 --> 52:57.420
Cheesy, you threw in a news app.

52:57.420 --> 52:59.020
Oh, it looks like a feed reader app.

52:59.020 --> 53:00.560
Yeah, and that's exactly what it is.

53:00.560 --> 53:04.940
So I've previously been using an instance of fresh RSS,

53:04.940 --> 53:08.460
basically just to have my own little RSS news reader

53:08.460 --> 53:12.060
that I can log into and pull down feeds from.

53:12.060 --> 53:17.380
Just switched over a couple of days ago to using the news app

53:17.380 --> 53:18.580
that's in Next Cloud.

53:18.580 --> 53:21.260
And it's super solid, really good.

53:21.260 --> 53:24.260
It's a lot quicker than fresh RSS was

53:24.260 --> 53:27.420
as far as updating the feeds.

53:27.420 --> 53:30.020
It will give you kind of like a little notification

53:30.020 --> 53:34.380
if you're on that tab letting you know that it's been updated.

53:34.380 --> 53:36.860
It's a really solid, solid news reader.

53:36.860 --> 53:38.620
I'll tell you where they could improve it.

53:38.620 --> 53:42.340
If they made it so it was a group RSS shared set of feeds

53:42.340 --> 53:45.900
so we could have like a one feed dashboard

53:45.900 --> 53:48.860
that we could go into, that would be great.

53:48.860 --> 53:51.580
The way it is now is each user has their own app data.

53:51.580 --> 53:52.260
Right.

53:52.260 --> 53:56.140
And then another thing I would recommend that an app that you

53:56.140 --> 53:58.180
install, and maybe one of the first,

53:58.180 --> 54:01.860
is the app order app, which will allow

54:01.860 --> 54:05.900
you to reshuffle the icons along the top header.

54:05.900 --> 54:07.620
So you can place those wherever you want.

54:07.620 --> 54:11.060
You can do that from an admin level.

54:11.060 --> 54:16.180
So you can choose what to show all of the users, which

54:16.180 --> 54:18.620
icons to show them, which ones not to show them.

54:18.620 --> 54:20.820
You can reorder them.

54:20.820 --> 54:23.100
Or you can just set it up so that the user basically

54:23.100 --> 54:28.860
has the ability to reorder and show and hide whichever icons

54:28.860 --> 54:30.380
that they want to see.

54:30.380 --> 54:31.900
So it's a really nice little feature

54:31.900 --> 54:33.140
that I'd like to see built in.

54:33.140 --> 54:37.780
Another one is right click.

54:37.780 --> 54:41.220
At first, whenever I installed Nextcloud and I got it going,

54:41.220 --> 54:44.780
and I couldn't right click and get that context menu,

54:44.780 --> 54:46.420
it kind of drove me crazy.

54:46.420 --> 54:49.540
So I would highly recommend that you also install the right

54:49.540 --> 54:50.340
click app.

54:50.340 --> 54:53.180
Right click is pretty much necessary in 2019.

54:53.180 --> 54:55.220
So I have a couple of recommendations as well.

54:55.220 --> 54:59.620
One of them is a two factor authentication for login.

54:59.620 --> 55:02.080
So that supports like Google Authenticator and Authy

55:02.080 --> 55:03.580
and all that kind of stuff.

55:03.580 --> 55:05.700
As I mentioned, I've got a lot of personal information

55:05.700 --> 55:06.260
in this one.

55:06.260 --> 55:09.260
So I wanted to make sure it was safe and secure.

55:09.260 --> 55:11.820
The other one is QoNotes.

55:11.820 --> 55:13.900
I don't know if you've used this desktop app.

55:13.900 --> 55:16.780
I think it's Qt app that allows you to take notes.

55:16.780 --> 55:20.660
And it allows me to use Nextcloud to sync my notes

55:20.660 --> 55:22.620
like I used to use Evernote to do.

55:22.620 --> 55:23.620
I think it's text only.

55:23.620 --> 55:25.460
But I mean, that's good enough for most things.

55:25.460 --> 55:26.580
Supports markdown.

55:26.580 --> 55:28.060
Yeah, it supports markdown.

55:28.060 --> 55:29.460
And yeah, that's all I need.

55:29.460 --> 55:32.640
So QoNotes API is the name of the plug-in for Nextcloud.

55:32.640 --> 55:34.180
Yeah, we should probably set that up.

55:34.180 --> 55:35.460
I love QoNotes.

55:35.460 --> 55:36.220
That's a good one.

55:36.220 --> 55:38.420
Drew, you got any pro Nextcloud tips?

55:38.420 --> 55:39.260
Yes.

55:39.260 --> 55:43.620
So you can actually use it as a full PIM suite PIM,

55:43.620 --> 55:46.100
personal information management.

55:46.100 --> 55:49.620
It does have a mail client and a calendar.

55:49.620 --> 55:52.020
And you can even get your contacts in there

55:52.020 --> 55:55.260
if you want to set it up so that you have all of your stuff.

55:55.260 --> 55:56.580
Is it good though?

55:56.580 --> 55:57.700
It's OK.

55:57.700 --> 55:58.380
It's not great.

55:58.380 --> 56:02.200
It's not going to be challenging Gmail and Google Calendar

56:02.200 --> 56:03.380
anytime soon.

56:03.380 --> 56:07.700
But as far as a simple implementation

56:07.700 --> 56:11.500
of each of those things, it's all right.

56:11.500 --> 56:14.980
So really, if you're going the route of Nextcloud

56:14.980 --> 56:17.700
because you want the enhanced privacy

56:17.700 --> 56:22.460
aspect of self-hosting it and not having somebody controlling

56:22.460 --> 56:25.980
your stuff, and say you also have your own mail server,

56:25.980 --> 56:30.420
this is a good way to have a web-based interface

56:30.420 --> 56:35.860
to your various services like mail, contacts, calendars

56:35.860 --> 56:38.540
that isn't being snooped on.

56:38.540 --> 56:44.140
So using it that way, you can get a little more off the grid,

56:44.140 --> 56:45.060
as it were.

56:45.060 --> 56:47.660
I have one more pro tip, if I may.

56:47.660 --> 56:50.260
And that is something called Rclone.

56:50.260 --> 56:53.100
Now, Rclone allows you to mount a directory using

56:53.100 --> 56:55.860
Fuse on your Linux system.

56:55.860 --> 56:59.220
And then use Google Drive or any other kind

56:59.220 --> 57:01.220
of quote unquote limitless back end.

57:01.220 --> 57:03.380
So if you wanted to host Nextcloud on a droplet,

57:03.380 --> 57:06.300
for example, it's only got 20, 30 gig of disk.

57:06.300 --> 57:08.460
Without paying for digital ocean spaces or something,

57:08.460 --> 57:11.740
you could use your pre-existing Google Drive account.

57:11.740 --> 57:12.780
And it's all encrypted.

57:12.780 --> 57:14.460
Rclone handles the encryption.

57:14.460 --> 57:17.460
And it's completely transparent to Nextcloud using Fuse.

57:17.460 --> 57:19.580
So that's another top tip.

57:19.580 --> 57:21.460
Nice.

57:21.460 --> 57:23.980
My newbie tip then would be take a look

57:23.980 --> 57:26.820
at the desktop client's Selective Sync options.

57:26.820 --> 57:28.620
And I'm very happy to report that I

57:28.620 --> 57:31.420
feel like they've given really good data on the sync process.

57:31.420 --> 57:34.060
In fact, much better data than Dropbox gives.

57:34.060 --> 57:34.540
Really?

57:34.540 --> 57:35.060
Yeah.

57:35.060 --> 57:37.300
I'm really happy with the desktop sync information.

57:37.300 --> 57:40.660
You were skeptical of sync.

57:40.660 --> 57:41.340
Very happy.

57:41.340 --> 57:45.060
And for us, because we have archival information,

57:45.060 --> 57:47.180
we have large productions that some people just

57:47.180 --> 57:49.580
aren't even involved with, Selective Sync

57:49.580 --> 57:51.860
is such a killer feature.

57:51.860 --> 57:54.100
And I'm very happy to report that it seems to be working

57:54.100 --> 57:54.740
quite well.

57:54.740 --> 57:56.340
So my early tips are to play around

57:56.340 --> 57:59.140
in the settings of the Nextcloud client and take a look at that.

57:59.140 --> 58:00.820
I'm excited to switch to this already.

58:00.820 --> 58:04.660
Yeah, I've moved three or four folders out of Dropbox already.

58:04.660 --> 58:05.980
That's how far I've gone.

58:05.980 --> 58:07.900
And then I feel like after the company event,

58:07.900 --> 58:09.900
we're going to just do the big switch.

58:09.900 --> 58:12.420
Another quick tip related to that,

58:12.420 --> 58:15.500
for any GNOME users out there, GNOME Online Accounts

58:15.500 --> 58:16.940
does support Nextcloud.

58:16.940 --> 58:21.900
So you can add it, and it shows up as a file system

58:21.900 --> 58:25.700
in your files app, Nautilus, on the left-hand side,

58:25.700 --> 58:28.980
where you can click into it and directly access

58:28.980 --> 58:32.300
all of your folders, not even the ones that are just synced.

58:32.300 --> 58:34.780
And it just grabs everything over web dev.

58:34.780 --> 58:36.220
Yeah, so you don't even have to.

58:36.220 --> 58:37.740
If you just need a couple of files,

58:37.740 --> 58:39.540
you don't need to bother with sync,

58:39.540 --> 58:41.540
which is probably a fair number of people on the team, really.

58:41.540 --> 58:42.380
Always on connection.

58:42.380 --> 58:42.900
Yeah.

58:42.900 --> 58:44.060
Oh, it's so great.

58:44.060 --> 58:46.900
Yeah, I really think that's pretty neat.

58:46.900 --> 58:49.260
We've been experimenting with all kinds of different ways,

58:49.260 --> 58:53.020
too, to make sure that, like, I have a couple of automation.

58:53.020 --> 58:54.740
I don't want to go into a lot of details,

58:54.740 --> 58:56.440
but I have a couple of automation things

58:56.440 --> 58:59.100
that kick off when certain things enter folders right now

58:59.100 --> 59:00.060
in Dropbox.

59:00.060 --> 59:01.820
And Wes and I yesterday were experimenting

59:01.820 --> 59:05.020
with replicating that Nextcloud with the extra layer

59:05.020 --> 59:08.300
of challenge that you then have to mount that path to where

59:08.300 --> 59:11.620
that is in Nextcloud into the Docker container.

59:11.620 --> 59:13.620
Like, there was a little extra layer

59:13.620 --> 59:16.060
of work we had to do there to kind of figure that out.

59:16.060 --> 59:17.580
So there's some instances like that.

59:17.580 --> 59:19.380
We're still sorting a couple of things out.

59:19.380 --> 59:23.020
But I think for us, the other area we're going to use this

59:23.020 --> 59:24.880
out of, and I don't even know how you do this yet,

59:24.880 --> 59:26.840
is there's that feature where you can request

59:26.840 --> 59:27.940
somebody sends you a file.

59:27.940 --> 59:30.100
And we're going to use that for production purposes.

59:30.100 --> 59:32.980
When we record, we can then send a guest a link,

59:32.980 --> 59:35.460
say, hey, please upload what you just recorded to us here.

59:35.460 --> 59:36.660
Give me those bytes.

59:36.660 --> 59:38.060
And otherwise, we were actually just,

59:38.060 --> 59:39.780
we were discussing building that.

59:39.780 --> 59:42.380
We'll just, I guess we'll just build this ourselves for free,

59:42.380 --> 59:43.140
because that'd be great.

59:43.140 --> 59:45.340
And then we look at the Nextcloud and go, oh, yeah,

59:45.340 --> 59:47.260
like, that's just a feature built in.

59:47.260 --> 59:47.860
It's pretty nice.

59:47.860 --> 59:48.740
Hey, Chris.

59:48.740 --> 59:50.780
I don't know if you remember, but for our Portland trip,

59:50.780 --> 59:52.980
I sent you a link like that, and you gave me all your photos.

59:52.980 --> 59:53.540
Yeah.

59:53.540 --> 59:54.180
All the photos.

59:54.180 --> 59:54.980
That's incredible.

59:54.980 --> 59:55.540
It was awesome.

59:55.540 --> 59:56.540
It was the first time I'd used it.

59:56.540 --> 59:57.500
It worked really well for us.

59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.500
I was going to ask you, have you been finding success there?

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.540
Do you sync a lot of photos?

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.180
You're like, what's the, like that?

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.180
A lot of little files, big files, that kind of.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.020
What's the Brent breakdown?

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.580
Yeah, what's the Brent experience?

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.420
Yeah, so I've been recently moving towards Nextcloud

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.740
for syncing photos to clients as like a method

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:17.020
of delivery because almost everything I

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:22.060
produce in my photography stuff is digital,

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.260
as you might imagine.

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:25.060
So I've been testing that a little bit,

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.900
and it's been working really, really well for clients.

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.100
I've gotten no bad feedback, and it has mostly the features

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.780
I need, not all, but mostly.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:34.780
And it's worked great.

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.700
I haven't had anybody complain about it.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.580
I think after the last week, Cheese and I

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.940
were talking about raw support for giving previews of raw

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.220
photos.

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.140
That's something he ran into as a problem,

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.740
but I don't ever serve raw photos sort of to a public place.

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.540
So it was fine for me.

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.500
But it's been super solid.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.060
I've been running it for a year now,

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:01.540
and also moved all of my contact and calendar

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.060
syncing from the phone to the computer.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.860
Wow, you must be feeling good about it.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:09.220
Oh, yeah, that I've been doing for a few months now.

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:15.180
And I was testing it alongside the Google services,

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:18.020
just because I think, as you learned last time,

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:21.020
you tried Nextcloud, you should sort of test it for a while.

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.540
And sometimes you run into some strange bugs.

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:26.380
But it's been really, really solid.

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.860
And I've been loving it that all of my syncing of almost

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.100
everything is in the same place.

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.740
So one log in, and I get files.

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.940
I get calendars.

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.780
I get contacts.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.020
I get notes.

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.260
I get all that stuff.

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.460
So I would encourage you to consider that as well.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.620
It's been really powerful.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.860
And I've helped a bunch of people move to that.

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:45.740
And they've loved it.

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.980
That does sound appealing, especially because Hedi and I

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.460
right now are trying to sort out,

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.140
what's the best way for us to share that kind of information?

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.340
Nextcloud, dude, definitely is.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.060
Brent, there is a Camera Raw plugin

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.580
that you can install, which I have used successfully

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:00.660
for a while.

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:04.700
Yeah, it requires an iMagic plugin that has been deemed.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.220
Some people said it wasn't so secure.

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:09.380
So I would love to get your take on that at some point.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.280
But that's for that reason I considered not going for it.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:12.780
I didn't know that.

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:13.540
I just installed it.

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:14.180
Honey badger.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.180
I didn't care.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.140
Ironic honey badger.

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:20.180
What's your nextcloud address again?

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.860
Yeah, let's give that out on the air.

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:22.980
Yeah, let's do that.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.620
Can we talk about business applications

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:25.420
for just a moment?

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.180
Please do, sir.

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.140
So there are a couple other cool things

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.620
that you can do with it.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:33.780
There is the ability to white label,

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.180
where you can put in your own logos, your own color

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:38.820
themes, and all of that.

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.020
JBcloud.

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.100
That's right.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.260
And I want to do that.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.740
I definitely want us to do that.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:47.980
There are some other neat features in the app store,

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:54.780
like a DICOM viewer for people working in HIPAA sites,

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:55.980
that actually works.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:01.100
I don't know if you guys have ever had to deal with DICOM

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:06.540
files, but essentially they're files that are typically

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:07.940
somewhat encrypted.

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:12.740
And you end up shipping them on a CD from one hospital

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:13.540
to another.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.620
And then they've got this included viewer

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.220
that only runs on Windows.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.740
And some of them only run on Windows XP.

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.860
Like for x-ray images and whatnot?

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.620
Yeah, I think I have.

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:25.700
It's been a long time.

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.300
So for HIPAA, where you are trying

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.860
to self-host all the things as much as possible,

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:32.980
Nextcloud is a really good option.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:35.900
OK, so now, Brent, you brought it up, Federation.

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.980
I got to ask how Federation is going

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.380
to fit into our future setup.

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:44.020
Because I envision, and I want to get your feedback

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.220
on this, all of you, I envision our on-premises Nextcloud box

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:50.940
being like a source of authority for all of the data,

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:53.580
like terabytes of data on this thing.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:57.700
But then it seems like the more frequent access data,

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:00.380
the less historical stuff, should be available up

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.700
on a droplet or something that's fast and available

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:03.700
for everyone.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.700
And I'm wondering if that's where Federation plays

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.580
into this, or how Federation plays into this.

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:10.820
And if, maybe down the road, I could

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:14.260
have a setup where some data is on some Nextcloud servers

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:17.540
and the rest of it's on another, how that could work?

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.060
Or do you get where I'm going?

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.500
Is there some sort of future where

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.300
I could have some sort of glorious on-premises cloud

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.660
hybrid Nextcloud setup?

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.180
I think the future is here, Chris.

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:26.860
Is it?

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:28.180
Have you played with Federation?

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:31.020
So I have two servers, because I basically

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.540
wanted to play with Federation, but for a few other reasons.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.740
So I have two servers that I am running

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:39.700
with a few different users on each individual server.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.900
And so that way, I can have a certain URL

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:46.780
when I share files to clients, for instance,

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:50.260
and then another sort of internal URL, if you will,

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:54.740
that contains almost all of my internal files.

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:56.340
So you can see it another way, which

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:58.260
is I have one for business and one for personal.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.660
Oh, that's a good idea.

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:04.300
It's been really nice, because I can have certain content

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:09.300
in one place, and I can share it to myself from one server

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.180
to the other.

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.140
I've been really impressed with the Federation.

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:14.700
It isn't instant when you do a share,

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.700
but it's pretty darn close.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:20.460
And so I would say if you've got that sort

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:24.400
of decentralized notion in your mind of where you want to go,

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.180
I'd say go ahead and try it.

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:29.580
It's been super solid and really easy to share files.

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:31.700
They have sort of a nomenclature that's

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.340
easy to understand for sharing files

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:36.060
between different servers from user to user.

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:38.420
And I say go full steam ahead.

01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:40.840
Couldn't be easier to test that kind of thing in Docker,

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.340
though.

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:44.140
You just spin up another container and test it out.

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:44.740
That's true.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:48.620
And we have a system up on DigitalOcean

01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:50.780
that we kind of use for those very kinds of purposes.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.140
So we could definitely try it.

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:56.460
And I think I could also see myself setting up a personal

01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:59.420
next cloud, probably on DO.

01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:01.220
I don't need nearly as much storage.

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:04.460
If I separated my personal stuff from all the JB stuff,

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.140
I'd probably need a couple of gigs at most,

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:10.260
because it's mostly documents and backgrounds that I like.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.820
It's all the boring stuff, yeah.

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:14.220
Don't forget that high res photo sync, though.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.020
That does eat up a lot of space.

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:16.980
It does, yeah.

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.940
But I'm going to be sending those to the JB one,

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:21.620
because my intention there is to just turn that

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:24.500
on while I'm at events, and then turn it off after.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.940
Because otherwise, I've got built-in platform solutions

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:29.540
for syncing the photos and backing them up.

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:34.020
But I guess I feel like one of the things that

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.940
has made me feel like this is the time to go with NextCloud,

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.340
besides just the project getting more mature,

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:44.220
and Dropbox getting crappier, is the setup

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:48.580
that we now have, where we have at multiple layers what I feel

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:52.660
like are solid sketch hatches.

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.540
If the container goes bonkers, we can go back,

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:57.300
or we can switch to a different container.

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.420
It's isolated from the config and the data.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:02.380
The data is not the application.

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:05.180
The two things are not at all intertwined,

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:08.140
and they're completely safe to separate and move

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:09.660
independently.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:14.260
And then the operating system, also, as we have now proven,

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:18.140
can be swapped out to anything that supports ZFS.

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:21.660
I mean, we have gone from a FreeNAS install that

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:25.860
was maybe one release behind or current, and went to Fedora,

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.860
and were able to just successfully mount those CFS

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:29.980
pools.

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:34.100
And did we end up doing these command to bring it up to date?

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.180
We've not upgraded the pool to the latest stuff.

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:37.300
Yeah, we did look, though.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.340
There is an option to essentially upgrade

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.420
the pool to the most current, but then there's

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.260
no going back to FreeNAS if we do that.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.300
Does Alan know that you've dropped BSD?

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.500
I haven't really said anything, no.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.540
I'm pretty confident that at this point, if for some reason

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.300
we were like, oh, screw Fedora.

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.100
It's so horrible for some reason,

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.580
even though we've been running it on other systems on DO

01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:01.260
now for a while, I'm pretty confident we

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:05.180
could put Ubuntu LTS on there, spin those containers up,

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:08.460
and mount that ZFS pool, and we'd be back in business

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:09.580
in an hour.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.420
And so at each, all these different levels,

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.780
we're abstracted and we're safe.

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.460
There's like, next cloud can screw up, we're good.

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:16.900
The ZFS pool can have problems.

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:17.820
It doesn't mess it.

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:19.100
And at the same time, it's not making it

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.460
like it's some horrible thing.

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.340
In fact, it's easier to manage, if anything.

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:22.820
It is.

01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:24.300
It's way easier.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.340
It's great.

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:28.140
I'm giddy with how simple it is, really.

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.780
Once you've gotten the most basic Docker understanding,

01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:34.300
you compose files that are easy to read,

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.740
and the Docker command line is very simple.

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:41.220
Or you can use, even on top of that, you can use cockpit.

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.460
And it has a front end, a graphical front end.

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.740
And if you don't need to do anything fancy, it's fine.

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.700
I'm so pleased you guys are doing this.

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:50.180
It's been the way I've been running my servers now

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.940
for two, three years, or whatever.

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:55.020
Just 100% Docker containers for everything

01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.020
I can get my hands on.

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.860
And it just makes life so, so easy.

01:08:58.860 --> 01:08:59.620
It's great.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.660
I guess I feel like, I don't know,

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:03.580
a lot of times when you do something like this,

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:04.940
you've got to compromise.

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.580
You've got to give something up when

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.340
you go with the free solution that's self-hosted.

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:13.900
But this time, it's like, I'm gaining a bunch of stuff,

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.860
and I'm going to be saving money.

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:21.660
And I also got privacy that I didn't have before.

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.420
So I've gained on every front.

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:24.740
I think the application is better.

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:25.940
The suite of tools is better.

01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:27.500
The platform it's on is better.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.580
And it's private.

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.840
And, oh, by the way, it's under my own roof.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.220
And it's kind of fun.

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:33.740
Yeah, and it's really fun, too.

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:34.340
That, too.

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.220
Because it's not a huge hassle.

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:35.740
Hell yeah.

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:36.900
That, too.

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:38.620
I just, oh.

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.420
This is just, I love open source.

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:43.860
I love free software because this is the right.

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:45.980
This is when it's at its best.

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:46.860
It really is.

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:47.380
So good.

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:49.060
So I really encourage you to go out there and check it out.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.060
However you want to install it, it's

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.040
worth the time to just play around with it a little bit

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.620
and see if maybe it would work for you.

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:56.980
Because I was resistant, legitimately.

01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.900
And I'm just really happy we gave it a go.

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:00.900
And maybe some of our fine audience

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.740
have some tips we should be hearing

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.860
about how they have their Nextcloud instances set up.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:05.860
How do they tell us, Wes?

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:09.620
Oh, linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:10.740
Absolutely.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.540
Hey, by the way, next week, we're

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:18.180
going to have a special on PCI pass-through for virtualization

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:21.100
and our general VM setups, how we do them,

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.020
and maybe some of Wes's tricks for running operating systems.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:27.940
We decided to just make one authoritative episode

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:29.140
that we can refer people to.

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:32.820
So it's going to be our comprehensive setup

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:34.580
on how we do virtualization.

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:37.540
I have been all in on PCI pass-through and eGPUs.

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:40.100
And so has Drew.

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:44.340
And I feel like we need one definitive spot.

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.380
And so while we are traveling, we thought,

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:47.940
let's go ahead and release a special.

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:50.780
So we're going to do a PCI pass-through special next week.

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:51.900
So make sure you grab that.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.900
Should be really good.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.060
All right, Mr. Payne.

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:56.500
Well, I'm so excited I could talk about Nextcloud

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.180
for another hour.

01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.880
But we should probably get to these pics,

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.540
because they're crazy good.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:03.340
And one of them is rather relevant to us that you found.

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:07.180
And I love the way they talk about this project.

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:08.940
So it's called Lexicon.

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:11.940
And here's how it describes itself.

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:14.980
Manipulate DNS records on various DNS providers

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.780
in a standardized way.

01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:19.940
It's just, what does that mean, Wes?

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:23.060
Well, OK, I think Lexicon is actually a great name, right?

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:25.020
Because we're dealing with names.

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.380
We have all these different terms.

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.580
DNS helps you look things up.

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:30.420
Unfortunately, different providers

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.740
do things in different ways.

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:33.260
Some have very nice APIs.

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.100
Some have complicated APIs.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.380
Some have unofficial undocumented APIs.

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.460
All of that's been combined in Lexicon,

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:42.740
which is a handy Python library that has

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:44.140
a great little command line.

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:48.020
So it was built with Let's Encrypt in mind, primarily,

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:50.100
as well as being a general utility.

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.280
So you can do stuff like do their DNS challenge,

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.060
where you have to go add a specific thing to your DNS

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:55.900
update.

01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:58.060
With Lexicon, you can do that programmatically.

01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:02.420
Yeah, and it supports a ton of providers.

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:05.780
Route 53, Cloudflare, Hover.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:11.420
Hover, DigitalOcean, EasyDNS, GoDaddy, obviously,

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:12.500
Google Cloud DNS.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.800
I mean, Linode, just essentially all of them.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:18.660
I'm looking at namecheaps on there.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.620
All of the ones I've ever used are on there,

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.540
including ones I haven't.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.860
So in theory, as long as it's on this list,

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:27.980
regardless of who your DNS provider is,

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:29.940
it's the same set of command syntax

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:32.540
to update DNS records, modify DNS records.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:35.020
Yeah, there's a few little variances here and there

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:36.780
as they're acquired by the platforms.

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:40.100
And it's one PIP package in Python,

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.300
but a few of them have a few extra packages because they

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.640
have extra dependencies, maybe.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.340
So look into the details for your specific provider.

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:48.980
But in our case, we were doing some stuff with Hover.

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:49.740
Really easy.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:50.620
You just had to go.

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:52.820
You could get your credentials, pass that in.

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:55.220
They have a couple different options for how you do it.

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:56.860
And then you can make queries and stuff.

01:12:56.860 --> 01:13:00.620
So we needed a dynamic DNS updater

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:03.020
now that we're using a whole bunch of stuff at the server,

01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:05.900
obviously, here in the studio.

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.740
We want to know where it is when we're on the road.

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.820
That made it really easy.

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.240
I just wrote a little batch script.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.820
You could go and query Hover through lexicon

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:17.180
to find out what the current IP address is.

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:19.340
And you can easily delete it or change it.

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:22.740
And does that just become like a script that gets cronned or?

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:26.500
Yeah, I stuck it in a Docker container on the server here.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.220
And then it's just running all the time.

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.340
Of course it is.

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.780
All right, well, how about something

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:34.220
you're not going to run in a Docker container this week?

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:37.540
It's called Arandr.

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:40.340
I realized that I never really followed up on how I solved

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:41.940
this super obnoxious problem I had,

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:44.660
where I had two vertical screens on the side

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:46.160
and a horizontal screen in the middle.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:48.780
So I have three ASUS 27-inch monitors,

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:52.660
two of which are vertical, one of which is standard 16

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:53.940
or whatever it is.

01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:55.180
You get what I'm saying.

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:57.180
And I have this really obnoxious problem

01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.820
that has plagued me across all the different desktop

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:01.580
environments.

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.620
And I eventually just decided I had

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:04.740
to come up with a solution.

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.940
I thought the desktop environments would solve it.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:10.580
I thought maybe switching to an AMD GPU from an NVIDIA GPU

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:11.540
might solve it.

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.340
A dramatic switch, by the way.

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:14.420
It did not solve it.

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.860
In fact, now it just manifests in different, weirder ways.

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:19.580
So I had to make a script.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:22.260
And Arandr or Arandr or whatever you.

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:23.220
A-ran-der.

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.100
Yeah.

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.340
It's essentially a front end to X-randr,

01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:31.020
which is a way to script the layout of your screen, windows,

01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:31.940
et cetera.

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.660
And the nice thing about this is it just

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:35.380
looks like a regular display manager window

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:37.020
where you arrange your monitors like you

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.420
would in a multi-monitor setup.

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:39.420
And then you hit Save.

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:41.820
And it generates the script for you.

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:43.420
I put that into a desktop launcher.

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:44.420
That's in my menu bar.

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:46.660
As soon as I wake up my screens, if they're screwed up,

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:48.180
I click that within a second.

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:49.580
Everything's laid out perfectly.

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:50.060
You know, it's funny.

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:51.420
I discovered this a few years ago

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.180
when I was still running Unity.

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:55.940
And then I had three screens on an NVIDIA GPU

01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:58.420
over, like they were DisplayPort daisy-chained.

01:14:58.420 --> 01:14:59.500
And it was just the worst.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.980
I had to deal with fighting with the built-in desktop

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:03.780
environment display manager.

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:04.700
It just wasn't as good.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:07.540
Plus, as you say, you can easily add it to startup scripts

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.460
or, you know, just restore scripts.

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:11.420
Yeah, didn't you just use it recently here in the studio?

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:11.540
Oh, yeah.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.300
It's on the Reaper machine now, because I

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.180
wasn't happy with how XFCE was doing it.

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:18.260
Yeah, we have like a stand-up, the jack system,

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:21.620
patch everything in, because we have so many things.

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.660
And so Wes created a script to standardize it.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:25.940
And part of that is you just run this so that way,

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:27.520
every time the monitors, you just

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.980
know they're always laid out correctly.

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:29.580
Exactly.

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:33.780
Yeah, it's so nice, because you can run this once,

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.580
and then it solves the problem for you forever.

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.140
And I don't know if you've ever experienced some of the ones,

01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.100
I think, in the Gnome Heritage, in particular,

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.580
where the screens just don't move where you tell them.

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:44.580
Yes.

01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:45.300
It doesn't happen, right?

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:47.340
It's just it's the perfect amount of simplicity.

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:48.300
It's not flashy.

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.580
It gets the job done.

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:51.100
I will have a link in the show notes.

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.860
I encourage all of you, at least as long

01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:54.940
as we're still running X. That was one of the stories that

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:57.100
did not make it in, but I want to talk about soon,

01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:01.580
is we now kind of have a end-of-days date for X.

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.420
Maybe we'll try to cover that next episode,

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.020
because that's kind of a big deal, too.

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:06.760
And maybe we should spend some time,

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.060
switch totally over to Wayne.

01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.620
Let's see how, you know, evaluate.

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:10.460
Yeah, we really should, especially

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.540
since we've got the ThinkPads with the full Intel set up.

01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:12.940
Yes.

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:13.820
We really could.

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:14.660
I have done it a little bit.

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:17.100
The issue is, once I switch back to XFC,

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.900
I basically kiss that goodbye.

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:23.260
But you know, it's not bad to check in on Gnome or GATEV.

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.260
I think I need to.

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:25.500
Yeah, and we could do that.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:26.780
We could definitely do that.

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:28.580
Well, I want to say thank you, everyone, for listening.

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:31.180
We really appreciate you listening to these shows,

01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:33.380
sharing them with your friends, sending in feedback.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:36.420
Or even if you've just been a longtime, silent listener who's

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.620
never said anything, we're thinking about you,

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:39.020
and we appreciate you.

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:39.780
We do this for you.

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:41.020
That's the whole reason, right?

01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:41.540
Yeah.

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:42.940
We very much appreciate your time

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.220
and choosing to listen to us, so thank you very much.

01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.500
We will not be live next week, because I'll

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:48.660
be traveling back.

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.980
I'll be doing a road trip back from Texas,

01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:54.700
so we'll have the prerecorded PCI pass-through episode.

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.660
But we'll be back after that, the next Tuesday,

01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:57.940
the following Tuesday.

01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:59.660
We do it at 2 PM Pacific time, but you

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.900
can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:02.780
I'm at Chris Ellis.

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:03.900
The network's at Jupiter Signal.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:04.780
Thanks for being here.

01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:06.140
See you next Tuesday.

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:27.140
I'm Chris Ellis, and I'll see you next week.

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:49.380
All right, jbtitles.com, let's go boat.

01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:52.260
I'll tell you where else I use A Render,

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:55.060
and that's when I'm switching between two virtual machines

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:56.940
with PCI pass-through.

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.500
I can use that script on a hotkey

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.940
to rearrange my monitors to have just one as Windows 10

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.540
or just one as Linux.

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.620
That's a nice way to do it.

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:07.580
Yeah, hotkeys are a good way to go, too.

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:08.580
I should hotkey it.

01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.260
I don't know why I don't.

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:12.140
I should, I really should just hotkey that.

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:15.340
Control-F10 is now Windows 10, so I mean, it just makes sense.

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:17.140
That way, when you try it at Wayland again,

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:20.860
you'll have to figure out how to make that work.

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:22.660
You really are in this now.

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:23.940
It's the future, Chris.

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.340
I use XClip and A Render.

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:29.660
I'm heavily all in on X.

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:30.900
Yeah, I know.

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.320
I know when I was reading this post about sort of the plans

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:36.260
for wrapping up Xorg, I was thinking to myself,

01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.780
well, I don't know if I'm ready.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:39.580
I don't know if I'm ready, but you know.

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:42.780
You're going to be installing the weird 32-bit Xorg snap,

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.260
and that'll be your system.

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.380
I'll have XWayland 32-bit.

01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:47.980
No, but seriously, though, you joke,

01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:50.180
but like we were talking about with the 32-bit stuff,

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.220
at some point, you do have to make a transition.

01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:55.180
And like it or not, we're running

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:57.540
an engineer's workstation operating system here.

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:00.060
We're not really running Mac OS for end users, right?

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.860
And so sometimes the stuff's a little bit of a pill

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:07.340
to swallow, but that's sort of the agreement,

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.540
I think, when you run desktop Linux, like it or not.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.700
Maybe I'm wrong, but it sure seems to be the case.

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:15.180
See the upside if we do some playing around there.

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:17.660
That's a good excuse to play with pipeline again, too.

01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:19.820
Yes, yes, yes.

01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.980
I like the way you're thinking, Wes Payne.

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.140
We're going to have to make that happen.

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.060
What are you thinking?

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.380
Are you thinking like Fedora?

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:27.660
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, yeah.

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:28.580
How'd you know?

01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:33.580
Oh, I know.
