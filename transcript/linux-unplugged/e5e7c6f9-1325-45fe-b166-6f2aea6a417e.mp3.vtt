WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
This was a fun tweet that was sent my way if you're stranded in a weird shell and you're only allowed to bring three commands

00:08.480 --> 00:12.120
Which ones do you choose boy? There's a lot of good choices out there

00:12.120 --> 00:17.220
You see tons of folks answering with you know, you need an editor of some type or maybe I'll just bring see

00:17.740 --> 00:23.500
My favorite answer it was just give me common lisp. Okay. All right. What about you cheese?

00:23.500 --> 00:27.000
What would your if you had you could bring up to three commands with you? Which one did you bring?

00:27.580 --> 00:28.720
probably

00:28.720 --> 00:30.720
pseudo

00:31.300 --> 00:33.300
Less and

00:34.780 --> 00:37.960
LS sure, come on. Where's the netcat?

00:39.560 --> 00:41.640
What about you drew which three commands would you bring

00:42.280 --> 00:47.640
Probably cat echo and LS our case. He says I'd bring Hollywood. That'd be good. You know that that

00:48.920 --> 00:52.540
You're not gonna get much work done, but you'll be entertained. How come no one has said apt

00:52.540 --> 00:56.280
It feels like that's the obvious choice or whatever your package manager of choice is DNF

00:56.280 --> 01:03.040
Well, if you have a netcat you can just you know bring the archives across and I see you need to live archiver untar

01:03.040 --> 01:06.160
Or whatever isn't the real answer Emacs. It's got a package manager built

01:18.480 --> 01:25.620
Hello friends and welcome into your friendly Linux weekly talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hi Wes Payne. Hello

01:25.620 --> 01:31.980
Welcome into 353 sir. Oh, I like that number. I know feel so official. Well, we have a really great episode

01:31.980 --> 01:36.220
It's something we've wanted to touch on for weeks and that is your feedback

01:36.220 --> 01:41.740
We got a whole batch of listener feedback this week also have our thoughts on the new pop OS

01:42.220 --> 01:48.300
2004 we've been kicking that around and we'll give you our take on that and we have a new machine that just arrived in the

01:48.300 --> 01:53.740
Studio still in the box. We'll take that out and tell you what laptop we're reviewing next

01:53.740 --> 01:58.940
Plus we have a bunch of community news and so much more to get into so first

01:58.940 --> 02:03.900
Let's start by saying hello to the gentleman on the over the internet mic line. Hello cheesy and drew

02:03.900 --> 02:09.980
Good to have you guys on board. Hello guys. Hello. Hello. Hello and hello to our

02:10.700 --> 02:14.180
Virtual lug time appropriate greetings mumble room. Hello. Hello

02:17.900 --> 02:20.060
So, let's start with some community news

02:20.060 --> 02:25.940
there's a story that I wanted to bring up to the top of the show sort of flag it to everyone's attention if you have

02:25.940 --> 02:32.740
recently installed Ubuntu 20.04 server and chose the encrypted storage option it is possible that that

02:33.340 --> 02:35.940
password you chose for encryption was

02:36.580 --> 02:39.540
Stored in plain text in a log file. Oh

02:40.620 --> 02:43.300
so the fix is out fixes in Wes and

02:44.700 --> 02:46.700
If you grab the most recent

02:46.700 --> 02:53.060
20.05.2 dash 1 8 7 4 of this sub equity. I think it's what it's called package

02:53.660 --> 02:59.700
It will fix the problem. It's an installer issue. Just a bit of an oversight. I guess oopsie doodles

02:59.980 --> 03:05.820
Yeah, one of those rather big oopsie doodles actually and it wasn't an intentional thing

03:05.820 --> 03:10.360
It wasn't like some breach or anything about you back door and there's as far as we know

03:10.360 --> 03:13.620
No examples of this information being used in the wild

03:13.620 --> 03:18.300
It was caught during a check and then submitted as a bug and then of course canonical jumped on it

03:18.300 --> 03:23.140
I might have the timing wrong, but I think they went from discovery to fix took them 17 hours or so

03:23.140 --> 03:26.580
I'm not be able to you might be able to check Wes in the launchpad bug. Oh, yeah

03:26.580 --> 03:32.060
It looks like it was reported here 18 hours ago 19 hours ago and the fix was in five hours ago

03:32.060 --> 03:36.860
So that's some 14-ish hours Wow, even better than what I was told clearly something they're taking seriously

03:36.860 --> 03:41.420
Yeah, you know so very good. But just so you know, that is pretty critical. You should probably get that updated

03:41.420 --> 03:43.420
now

03:43.740 --> 03:45.580
Go check if you've already got your system installed

03:45.580 --> 03:49.700
Maybe just go and see if those log files are hanging around and remove them. Hello to Alan Jude

03:49.700 --> 03:51.480
It's good to have you back on the show, sir. Hello

03:51.480 --> 03:52.180
Hello

03:52.180 --> 03:56.820
Was just saying on the pre show before we actually hit the record button that I've been really enjoying two and a half admins

03:56.860 --> 04:04.000
Which is a new podcast with Alan Jim Salter and Joe Resington at two dot five admins comm is that what it is?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.440
Yep, that's that's our clever domain hack

04:07.100 --> 04:10.860
So clever really good show. It's great to have you and Jim on the same show

04:10.860 --> 04:18.060
And I've been enjoying the first two episodes. Let's go check that out. Definitely don't mention ZFS at all. No that never comes up. I

04:19.060 --> 04:19.980
Love it

04:19.980 --> 04:25.100
you know like always Alan you do a great job of explaining the stuff that people are the most interested to know and sort of

04:25.100 --> 04:26.300
Deliver it in a great in the way

04:26.300 --> 04:29.940
You've always done a great job of delivering it since early days of tech snap clear clear breakdown

04:29.940 --> 04:30.740
I love it

04:30.740 --> 04:35.100
And so you then you add that with Jim in there and then Joe has the perspective that maybe a lot of people in the audience

04:35.100 --> 04:39.120
Have which is they haven't yet learned about this. You need someone to ask the questions

04:39.120 --> 04:44.540
Yeah, he's the dot five and the two admins right there. If you didn't catch it. I craves EFS. There you go

04:44.660 --> 04:46.500
So go check that out. It's good to have you here

04:46.500 --> 04:52.020
We have a whole bunch of a whole bunch of people in the virtual leg over 30 people in there today

04:52.020 --> 04:56.560
Which is really cool. Maybe the best one yet. If you'd like to join us, it's at Tuesday

04:56.620 --> 05:02.860
It's on Tuesday at noon Pacific over JB life TV and then there's instructions if you just google search

05:03.380 --> 05:07.540
Jupiter colony mumble mumble Jupiter broadcasting. Okay. Okay. Thank you

05:07.540 --> 05:13.860
So it's mumble dot Jupiter broadcasting org and that has the setup guide the trickiest thing about our mumble server is

05:13.940 --> 05:18.140
It's using the old default port not the new default port and if you aren't going to join

05:18.300 --> 05:22.220
Maybe just show up a little bit early make sure you can get your mic checked out get through all of our staging

05:22.220 --> 05:26.460
It's great to see not a guy at work back in there because that's one of my favorite nicks of all

05:26.700 --> 05:29.020
Not a guy at work totally innocent

05:29.260 --> 05:35.980
One of the things that got us chatting in our back channels just between Wes I and cheese and drew and everybody else on the team

05:35.980 --> 05:41.300
Was this sort of bold statement made by fedora?

05:41.300 --> 05:45.140
I guess I guess you could attribute it to a statement on fedora's part

05:45.660 --> 05:50.860
This kind of came out. Well not kind of it did come out of a fedora AMA that was conducted on

05:51.460 --> 05:54.980
Telegram and ask me anything where a question was asked

05:54.980 --> 05:59.060
Why is gnome shell the default for fedora workstation?

05:59.060 --> 06:01.740
And then I guess after some reflection they realized, you know

06:01.740 --> 06:09.020
We didn't really challenge that underlying assumption and so then a post was created saying that gnome is not the default for fedora workstation

06:09.020 --> 06:12.220
No, it's not the default Wes. Whoa, that's news to me

06:12.740 --> 06:15.220
But let's dig into what they're actually trying to say here

06:15.220 --> 06:20.440
I get it, but I think it will provoke a conversation that I'd like us to get into what they're essentially

06:21.140 --> 06:28.340
Asserting is that fedora workstation isn't a box of parts where you choose default options and then blast it onto the hard drive

06:28.340 --> 06:31.140
They say no instead. It's a carefully procured

06:32.060 --> 06:38.780
Assemblement of an operating system aimed at developers sysadmins and makers in general if you replace one or more parts of it

06:38.780 --> 06:41.120
Then it stops being fedora workstation

06:41.120 --> 06:45.800
It's not the thing they've created anymore and it starts being a build your own operating system and that's okay

06:45.900 --> 06:50.540
But it's not fedora workstation, right? Then they say this is an important distinction to make

06:50.540 --> 06:56.980
It's not that they have some specific goal of creating this exact gnome experience so much as it is an entire

06:56.980 --> 07:04.740
Workstation product that is tightly integrated that they test as a whole and it's developed as a whole

07:04.740 --> 07:09.620
It's a mindset of how they create the distribution how they test the distribution how they verify the distribution

07:09.620 --> 07:13.140
Yeah, this post is over on Christian Schaller's blog and you know

07:13.140 --> 07:17.420
He writes having been in the game of trying to provide a high quality desktop experience both

07:17.500 --> 07:21.560
Commercially in the form of rel and through the community efforts around fedora workstation

07:21.560 --> 07:29.020
I have seen and experienced firsthand the problems that the mindset of interchangeable desktop creates

07:29.580 --> 07:33.780
For instance before we switch to the fedora workstation branding and it was all just fedora

07:33.780 --> 07:36.580
I experienced reviewers complaining about missing features

07:37.180 --> 07:44.360
Features that we'd actually spent serious effort implementing because the reviewer decided to review a different spin of fedora that can know

07:44.780 --> 07:49.060
Mmm other cases. I remember our customers trying to fix a problem by switching desktops

07:49.060 --> 07:54.780
Only to discover that while the initial issue they wanted fixed got resolved now that they've switched

07:54.780 --> 07:58.120
Well, they have a whole bunch of problems and never saw the fix to the first one

07:58.120 --> 08:05.020
yeah, and so for now rel only offers gnome as the default desktop and the same is true in fedora workstation and that's not because

08:05.020 --> 08:07.940
They don't understand that people enjoy experimenting with other desktops

08:07.940 --> 08:12.100
but because it allows them to work with their customers and users and

08:12.100 --> 08:18.740
And hardware partners on fixing the issues they have with their entire operating system

08:19.180 --> 08:22.380
Because it's a clearly defined entity and adding features

08:22.940 --> 08:29.380
Needed going forward and properly supporting hardware and vendors going forward as opposed to spreading themselves thin

08:29.380 --> 08:35.260
They say this is their take on it and just run around putting band-aids on problems that have been reported

08:35.260 --> 08:35.700
Yeah

08:35.700 --> 08:38.940
And maybe in the long run this is actually beneficial for people who do want to end up

08:38.940 --> 08:43.080
Customizing their operating system because the team is just focused on you know

08:43.080 --> 08:47.540
A narrow set of things like high TPI support getting wayland ready for the desktop

08:47.540 --> 08:51.700
That's what we talk about all the time or making Thunderbolt work properly on Linux

08:51.700 --> 08:56.720
And when you do have this giant mass of things to focus on it's not just not the same as having a you know

08:56.720 --> 09:01.300
A precise goal that you're trying to polish and get ready to ship as fedora workstation

09:01.300 --> 09:07.480
Yeah, and you see this manifest in fedora almost in every release in some way like a recent example

09:07.480 --> 09:13.380
I think has been how they use a system D for the terminal sessions in gnome terminal

09:13.380 --> 09:18.420
No, yeah, which is that's a that's a clear from the GUI all the way down to the low levels of the OS

09:19.180 --> 09:22.740
Integration and there's been other things they when they rolled out like the example

09:22.740 --> 09:29.520
He makes Christian makes here is Thunderbolt support when bolt and Thunderbolt D and all of the security stuff rolled out for fedora

09:29.860 --> 09:36.600
There was a user facing GUI component in gnome system settings. There was a user daemon

09:36.600 --> 09:42.040
In the lower levels of Linux and there was even some hardware firmware changes for some vendors

09:42.040 --> 09:45.700
It was literally like he's speaking to here hardware vendor

09:46.760 --> 09:53.260
assistance lower-level Linux cooperation and GUI implementation and it was executed as a whole

09:53.440 --> 09:59.480
Singular product right and without that. I mean, it's kind of the Linux curse in many ways because we have all these interchangeable parts

09:59.480 --> 10:00.160
Yeah, sure

10:00.160 --> 10:04.200
You know the bolt daemon gets created but you're left on the own for the desktops and well

10:04.200 --> 10:08.720
Maybe eventually plasma does it and who knows who spares the effort on the gnome side to do it?

10:08.720 --> 10:12.000
But when you think of it as a shippable product in this big vertical stack

10:12.060 --> 10:12.880
You're like, well, no

10:12.880 --> 10:15.720
We need to we need to make this work from the bottom on up seems obvious

10:15.720 --> 10:19.480
But it's not generally how we assemble something of a bunch of different parts

10:19.480 --> 10:25.680
And so I guess I can see their point that if you go with this spin of fedora, it's not so much this default

10:25.680 --> 10:32.160
It's that's how that spin is developed. I guess I can get that and it's not like they're not making the plasma spin or other

10:32.160 --> 10:35.120
Spins available. Those are still perfectly easily valid options

10:35.120 --> 10:40.320
But there was something that came up and this is really hard to quantify and I almost debated not even saying it on air

10:40.320 --> 10:45.800
Because it's so silly but in our love plug. We were talking about how when you use

10:46.800 --> 10:48.000
fedora

10:48.000 --> 10:52.460
You can kind of perceive that it's one cohesive product if there's something about it that makes it

10:52.720 --> 11:00.580
Feel like gnome is part of the whole system where most the time when I use gnome or any other desktop on any other distribution

11:00.580 --> 11:05.020
It's like I can perceive there's a separation between gooey and lower level, right?

11:05.020 --> 11:09.540
I mean compared to like a fedora install to just installing, you know an arch. It's not the same

11:09.540 --> 11:12.180
It's not the same. You could put the same theme on there

11:12.180 --> 11:13.860
You can have the same version of gnome shell

11:13.860 --> 11:17.900
You can have the same version of the kernel and the same version of system D

11:17.900 --> 11:21.420
And it still somehow doesn't feel like it's all a single product

11:21.660 --> 11:24.220
that's why I debated not even mentioning it because I

11:24.220 --> 11:31.660
I can't really even describe what that experience is but I bring it up because others also felt like they noticed it in the in the

11:31.660 --> 11:34.140
Lug hangout and I thought okay, so it's not just me

11:34.140 --> 11:38.100
It's not crazy Chris right and we talked so much about all the great work that fedora does sort of you know

11:38.100 --> 11:44.220
Shepherding changes in from upstream and taking them together. I think it'd be easy to forget that there is this holistic approach that's going on

11:44.900 --> 11:48.220
Fedora 32 it's so good. Just if you haven't tried it yet

11:48.220 --> 11:49.980
I'll give that a spin because it's a great release

11:49.980 --> 11:56.060
maybe you can tell what we're talking about here that that sort of full cohesive product experience now something that was going to be a

11:56.060 --> 12:01.020
Cohesive product that is completely dissolved is ton or ton. I think it's ton

12:01.500 --> 12:04.260
Which was the whole crypto?

12:04.980 --> 12:10.980
Currency experiment the telegram was hurtling towards for the last two and a half years

12:11.100 --> 12:15.300
They write on their blog our best engineers have been working on the next generation blockchain

12:16.140 --> 12:17.420
platform

12:17.420 --> 12:20.380
Called ton right? It was telegram open network, right?

12:20.380 --> 12:24.380
Yeah, a cryptocurrency that they were also going to go with that was going to be grand

12:24.380 --> 12:28.300
so you have the blockchain component ton and then you had Graham the coin and

12:28.860 --> 12:36.620
That grand plan for telegram is now over and I think this is really noteworthy because the Linux community is pretty large on

12:37.180 --> 12:38.620
telegram and

12:38.620 --> 12:44.060
For the last two and a half years the best engineers as they put it on their very own blog

12:44.060 --> 12:49.660
Have been focused on a cryptocurrency that by all outside accounts was never going to go anywhere

12:49.700 --> 12:57.620
anyways, why do so many of the messaging apps seem to want to have a cryptocurrency like I remember was it keybase has been working on

12:57.620 --> 12:58.580
one and

12:58.580 --> 13:05.300
Making pop-ups in the app and annoying people that didn't care about cryptocurrencies about it. Although they just got bought by zoom. So who knows? Oh

13:07.060 --> 13:09.540
That hurts so bad I know yeah

13:09.540 --> 13:14.740
um, the other one that gets me and it's also widely embraced by our community is

13:15.380 --> 13:22.460
Library or Libri or whatever library their whole system is really it comes down to a coin and when you cash out that coin it

13:22.540 --> 13:25.820
Impacts negatively your search results on library

13:26.340 --> 13:33.260
Look this one up go look up how you exchange the library coin. It's cute. You basically have to sell it to a completely

13:33.260 --> 13:41.580
Other cryptocurrency something like aetherium or something something that's more widely traded that you can actually then trade elsewhere and it bitcoins too expensive

13:41.580 --> 13:45.200
So go screw yourself. You better go with one of the lower tier priced

13:46.020 --> 13:50.940
Cryptocurrencies then if you're if you're lucky you can either sell that directly into your currency

13:50.940 --> 13:53.840
But more likely what you'll have to do is then sell that

13:54.220 --> 14:00.540
cryptocurrency to buy Bitcoin and then you will have to sell the Bitcoin to actually cash out from library and

14:00.540 --> 14:03.900
This was the same direction Telegram was going down

14:04.180 --> 14:10.460
But unfortunately for them, but maybe fortunately for the users the US court decided that grams couldn't be distributed

14:10.860 --> 14:13.100
not only in the US but

14:13.700 --> 14:14.780
globally

14:14.780 --> 14:20.340
Because they said it's possible US citizens would just find another way of accessing the platform after it launched

14:20.340 --> 14:25.540
so to prevent that grams will not be allowed to be distributed anywhere in the world and

14:25.540 --> 14:32.340
And while it seems like an excessive extreme overreach that the US law could somehow block

14:33.060 --> 14:35.180
free cryptocurrency trade in other countries

14:35.740 --> 14:39.960
There is a pretty established network of interest that is going to enforce that ruling

14:40.100 --> 14:40.580
Yeah

14:40.580 --> 14:46.460
It turns out the dollar is still pretty important as are all the financial institutions here in the States and the way they write about this

14:46.460 --> 14:50.100
Kind of I think betrays where they were going with this

14:50.700 --> 14:52.700
They write about it like

14:52.700 --> 14:55.340
Yeah, like we found a gold mine and

14:56.180 --> 14:58.740
We were gonna start letting people into our gold mine

14:58.740 --> 15:02.120
He says this is a quote from the blog if this doesn't make sense to you

15:02.120 --> 15:07.580
You're not alone, but this is exactly what's happened with ton the mine, which is ton the blockchain

15:07.580 --> 15:12.180
It's investors and grams, which is the gold a judge used this reason

15:12.180 --> 15:16.660
He'd tell people that they should not be allowed to buy or sell grams like they can buy or sell Bitcoin

15:16.980 --> 15:19.500
They look at this as a gold mine

15:19.500 --> 15:23.460
He writes many people invested in the gold mine because they were looking for profits

15:23.540 --> 15:29.420
They didn't want that gold for the gold themselves. They wanted to sell it to other people because of this

15:29.420 --> 15:31.420
You're not allowed to give them the gold

15:31.620 --> 15:37.100
That's how he's thinking about this. That's that's from him interesting this cryptocurrency thing, which is kind of cool

15:37.100 --> 15:39.500
But there was the peak hype when this launched

15:39.980 --> 15:47.540
Was maybe seen as this path to monetization that so many projects seem to be struggling to look for clearly is not gonna happen for Telegram

15:47.540 --> 15:52.780
We're writing this post to officially announce that telegrams active involvement with ton is over

15:53.300 --> 16:01.180
You may see or may have already seen sites using the name or the telegram brand or the ton abbreviation to promote their projects

16:01.540 --> 16:05.260
Don't trust them with your money or data course, of course

16:05.260 --> 16:06.700
There's a sketchy

16:06.700 --> 16:09.460
Stealing your money angle to this whole thing to block chain, man

16:09.460 --> 16:14.560
Is there any cryptocurrency that doesn't have a sketchy angle truth that might just be true of currencies

16:14.560 --> 16:19.480
I think about it. Hey when we when you put money on the line, I mean, there's a lot of incentives

16:19.480 --> 16:24.480
Mm-hmm. That's how you know that Bitcoin is like real money because there's just as many scams around

16:26.640 --> 16:27.960
That's very true

16:27.960 --> 16:31.680
Yeah, it is very true. We got to get to the unboxing here in a moment

16:31.680 --> 16:34.440
But I wanted to talk about a little discovery

16:34.440 --> 16:35.400
I had over the weekend

16:35.400 --> 16:41.760
Thanks to mini Mac and Jill in the love plug this Sunday and also a news item that we thought we could cover here

16:41.760 --> 16:47.660
So you remember the Enlightenment desktop right everyone enlightenment, of course. Oh, yeah, it is still going and

16:48.240 --> 16:52.600
Just this week. They launched a new set of their frameworks

16:53.020 --> 16:56.240
EFL think of it as like their version perhaps of GTK

16:56.240 --> 17:02.120
But they would argue quicker better faster and better looking and they've released a new set of their core libraries

17:02.440 --> 17:05.280
We thought well, what a great opportunity to kind of just take a look at

17:05.280 --> 17:11.600
At enlightenment and I was chatting with a love plug like I was saying and I was I was kind of praising

17:12.400 --> 17:19.000
how the things I love about plasma are some of the Kaywin window rules and telling windows to go exactly at this desktop exactly in

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
this space every time I open it and

17:21.480 --> 17:23.480
Mini Mac and Jill were nodding. Yep

17:23.800 --> 17:30.160
enlightenment can do that enlightenment can do that and then Jill you shared with me one of the features that you found enlightenment to be

17:30.160 --> 17:36.120
Just maybe tops as far as Linux desktops go for all of them is the monitor management

17:36.120 --> 17:39.840
Oh, yeah, they they've been far ahead in that in that area

17:40.480 --> 17:45.800
They have a wonderful screen utility your monitors come up out of the box

17:45.800 --> 17:51.300
And this was like ten years ago before distros multi monitor worked really well on distros

17:51.920 --> 17:54.600
Right now I have three monitors one

17:54.600 --> 18:02.200
43 inch ultra HD and then two 30 inch monitors on the side in portrait mode and

18:03.360 --> 18:08.000
Enlightenment I've got it all configured in enlightenment and it works just beautifully out of the box

18:08.360 --> 18:11.160
Hmm. I think you mean you need a little more screen real estate there Jill

18:12.240 --> 18:16.200
That's great. Next up. She'll be full VR. That sounds like a brilliant setup

18:16.200 --> 18:20.400
But it must get tricky when doing gaming and stuff, you know, I'm a big gamer

18:20.400 --> 18:27.440
I like to game spanning the three monitors. So it's it's a it's a big deal for that to work because most window managers

18:27.440 --> 18:29.440
that does not work out of the box and

18:30.080 --> 18:34.600
With with enlightenment it does that's so cool and mini Mac

18:34.600 --> 18:41.400
There's a performance aspect to it too. That seems to be super palatable even in a VM. I lose enlightenment as Jill

18:41.400 --> 18:47.420
I lose it on all my multi screen environments, but also on computers that have low specs

18:47.420 --> 18:52.820
So enlightenment comes handy because not only does it use quite?

18:53.700 --> 18:59.680
a small amount of one so my system now on that Toshiba has about a hundred megs of ROM

18:59.680 --> 19:03.980
It's using and enlightenment is so scalable. You can use it on that

19:05.660 --> 19:11.980
1024 to 600 pixel laptop and you can use it on a huge machine with like four screens a

19:12.020 --> 19:17.100
Little tidbit you shared with me is there's a reason why themes are slightly trickier on enlightenment

19:17.100 --> 19:23.980
But the net result is much better performance. There is a very very special thing that the themes are in fact binary

19:24.580 --> 19:28.900
So that has a very positive aspect. So the whole thing is really

19:29.580 --> 19:35.200
Really bleeding fast, but it also has a negative aspect that you don't have so

19:35.660 --> 19:42.360
Much themes available for now. You have a an official arc theme that I use that is pretty good

19:42.360 --> 19:50.080
Pretty stable. Yeah arcs great. I love arc, but you have you don't have all these fancy teams that you can use without a desktop

19:50.440 --> 19:57.840
But these themes that you have are binary and they are bleeding fast and you can use them and it's a breeze to use

19:57.840 --> 19:59.520
It it's really a breeze

19:59.520 --> 20:02.560
Computer could you have a question that I bet is on the mind of a lot of people there?

20:02.560 --> 20:07.880
They're a little skeptical of enlightenment. How would it stack up speed wise to something like i3?

20:07.880 --> 20:14.760
As I never use some tiling window managers. I can't really tell you what I can tell you

20:14.760 --> 20:15.920
It's bleeding fast

20:15.920 --> 20:21.080
and when we talk about tiling managers you have a module in enlightenment where you can

20:21.400 --> 20:26.440
Use a tiling options and the coolest cutest thing is you can in fact define

20:26.800 --> 20:31.340
Virtual desktop to use tiling functions and others use not so we can say

20:31.840 --> 20:36.960
My left monitor using tiling functions and my right monitor does not use tiling functions

20:36.960 --> 20:43.060
Oh snap, that's awesome. So you can see my virtual desktop on screen one

20:43.680 --> 20:49.200
Uses tiling functions and my my right screen doesn't so you have

20:50.060 --> 20:57.360
Possibilities you can't even imagine you can choose for every application you use you can choose if yes or no you want the window

20:57.560 --> 21:02.540
Decoration then you can use stacking so you can have like an RC

21:02.540 --> 21:09.940
IRC terminal open remove the window decoration and put it just on always low

21:10.320 --> 21:14.480
So you have like a living background and you have all the other windows

21:14.840 --> 21:19.840
That you can over your living background and you can roll in windows

21:19.840 --> 21:26.400
So you don't have to minimize them you go into Windows title and you roll up your window mouse and you just see the title

21:26.400 --> 21:30.860
Bar or window shading as it is on plasma. Do you have so many options?

21:30.860 --> 21:37.580
You really have to discover and you have to be ready to really crawl to through all the settings

21:37.580 --> 21:39.580
but there's a lot of it and

21:39.920 --> 21:41.720
some of the

21:41.720 --> 21:45.720
Possibilities you have are rather cryptic you get you really have to work

21:46.400 --> 21:51.600
Yourself through the settings, but once you have your setting you will never change it and you will love it

21:51.680 --> 21:54.280
So this is where e live came in

21:54.280 --> 21:59.840
It was recommended to me by you and Jill and you can find it at e live CD org

21:59.840 --> 22:04.480
It is a Debian based preset up enlightenment environment

22:04.480 --> 22:10.840
There's a stable version which I believe uses enlightenment 17 and a beta version which uses enlightenment 16 think and

22:12.000 --> 22:15.880
You can throw it on a VM or on a box and try it out immediately and it's a pre-configured

22:16.280 --> 22:23.000
with a nice theme some default options and it walks you through the basics of using the environment with a

22:23.520 --> 22:27.000
with a help walkthrough and it is a

22:27.000 --> 22:32.240
a blast to try this distribution out and I say this in the

22:32.600 --> 22:38.640
Like the most affectionate way it in some ways reminds me of an older era of Linux setups

22:38.640 --> 22:39.600
Yes

22:39.600 --> 22:43.880
That where they really kind of they let you sort of set a lot of options at install

22:43.880 --> 22:47.960
But then nailed the experience when you do it just right so I'm I'm installing it right now

22:47.960 --> 22:49.800
I have it up right here on this computer

22:49.800 --> 22:55.440
And it's asking if I'd like the compositor if I'd like conky for the for the resources embedded in the desktop

22:55.440 --> 23:01.640
If I'd like a dock and you walk through these kinds of questions about package sets, would you like chrome chromium Firefox?

23:01.760 --> 23:04.640
Hey, I've detected that this thing supports open GL

23:04.640 --> 23:08.440
Would you like me to turn that on some of these things are just killer for new users?

23:08.440 --> 23:10.520
Yeah, I would have never known how to go figure that out

23:10.520 --> 23:13.220
But I used to love that stuff and now Linux distributions

23:13.220 --> 23:17.920
They just they just do it all for you without even asking really but when I install this I was like, you know

23:17.920 --> 23:20.080
Maybe maybe I will try pale moon this time

23:20.080 --> 23:24.680
I will try and I just checked that box instead of Firefox and it was a really fun

23:24.680 --> 23:29.720
experience because it reminded of the way it used to be installed distributions and at the end you end up with something kind of a

23:29.720 --> 23:31.720
little bit unique for you and

23:31.760 --> 23:35.520
It was so fast. So Wes and I were playing with this. You got a chance to try it

23:35.520 --> 23:39.520
I did. Yeah, Wes and I were very impressed by it and I thought for myself

23:39.520 --> 23:46.280
I know immediately where I would use this on a daily basis if they made an arm image for the raspberry

23:46.280 --> 23:48.280
I knew that's what you were

23:49.160 --> 23:51.080
Really would be I mean it makes you

23:51.080 --> 23:54.800
Reconsider like how what you can get out of a machine because like it feels

23:55.480 --> 24:01.280
Pretty modern right and it has a lot of features. It's got the nice dock right on the bottom tons of configurability

24:01.600 --> 24:03.680
Yeah, like this thing right here low resource

24:03.680 --> 24:04.160
Yeah

24:04.160 --> 24:09.920
This thing right here with I have a web browser open in a PDF viewer and it's using 300 megabytes of RAM with the entire

24:09.920 --> 24:14.440
Thing the whole whole thing loaded. That's not bad because it's and it's been sitting there for I don't know a couple hours

24:14.840 --> 24:18.240
So it's not bad and it can scale down below that if you look at some of the screenshots

24:18.240 --> 24:21.720
They've got yeah, and it's one of those. It's one of those desktops that works

24:22.600 --> 24:26.920
Brilliantly, it sounds like if you have multiple monitors, but I've been really impressed a single screen on a laptop, too

24:26.920 --> 24:31.100
So we reached out to the developer of e live thaner to mesas

24:31.100 --> 24:35.320
I think is how you say it. I get that right nicely done thana termesis not easy for me

24:35.320 --> 24:36.500
I had to write it down right here

24:36.500 --> 24:44.000
But I wanted to get it right because this is an individual who is working on this distribution by themselves since 2005

24:44.000 --> 24:51.600
I believe and it really showcases what is I think such a classic story in open source where there is

24:52.280 --> 24:57.880
Really really great software out there that does amazing things, but there's no marketing team

24:57.880 --> 25:02.040
There's nobody that's pushing it in any particular channel and it just goes undiscovered

25:02.520 --> 25:08.840
That's the enlightenment desktop and the enlightenment libraries which are used by people in the industry who know like

25:08.840 --> 25:14.120
You know embedded markets, but outside of that it doesn't have a lot of general user adoption or knowledge

25:14.120 --> 25:21.480
And so something like e live comes along and it showcases this brilliant work, which in itself is also a brilliant work

25:21.560 --> 25:24.960
So I thought maybe I'd share a little bit of the email exchange

25:24.960 --> 25:28.960
he wrote back to us and gave us some inside information about the project and

25:29.680 --> 25:30.920
Than it to mesas writes

25:30.920 --> 25:36.800
It is developed by a single person me and it sometimes receives a bit of help from volunteers in the past

25:36.800 --> 25:40.080
I was able to pay someone, you know a little extra for some development help

25:40.080 --> 25:43.960
But at the moment I'm alone and donations are not enough to pay anyone extra help

25:43.960 --> 25:46.120
and it's the reasons why donations are so

25:46.320 --> 25:51.720
Crucial for the survival of the project and you'll notice that when you go to the download page is it's almost like an elementary OS

25:51.720 --> 25:57.520
Style approach that really asks you to download they have some free options or maybe wait a little while to get the ISO if you

25:57.520 --> 26:01.080
Don't can't donate. Yeah, that's one. That's an interesting approach is

26:01.080 --> 26:06.860
Donate to get the ISO now or give us your email and you'll get an link in an hour and on the beta side

26:07.000 --> 26:11.260
32 bits are free, but the 64 bits version is a donation

26:11.920 --> 26:16.120
But I think this is actually better right then the more insidious ways

26:16.120 --> 26:23.120
The distributions could try to make money with tracking built-in advertising god forbid some sort of cockamamie crypto scheme

26:23.680 --> 26:26.560
This I think is a more direct user supported approach

26:26.560 --> 26:34.320
But I think he's gotten a lot of pushback on this and people don't really seem to care a lot when you look at the numbers

26:34.320 --> 26:39.120
Of donations that he's getting it's really kind of too bad because I think this is close to his full-time job

26:39.120 --> 26:41.520
It's just trying to keep this thing going. It takes quite a bit of work

26:41.840 --> 26:47.520
It's hard to position a specific role for you life to since it it aims to be better every single release. He writes

26:48.080 --> 26:54.880
This of course doesn't mean that it is the distro to pick for use for maybe developing no JS or to use to deploy

26:54.880 --> 26:59.160
Kubernetes, but since it's based on Debian with good customization and compatibility

26:59.160 --> 27:04.920
You can still use it for any purpose or transform it in to other things. Yeah, and I think that's true

27:04.920 --> 27:08.700
There's actually a Linux insider review just recently in May to quote them

27:09.000 --> 27:12.480
Elive is one of the most multi-purpose and different Linux distributions

27:12.480 --> 27:16.760
You are likely to encounter and it does seem you know, there's all kinds of interesting things out there

27:16.760 --> 27:22.480
He mentioned specifically the very powerful customizations to the terminal, which I've not had a chance to try yet

27:22.480 --> 27:27.600
But definitely piqued my interest if you type el underscore and press tab

27:27.600 --> 27:32.000
You'll see a ton of functions that can turn your shell into a powerful framework for development

27:32.000 --> 27:35.200
And I think he uses that to actually develop the operating system itself

27:35.200 --> 27:40.080
And also neat of him is customized right out of the box to be a full IDE suite

27:41.200 --> 27:47.520
As it should be and then like like I was saying sort of more in the era of classic distributions

27:47.520 --> 27:51.640
But in a good way when you're doing the installation towards the end you get asked

27:51.640 --> 27:53.920
You want to install extra drivers and stuff, you know?

27:53.920 --> 27:55.920
You're kind of familiar with some of these some districts still ask you that stuff

27:56.400 --> 27:58.800
And when specific hardware is detected check this out

27:58.920 --> 28:02.520
It will automatically configure the font sizes based on your screen

28:02.920 --> 28:10.320
resolution a dynamic installer of the distro that optimizes for lightness and low-end computers oral enable extra features if it detects the other more

28:10.320 --> 28:17.160
powerful computer and its own persistent system that saves different desktop settings per each different computer detected and

28:17.160 --> 28:21.960
And there's some default customizations for apps and ad blockers

28:22.320 --> 28:27.040
included by default in the browser with tools to automatically fix things like

28:27.480 --> 28:30.680
running out of space and watching for that a possible stuck process and

28:30.960 --> 28:34.600
Detectors for hard disk errors and strong shakings of the computer

28:34.600 --> 28:39.700
There's a good multimedia support optimized video playback based on your graphics card as well

28:39.760 --> 28:43.840
He says I'm sure there's more stuff, but that's some of the highlights. That's a lot of stuff

28:43.840 --> 28:45.600
At

28:45.600 --> 28:49.920
The moment we have the stable and beta versions. They're really different in many senses

28:49.920 --> 28:56.360
For example, the stable version is very old but offers the best user experience intuitiveness beautiful and features

28:56.920 --> 29:00.960
Included in the enlightenment 17 desktop. Yeah, that's where it got a little confusing for me

29:00.960 --> 29:07.240
Is the stable version actually has enlightenment 17 and the beta version I guess trying to work on all the underpinnings that's using

29:07.320 --> 29:09.320
enlightenment 16 for now. Yeah

29:09.320 --> 29:14.040
Enlightenment 16 is loved by many people and deserves a good try for those who've never tried it before

29:14.520 --> 29:16.720
You could see there's so much pride in this work

29:17.120 --> 29:22.200
Absolutely a little bit of defenseness about the donations which seems to be very common in open source projects

29:22.200 --> 29:26.680
but the end result is something that's brilliant and beautiful to use and feels like a

29:27.160 --> 29:33.000
Desktop that is different and modern and the funny thing is it's been that way for quite a while, right Jill

29:33.040 --> 29:36.920
Yeah, enlightenment was the first kind of eye candy OS

29:36.920 --> 29:40.780
It was the most beautiful desktop ever created at the time

29:40.960 --> 29:42.640
Yeah, like you were saying, you know

29:42.640 --> 29:48.760
it lives in that world between a lighter X window manager like flexbox and window maker and

29:49.400 --> 29:54.920
Xfce so it lives in that space between memory wise but it's so

29:55.480 --> 30:00.720
Fast and beautiful even though it's not one of the heavier desktop environments

30:00.720 --> 30:04.280
I mean if you've been running genome and you can't stand that there's JavaScript involved at all

30:04.280 --> 30:07.660
Yeah, go for your binary themes and I remember talking about

30:08.200 --> 30:15.040
Enlightenment back during Linux action show and I think I had a bias set in and I'm gonna admit it right here

30:15.040 --> 30:16.840
it was simply I

30:16.840 --> 30:20.400
Figured by now that stuff would have broken like it was really good with the software

30:20.600 --> 30:25.160
Compositor and the monitor support back when I was doing Linux action show with Brian

30:25.160 --> 30:28.000
Like that's the last time I probably really looked at it. Seriously, and I thought to myself

30:28.560 --> 30:32.680
Well, I'm sure it's just bit rot over time and that stuff still can't be good turns out

30:32.680 --> 30:36.160
Like they kept with it. That's kind of the amazing thing is I mean

30:36.800 --> 30:42.440
Not many other communities. Would you see this sort of its own little ecosystem that can just continue to flourish?

30:42.440 --> 30:46.880
I mean doesn't matter if any anyone's talking about it on podcasts or folks know about it

30:46.880 --> 30:51.440
If it has a dedicated set of users who care about it and get great use out of it. That's enough

30:51.560 --> 30:52.080
Yeah

30:52.080 --> 30:57.240
You got users like mini Mac and Jill who become advocates for because they know it's like there's this really great thing over here

30:57.240 --> 31:03.200
That happened so often open source when you got to think too that they also offer for free the 32-bit version

31:03.440 --> 31:07.560
Which if you have an older machine, you know an old netbook or something like that

31:07.560 --> 31:11.700
This would be perfect for it as well. Whereas a lot of distros are dropping that 32-bit support

31:11.700 --> 31:16.200
So it made me want to fire up man Jaro on a pi 4 like a minimal man

31:16.200 --> 31:19.040
Jaro install and then just build my way up to enlightenment

31:19.120 --> 31:24.740
but I know I wouldn't be able to create an experience as good as I witnessed with e live because

31:24.740 --> 31:29.700
Thanatomysus has been working at that for very long time and

31:30.300 --> 31:33.680
Really knows how to work the back-end configuration of enlightenment

31:34.100 --> 31:38.180
but I really want it on a Raspberry Pi because it is in that sweet spot of

31:38.580 --> 31:41.860
like Jill was saying of sort of where XFCE is

31:42.980 --> 31:46.940
Including sort of a slower release cadence, but it's a slow but steady improvement cycle

31:47.300 --> 31:49.800
Do you end up using predominantly GTK?

31:50.300 --> 31:53.540
Applications you mix it mix it all up. Is there is there one?

31:53.540 --> 31:59.620
Desktop tool get like cute apps or GTK apps that work better or look better under enlightenment

31:59.620 --> 32:05.580
I've had it installed alongside Gnome and KDE as well and haven't really noticed a difference

32:05.580 --> 32:08.700
I mean I run Kdenlive in it without any issues

32:09.300 --> 32:11.060
Theming's not weird or anything?

32:11.060 --> 32:11.580
No

32:11.580 --> 32:12.100
No

32:12.100 --> 32:16.740
The only thing that happens is when you boot into it like I have it installed on Ubuntu

32:16.740 --> 32:21.620
Mate too and when you you boot into it, you know all your icons from Gnome come in

32:21.620 --> 32:23.620
but other than that

32:24.020 --> 32:29.560
No, it, you know kind of exists on its own same experience for you essentially MiniMac

32:29.560 --> 32:35.100
I on my laptops normally I use Gnome. So I'm pretty used to the GTK environment

32:35.740 --> 32:41.900
a cool thing about at least the latest versions of enlightenment is that you don't have a problem with a

32:42.220 --> 32:47.720
Double title bar. So enlightenment can very good adopt right now to the new inline

32:47.720 --> 32:54.040
Decorations of the GTK applications fancy you don't face a problem that some QT users

32:54.360 --> 33:00.080
complain that you have to title boys and then you have to work through the problems to

33:00.840 --> 33:04.720
Eliminate one of them. We're all a bunch of filthy multiple desktop users

33:06.880 --> 33:08.180
So ridiculous

33:08.180 --> 33:08.680
well

33:08.680 --> 33:14.540
Thank you to the Thanatomysus for taking the time to respond to my questions and if this is all piqued your interest go check out

33:14.540 --> 33:19.260
Elive, elivecd.org and if you like what he's doing there kick him a few bucks

33:19.260 --> 33:23.500
I think it's a great example of an open source project showcasing other great open source work

33:23.500 --> 33:28.700
And it really is on the users to make that thing possible. Exactly. So that's pretty great

33:28.700 --> 33:33.220
All right, Wes. What do you say we do a little housekeeping housekeeping? All right, bring it in bring it in. Oh

33:35.540 --> 33:36.620
Yes

33:36.620 --> 33:39.780
You heard us mention that we're live. You heard us mention the lup lug

33:39.780 --> 33:44.620
Let's just kind of explain what those are because we're just tossing them around like maniacs

33:44.900 --> 33:48.060
We are live on Tuesdays mentioned that earlier noon Pacific

33:48.060 --> 33:53.380
but you can get it converted at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar you go to jblive.tv to watch it and

33:54.340 --> 33:56.300
That's the that's the gist of it. Although

33:57.140 --> 33:59.140
More and more people are really figuring it out

33:59.140 --> 34:02.460
We have a quiet listening section in our mumble room

34:02.460 --> 34:07.700
Which is pretty good audio quality and like the lowest latency you're gonna get it's like you're sitting right here in the studio with us

34:07.700 --> 34:12.220
It's true. So that's another way you can tune in live and it's low bandwidth as well. So that's nice

34:12.220 --> 34:13.580
There's so many ways

34:13.580 --> 34:14.900
But we just love to have you here

34:14.900 --> 34:20.640
We have a great chat room going to a bunch of people in there IRC that geek shed net pound at Jupiter broadcasting. Okay

34:21.140 --> 34:27.620
That's the live stream. Now. Let's talk about that lup lug lup lug that's happening on Sundays same bat time

34:27.620 --> 34:32.580
We do this show on Tuesday. So noon Pacific in the same mumble room just up in the lobby

34:32.980 --> 34:34.980
We get together we hang out for a few hours

34:34.980 --> 34:40.540
We get Chris to try enlightenment and it's it's a rather good time. We really enjoy it

34:40.540 --> 34:43.460
So we'd love to have you join us. It's just a way for people to hang out and actually

34:44.260 --> 34:48.740
Chat with other Linux users can be refreshing if you don't get an opportunity to do that very much

34:49.000 --> 34:54.300
So that's the lup lug and you just got to get in that mumble room to join us and there is an IRC room as well

34:54.300 --> 34:57.920
We can get details IRC that geek shed net and that is pound

34:58.540 --> 35:02.580
Love lug, it's just nice to have a casual chat, you know, it's no pressure

35:02.580 --> 35:07.220
It's not live or anything, but you'll be surrounded by people who also want to talk about Linux. That's right

35:07.220 --> 35:13.760
That's right. And then Drew's here with the news on the infinite escape room for Linux. What's this? What is this?

35:14.100 --> 35:14.940
What is this?

35:14.940 --> 35:16.940
This is a podcast that

35:17.060 --> 35:24.020
Reached out to us on Twitter and they asked for some help getting up and running with Reaper on Linux for their editing

35:24.620 --> 35:29.940
So I talked with them a little bit over Twitter DMS and got them up and running with you know

35:29.940 --> 35:32.500
some Lin VST and some wine and

35:33.220 --> 35:41.140
Really just getting them where they needed to be to do their audio editing on Linux and it sounds like they're there

35:41.140 --> 35:46.580
They've got it running and everything is good. So I just wanted to give them a shout out and say hey

35:46.580 --> 35:48.580
Congrats guys for moving to Linux

35:48.700 --> 35:54.360
That's amazing. Super cool. I did see that Twitter thread go by and that's super cool that you helped them and I

35:54.360 --> 35:59.520
I presume since it's you they were speaking to they're now using Reaper. That is correct. Yes

36:00.160 --> 36:02.720
That is our recording tool of choice for the Linux platform

36:02.720 --> 36:03.760
I mean big props though

36:03.760 --> 36:05.720
It's not easy to go, you know

36:05.720 --> 36:11.000
Especially when you're focused on the content to go change up all the tooling that you're using and I know from experience they get into

36:11.000 --> 36:14.480
Working on Linux while it works. Great can be a bit of an adventure

36:14.480 --> 36:21.040
So especially if a few of your favorite plugins are Windows based plugin, right now we have a bit of it's a change

36:21.040 --> 36:26.700
But not really one that will really affect the show very much, but I'm excited to announce that mr

36:26.700 --> 36:30.240
Wes Payne ladies and gentlemen has a new day gig

36:30.840 --> 36:32.760
West congratulations

36:32.760 --> 36:35.640
But not much is changing for the show really is it no not at all

36:35.640 --> 36:38.280
I'm going back to the world of software development full-time

36:38.280 --> 36:40.920
So I'll be leaving a cloud guru as an employee

36:41.080 --> 36:45.160
But I'm certainly not leaving the Jupiter broadcasting community and definitely not the show now

36:45.160 --> 36:48.040
I'm really glad that you were able to continue staying here for the show because

36:48.040 --> 36:55.360
Since episode 100 it's kind of become a thing with I know I can't quit it. No, you can't I noticed you got these shackles installed

36:56.520 --> 36:59.920
Yeah, if you just sit right there forever just so I can make sure you won't go anywhere

36:59.920 --> 37:04.640
No, no, no, it's we we've chatted about it. I think it's gonna work out pretty good. I'm very happy for you

37:04.640 --> 37:07.240
I'm glad you're able to get a new gig that's back in the software development field

37:07.240 --> 37:09.240
And I think you're gonna enjoy it quite a bit

37:09.280 --> 37:13.160
but it does bring up a rather particular challenge and

37:13.560 --> 37:16.640
That is you got to give back that laptop

37:16.640 --> 37:19.720
So let's talk about that, but that right there. We'll leave that for the housekeeping

37:20.440 --> 37:22.320
That's officially the housekeeping this week

37:22.320 --> 37:26.400
but let's talk about what we're gonna do about this think pad because that is a work machine and

37:27.080 --> 37:30.760
That's got to go back. I miss it already. But wouldn't you know it?

37:30.760 --> 37:33.560
We got something new that just came into the studio this week

37:34.120 --> 37:38.960
So sent in by Dell go ahead and take it out of the box there Wes and tell me tell me what we got there

37:39.720 --> 37:44.680
There you go. Oh, yeah open it up here. Oh, it's very silver. It is very silver

37:44.680 --> 37:51.480
Mm-hmm. This looks like the latest new model of the XPS. Oh, it is indeed Wes. It is the new XPS 13

37:51.480 --> 37:54.660
It's got one finger open kind of sort of

37:55.960 --> 38:01.800
And look at that screen so that's got the new edge to edge screen and the edge to edge keyboard

38:01.800 --> 38:07.460
So it's just nothing but laptop and the new fingerprint reader up in the top corner

38:07.700 --> 38:12.960
Which looks really nice same carbon fiber feel to it, but even more metal now

38:12.960 --> 38:17.280
I mean, they've got these fancy chamfered edges. Yeah, isn't that looking super? Wow. Yeah

38:17.280 --> 38:20.400
It looks like a really high-end product now with those shiny edges

38:20.400 --> 38:21.320
So Wes Payne

38:21.320 --> 38:26.440
What good timing for you to review a new laptop and tell us what it's like to set it up for a software development job

38:26.440 --> 38:31.680
And maybe a little casual gaming. What do you say? I think that sounds like a challenge. I'm ready to take on there

38:31.680 --> 38:37.760
You have it. So we'll either have it next week or shortly thereafter the West Payne take on the new XPS

38:37.760 --> 38:42.600
13 so that should be really cool coming with me buddy getting used and abused Wow

38:42.600 --> 38:45.920
Look how much put that next to the ThinkPad there. Look how much thinner that is

38:46.480 --> 38:51.840
Holy smokes that XPS is almost just the size of the top of the ThinkPad

38:51.840 --> 38:56.200
It's that's wild and it's like 75% in the just in the area of the thing

38:56.200 --> 39:02.760
So the ThinkPad is a 14 inch. Yeah, so it's a slightly slightly bigger screen, but no question about it

39:02.760 --> 39:08.160
Just even from across the table here. I can tell you that XPS 13 screen is way better. Hey better

39:08.200 --> 39:12.420
Yeah, we'll find out about onboard sound and things like that. You know, that'll be in the testing

39:12.420 --> 39:15.760
Yeah, I'll be curious on the whole West Payne tank take because that's got the 10th gen

39:16.560 --> 39:24.100
Intel processor which people are claiming has a decent as far as decent in integrated graphics goes has decent performance

39:24.400 --> 39:30.260
You've been playing on the ThinkPad with seventh generation, right? Is that what it is? Yeah, so this should be a big GPU

39:30.260 --> 39:34.520
I'm excited to give it a try. Mm-hmm curious to know how all the setup goes for the new gig and all that

39:34.520 --> 39:38.000
Of course, eventually we'll have to send it back, but we'll wipe it. We'll wipe it

39:38.320 --> 39:41.080
Just a great opportunity to do really give that. Yeah

39:41.080 --> 39:45.520
I mean I keep watching these things evolve and of course I had XPS way back when yep

39:45.520 --> 39:47.360
So I know it's been a good line

39:47.360 --> 39:50.600
I'm seeing you know what it work is my day today. Was it the first model XPS?

39:50.600 --> 39:54.920
It was yeah the first model says this is gonna be really interesting to get your take on this one stuff

39:54.920 --> 39:57.760
Cool, so we'll have that in a future show, but now

39:57.760 --> 40:03.520
What do you say? We talk a little pop OS 2004. Oh, it's beyond time for that now

40:03.520 --> 40:07.160
I was a little spoiled because I got to play with it on the new lemur pro

40:07.160 --> 40:11.480
So I really got to see it in its prime when it's on system 76 hardware

40:11.840 --> 40:14.140
But I think that's worth talking about for a moment

40:14.140 --> 40:17.880
So there's a couple of standout features that I think you guys will probably also echo

40:17.880 --> 40:23.340
But I'd like to just give a little attention to here off the top and that is the new pop shell tiling tool

40:23.340 --> 40:29.100
you heard us talk about it we were the first to interview system 76 and get information out there about it and

40:30.180 --> 40:35.780
Turns out it's totally rad. It's rad and how it's been created to they're using typescript to write this thing

40:35.780 --> 40:40.400
Which means in theory, I think a lot tighter safer JavaScript on the end. Yeah, right

40:40.400 --> 40:42.640
I mean in a nice first-class development experience

40:43.020 --> 40:49.000
Absolutely, and that feature alone is implemented in a really slick way that just makes it worth trying out

40:49.000 --> 40:55.200
even if you just get a the latest version of gnome shell and install this extension, it's it's really neat because it's

40:55.720 --> 41:02.000
Integrated in the top menu. Yeah, click that little sucker and then there's just one button toggle on one button toggle off

41:02.000 --> 41:06.440
Yeah, just says tile windows. And there you go that one simple obvious

41:07.400 --> 41:11.200
Fantastic feature is what makes this a totally actual

41:11.840 --> 41:17.220
Usable feature for me that I will really use because there's certain workflows where I want free-floating windows

41:17.220 --> 41:21.800
And I want control over everything where it's positioned and there's other times where it's just a keyboard day

41:21.800 --> 41:25.160
My hands not coming off the keyboard go ahead and tile it for me. So I've got it right here

41:25.160 --> 41:30.040
I've been using it while we're doing the show and I was using a note-taking application that had a little sub menu that just was

41:30.040 --> 41:35.660
Not playing nicely with tiling super simple to go pop that off get my work done when I'm done with that app pop tiling back

41:35.660 --> 41:40.800
On and I'm set up in show mode that feature alone is worth trying even if you're familiar with tiling window managers and whatnot

41:40.800 --> 41:45.100
It's just fun to see how they implemented that and I think they're gonna just add more to it

41:45.100 --> 41:51.320
It's got absolutely plus you can configure the spacing around the windows and especially with some of the just as a contrast to some

41:51.320 --> 41:56.160
Of the more, you know low-level tiling window managers where you're customizing it in Lua or you know

41:56.160 --> 42:00.880
Something that takes a lot more learning. This is just an easy mouse click away to configure about how you like

42:00.880 --> 42:02.160
Yeah, and you're still a num shell too

42:02.160 --> 42:07.640
So there's that's a lot more appealing to a lot of people other things in there are really nice to have

42:07.640 --> 42:14.800
I feel like 2004 Ubuntu 2004 is just a really great release, but there's still some differentiation there with pop pop shop

42:14.800 --> 42:16.800
I think stands out as

42:16.880 --> 42:22.200
What seems to be maybe another round of thought and pass that went into the default selection of apps?

42:22.960 --> 42:24.960
When I open up pop shop

42:25.080 --> 42:28.160
Literally, probably three out of the five top apps

42:28.160 --> 42:31.360
I have to install immediately to make this a work machine are right there

42:31.360 --> 42:34.840
And then after I have those installed what it replaces them with completes the picture

42:35.200 --> 42:39.600
it's pretty rare and it includes proprietary stuff and open source stuff and

42:39.600 --> 42:44.880
They've really gone all-in on flat packs, but the way it's implemented the user never really has to be concerned with it

42:44.880 --> 42:46.520
You know, honestly so far, you know

42:46.520 --> 42:52.380
We've just been doing just stock 24 and fedora like the pump shop. It's been the best experience by far

42:52.440 --> 42:58.840
No, it doesn't feel slow. There's no random sluggishness things queue up in a very natural way and all the software

42:58.840 --> 43:00.240
You want is right there

43:00.240 --> 43:02.960
Normally I give up and just use that back on the command line

43:02.960 --> 43:07.120
But I didn't have to and just flat hub being installed by default is a nice touch

43:07.120 --> 43:10.480
It makes it a little bit quicker to get running the other thing

43:10.480 --> 43:15.880
I really appreciate that I implement on every desktop environment today except for plasma and gnome

43:15.880 --> 43:21.720
now is they included a pretty great launcher super key plus forward slash and

43:22.360 --> 43:27.720
It launches a quick responsive launcher that is definitely faster than stuff built into gnome

43:27.720 --> 43:30.280
I think I'm probably just gonna stick with gnome at this point

43:30.280 --> 43:33.400
I've built that muscle memory, but that's the kind of little stuff

43:33.400 --> 43:38.680
They're adding that I think really shows you system 76 is thinking a little bit deeper about a particular niche

43:38.920 --> 43:43.720
Jack Wallen has a take that will link in the show notes and in there he writes system 76

43:44.560 --> 43:48.520
Understands that their target audience wants to keep their fingers and hands at the keyboard

43:48.680 --> 43:53.600
Why it's more efficient instead of shifting from the keyboard to the mouse and back again

43:53.600 --> 43:58.000
Things go much more smoothly when you can keep those digits pounding and he's right

43:58.000 --> 44:00.480
You're seeing features like the tiling like the launcher

44:00.480 --> 44:04.520
Not everyone likes that but they're kind of being bold here in a way

44:04.520 --> 44:12.240
They're going particularly add a certain demo of users in an aggressive way that I like to see and I think adds genuine

44:12.720 --> 44:14.720
differentiation between stock Ubuntu and

44:16.160 --> 44:19.560
Long-term I think could potentially be great for main

44:19.920 --> 44:23.760
Ubuntu mainline Ubuntu because they could Sherlock the crap out of this stuff

44:23.760 --> 44:29.520
They can sit here and watch system 76 essentially market test this stuff in a particular niche

44:29.520 --> 44:32.880
That's tolerant to these types of tests and watch what does well

44:32.880 --> 44:38.600
And then just nab that feature and roll it into mainline Ubuntu that's called Sherlocking

44:38.600 --> 44:45.000
Which is a term that's been coined because Apple does that with Mac OS and iOS they watch what independent developers create

44:45.000 --> 44:50.200
They take the most successful ideas and then they just incorporate into their own OS and they make it part of the platform

44:50.760 --> 44:56.600
Canonical has that opportunity here with the innovations that are happening in pop and pop shell etc

44:56.600 --> 45:00.440
They can watch that and say, you know what things like game remote. Maybe we should ship that by default

45:00.440 --> 45:05.240
Yeah, very true. I've also just been impressed with how accessible it is for tiling in general

45:05.240 --> 45:10.440
It doesn't feel like some obscure super user type thing. It's just another way to interface with your desktop

45:10.440 --> 45:14.880
That's a really good way to put it. It doesn't feel like you're all of a sudden becoming an elite hacker. Exactly cheesy

45:14.880 --> 45:18.360
I know you've spent a lot of time with pop. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the 2004 release

45:18.360 --> 45:20.520
I spent a considerable amount of time with it

45:20.920 --> 45:25.960
Been living with it on the ThinkPad now for a couple of weeks to two and a half weeks something like that

45:25.960 --> 45:32.680
Also living with it on the Thalia that I was gifted from system 76. So that upgrade process was painless

45:33.280 --> 45:37.680
Tiling extension the pop shell is great. And I think it's a great

45:38.400 --> 45:43.740
Entry level for someone who doesn't know if they want a tiling window manager doesn't want to necessarily go full i3

45:44.000 --> 45:48.320
Maybe just wants to experience it first all the keyboard shortcuts are sane

45:48.320 --> 45:55.760
And there's nothing just super crazy in the keyboard shortcuts. The terminal is added to your favorites by default. Thank you

45:55.760 --> 45:58.800
Nice, the dot matrix wallpaper is super cool

45:58.800 --> 46:04.400
I love it one of the cool things that I really like about pop and it makes sense to me

46:05.000 --> 46:10.480
Because of the market that they're delivering these machines to is that it's an opt-in

46:11.120 --> 46:14.000
Kind of disk encryption on the installer

46:14.000 --> 46:17.920
You can opt out of it by hitting a checkbox, but by default

46:18.720 --> 46:22.700
Disk encryption is turned on. This is where you need to be people

46:22.700 --> 46:26.760
you need to be encrypting your your drives and obviously if they're selling to

46:27.440 --> 46:31.640
People that are developing equipment for space or whatever that you know

46:31.640 --> 46:37.560
You would want to have that disk encrypted in case that machine was ever lost for some reason a couple things

46:37.560 --> 46:42.220
It didn't really care about and you know, it's just personal preference sort of thing

46:42.220 --> 46:46.860
It doesn't default to detailed view. It's still icon view in

46:47.300 --> 46:52.500
Gnome files. Oh, I hate that. That's where it always goes first right whenever I open up gnome files

46:53.260 --> 47:00.740
There are still a few issues, you know with pop shell and I expected it to be that way if you're resizing windows splitting windows

47:01.060 --> 47:06.340
And those sorts of things you'll run into issues where certain applications don't tile properly

47:06.340 --> 47:11.900
So you'll kind of have to you know mess around with it a little bit to find that happy medium for you

47:12.660 --> 47:18.660
Obviously if you've got a large 4k screen, it does help out with the screen real estate. So you're not crunching down

47:19.300 --> 47:23.740
Gnome files to a you know, super small tile and the you know

47:23.740 --> 47:28.540
Making it basically impossible to navigate through files, but overall it's it's really a solid

47:29.860 --> 47:32.820
Distribution it makes sense that they would

47:33.380 --> 47:35.380
Do what they've done with pop shell

47:35.380 --> 47:38.580
For the for the audience that they're targeting with their hardware

47:38.580 --> 47:42.060
So I think they've done a great job and it's built on top of 2004

47:42.460 --> 47:45.100
Which as you mentioned has been a rock-solid release

47:45.100 --> 47:51.260
So I've been thrilled with it and it's gonna remain on my Thalia and it's gonna remain on my laptop for quite a while

47:51.260 --> 47:53.860
That's the ultimate testament is if you stick with it

47:54.100 --> 48:00.260
And I don't I don't know for me because where pop sort of seems to be

48:00.260 --> 48:06.500
Landing in my spectrum of distros is right where I have Manjaro right now. That makes sense

48:06.500 --> 48:09.060
I think pop has a better out-of-box experience

48:09.820 --> 48:11.660
but in

48:11.660 --> 48:17.300
Three months. I know I'll be happier on Manjaro just because all the little things hooked on rolling and

48:17.780 --> 48:22.860
You know with with an AUR wrapper. You can really just install anything under the Sun. I I

48:23.380 --> 48:26.300
Was spending 10 minutes like a dope over the weekend

48:26.300 --> 48:33.580
Googling for a Cups PPD file for my brother laser printer when it dawned on me that of course

48:33.580 --> 48:35.100
It's in the AUR

48:35.100 --> 48:40.580
Everything's in the AUR and I just installed it and I was ready to go and I got right to printing which was like the first

48:40.580 --> 48:42.540
Time I'd print it in two years. I think you animal

48:42.540 --> 48:46.340
Well, it should be said too that on the other drive in the ThinkPad there is Manjaro

48:47.740 --> 48:51.540
You know, it's like West always says it's not the distro. It's how you use it. I

48:52.420 --> 48:55.060
Do think you're right about the pop out-of-box experience

48:55.060 --> 48:58.940
I was especially impressed with the installation. It just felt super friendly streamlined

48:58.940 --> 49:03.940
Honestly, I think it's like my favorite install experience on any OS so far fair point

49:04.180 --> 49:09.940
It has the best installer the best art. It looks the best it has the most consistent look and feel

49:10.340 --> 49:16.740
You can really tell that they have talented people on their team and they're pointing some of them at this thing and saying or them

49:16.740 --> 49:23.700
And saying make it consistent make it a product and it feels like it much like fedora does

49:23.700 --> 49:26.340
I just in a different kind of branded way, right?

49:26.340 --> 49:30.780
I think we were a little skeptical at first pop was announced like what where's the value add white?

49:30.780 --> 49:35.000
But it's exactly that sort of focusing on it as a product combined with some of their hardware

49:35.700 --> 49:41.040
Yeah, it's there and then lastly I'll just add with the the lemur Pro the most direct experience

49:41.040 --> 49:46.920
I had being benefit that it was a pop OS install on system 76 hardware with the lemur was

49:47.460 --> 49:49.460
The firmware update they needed to issue

49:49.460 --> 49:54.340
Early into the review cycle of the machine that changed the fan curve

49:54.980 --> 49:59.980
That was a very cohesive experience. It felt top-grade

49:59.980 --> 50:05.740
I mean it felt just as good as anything you would experience from any vendor that has been doing this for 15 years already

50:06.260 --> 50:11.380
During the flashing process that came up with a graphical system 76 screen with a console output

50:11.380 --> 50:16.700
It wasn't just like some UEFI output on this on the command line. We had

50:17.260 --> 50:18.940
Jeremy on last week

50:18.940 --> 50:22.620
talking about the the lemur and we kind of briefly

50:23.060 --> 50:28.000
Touched on the the keyboard and a lot of these keyboard shortcuts for pop shell

50:28.740 --> 50:32.220
Kind of play into this new keyboard that they're manufacturing as well

50:32.220 --> 50:34.420
So I'll be interested to see you know

50:34.420 --> 50:35.220
how that all

50:35.220 --> 50:40.000
Turns out and I'm sure I'll be the proud owner of one of those keyboards whenever they do start to ship too

50:40.000 --> 50:42.940
So I think if you you know, if it works for you, it's a great one

50:42.940 --> 50:45.700
I think for me, I'll probably stick on Manjaro

50:45.700 --> 50:51.740
But keep a close eye on what pops doing to now. I really have like just have all the choices

50:51.740 --> 50:55.900
So I'm doing good. We got a feedback in you want to switch to feedback West. It's

50:56.940 --> 51:01.660
It's apropos as they say indeed says hello guys. I was just listening to episode

51:02.420 --> 51:09.140
343 what Linux is best at the pop OS tiling window manager extension chapter made me wonder if you'd come across to paper

51:09.140 --> 51:15.740
WM or paper whim it's a gnome extension that provides a decent tiling window manager experience

51:15.740 --> 51:17.940
I've been using it daily for a few weeks

51:17.940 --> 51:23.980
It works well on pretty much stock Ubuntu 1910 installation in my case and looks like it's under heavy development

51:24.820 --> 51:31.260
Richard also wrote in on gnome and tiling says I just wanted to say that I was listening to the one-click trap episode and you

51:31.260 --> 51:35.140
Mentioned a tiling window manager for gnome shell. I think we've been talking about this

51:35.140 --> 51:42.700
I'm getting the sense. So this is a topic system 76 isn't the only one out there and some of them are really polished such as

51:43.180 --> 51:45.180
paper WM and

51:45.380 --> 51:52.100
Mosaic a new contender enters the ring West mosaic. You should check them out and review the gnome shell extensions

51:52.180 --> 51:56.500
You know when we got these feedback actually did go and install paper WM because why not, you know

51:56.500 --> 52:01.420
You just go clone their repository run the install script and it'll install for you. And yeah, it looks pretty nice

52:01.420 --> 52:07.900
Maybe a little less user friendly than than the pop shell is but if you want perhaps a little more full featured tiling

52:07.900 --> 52:09.180
Definitely worth a try. Ah

52:09.180 --> 52:13.660
So if you are even hardcore on the tiling side of things, but don't want to step away from you know

52:13.700 --> 52:18.400
That's a weird use case. Who is that user? Yeah, I took it. These people are

52:19.000 --> 52:23.380
Richard and Chris are so then we have gammas dot file tool

52:23.380 --> 52:26.300
Which I thought would be a cool one to kind of cap us off today. You ready for this one?

52:26.300 --> 52:32.700
Yeah, if you're like me and use git for version control and sharing your dots you probably have a few things you want to keep

52:32.700 --> 52:37.220
Private nearly everyone has an SSH config and a lot of people here need their mumble.com

52:37.860 --> 52:39.860
Great point. Oh boy

52:40.460 --> 52:42.460
We just always delete it but that's not the right

52:43.140 --> 52:47.700
It's not which is one of the reasons it has your private cert in there

52:47.700 --> 52:52.220
Which was what all of the permissions for mumble once you've been verified and like voice or you know

52:52.220 --> 52:56.860
A mic check and all of that your certificate says you're good and then when you delete that config you lose that

52:57.220 --> 53:02.020
He uses get crypt it uses gets filter attribute to encrypt

53:02.420 --> 53:09.140
Transparently so you can host all of your dot files in one public repo without worrying about people stealing your sensitive data

53:09.140 --> 53:13.300
if someone checks out the repo the encrypted files are simply checked out and

53:13.740 --> 53:19.800
Encrypted unless they have the key and the git crypt unlock and then git crypt unlock the repo

53:19.800 --> 53:23.120
Do you have you looked at this? No, you know, I've seen it floating around there

53:23.120 --> 53:27.320
But I've never actually used it in any of my workflows and it does seem like a nice way to do it

53:27.320 --> 53:32.120
You know if you don't have ways to separate that stuff fully out there or you have to compose them together when you you know

53:32.120 --> 53:35.040
Reinstall stuff just leave it right there and then get handle it

53:35.040 --> 53:39.880
I wonder if I was going to use get say to back up my configs and my dot files

53:39.880 --> 53:45.200
I think that might be where I drew the line and just did a little self hosted git lab and

53:45.200 --> 53:51.240
And I suppose I'd still care about security, but I just don't know if I want to put that stuff on a public

53:51.360 --> 53:57.760
Yeah, I suppose it depends on the line two of which configs do you need secrets in and which do you really feel value and sharing?

53:57.760 --> 53:58.600
You know if you've got a lot of

53:58.600 --> 54:02.400
Customizations or nice hacks to your VM RC that you want to share with folks out there

54:02.600 --> 54:06.440
Versus something maybe like mumble comp where it really is just one of your personal details

54:06.440 --> 54:09.440
I think if I was doing a general dot file backup like that

54:09.440 --> 54:14.240
I would be concerned that eventually something would end up in there sort of like we started the show with that

54:14.240 --> 54:21.680
Installer error that wrote by mistake the encryption password in plain text like you just sometimes it's easy to have happened to even experienced users

54:21.680 --> 54:25.680
You don't know what's going in there like sometimes applications. Just put something dumb in there

54:25.680 --> 54:27.000
I think I'd want it encrypted, too

54:27.000 --> 54:30.480
So I think this is a great a great tip by a gamma so gamma

54:30.480 --> 54:31.800
Thank you for saying that along and again

54:31.800 --> 54:36.200
It's git crypt this seems like another opportunity for folks to give some feedback to us to you know

54:36.320 --> 54:40.200
This is a common problem if you're not using git crypt. What are you using? Yeah?

54:40.200 --> 54:45.840
How are you doing this and is it necessary to use git for this or would our sync?

54:45.840 --> 54:49.580
Just do the job and to like say a sync thing directory is that crazy

54:50.240 --> 54:52.240
That just seems like maybe a simpler approach

54:52.960 --> 54:57.740
Yeah, I mean, I think there's a forget users folks who already work with git every day

54:57.740 --> 55:00.100
There is sort of a you know when you have this hammer

55:00.100 --> 55:05.400
Then probably what you just said is it because I probably use our sync more than I use git right and git has you know

55:05.400 --> 55:08.640
Versioning baked into it right yeah, that seems like the big advantage

55:08.640 --> 55:13.760
Yeah, for sure interesting Linux unplug calm slash contact for how you do it or anything else

55:13.760 --> 55:20.240
We've talked about recently that you'd like to chime in on including any questions you have for that XPS 13 that vessel

55:20.240 --> 55:24.240
Oh, please do let me know yeah, putting it through the ringer probably another way to let you know is on Twitter

55:24.240 --> 55:29.200
Yeah, that's right at Westpain, and I'm at Chris las you can go check me out over there

55:29.200 --> 55:35.040
Let me know what's up check out my website Chris last calm. That's happening, too. I don't know maybe there's something going on

55:35.040 --> 55:39.920
There you didn't know about I don't know there's only one way to find out. I'm not the boss of you not yet

55:40.320 --> 55:42.200
That's right. That's right

55:42.200 --> 55:48.960
Well congratulations again to you sir. Thank you. I am looking forward to hearing your takes on that XPS 13 as well as more feedback

55:48.960 --> 55:52.800
I love doing that so please get all that sent in we have links to just about every dang thing

55:52.800 --> 55:56.360
We talked about today at Linux unplug calm slash

55:57.040 --> 56:03.880
353 that's this episode and of course I encourage you to subscribe at Linux unplug calm slash subscribe

56:03.880 --> 56:09.800
Where we have a feed for every type of variety and player out there as well as just a straight-up RSS feed

56:09.800 --> 56:34.360
It's new. I think you're really gonna like it check it out Linux unplug calm subscribe. There's only a little bit of XML

56:39.800 --> 56:41.800
I

56:51.680 --> 56:57.160
Thought it was gonna be an Oprah moment there whenever you let Wes unbox the XPS

56:57.160 --> 57:01.920
I thought you're gonna be like, you know, you get a laptop you get a laptop, you know

57:01.920 --> 57:03.480
If I could afford I'd get him a laptop

57:03.480 --> 57:08.480
But now the West's you know, I think the rule goes Jesus whoever has the new gig buys the laptops, right?

57:08.480 --> 57:15.160
I think that is how it works, right? I think he owes us all lunch and around the laptops. So I'll be taking orders
