00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 72 for December 23rd, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,040
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's already tracking Santa's

3
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,040
sleigh.

4
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,600
My name is Chris and we have something kind of special for you this week.

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
It's a little different.

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,080
It's a first for a lot of our shows on the network.

7
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,400
This week we're playing some of the audience's favorite moments as submitted by you.

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,840
So if it's a train wreck, I'm officially transferring all blame to those of you, no I'm kidding.

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,760
No, actually it's gone through some of our favorite moments and to be honest, on the

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,760
Linux Unplugged show, it's just the way it goes you guys.

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
Some of those, they're rants.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,660
A lot of great rants though, at least I happen to think so.

13
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,600
And they inspired a lot of, I think, really good reflection and discussion.

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,040
That's what I think Linux Unplugged oftentimes is all about.

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,620
And so this week we're going to go in and look at some of those moments and other moments

16
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,120
that you submitted into the show.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,100
In fact, it's, there's a lot, it's dense, there's a lot to get into.

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,880
So in fact, so that way I don't have to interrupt, I will be joining you from time to time, moments

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
throughout the show.

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,820
Chris will come in and spend a holiday moment with you.

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,960
But to kind of clear the air, get us ready for it, I think I'm going to thank our first

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,120
sponsor this week.

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,900
You guys know them, you guys love them.

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,580
That's the amazing folks over at Ting.

25
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,600
Go to linux.ting.com.

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,320
That's going to get you not only a $25 discount off your first Ting device, but a little feather

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,360
in your cap for supporting the Linux Unplugged show, linux.ting.com.

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,200
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,400
Ting is my mobile service provider.

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,360
And as I sit here and take a holiday sip from a holiday beverage and reflect on the things

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,160
that I do feel very thankful for, Ting is one of them.

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,380
I'm coming in now on two years of Ting service.

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,440
You can get started by going to linux.ting.com.

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,000
No more contract.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
No more termination fee.

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
No more scams.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,960
No more getting you to pay for data that you may or may not use, or a certain amount of

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,240
text messages you may or may not use.

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,820
Just pay for what you actually end up using.

40
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
That's how Ting works.

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,560
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,360
They add them all up at the end of the month, whatever buckets you fall into, that's all

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
you got to pay.

44
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,620
You want to turn on hotspot, you want to tether that, then just pay for the data.

45
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,540
You don't have to be in some sort of special plan.

46
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,680
And Ting has no hold customer service.

47
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
I don't need it.

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,920
To be honest, I've never had to call them.

49
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,980
I take advantage of their incredible dashboard.

50
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,920
But if I have friends and family, I absolutely let them know, you know what, you can call

51
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,480
Ting and they'll answer your tough questions.

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,080
They hire the Android geeks, give them the ability to solve your problem, give them the

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,080
authority to resolve any kind of account issue, and then they have them answer the phone when

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
it rings.

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
I know.

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
It's a crazy concept.

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Linux.Ting.com.

58
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,840
They have that powerful online control panel where you can take control of your account,

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,720
turn things on and off as you need them.

60
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,380
It's really impressive.

61
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,920
And one of the things you may have heard about is Ting is expanding into GSM next year.

62
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,300
They're going to have CDMA and GSM coverage.

63
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,960
And they posted up a video where they talked to one of their executives about that.

64
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,600
So I'm going to play it for you.

65
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:31,600
Dean asks, I've been happy since my switch to Ting a year ago.

66
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,520
Any chance that Ting will offer GSM service besides CDMA?

67
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:43,120
I'm sure you've seen by now that we are actually offering GSM service in addition to Sprint.

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,800
There are two great things that that gives us.

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:52,560
First, it gives people access to a wider variety of phones that they may already own or get

70
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,520
in the secondary market.

71
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,900
Second, probably a little more specifically, it does now mean that you can go down to the

72
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:09,320
Apple store, buy an unlocked iPhone, new iPhone 6, 6 Plus, grab a SIM from us, pop it in and

73
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,440
use Ting.

74
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,400
And for a lot of people, that's been a real limitation.

75
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,280
You know, I do think it's worth noting that this is and not or.

76
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,000
And we're thrilled to be able to offer multiple networks.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
Linux.ting.com, mobile didn't make sense.

78
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,560
Thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

79
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,240
They're also getting into fiber internet to change up landlines.

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
Love Ting.

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,640
And I think you should go check them out.

82
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Start saving right now.

83
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,800
And they have a special $100 and 50 bones credit if you have to cancel a line that has an early

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,360
termination on it.

85
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,880
No more ETS with Ting, linux.ting.com.

86
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,800
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

87
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,520
Well, SystemD sure came up a lot this year, didn't it?

88
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,600
And there was a lot of different discussions on the Linux Unplugged show, but we figured

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,900
we've got to touch on it once officially to market for 2014.

90
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,920
So this is one of the highest submitted discussions around SystemD.

91
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Enjoy.

92
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,960
Did you guys see the roll up your sleeves, we may need to fork Debian site.

93
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Did you guys catch this?

94
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Oh boy.

95
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,680
And I'll just read the first paragraph here.

96
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,200
We are veteran, which is bolded by the way, veteran Unix admins, and we are concerned

97
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,640
about what's happening to GNU slash Linux Debian edition, and they're considering forking

98
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
the project.

99
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,080
I want to stop right here.

100
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
I think that's a great idea.

101
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,480
I think fork it.

102
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,920
Like instead of delaying the progress of the distribution or the direction, fork it and

103
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
go your own way.

104
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,600
That actually seems like the right approach to take, especially if you're never going

105
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,800
to be satisfied with the SystemD version of Debian.

106
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,520
That seems like a pretty reasonable response, and I hope they do.

107
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,400
I think the competition would be good.

108
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,560
The thing that I can't get past, and it seems like a lot of other people have picked up

109
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,960
on it, is the language used there.

110
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,400
Veteran Unix admins and bolded.

111
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,800
What that does is sort of projects old farts, and I'm not trying to be derogatory, I'm just

112
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,880
saying like from a messaging standpoint, people are saying that makes you sound like a bunch

113
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,240
of old farts, and then people sort of write it off.

114
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
What do they care?

115
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,200
A bunch of stick in the muds.

116
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,880
And it immediately makes people not take it very seriously.

117
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,920
Well looking at it from my perspective, I think it's a combination of quote-unquote

118
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,840
old farts as well as people that are of the mind that if it isn't broke, why fix it, at

119
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
least from their perspective.

120
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,800
And so you might have an inner mixture of individuals in that space.

121
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,960
Wimpy, do you think they're just crazy?

122
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,480
Well they're exercising their right to free speech and all power to their elbow and everything,

123
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,440
and if they want to have a go at forking Debbie in, then I think everyone should just stand

124
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,360
back and let them get on with it and let themselves burn themselves out trying.

125
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
Let's just take those two words together.

126
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,800
Fork Debbie in, okay?

127
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,240
Forking is hard.

128
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,640
I have first-hand experience of forking really small projects in the comparison with Debbie

129
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
in.

130
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,840
So they want to fork Debbie in.

131
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,400
Just think about all of the infrastructure that's involved there and all of the platforms

132
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
and everything.

133
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,880
It's just crazy nonsense.

134
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:31,200
And Ian Jackson's obviously got an opinion about this, and he posted his thing to the

135
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,200
mailing list to suggest that this was evaluated one last time, very expressly stating he didn't

136
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,520
want to turn this into a system D versus whatever in its system debate.

137
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,680
And then the internet explodes with system D inferno again.

138
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,000
This is so disappointing.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,840
It's just laughable.

140
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,160
And if they want to fork Debbie in, yeah, go on, do that thing.

141
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
I'm all for it.

142
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm going to watch that gleefully from afar.

143
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,160
Yeah, I would be pretty skeptical myself.

144
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,960
And Valt, you think, no, no, don't fork.

145
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Don't do that.

146
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,440
We need more resources as it is, not less people working on the same stuff.

147
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,120
Well, that's obviously my actual practical point is, no, don't fork it.

148
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,680
Find a way to accommodate multiple-init systems in Debbie in.

149
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
I'm starting to change now.

150
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,800
But if you want to fork Debbie in, yeah, go on, do it.

151
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,960
But they're never going to be interested in being involved with the project in that state,

152
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,220
then they should just fork it.

153
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,560
You're not really losing resources because if they weren't going to cooperate anyways,

154
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
you're not losing them.

155
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
They're already lost.

156
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
So let them go off and do their own thing.

157
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,000
Well, no, the thing is, is that, no, well, yeah, okay, if they want to fork Debbie in,

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
fork Debbie in.

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,480
But there's system BSD, there's useless D, there are shims around system D. If they were

160
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,480
really serious about coming up with an alternative, they would be looking at those projects in

161
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,720
terms of developing them and supporting them within the Debbie in community rather than

162
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,080
saying we're going to fork Debbie in, which is frankly insane.

163
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:14,800
Well, yeah, you're talking the biggest distribution there is, the mother of most of our distributions.

164
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Yeah.

165
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Yeah.

166
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,920
That's a huge undertaking if you're even thinking about that.

167
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Would you do a complete fork or would it be more like sort of a clone of straight up Debbie

168
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:31,000
in where you're just constantly swapping out the system D parts for something else?

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,920
Well, one thing that comes to mind that I want to point out here is that now, last time

170
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,840
I checked, most computers with blogging platforms attached don't have breathalyzers ready.

171
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:47,240
So it's entirely possible they were fit-shaped and they got on and yeah, Debbie, baby, baby.

172
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,160
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you who's a little S-faced.

173
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
How about this one?

174
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,960
How about this one?

175
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Fork fedora.org.

176
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Shall we fork fedora?

177
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Oh, that's brilliant.

178
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,200
And then here's the next one.

179
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Not really.

180
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,640
It's doing great.

181
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Maybe we're not veteran enough.

182
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
That's great.

183
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
That's really good.

184
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
That is fantastic.

185
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
That's the best response.

186
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,520
They sound like they're really housed.

187
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
You know what?

188
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Yeah.

189
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Yeah.

190
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,520
They're really housed, right?

191
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
I would like to buy a beer for those guys.

192
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
I've already verified this is a factual thing.

193
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Yeah.

194
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
No, Matt did prove that.

195
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,760
He did actually later up on G+.

196
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,560
All of my 10 people on the whole internet, but still we exist.

197
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Yeah.

198
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,120
That actually is getting housed as a term.

199
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,200
It's like got a ridiculous origin though or something.

200
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I don't remember.

201
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Yeah.

202
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,200
It's abbreviated from, you know, the other word.

203
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,880
So, okay.

204
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,960
But this fork business, like shall we fork fedora, time to fork Debian.

205
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
I've never.

206
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,640
Well, actually we have.

207
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,560
The only time I think we've ever seen the Linux community this riled up and just unable

208
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,560
to just move forward for a long time was like the Microsoft Novell deal where you had boycott

209
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,040
Novell prop up and you had all this stuff and there was such decisive lines and it went

210
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,160
on for like two years, but really not, I mean, you know, it was, it was not as bad for two

211
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,520
years, but it really went on for a while.

212
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,280
And this is like, we haven't had a good old classic drama like this since then.

213
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,320
It's like the good old days again.

214
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,920
Oh, I remember the old Novell thing and I'm sitting there going thinking, that's great.

215
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,920
I'm going to go watch TV now cause I'm just like, this is going to be a week long thing

216
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,440
and people are going to blow it over.

217
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Yeah.

218
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
That still cracks me up.

219
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Just all right.

220
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Wimpy.

221
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Go ahead.

222
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Ask the questions on everybody's mind.

223
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:39,520
Well, I'm putting myself out there again as the, as the bloke that says, you know, system

224
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,320
D is really quite good.

225
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,640
But I, I often wonder reading what some of the people say about system D and also listening

226
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:54,040
to other podcasts and what they have to say about system D and I'm left with the impression

227
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,920
of you've never actually used it.

228
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,200
Not only have you never actually used it, you've never actually sat down and written

229
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,760
a unit file.

230
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,600
You're not a package maintainer.

231
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,600
You haven't had to deal with init scripts and you haven't seen the benefits of migrating

232
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,480
a package from an init script to system D and, and the many other benefits of system

233
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,400
D. Now I can appreciate that people are very, very firm in their opinion that they like

234
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:27,080
the way things are and there's a place for that, but I think a lot of the speculation

235
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:34,400
and commentary about system D is being had by people who simply do not know what they're

236
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
talking about.

237
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,920
So I'm not suggesting necessarily that fork Debian falls into this camp.

238
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:47,900
They would claim to be seasoned Linux administrators and Debian veterans quite.

239
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,080
So maybe they do know what they're talking about and they have legitimate reasons as

240
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,680
to why they feel system D is not going to suit them.

241
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,040
But there are some podcasts where I've heard them debating the various init systems and

242
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,080
talking about the pros and cons and then admitting partway through their, you know, slagging

243
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,940
off of system D, they've never used it and you just think, well, how are you qualified

244
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,120
to have an opinion?

245
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,080
So my stance on the system D discussion, I think if you look over the history of this

246
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,120
show has an arc where I'm pretty neutral, don't give a crap, and then I become pretty

247
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
pro system D.

248
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,920
And then I get to a point where I was a little belligerent to people who didn't, who didn't

249
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,680
seem to think going forward with system D was a good idea because the reason I've, I

250
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,080
don't know if belligerence is the right word, but I'll just label it that.

251
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:40,440
The reason why I felt that way is because as a sys admin of like 14, 15 years, there

252
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,720
are literally things that I see in system D that I think if I had that when I was managing

253
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,760
servers, I would have hated my job so much less.

254
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,000
Like it's not just small stuff that I see in system D. Some of the things that system

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,040
D brings as a whole, I see as fundamentally necessary for Linux to remain competitive

256
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,280
at scale.

257
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,680
Like without those things and with and without those things, FreeBSD could easily eat our

258
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,120
lunch really because essentially we're, we're, we're just as capable and, but system D offers

259
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,040
so many things and the problem is you really don't know how important they are until you've

260
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,460
deployed Linux at scale or you have a, a, you know, a very network demanding thing or

261
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,640
you have something that has to be as absolutely minimal as possible and support socket activation

262
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,080
or you need something that's integrated with namespaces.

263
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,120
All these things that are edge cases, but together matter so much and may, and are so

264
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,000
important to keeping Linux competitive, not just on the server, but also in mobile.

265
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,920
That when you, when you come, when you argue against system D, what you have to realize

266
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,920
is you have to really come with something that's extremely compelling because what you

267
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,160
are arguing for is essentially removing what I, in, in my personal opinion, and I'm not

268
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,480
saying it's right, but in my personal opinion are fundamentally critical features to keep

269
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,380
Linux competitive.

270
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,240
So if you're going to say no system D, you've got to have an answer for those problems.

271
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,840
And yeah, I don't think you and I can have a debate about this because I think we're

272
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,960
clearly on the same side of the fence and we've got, we've got our personal opinions.

273
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,220
It sounds like the largely similar reasons.

274
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,840
So really what we need is somebody to step up and tell us why we're wrong.

275
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:27,000
And I, I, I think part of is some of the more vocal people debating this are not the same

276
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,660
people who are as impacted by it.

277
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,000
Like I think there's a group of people that care a lot, but they're just not as vocal

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,160
about debating it.

279
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,680
I think I'm trying to, cause I get emails that seem really well reasoned, but I, even

280
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,060
then I've still not been convinced.

281
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,280
The biggest things that convinced me that it might be a problem are always the what

282
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,720
if scenarios.

283
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,840
And I think, yeah, if that happens, we could have a problem, but that's not a today problem.

284
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
That's a what if problem.

285
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Quite.

286
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
Quite.

287
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,240
Anyways, so how do we get talking about, oh yeah, the forks.

288
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Yeah.

289
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,520
The system D conversation once again has been stirred back up by these project forks.

290
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,600
And you know what's interesting is you check the Linux forums like r slash Linux and just

291
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,680
general discussion forums and people are constantly still asking about it.

292
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,740
It is genuinely a topic that even though it seems like we've talked about it ad nauseum,

293
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,160
people still seem to care about.

294
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,560
I guess that's sort of the fun of being a Linux user is you get to care about such nitty

295
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,480
gritty things like your display compositor and system D and all that stuff.

296
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,680
So I guess that's why we do it.

297
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,960
And that concludes the system D portion of this show.

298
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,880
However, something does tell me we'll probably still be talking about system D in 2015.

299
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,920
I can't help myself and it's obviously a huge area of interest for the Linux community.

300
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,720
2015 is going to be a big year for system D. 2015 is also going to be a big year for

301
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,400
our sponsor, DigitalOcean, and I mean that.

302
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,840
They have some very impressive stuff in the works that you guys are going to find out

303
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,200
about very soon.

304
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,300

312
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
up a bit.

313
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
I feel perhaps I have gone too fast for you.

314
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,840
I want to slow down and treat it right and tell you about DigitalOcean, a simple cloud

315
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,640
hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin

316
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,480
up a cloud server up in the cloud, my friends, with root access and unbelievable speeds.

317
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,640
And speaking of speeds, you can actually get the cloud server created in less than a minute

318
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,800
and pricing plans start at only $5 per month.

319
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800

322
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Remember that?

323
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
Well, that's going to get you a $10 credit.

324
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,800
Well, I just said it's $5 for one of their rigs, 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

325
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,040
SSD, one CPU, and a freaking terabyte of transfer, my friends.

326
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
A terabyte.

327
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,280
That's a lot of Christmas movies.

328
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Or something else.

329
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
I don't know.

330
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
I don't judge.

331
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Honey badger over here.

332
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,040
What's great is DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore,

333
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Amsterdam, and London.

334
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,660
So you're going to get a data center somewhere that makes you look like a boss, or you could

335
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,160
diversify your regionalness with that.

336
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,680
I think it's pretty great.

337
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,640
But really, what's great is that interface.

338
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,240
DigitalOcean has the most intuitive control panel for managing something like this.

339
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,080
I wouldn't have thought it could be done.

340
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,480
It really is great.

341
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,320
And power users can replicate the control panel, the functionality, on a much, much

342
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,800
larger scale with DigitalOcean's straightforward API that I'm told is gorgeous.

343
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,840
And I've recently been checking out some of the applications that take advantage of that

344
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
API.

345
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Like Swimmer.

346
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,720
Yeah, it's called Swimmer.

347
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,080
A full featured open source Android client for DigitalOcean.

348
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Look at this thing.

349
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
It's open source.

350
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,280
It's up on GitHub right now.

351
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,480
You can check it out.

352
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,300
And this allows you to manage your DigitalOcean droplets.

353
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,880
You can SSH into the droplet, reboot, power cycle, shut down, resize the droplet, snapshot

354
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,920
it, rebuild it, turn backups on, create a droplet from your phone.

355
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,060
Amazing.

356
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,440
Look at all the options you have with this thing.

357
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,240
This is what's so cool about DigitalOcean's API, and because it's so great, developers

358
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,600
are excited to use it.

359
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,160
And now you can go take advantage of something like this, like an open source Android app

360
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,640
so you can even trust it.

361
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,800
That's so awesome.

362
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,840

Man, that is so slick.

368
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
I really think that's it.

369
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,840
It's such an impressive setup.

370
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,000

And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

374
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,240
You guys, I'm looking forward to 2015.

375
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
I know you guys have something.

376
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
I can't even say.

377
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,120
I can't even say, but let's just say I know some things, and I'm really impressed with

378
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
what I know.

379
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,160
Up next, though, is an interview with a talks developer.

380
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,240
This was sent in by quite a bit of you.

381
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,800
Encrypted messaging space is something I'm following really closely myself.

382
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,680
I find it to be a fascinating field with a lot of cool things happening right now, but

383
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,520
not one that I've really zoned in on as my go-to messaging platform.

384
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,800
So when we had this chance to interview a talks developer, I was really interested in

385
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
what they had to say.

386
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
I hope you will be, too.

387
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Enjoy.

388
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,560
So I want to welcome two developers from the talks project onto the show.

389
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,220
Joining us on Mumble right now, we have STQ and I run Gentoo.

390
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,160
So I know talks started up as sort of a discussion thread, and I'm told I think it started on

391
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,640
4chan.

392
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
And now here we are.

393
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,000
We're what, seven, eight months down the road?

394
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,960
It's become a very active project.

395
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,800
So where is it at from where it started versus where it's at today?

396
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:49,280
Well, talks started as, well, I actually, I had this idea, this very basic idea, and

397
00:20:49,280 --> 00:21:00,680
then, well, I was on a thread, on a G, that was speaking about how Skype is, well, privacy

398
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
issues with Skype.

399
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:09,080
So, well, I had just, well, I just decided, okay, hey, let's, I was actually a bit maybe

400
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:17,880
drunk at the moment or something, and I said, okay, let's make a Skype replacement.

401
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,520
So that's how it started.

402
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,680
And then, well, I was very impressed by the positive response from everyone.

403
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:35,200
So I said, okay, let's start writing code, let's start planning stuff, and that's how

404
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
talks started.

405
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,400
So it started kind of as a crazy idea that maybe after you thought about it for a little

406
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,560
bit realized, this could be a good idea.

407
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,040
Have you worked on this kind of stuff before or something like this before?

408
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,440
Well, I played around with some BitTorrent DHT.

409
00:21:52,440 --> 00:22:03,080
I did a couple of scripts to, like, I once made a script to find out which, to try to

410
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:11,560
track everything on the BitTorrent DHT, but, well, there were some little bandwidth issues.

411
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:20,760
I would have needed a big server and something, so the idea kind of died, but that gave me

412
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:29,480
a bit of experience on, like, how peer-to-peer software works and everything, so that's how

413
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
...

414
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
Yeah.

415
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,160
Well, can you tell me a little bit about, and I guess it's actually pronounced salt,

416
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,460
but the networking and cryptography library that talks is sitting on primarily.

417
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,920
Is this the big piece of functionality here?

418
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,560
What does this component play?

419
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,040
What role does that play?

420
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,480
Well, that's the... Seriously, I like that crypto.

421
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,160
I love that crypto library.

422
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,560
It's very simple to use and everything, and it's very secure.

423
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:08,640
I don't think talks would have worked without it since, well, when talks started, we didn't

424
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,200
know what crypto library would use.

425
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Right.

426
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,360
That seems like a huge choice to make, right?

427
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,840
Yeah, but then someone suggested it in a thread, and then I looked at it, and I just saw this

428
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,840
is perfect.

429
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,360
It's simple to use.

430
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,200
It's fast.

431
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,400
It's very secure.

432
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:40,760
It protects against all types of timing attacks, et cetera, so we picked that, and I started

433
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:49,040
reading a lot, okay, so how do I implement this correctly in talks without screwing up

434
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
things?

435
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Right.

436
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,440
That was my question, because I've heard that I think also the Telegram Messenger program

437
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,000
uses the salt library, but I guess they maybe... I don't know the details, but I guess

438
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
they've implemented it incorrectly.

439
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,840
Have you looked at that situation and tried to kind of balance what they did wrong and

440
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,440
adjust accordingly for talks?

441
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,600
Telegram, they don't use the salt library.

442
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,400
They use their custom crypto implementation.

443
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,040
If they would have used the salt library, their crypto would have been fine.

444
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,760
Nobody would be complaining about it.

445
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Right.

446
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Gotcha.

447
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,600
So something that seemed kind of like a big deal, you guys got accepted, the talks project

448
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,160
got accepted into the Google Summer of Code, but you know a lot of people have asked is

449
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,940
that going to influence the project in any way?

450
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,560
What about their independence?

451
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,440
What are your thoughts on the Summer of Code and what it means for that aspect of the project?

452
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,360
I'll go ahead and answer this.

453
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Sure.

454
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,400
Well, I think with Google Summer of Code, we're really going to be able to finish a

455
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,400
lot of things that we wouldn't have the time to do that due to our prior commitments we

456
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,880
would never be able to do.

457
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,920
We would be able to have people who have different skill sets in areas we might not have.

458
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,360
It would be able to help out that way.

459
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Okay.

460
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:09,520
So what about this criticism that people have said, oh, well, this is a bad sign.

461
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,400
This is about influence.

462
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
What do you think of that?

463
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,880
Has there been communications from Google about suggestions or anything like that?

464
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,360
No, they don't do anything like that.

465
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,640
They exist purely to foster the development of open source projects.

466
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,880
No secret influences, no link to this secret library, nothing like that.

467
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,760
No insert go to fail line here.

468
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,520
That's good considering that there's a lot of hopes riding on a secure messenger and

469
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,520
I got to tell you guys, this is a pretty contested space right now.

470
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,520
So I think people are looking for a lot of things to pull out to kind of criticize on.

471
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,880
And to that end, I don't really know if there is something to be worried about here, but

472
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,940
a lot of people have criticized that they started as a threat on 4chan.

473
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,920
Have you guys dealt with growing pains as a result of that?

474
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:09,240
Well, we didn't start like that, but as we developed, we got people with skill sets from

475
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,480
Reddit and all these areas and sort of nurtured.

476
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,360
That's exactly, I mean, so when I, I mean, not to interrupt, I'm sorry, but when I, when

477
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,580
I, so I've seen this question, it was sent into our show a few times and to me it just

478
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,000
seems like these are locations that technical people hang out.

479
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,520
True, so 4chan specifically, that little area is a lot of trolling.

480
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,440
I think it was pure luck that the people who we have now, that all the skills matched up

481
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
just perfectly.

482
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Yeah, yeah.

483
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Well, I, and I, and I know, I know it's something that's on people's radar and it maybe seems

484
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,000
like one of those things down the road.

485
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,360
It probably, it, it probably won't be as big of a factor, but what are any other growing

486
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,560
pains you guys are seeing as the project is becoming more aware?

487
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,000
People are becoming more aware of it?

488
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Not really.

489
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:06,800
Well, there's always a bit of issues, but we can, we, we've dealt with them and it's

490
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
good.

491
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Well, okay.

492
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,720
So now that's the big picture stuff.

493
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,040
I want to talk a little bit about maybe features and stuff that talks is hoping to support

494
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,520
down the road.

495
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:22,320
What are your plans for, three, there's three major things I've seen requests from the audience.

496
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Uh, conference call setups.

497
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,560
You guys have any plans to do things like group calls and things like that down the

498
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
road?

499
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,560
Yes.

500
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,920
Okay, good.

501
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,480
What about multiple presence?

502
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,200
As in I can be logged in on a, on, on multiple computers and the message goes to all locations

503
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,720
or maybe I'm on my, I'm on my Android phone and I'm also on my laptop and I want my messages

504
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,200
and calls to go to both locations.

505
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,400
Is that possible with the security model you're using now?

506
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,400
You know, we haven't worked out something like that just yet.

507
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,800
We're still working on a lot of our group chats, how we can do audio and video, how

508
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,960
we can do things like that, but when the time comes, I know we'll be able to reach that

509
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
area.

510
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:10,440
Yeah, it's a, it's possible, but, uh, it's a later after, after we've done the TCP stuff,

511
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,080
after we've done the, the group chats and the work and yeah.

512
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,440
Is that how you're focusing right now?

513
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,880
It seems like the talks clients that I've tried are all text chat based to get that

514
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,160
working and then as the plan to then to get the next set of functionality working and

515
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
then the next.

516
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:32,280
Yeah, it's a, it's how, uh, well, I think it's the best way to develop software to do,

517
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:38,600
make a feature, test it correctly, add another, add another and, uh, that's a.

518
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,200
So what's on your immediate list and then what's on your sort of, after I get this next

519
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,800
immediate problem solved, after I get this thing that's bugging me fixed, I really want

520
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,300
to start working on.

521
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,920
So what are those two things?

522
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:56,040
Well, we have first the, the thing that I want to finish first, well, that I'm working

523
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:06,320
on right now is, uh, the TCP, uh, TCP stuff so that, uh, I want to add a TCP relay functionality

524
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:15,920
to talks, uh, nodes so that, uh, people that are behind bad knots and, uh, can, uh, can

525
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:21,680
also use talks currently talks on the works people with that can a whole bunch through

526
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
their knots.

527
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Okay.

528
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
But that's not everyone.

529
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,680
Yeah.

530
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,880
Some people are behind enterprise knots, some symmetric knots that are weird and on and

531
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:39,720
block certain, uh, like, yeah, they only have a maximum number of UDP connections that can,

532
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,760
well, that can be a problem because well, tax needs to connect to a bunch of people

533
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
for discovery.

534
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
Yeah.

535
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Yeah.

536
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
So, okay.

537
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,760
I look at this and I think if talks was really successful, I, if, if you could truly create

538
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,520
a Skype replacement that was secure, you would have a system that would be used by, by journalists,

539
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,000
by dissidents, by the paranoid and by cheaters.

540
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,480
And, uh, it would be this, these groups of people would fundamentally rely on this technology

541
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,360
to be absolutely iron clad solid.

542
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,160
Have you considered code audits and, and maybe you add a certain like quote unquote official

543
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,800
release point saying we're going to audit the code, have a third party look at the code?

544
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,920
Well, yes, of course, but we want to wait till a lot of our major features are done.

545
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,800
And talking about what you mentioned earlier, we're designing talks to be something that

546
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,520
everyone can use someone talking, someone somewhere.

547
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,440
I have no idea what I'm saying right now, but long story short, we want to design something

548
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,240
that's so fast, so easy, so smooth that people would use it instead of Skype.

549
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:57,560
I mean, we're not going to truly accomplish our goal unless everyone's using this, unless

550
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,800
there's nothing that can be spied on, nothing that can be new.

551
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,360
Maybe it's not a selling point for end users, but we want to give it to everyone.

552
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,000
That's an interesting way to put it.

553
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,680
I mean, it's definitely is.

554
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,080
It's definitely for some, but yeah, you're right for the general user, it's not really,

555
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,080
it's not really a big deal.

556
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,800
Uh, you know, the only really other question I had sent in from the audience that was kind

557
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,080
of kicking around is, uh, how do you guys plan to make money and are you going to take

558
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
donations?

559
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:33,040
No, we might take donations and so Gentoo's been talking about it a bit, but right now

560
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,120
all of our expenses, our build systems, everything comes out of my own pocket and I haven't really

561
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,200
been taking anything in.

562
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,800
Well, you're a good man, SDQ.

563
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,640
So have you considered like a donation system or like a Kickstarter system or something

564
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
like that?

565
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,960
Um, can you repeat the question?

566
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
I couldn't hear you.

567
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Are you thinking about, are you guys?

568
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,560
Cause the reason I'm asking is we had a few people send in like long play wrote in and

569
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,400
asked if, uh, you guys would, he wants to send you money, but he couldn't find a way

570
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
to donate.

571
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,320
Are you considering doing a donation model?

572
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:15,440
We might put a donation button on the website because the reason I didn't want donations

573
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:23,800
to, well, us accepting donations at the beginning is, well, what if, uh, we just started and

574
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,360
then everything fails and well, people are going to be angry and everything.

575
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,760
But well, we've, uh, we've gone a long way from there.

576
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,880
So we might, uh, yeah, that's good.

577
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
It's good.

578
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Yeah.

579
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
Yeah.

580
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,480
You want to make sure you got something that, uh, you can, you can show for before you ask

581
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,560
people to start taking money.

582
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,160
Well, also I'll open it up to the mumble room and see if there's any questions that the

583
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
group has.

584
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,000
Um, and you guys, if you do just ping me in the chat room with any questions you have

585
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,040
for the folks and we'll, we'll get through those.

586
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,160
In the chat room, I'm also checking your questions as, as we go, but, uh, guys, I want to thank

587
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,760
you for coming on Linux Unplugged.

588
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,120
As this project I'm going to be watching, you know, I'm, I'm still really interested

589
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,800
in picking the mobile messenger of the future.

590
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,000
And right now the Jupiter Broadcasting Network really kind of uses Skype a lot for our shows

591
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,700
because at the end of the day, it seems to be the, the sort of the best combination of

592
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,960
deployment and ease of use and actual video and audio quality simultaneously.

593
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,060
I'm really excited about the talks project.

594
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,560
We talked about it a little bit this last Sunday on the Linux Action Show and I demoed

595
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,580
a couple of different apps you can use for it.

596
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,920
It's early days right now, uh, but, uh, I, I, I want to encourage you guys to keep going

597
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,000
at it, keep working at it because this is a space that people are going to be more and

598
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,560
more interested over the, uh, the next couple of years.

599
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,800
Crossroads asks, uh, how does this compare to other chat programs, e.g. BT Chat or Tor

600
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Chat?

601
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
And actually that's a great question.

602
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,000
Have you guys seen the announcement of Tor Chat and what are your thoughts on that versus

603
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
talks?

604
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:01,520
Well, Tor Chat is, uh, they're going more on the anonymous, uh, well, they want to make

605
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:07,080
an anonymous chat, but, uh, talks is, uh, isn't anonymous.

606
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:13,400
You connect directly to the people you're speaking to because, uh, we want performance

607
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:21,920
because, well, streaming, uh, high resolution video through Tor is, well, doesn't really

608
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
work well.

609
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
That's true, right?

610
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
Yeah.

611
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
That's a great point.

612
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Yeah.

613
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
I hadn't thought about the video aspect of it.

614
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
And to reiterate further.

615
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
Yeah.

616
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Go ahead.

617
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:38,920
I mean, we're trying to design something that everyone can use, not just the paranoid.

618
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,040
Well, and, and to that end, is that why, I mean, I'm seeing a lot of, a lot of different

619
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
talks clients.

620
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,720
There's not like one official talks client.

621
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,520
I guess it would be conceivable that you could have chat programs like Pidgin out there and

622
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,080
others that support talks and Tor Chat at the same time.

623
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
Right?

624
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Yeah.

625
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,720
Pidgin for a, there's a talks plugin in development already.

626
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:05,600
So it, uh, it already supports talks, but very good.

627
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,920
That's very interesting you guys.

628
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,400
And, uh, I'm glad you're working on this to tell you the truth because, uh, one of my

629
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,320
predictions for, uh, the, the, uh, the Linux action show for 2014 was that there'd be an

630
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,020
explosion in secure messaging.

631
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,900
So you guys are right now confirming my prediction.

632
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,000
So that's awesome for me.

633
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Most definitely.

634
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah.

635
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I know, right?

636
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,720
Uh, so you guys, I know, I know you guys probably are not big fans of giving out timelines,

637
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,120
but do you have a general big picture timeline or roadmap of when features will roll out

638
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,360
or be available?

639
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,920
I can tell you the, well, the order at which we're going to roll them out, but timelines

640
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,840
are a bit, uh, I'll take that.

641
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,720
I'll take order of you that you want to roll things out for sure.

642
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,880
Well, first of all, we're gonna roll out the TCP relays.

643
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,600
Then after that, we're going to work, uh, on, uh, fixing our group chats and making

644
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,120
audio video work in group chats.

645
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:06,640
And well, that's the two main, that should take a while because they're, they're two

646
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,600
very big, uh, features that they're going to need lots of testing and everything.

647
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:19,480
And after that, we're going to concentrate on, well, whatever, uh, well, maybe optimizing

648
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:28,880
code or, uh, trying to implement other features like offline messaging and like how someone

649
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:37,000
who wants to be logged in at two computers that we might, uh, might work on that.

650
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,120
It depends on what we feel people want the most.

651
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,120
What they're asking for.

652
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Yeah.

653
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
Well, let me ask you this.

654
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,760
What if somebody, Daredevilin is making a great question, making a great point in our

655
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
chat room.

656
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,280
What if, what if you, uh, were, uh, you wake up one day, you go to slash dot or tech meme

657
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,840
or Reddit or whatever, and you see a top headline, new secure messenger launched available

658
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,520
on Android, iOS, and the desktop, um, it's, it's awesome.

659
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
It's rock solid.

660
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
And you dig through it.

661
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,720
And when you see they're charging, they're charging for the app and then you'd read through

662
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,740
the details and you realize, holy crap, they're using talks.

663
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:14,080
How do you feel about people creating clients or potentially business models on top of a

664
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,200
system that you're building today?

665
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Well, the core is licensed under the GPL v3, so they can't take the code and not give the

666
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,440
source back.

667
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,880
So well, if someone does take it and improves their source and if they make money, I don't

668
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,520
care if they, because they're improving the software.

669
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,560
So Daredevilin, I didn't realize you were in here.

670
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Go ahead.

671
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,520
And did you have more you wanted to add to that?

672
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Daredevilin?

673
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
No.

674
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
Sorry.

675
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
I'm here.

676
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
Can you hear me?

677
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Yeah.

678
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Yeah.

679
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,800
So what happened is, uh, the reason I got this question is because, uh, I was wondering

680
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,160
more, uh, I know it's GPL and people are contributing back, but there's kind of business models

681
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,360
that could involve, for example, a company making their own nodes in a way that, um,

682
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,760
will allow them to mimic users.

683
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,000
And I mean, it depends of course on the intrinsic of the project, but then goes to something

684
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,600
that is something a little bit deviated from original thoughts plans.

685
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,800
And it goes like uses talk source code.

686
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,080
It uses all like a Bitcoin's Litecoin, that kind of thing.

687
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
Yeah.

688
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Kind of, sorta.

689
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:34,240
So it will be with some differences that will make more a company driven perspective and

690
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,480
not actually providing the users direct access.

691
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,080
So what are the measures in place for you to incentivize people to just come to your

692
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:49,440
project instead of just working, doing something crazy that goes completely out of town?

693
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,400
Well, if, if a company does something like that, well, end users actually use the software

694
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,480
from that company.

695
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,040
That means you're doing something good.

696
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,320
So that's a win for you.

697
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
Wow.

698
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:09,080
You can always take the code out and put it in our, in our project.

699
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:14,400
So Josh, go ahead.

700
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
That's a good point.

701
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
It's like, okay.

702
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Oh, okay.

703
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
I mean, that's an interesting way to think about it.

704
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Yeah.

705
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,320
Like OpenBSD makes FSH and they give it away for people to do whatever they want.

706
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
Right.

707
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
Great point.

708
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,720
I mean, that's, that's an interesting way to kind of frame that Josh, you had a kind

709
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,320
of a question more about funding, right?

710
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,040
Yes, I did.

711
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,560
So you guys talked about maybe monetizing or accepting donations in the future.

712
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,600
So what is your opinion on allowing, you know, people to back certain features with something

713
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:49,300
like Bounty Source and allow you guys to get paid to like implement certain features like

714
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:58,120
group chats and maybe help speed the process along or provide some sort of monetary incentive?

715
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:03,040
You know, I think something like that really hurts people's trust that something doesn't

716
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
need a timeline.

717
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,520
If something looks good, looks like it's easy to do, but it doesn't come up and it ends

718
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,320
up taking a lot longer than it should or something.

719
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,320
People get disappointed.

720
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
Hmm.

721
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:22,240
Well, the main issue is that implementing something is relatively easy.

722
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,640
Implementing something that's bug free and works perfectly, that's, that's hard.

723
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,280
So well, that's, that's, that's an interesting point.

724
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,880
Yeah, you know, yeah, I, it is, so it's something to consider I think because it's really fascinating

725
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,560
to really, it truly tells you what, what people's priorities are when they assign a dollar value

726
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,000
to it in a way that is so much more tangible than, than emails and bug requests and all

727
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
these things.

728
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,160
When people are actually willing to put money down for something, then you really know it's,

729
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,660
it's literally of a value to them.

730
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,800
So I, but I do understand you don't want to overset expectations and you guys seem to

731
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,760
be, you know, walking that line pretty closely.

732
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,880
I'm going to take a quick break right here and when we get back, I want to talk a little

733
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,960
bit about maybe your thoughts on the future of mobile for talks, but first I hope you'll

734
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,840
have some time this holiday to visit linuxacademy.com slash unplug so you can take advantage of

735
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,280
our special 33% unplug discount, which is an incredible deal.

736
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,440
Linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

737
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,400
Go check them out right now.

738
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,720
There's never been a better time.

739
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,000
Step-by-step video courses, downloadable comprehensive study guides, bring them offline with you.

740
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,840
This is reading material, but also audio and video material.

741
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,720
You can plug it into your podcast player.

742
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,080
You can learn from the presenters.

743
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,820
They've got great audio setups.

744
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,560
They're genuinely passionate about the topics.

745
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,760
That's what makes them such great educators and you can sit there and absorb it as you

746
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,520
travel as you're in the shower, like spooky sprite comes with your own server too.

747
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,240
So when the courseware requires it, they automatically spin up a server for you on the backend and

748
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,360
all of this, you get to choose from seven plus Linux distributions and have that courseware

749
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,440
and the VMs automatically adjust to match the distribution you've chosen.

750
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,920
You can keep track of your progress as you go and quiz yourself and Linux Academy has

751
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,320
rolled out courses recently on Docker.

752
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,640
Great opportunity to go learn Docker, Vagrant and Puppet and I'm talking about stuff that

753
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:18,120
takes you from beginner, absolute beginner to professional, ready to be certified.

754
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,080
One of their students recently took the AWS course and I got an email about this.

755
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,320
After the AWS course, he got a certification and he actually went and got a job at Amazon.

756
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
It's amazing.

757
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,000
They have a community there that helps kind of bump you.

758
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,600
When you're having sort of a down moment and you're having a hard time motivating, that's

759
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,920
just enough to just give you a little bump to keep you going and the management system

760
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,620
you have when you log into your Linux Academy dashboard is really, really great.

761
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,760
They have something called learning plans too where you can say, okay Linux Academy,

762
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,140
I got this much time this week and then Linux Academy will generate courseware for you based

763
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,600
on your availability, custom tailored to you and it can send you email reminders about

764
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,600
quizzes and stuff.

765
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,840
I mean it's a really good way to adapt the program to you to match your ebb and flows

766
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
of availability.

767
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
It's life.

768
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,120
We all have it and you can get started by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

769
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,320
Also a lot of great new DevOps content has been flooding into Linux Academy as well as

770
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,080
live streams so check it out, linuxacademy.com.

771
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,720
We've also got some development stuff for Android, Python, PHP.

772
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,820
If OpenStack is something you've heard a lot about but you don't really have your head

773
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:29,320
wrapped around it, great OpenStack courses, great, great OpenStack courses.

774
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,740
Some of the best in the industry really right there and in fact some of the biggest companies

775
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:37,120
in the industry are working with Linux Academy because their courseware is so great.

776
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,640
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

777
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,200
the unplugged program.

778
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,320
Okay, well before Ubuntu 14.10's release there was a lot of talk about how boring of a release

779
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
it might be.

780
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:54,680
I made an offhand comment in the news one episode and man oh man did I get a lot of

781
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,680
response.

782
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:02,040
Popeye was one of the blokes who felt perhaps my comment needed to be responded to so he

783
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,560
and I had a nice chat about that.

784
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,920
Alright, so I want to move into the topic that was sparked after Sunday's coverage of

785
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,840
Ubuntu 14.10 and before we get into that, so in the Linux Action Show subreddit and

786
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,640
in the email there are a lot of people that apparently decided that I am very biased against

787
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,920
Ubuntu and one of the reasons decided was that I skipped over talking Unity's touch

788
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,680
support when we were talking about GNOME 3.14.

789
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,400
I just want to clear the ground right now, just quickly mention that was not me sliding

790
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,800
Unity at all, that was just me focusing on GNOME 3.14 because we were covering GNOME

791
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,800
3.14.

792
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,320
We were not covering what Unity can do, we were covering what GNOME can do so I just

793
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
didn't mention it.

794
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,840
It doesn't mean I was intentionally because I don't like it leaving it out, it was because

795
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,280
I was talking about GNOME and what GNOME was adding and what Wayland was adding.

796
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,360
But there is more contention over our coverage of Ubuntu 14.10 itself.

797
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,800
It's probably, you know what Matt, people hate crickets I think is what it is, people

798
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,800
just hate crickets.

799
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,800
I think it is, yeah.

800
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,280
I think the crickets may have been something that kind of set folks off, I don't know it's

801
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,280
funny.

802
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,280
Yeah, it's just too much I think.

803
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
Should have been a bomb going off.

804
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,600
People love that, people love explosions.

805
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:16,040
A lot of it boils down to a misunderstanding of, I think a lot of people attributed it

806
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:21,600
to arch fanboyism on my part and that I was such an arch fanboy that I was putting Ubuntu

807
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,480
down because of it.

808
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,480
And I think a lot of it was probably coming from people who haven't watched the shows

809
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:34,200
for a long time because I think people, sometimes what happens is people see that I am pro something.

810
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,640
I was very pro Ubuntu, very pro Unity, the desktop for a long time, I still think it's

811
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,520
a good desktop.

812
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:47,760
And so because I was pro something for a long time, it is to them illogical that I would

813
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,320
now say something that is not pro.

814
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,200
Because once you like something, you're supposed to like it forever.

815
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,960
But I think people who watch me know that my opinions change over time based on results

816
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,120
and the way things go.

817
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,600
I'll give you a great example.

818
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,360
I think you could go back in time and you could clearly see episodes where I was slamming

819
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:11,160
on Fedora, pretty handily slamming on Fedora for maybe the entire review.

820
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:17,760
Now my position on Fedora has changed quite a bit as they sort of are addressing some

821
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,760
of these problems.

822
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,940
I would say I still approach Fedora with some depredation and some level of skepticism,

823
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,600
but I am impressed with the changes they're making.

824
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,320
I'm impressed with their project leader.

825
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,720
Obviously we've had him on the show twice in a few weeks, and in the times of course

826
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,440
the second time wasn't really about Fedora.

827
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,780
So it was funny because in that very episode of people saying, well Chris is such an Arch

828
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,360
fanboy, they were completely negating the fact that we had like a 25 minute interview

829
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,060
with the lead of the project, of the Fedora project.

830
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:52,560
My point is, it's not a bias towards Arch that influences my reporting on Ubuntu.

831
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,020
I don't have any distribution bias at all.

832
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,020
That would be ridiculous.

833
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:03,120
The reason I go with Arch is because it does everything I need it to do, and it doesn't

834
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,480
feel like a distribution.

835
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,380
It doesn't have politics, it doesn't have councils, it doesn't have advisory boards.

836
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:14,600
It just is, and you don't have to worry about the politics and the people.

837
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,300
It feels just like a meta layer on top of Linux.

838
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,760
That's why I like Arch.

839
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,200
I could just as easily switch to Fedora next when they've got that rolling.

840
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,360
I could see that happening in the next year or so.

841
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,640
I don't have allegiance to any one particular distribution.

842
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,680
I do have a bias though, and that bias is a bias towards winning.

843
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,500
People who are doing it right.

844
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,300
People who are producing results.

845
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,640
People who are coming through on what they say they will do.

846
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,620
And as a company, any project, doesn't have to be Ubuntu, as any project slides in one

847
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:50,500
direction or the other, my coverage of that project will reflect that slide.

848
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,520
So if they say, now I'm sorry Poby, but let's just say there were supposed to be two phones

849
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,520
already in the marketplace.

850
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,880
Let's just say Mir was already supposed to ship.

851
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,000
Let's say that Ubuntu 14.10 is the most boring Linux desktop release we've ever seen from

852
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,400
the most important distro maker out there.

853
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,280
Let's accept all of these things as genuine facts, unfortunate facts, but let's just accept

854
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,280
those things.

855
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,000
Me reporting on that does not mean I have an Ubuntu agenda where I want to tear Ubuntu

856
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
down.

857
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,760
It's me reporting on the state of Ubuntu, one of the more important distributions in

858
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,760
the market.

859
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,480
It's not coming from an arch influence, it's coming from following these things and maybe

860
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,960
a little disappointment.

861
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,760
Does that make sense?

862
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,160
Matt can you fill in, am I missing any gaps here?

863
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,440
I think you pretty much hit it.

864
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,640
I mean, it's basically different, it really boils down to different strokes for different

865
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,640
folks.

866
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,960
I think it's just where it is at the end of the day.

867
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:44,700
And for you, you have a specific set of expectations that one distro or another may or may not

868
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,700
be meeting.

869
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,800
And that could of course change over time.

870
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,840
I think what I'm trying to get to is it feels like the conversation, I don't know if poisoned

871
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:01,400
is the right word or derailed, but this latching on to, oh well, he's just saying that because

872
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,720
he's a fan boy.

873
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,600
Or Chris is too biased by Arch to cover it.

874
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:12,560
Just me saying that out loud sounds ridiculous and childish.

875
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,820
The concept that I would have some sort of allegiance to some Linux distribution that

876
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,200
would influence my coverage of it is ridiculous.

877
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,560
What I will do is identify a Linux distribution that does something interesting, and if they're

878
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:29,420
doing that something better than everybody else is, I might suggest those other distributions

879
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:34,320
try to adopt some of those things, but that doesn't make them invalid.

880
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,240
I've used every distribution out there.

881
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,840
I also don't report much on Mandriva, do I?

882
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,120
That doesn't mean I have an anti-Mandriva bias, it just means they're not really moving

883
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,220
the needle much these days, so they don't really work their way up into the coverage

884
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,220
very often.

885
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,880
Well, and I think it's also worth mentioning, and someone will undoubtedly point out, okay,

886
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,400
then why does it appear that we quote-unquote rip on Ubuntu but not on Mandriva?

887
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,160
And my response to that would be simply because we have a set of expectations for this particular

888
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,940
distro, one that we've had a lot of great experiences with, and we just simply want

889
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:07,080
to see certain things addressed, and that's not happening.

890
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,800
I'm speaking for myself.

891
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,120
Ubuntu's relevance in the marketplace makes it more likely to receive criticism, and it

892
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,800
also makes it more likely to receive praise and hype, and I mean, there's two sides to

893
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,800
that coin.

894
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,800
Absolutely.

895
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Higher expectations.

896
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,960
And so, like in the chat room's pointing out, why do we dog on Mir and not Weyland?

897
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,080
Well, actually, I don't really think we dog on Mir.

898
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,720
In fact, if you trace the-

899
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,720
We didn't mention Mir in the last-

900
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,280
Well, no, but if you trace the history of our show back, when Mir was announced, we

901
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,360
were some of the biggest offenders of, hey, let him try it, give him space and let him

902
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,160
do something, and we took so much shit for that.

903
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,160
Like Matt and I-

904
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,160
I dressed up in a monkey suit.

905
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,160
I mean, come on, you know?

906
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,160
Exactly.

907
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,160
I brought the monkey suit to-

908
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,360
Like, we were there saying, let him give him a shot, and the thing is, it's not that we

909
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,760
don't want them to still have a shot, it's just the fundamental fact is, we're still

910
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,760
waiting.

911
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,040
That was a long time ago.

912
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,200
That's fine.

913
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,160
These things take time, but results, at the end of the day, are what we have to report

914
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,160
on.

915
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,840
That's what we have here to talk about.

916
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,560
That's what the discussion is about.

917
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,560
That's the reality.

918
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:12,300
And so, when OMG Ubuntu is in bold and italic, saying there's no new features, not even a

919
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,240
new wallpaper, what is the Linux action show supposed to say?

920
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,440
What dick am I supposed to suck to make all of you happy?

921
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,880
Because there's no dick I can find.

922
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,480
Holy shit.

923
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,480
Pretty much.

924
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,480
Right?

925
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,480
I mean, seriously.

926
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,480
Yeah.

927
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,480
I mean, I-

928
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,940
So, we are working right now on a different approach to our Ubuntu reviews.

929
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:38,120
That I think, it was producer Eric's idea, and I think it's a really solid idea that

930
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,920
will make our Ubuntu 14.10 reviews extremely interesting.

931
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,760
But it is requiring a completely reformulation of the way we approach a Linux distribution,

932
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,240
because we have to find something to talk about, to talk about.

933
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,840
Otherwise, we just wouldn't review it.

934
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,960
And that doesn't seem like a good option either.

935
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,800
I have covered this distribution for a long time, and I've never been at a point where

936
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,020
I've literally had no idea what to say.

937
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,020
Other than bad things.

938
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:05,560
So, I'm working, so we're working on a new formula to come up, give the respins some

939
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,640
attention and really kind of have a nice comprehensive look at it.

940
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,240
But I'm pretty happy with where we're going with it, but it's required a total adjustment

941
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:15,520
of our approach, because of the situation we now find ourselves in.

942
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,320
And I feel like, you know, there's a lot of energy being put in by our community.

943
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,880
There's about five threads in the Linux Action Show subreddit right now, if you count threads

944
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,000
that have also devolved into this topic.

945
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,320
So there's two or three primary threads, and one or two that have devolved into this topic.

946
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:36,120
Currently live in the Linux Action Show subreddit, claiming that we are so far off base with

947
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:41,040
Ubuntu 14.10, because of our biases and et cetera, et cetera.

948
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,740
There's no way for me to tell you this.

949
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,520
There's no anti-ubuntu agenda here.

950
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,360
There's no arch bias here.

951
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,480
There is a bias towards winning.

952
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,120
There is some Linux elitism, because we've been Linux users for a very long time, and

953
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,920
we start to know when something smells like shit, and we start to know when something's

954
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,840
winning, and we call it like it is.

955
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,040
I will grant you those things.

956
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:05,680
Bias towards winning and an elitism that isn't arch elitism, it's just a Linux user elitism.

957
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,680
It's just there, because honestly, after you see enough of this crap, you start to tell

958
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,200
people to get off your lawn.

959
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,600
It's not a function of being against Ubuntu.

960
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,000
It's just calling a spade a spade, or whatever the saying is.

961
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I don't even know.

962
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,320
It's just that's where we're at right now.

963
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,040
I want to address this, because I'm seeing there's a lot of energy being put into this.

964
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,200
So here's a great, and there's some great posts.

965
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:33,440
I mean, a lot of thought is being put into this stuff, but it's kind of misguided in

966
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:41,840
the sense that the trouble is we will continue to say if something's bad, I believe it is

967
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,560
our responsibility if something isn't going right.

968
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,760
We cannot sit here on this show that is the number one watched Linux media.

969
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,980
I cannot sit on that show and say something is great when it's not great.

970
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,560
It is our responsibility in any way we can to help these things move along in the right

971
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,560
direction.

972
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:02,620
If that's just our voice that's just echoing the thought of some users, that's fine.

973
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:06,280
If other projects watch this stuff and go, hmm, maybe we should rethink this.

974
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,280
That's great.

975
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,960
It doesn't really matter, but we have to be genuine to what we believe, and you have to

976
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,320
understand that it's not about us going after Shuttleworth, or making Popey cry, or anything

977
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:22,260
like that, because at the end of the day, if you watch the show long enough, you will

978
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:26,520
know that if they start producing results, if in 2015 we start seeing several great phone

979
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:32,040
models come out, and it's kind of great, and down the road, Unity 8's got its bugs worked

980
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,400
out, and it's great.

981
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,520
We will be beyond elated to cover that on the show.

982
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,240
I love covering stuff that rocks under Linux.

983
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,500
That's why the word action is in the Linux action show.

984
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:49,560
We like covering the stuff that kicks the most ass every single week in Linux and open

985
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,560
source.

986
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,120
I will be the happiest person.

987
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,120
Trust me.

988
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,260
Nobody will be happier than Chris, because it'll be great content for the Linux action

989
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,860
show when they have something that we all love.

990
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:01,860
Go ahead, Popey.

991
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,600
You might as well go.

992
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,600
So, there's a few things I didn't know about your review, because I was away at a conference

993
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:14,120
over the weekend, and then someone pointed it out to me, and so I watched it a bit earlier

994
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,120
on.

995
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,920
And there's a few things that struck me.

996
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:22,880
One was that you kind of missed the fact that we've been saying all through this release

997
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,280
that the focus is on phone.

998
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,280
We've said it over and over again.

999
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,280
Oh, yeah.

1000
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,280
It's not lost on me.

1001
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,280
Not lost on me.

1002
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,160
It's pretty apparent.

1003
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,440
Right.

1004
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,920
But you've waited until beta release before you decide to review it and then say it sucks

1005
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,320
because of what we've been saying all along, which is that we're not focused on the desktop.

1006
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:50,600
This is specifically why I aired those concerns when we were talking about the beta release,

1007
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,760
because I want to put all that out on the table, and I don't want it to influence the

1008
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,760
review.

1009
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,760
It's out there now.

1010
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,760
Now it's not going to be part of the review.

1011
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,400
What I was essentially doing was taking that and extracting that bit of what would have

1012
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,840
been in the review and putting it in that news bit.

1013
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:09,440
And now when the review comes, that's not a review.

1014
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,640
Us covering something, and I'm picking on you about this because we get this all the

1015
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,640
time.

1016
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:19,560
Us covering a news item is not us reviewing something in the show, and it's a common misconception.

1017
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,680
You specifically said that we make a big song and dance about it, which we didn't.

1018
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,720
We've mailed a mailing list saying the beta is out, OMG posted an article about it.

1019
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,080
That doesn't mean we've made a song and dance about 1410.

1020
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,040
We haven't made a song and dance about 1410 because we're not focused on it.

1021
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,520
No, I think Matt's point there was that there used to be a song and dance.

1022
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,720
No, you specifically said about there being a song and dance.

1023
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:49,060
Anyway, that was one thing was why bring it up when we keep saying this is not a big release.

1024
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:54,880
It's not the first big release that's not had major stuff in it.

1025
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,720
Because it's more unusual for the in-between LTSs to be so boring.

1026
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:04,400
It's more often the LTS is about the refinement and the polish, and then the big experimentation

1027
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,800
happens in the.10 release.

1028
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,800
And that's always the one that's-

1029
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,800
Well, not really.

1030
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,800
610 didn't change much.

1031
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,880
1210 didn't change a lot, but 1210 had the shopping lens, so everybody had something

1032
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,880
to talk about.

1033
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,880
Right.

1034
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,320
Well, I think a lot of interesting things happened in the 10 releases, and shopping

1035
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,040
lens is obviously the big one.

1036
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:26,520
But those were both post-LTS releases, and they didn't have tremendously huge game-changing

1037
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,520
things in them.

1038
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,520
Are you going back to 610?

1039
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,520
I mean, that's-

1040
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,120
Well, that was the first one that came to mind, because the ones in the middle and the

1041
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:37,680
ones after that had Unity, and obviously that's a massive thing for people to talk about.

1042
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,680
Yeah, exactly.

1043
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,680
Go ahead.

1044
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,080
So the other thing is, it's not just Ubuntu.

1045
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:47,120
Not a lot has changed in Ubuntu, but then there's Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Studio,

1046
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,120
Myth20, Ubuntu Studio.

1047
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,120
I agree.

1048
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,120
That's where the interesting stuff is happening.

1049
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,120
It's just one distro.

1050
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,120
It's one flavor of the distro.

1051
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,120
Right.

1052
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,120
Well, oh, now they're just one flavors.

1053
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,000
Now, when that's the only place where the innovation is happening, now Ubuntu is just

1054
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,080
one of the many flavors.

1055
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,080
But of course, when all the innovation is happening-

1056
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,360
It's always been one of the many flavors.

1057
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,360
Now, of course.

1058
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,360
Of course, it's always, yeah.

1059
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,620
They're just, yeah, it's just one of, it's the main dog.

1060
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,600
And the point is, is all the innovation, all the excitement is happening in all of the

1061
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,080
other flavors, which, you know, worked great for a lot of-

1062
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,440
I wouldn't say there was a lot of excitement going on in any of the others either.

1063
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,440
Oh, ouch.

1064
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,440
To be honest.

1065
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,760
I haven't landed here, dude.

1066
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,760
Look at the Mate.

1067
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,960
Kubuntu's got Plasma 5 preview, dude.

1068
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,960
That's great.

1069
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,960
That's huge.

1070
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,040
That's not in the archive for the release.

1071
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,920
That's a preview ISO, isn't it?

1072
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,440
In the same way that Unity 8 Next is a preview ISO.

1073
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,760
Also the Mate project isn't officially an Ubuntu flavor.

1074
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,240
It seems like there's a common thread here.

1075
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,320
Which is one that I didn't list.

1076
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,320
My point is-

1077
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,320
Specifically because it's not an official release.

1078
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,360
So you don't think it's a problem that all of the interesting things are happening in

1079
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,640
all of the distros based off you?

1080
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,640
I didn't say that.

1081
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:53,400
I said there are other distros, there are other flavors of Ubuntu, and there are interesting

1082
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,400
things going on there.

1083
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
You only focused on Ubuntu.

1084
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,680
You didn't mention any of the others.

1085
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,680
Because what I was talking-

1086
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,940
That's the point I was making.

1087
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,020
Those others were going to- again, this wasn't a full review.

1088
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,240
This is an announcement of the Ubuntu 14.10 beta.

1089
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,240
Right.

1090
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,680
Well, in fact, Ubuntu doesn't participate in the alphas and betas as much as all the

1091
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:11,680
others do.

1092
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,560
So it would be more interesting to talk about all the others on this particular release.

1093
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,680
Oh, I like how you're telling- okay, oh, okay, right.

1094
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,680
So Popeye, you don't-

1095
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:23,200
No, is that not fair to say that these guys are all participating and building up to a

1096
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,840
beta release, so it would be good to talk about them?

1097
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,840
You don't see the justification you're doing here?

1098
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,400
You don't see the deferment that's happening by saying, well, yeah, of course, nothing's

1099
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,400
happening in Ubuntu.

1100
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,160
But don't pay attention to main Ubuntu.

1101
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,040
Don't pay attention to the most important distribution.

1102
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,960
Don't pay attention to the one that has all the people officially working for Canonical

1103
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,960
on.

1104
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,540
Pay attention to all the ones based off of us.

1105
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,200
Pay attention to these guys over here.

1106
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,200
This is a total change.

1107
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,280
No, I'm just saying that these others are just as important as Ubuntu, and, you know,

1108
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,280
we-

1109
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,280
That's not true at all.

1110
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,280
We provide support.

1111
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,280
That's not true at all.

1112
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,280
And you know that's not true at all.

1113
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,280
No, that is not true.

1114
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,000
They are very important, but they are not as important as Ubuntu.

1115
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,480
I don't believe that they're not as important as Ubuntu at all.

1116
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:00,480
Oh, come on.

1117
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,480
Come on.

1118
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,560
No, I don't.

1119
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:09,240
We have an archive that has a variety of desktops, and more than there are flavors, you know,

1120
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,360
there's lots of other desktops in the archive that are important.

1121
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:18,200
In fact, Marte is now in the archive as well, and they're all important, but none of them

1122
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,200
are-

1123
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,200
I love all my children.

1124
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,200
Exactly.

1125
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:28,220
I know years ago, KDE felt themselves as the blue-headed stepchild, and that was frustrating

1126
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,360
because we put a lot of work into all of them.

1127
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,360
I'm just going to put that out there.

1128
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,600
I'm not a fan.

1129
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,400
So I think-

1130
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,400
You're entitled to your opinion.

1131
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Of course.

1132
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
I just think-

1133
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,400
But it's not an opinion.

1134
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,680
I mean, yes, my opinion that it is- where the opinion comes in is in my disappointment,

1135
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,600
but the fact of the matter is there really is nothing to talk about.

1136
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,600
Right.

1137
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,600
Okay.

1138
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,280
But you could argue that that's the same thing with every LTS.

1139
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,840
This isn't an LTS release.

1140
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,520
No, they're the same package with every time there's something that they release right

1141
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,360
after an LTS, it always happens.

1142
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,800
It's just more refinement to the LTS.

1143
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,800
Not always.

1144
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,800
No, that's kind of my point.

1145
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,560
The 10.10, 12.10, 14.10, it's the same.

1146
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,440
You just listed all the ones where they rolled out major changes to the Unity Dash, including

1147
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,920
search and privacy features.

1148
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,440
The ones you just named where there was massive changes.

1149
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,760
No, the 10.10 was known too.

1150
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:28,160
12.10 was slight changes with the adding search, adding Amazon search to it.

1151
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,160
That's not a slight change.

1152
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,160
That's not a slight change.

1153
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,480
That's a huge change.

1154
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,520
As far as functionality, it's the same.

1155
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,520
I mean, it's basically...

1156
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,520
All right.

1157
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,520
I don't want to argue version numbers.

1158
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,200
You add Amazon search to the dashboard, that's a big change.

1159
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,200
There's a lot to talk about.

1160
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,320
When you're an LTS, just being an LTS, that's something to talk about.

1161
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,320
Okay?

1162
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,600
You guys...

1163
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,640
We're getting down into the weeds of what versions of Ubuntu have what features.

1164
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:55,840
The important part is, what I want to walk you from is, A, that wasn't a review, okay?

1165
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:59,040
We're going to do something different for the actual review where we'll take a look

1166
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,460
at the spin.

1167
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:05,200
So don't consider that like our final opinion on Ubuntu 14.10.

1168
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:10,560
However, we are at an interesting point in Ubuntu's history right now.

1169
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,920
We're kind of in the thick of it, and we are documenting what happens while they are making

1170
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,080
this huge, huge, huge transition.

1171
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,520
This is what happens right now.

1172
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,880
We don't know, and we're not casting what's going to happen.

1173
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,040
We're not projecting what's going to happen, but what we do know is right now, what we

1174
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:31,440
get, so what we will get in the long run is potentially a competitive mobile operating

1175
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,120
system that has some great features that could tie in really nicely with desktops and offer

1176
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,280
power Linux users a great experience.

1177
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,680
But what we have today is not a great experience for Linux power users today, and that's what

1178
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,680
we're documenting.

1179
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,680
The fact that we...

1180
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:49,360
Just because we released 12.10 doesn't make 12.04 instantly, sorry, doesn't make 14.04

1181
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,360
instantly obsolete.

1182
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,360
Right.

1183
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,480
Actually, I think that's the interesting thing about 14.10 is, in a lot of ways, it doesn't

1184
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,800
change 14.04's relevance at all.

1185
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,120
You add a few PPAs to 14.04, you don't even have to change anything, right?

1186
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,120
Right.

1187
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:11,080
And we do hardware enablement kernels and XOR back ports to the LTS release, so yeah.

1188
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:19,000
You could consider 14.10 to be not exciting, not that much going on, so fine.

1189
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,360
That's happened in the past.

1190
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:25,520
We're focused on other stuff, and we'll come back to desktop next release.

1191
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:31,200
I kind of feel like, I mean, so why am I getting beat up on for saying that?

1192
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,440
I don't know.

1193
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,480
I was quite surprised myself that people reacted so badly.

1194
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,520
My only point was that you only focused on Ubuntu and didn't focus on the others.

1195
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,840
Well, and that was a little slight of hand because I plan to focus more on the respins

1196
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,360
later and I figured I'd get that criticism out of the way so that way it wasn't in the

1197
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,360
review.

1198
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,040
It's me pre-setting up the review.

1199
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:57,560
It's me kind of, so some of this was formatting for the show, for the arc of the story here.

1200
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,480
I didn't talk about Unity's multi-touch support because we had just talked about that and

1201
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:05,120
I was talking about Gnome, so people took that as me sliding Unity.

1202
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,480
And then when we got to the Ubuntu 14.10 discussion, I didn't really talk about the remixes and

1203
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,620
the reflavors because that's what we're going to focus on in the review because what the

1204
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,240
hell else can we focus on?

1205
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:17,260
And I don't want to just spend the whole review criticizing all of the mistakes and retrashing

1206
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,880
the software center like we often do.

1207
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,760
So we got it out right there in the news segment.

1208
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,760
Now it's done.

1209
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:27,880
Now it's sort of like, it's setting up the narrative for the review, setting up the expectations,

1210
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,320
setting up the state of things, and then-

1211
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,600
I tell you what, I'm really looking forward to this review.

1212
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,600
This sounds awesome.

1213
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,600
And then we deliver.

1214
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,600
Well, we'll see.

1215
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,600
I mean, maybe not.

1216
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,600
We'll see.

1217
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:43,280
But you know, so I guess people kind of jump down like our throats a lot lately whenever

1218
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,520
we kind of bring up the topic of Ubuntu.

1219
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,660
And it sort of feels like there's an expectation that we really should only talk about the

1220
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,200
good stuff.

1221
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,840
And I could agree there could be more good stuff we talk about.

1222
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,480
Yeah, but we get grief for that too though.

1223
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,480
Yeah, exactly.

1224
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,180
Well, that was the thing is like we used to get a ton of grief about that.

1225
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:04,040
But this week it was particularly strong.

1226
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,640
So I don't know if we've helped.

1227
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:11,840
I don't know if we've made any sense in any of this, but I definitely want to tamp down.

1228
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:18,000
I find it personally insulting to be called an arch fanboy because it implies that I am

1229
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,680
so simple-minded that my preference for one distribution over another would somehow like

1230
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,680
infect how I think about everything in my life when really-

1231
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,680
There was one other thing.

1232
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,680
Oh, yeah.

1233
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:31,680
Go on.

1234
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,160
I forgot to mention the gnome release schedule, meaning that we don't have the latest and

1235
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,560
greatest gnome in our races anymore.

1236
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,560
Yeah, okay.

1237
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,560
That's a good one.

1238
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:44,800
Yeah, that's kind of sad and it's a bit frustrating that we can't sync those things up.

1239
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:49,720
It would be nice if we could, but our six months releases have been like that for 10

1240
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:50,720
years.

1241
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:54,720
And when we had gnome as a desktop, I think we made exceptions and would pull it in at

1242
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,720
the last minute.

1243
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,400
But now gnome isn't our default desktop.

1244
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:06,400
So should we bust a gut to get gnome in there for the final release when it isn't even our

1245
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,520
default desktop?

1246
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,520
I agree.

1247
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,920
And the fact that there is a pretty good PPA system in place where you can grab it.

1248
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,160
The reason why, and I don't think I said this in the show, but the reason why I would love

1249
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,240
to see it just as a personal preference is, A, it would definitely make Ubuntu feel much

1250
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,800
more like a contender for me to use as my daily driver.

1251
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,160
But there's Ubuntu gnome edition.

1252
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:29,720
But also it just kind of seems like maybe while Unity isn't seeing a lot of stuff, why

1253
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,720
we're just going just small bug fixes here and there, wouldn't it be really cool if there

1254
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:39,680
was a very fresh, being worked on desktop, available to me to choose from, and that would

1255
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,680
be gnome 3.14.

1256
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:45,480
And to be honest with you, I honestly think a lot of Linux users are going to install

1257
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,280
Fedora 21 because it'll be one of the first distros that does gnome 3.14 out of the box

1258
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,440
and they will install it just for that reason alone.

1259
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,280
And so it would just be a nice feather in the Ubuntu 14.10's cap if it could be like

1260
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,600
a great way to get gnome 3.14 right out of the box.

1261
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,200
That's why I kind of brought it up because I think that would be a great combo while Unity's

1262
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,320
kind of on the shelf.

1263
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,640
But I understand release schedules and whatnot.

1264
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,640
That's just how it goes.

1265
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,040
And the PPAs solve that.

1266
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,040
That's fine.

1267
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:17,720
Jaron mentions maybe it's not what we're talking, but maybe it's how it's brought up.

1268
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:21,920
I think maybe that's potentially true, but at the end of the day, you have to understand

1269
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,360
that we have to provide some level of entertainment too.

1270
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,280
So there has to be something to engage people.

1271
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:30,520
There has to be something that makes people really feel passionate and want to engage

1272
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:35,680
with us because sometimes if you just keep it really dry and boring, people get bored

1273
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,720
and they tune out.

1274
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,720
So sometimes if it's presented in a certain way that you find offensive, consider that

1275
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,440
maybe it's being presented in a certain way to grab attention.

1276
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,720
Well, for the love of God, people, stop being so friggin' sensitive.

1277
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,740
I mean, that's my big thing.

1278
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,920
First and foremost, I recommend Ubuntu to everybody.

1279
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,920
I do.

1280
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,520
And I rip on them hard because I have high expectations.

1281
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:58,640
Everyone I know that recently switched to Linux is using Ubuntu and I will continue

1282
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,120
to do so because it's a good distro.

1283
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:04,920
I will also continue to rip on it because I care.

1284
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,800
I'll throw this in for you, Chris.

1285
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:13,000
Today I installed Fedora 21, Fedora 20, and Antegros.

1286
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,720
What possessed you to do such a thing?

1287
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,720
You'll find out later.

1288
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:17,720
Oh, okay.

1289
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,720
Oh, Mr. Relic.

1290
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:24,800
So I just, I don't know, I don't know if we're going to ever resolve this because it's such

1291
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,800
a fundamental.

1292
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,860
I understand, you know, you guys are really passionate about some of these projects.

1293
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:32,680
Some of you don't just contribute, you know, your voice, but you also contribute your time

1294
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,040
and your code.

1295
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,600
And I don't want to discourage anybody from volunteering on any open source project they're

1296
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,600
into.

1297
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:46,800
And I hope you will maybe consider, just stick with us for a little bit and consider that

1298
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:51,900
our opinions are not, I think it's a benefit to be somebody who constantly reevaluates

1299
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,080
the way they think about things and their opinions of things.

1300
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,320
And you can see over time those will transition.

1301
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:00,640
There's a lot of things over the history of the Linux action show where we came down pretty

1302
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,640
hard on something.

1303
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:07,120
And as they were, as those things were addressed, our, I mean, Gnome is another one.

1304
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,120
Gnome 3.

1305
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,120
Oh yeah.

1306
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,120
Right?

1307
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,640
I mean, and the reason was is at first Gnome 3 was no good.

1308
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,640
It just was no good.

1309
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,080
And it has gotten a lot better.

1310
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:19,160
And now our tone, our coverage of Gnome has changed to reflect that.

1311
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,460
It's just kind of natural if you think about it.

1312
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,460
It's not that weird.

1313
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,920
It just, it doesn't, it's just kind of, it's not a fanboy thing.

1314
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,480
It's just action speak louder than words.

1315
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,200
I'm teasing it off a lot, Wimpy.

1316
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,320
What process are we about to go through right now?

1317
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,320
Right.

1318
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:33,320
Okay.

1319
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:37,120
So everyone probably knows that's listening to this, that Ubuntu MATE 14.10 was released

1320
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:43,880
a couple of weeks ago and we've been preparing an Ubuntu MATE 14.04 release and I'm actually

1321
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,280
ready to go through the keystrokes to release it live now.

1322
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:52,280
So we're going to release the latest version, which is based on 14.04 right here on air.

1323
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,280
That's right.

1324
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,280
Let's do it.

1325
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,280
Right here on air.

1326
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,280
Okay.

1327
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:02,280
So I've got my terminator sessions open and I've logged into my two digital ocean build

1328
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,280
servers.

1329
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,880
This is where I prepare the ISO images.

1330
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:10,160
I've already prepared the images and I'm going to run the release scripts and the release

1331
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:16,000
scripts build the WebC torrents, actually make the ISOs from the squash FS, add the

1332
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,120
assets from the official Ubuntu CD releases, and then I'll sync them to my distribution

1333
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,120
servers.

1334
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,080
So let's do that now.

1335
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:29,080
So off we go.

1336
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,240
Right.

1337
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,840
So that's the power of digital ocean.

1338
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:37,120
That's just shunted six gigabytes of data.

1339
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,120
Really?

1340
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,120
Wow.

1341
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:46,760
We'll now just edit the release flag on the article.

1342
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:52,440
Now we'll run the deploy script.

1343
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,440
This is so exciting.

1344
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,440
I know, right?

1345
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,440
I know.

1346
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,920
This is actually the geekiest thing I think we've ever done on the show and I love it.

1347
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,600
So the deploy script basically takes all the markdown that the site is generated from and

1348
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,560
turns it into HTML.

1349
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,560
So that's done.

1350
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:17,160
So now I go to my CDN and I prefetch all of those images into the CDN and that's done.

1351
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:25,080
And now I purge the blog index from my cloud flaring and that just makes sure that the

1352
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:31,200
updates go through and I think we're done.

1353
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,040
So you just witnessed an operating system being released live.

1354
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,320
So you pushed the whole website and everything in that.

1355
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,320
Yeah.

1356
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,320
There you go.

1357
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:43,880
So if you go to Ubuntu mate.org slash blog, the article that you'll see now is the release

1358
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:44,880
notes on the article.

1359
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:51,440
So if you go to Ubuntu mate.org slash download, yes, that should redirect I think because

1360
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,200
there's two bits in there.

1361
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,200
You know what, Wimpy?

1362
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,200
You just earned yourself...

1363
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,200
Very nice, sir.

1364
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,200
Very nice.

1365
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,200
Thank you very much.

1366
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,200
Thank you very much.

1367
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:07,840
Let's stop talking about the future for a second and let's talk about something I think

1368
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,480
most desktop Linux users who bounce around desktop environments have experienced.

1369
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:17,360
You ever seen this problem where you got an application and it has a little system tray

1370
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:25,160
icon and maybe that particular developer decided, I don't want to implement the app indicator

1371
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,160
support for Ubuntu.

1372
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,640
So when you're in Ubuntu's Unity desktop, you don't get an icon up in the right hand

1373
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,640
corner.

1374
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,760
But when you're in KDE, you do get the icon and know maybe it's hit and miss.

1375
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,240
You've seen this kind of thing, right?

1376
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,240
Oh, absolutely.

1377
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,240
Absolutely.

1378
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,840
And it's something I've definitely experienced, but it also colors based on the level of difficulty

1379
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,040
which direction I'm going to go through.

1380
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,040
Sure.

1381
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:50,200
Because I've certainly had that experience both in Unity and KDE, less in Gnome.

1382
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,280
But yeah, it's certainly happened.

1383
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,280
Sure.

1384
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,960
And see, I feel like I've had more success in like almost all of the little tray icons

1385
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,200
show up in KDE.

1386
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:02,360
It's totally hit and miss in Unity and Gnome's gotten a lot better about it, but it's still

1387
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,760
hit and miss in Gnome.

1388
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:09,360
And this itty bitty tiny bit of fragmentation was introduced when a couple of different

1389
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:13,480
desktops decided to implement or really one desktop decided to implement app indicators

1390
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,440
differently than the other desktops.

1391
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,160
And even today, years later, we still get that wrong.

1392
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,640
And let's be clear for what it is.

1393
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,640
It looks like amateur hour.

1394
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,040
It looks pathetic.

1395
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:29,920
It's something that the Mac OS or Chrome OS or Windows would never get wrong and does

1396
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,320
not ever get wrong.

1397
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,000
It looks ridiculous.

1398
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,260
And I think we have to be clear when we're having this conversation that this type of

1399
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:42,960
little itty bitty fragmentation has much wider ramifications than how people appreciate and

1400
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,160
experience a desktop.

1401
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,560
And this as I'm going to use this example because it's something we can all relate to

1402
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,360
and then we're going to look at the larger ramifications of the fragmentation at the

1403
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,360
display server level.

1404
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,280
But what I want us all to think about as we are moving forward in this conversation is

1405
01:13:55,280 --> 01:14:00,560
look at the future directory of Linux of desktop Linux, quote unquote, desktop Linux competition,

1406
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,760
because it's not Windows.

1407
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,000
It might be Windows today.

1408
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,080
It might be Windows for the next few years.

1409
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:09,080
But five, 10 years down the road on the high end, it's Mac OS 10.

1410
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,720
On the low end, it's Chrome OS and Android.

1411
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:17,200
And those desktops would never be caught dead with that kind of amateur hour implementation.

1412
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,600
That was not going to happen.

1413
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,680
And that is our competition.

1414
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:23,840
If you look at the forward directory of the trajectory of the desktop market, that's who

1415
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,960
we're competing against.

1416
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:31,120
And those platforms, specifically Android, Chrome OS and Mac OS 10 already have a worldwide

1417
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:35,160
distribution system with massive amounts of momentum behind them.

1418
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:38,600
They have stores in almost every country around the world.

1419
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,840
You can order online.

1420
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,680
They have a brand image around them.

1421
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,360
And that's what future Linux is going to be competing with.

1422
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,360
That's what we're competing with.

1423
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,460
And we are not even bringing our A game.

1424
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:50,920
We're not even we're not even doing a very good job with our current setup.

1425
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:55,520
And now we're about to introduce fragmentation at the core level of the desktop that we have

1426
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:01,800
A, never had fragmentation before, and B, are fundamentally under resourced to properly

1427
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,160
develop it as it is.

1428
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:08,880
The X team already split to have one team work on X11 and one team work on Wayland.

1429
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,020
Well think about this.

1430
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:14,120
What if Ubuntu in some parallel universe had decided to go with Wayland?

1431
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:17,280
That would mean millions of more users banging on Wayland.

1432
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,760
That would mean more bug fixes, more refinement at a higher pace to Wayland, making that core

1433
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,840
part of the Linux desktop experience more refined, more tested, more performant.

1434
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,940
All of these things that matter, especially as game developers are moving over to Linux.

1435
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,740
But instead, we are splitting our resource.

1436
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:31,740
We are splitting our attention.

1437
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,960
We are splitting our testing.

1438
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,440
We're splitting our development time.

1439
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:38,040
And at the same time, we're introducing all kinds of fragmentation that developers are

1440
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,300
going to have to account for.

1441
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,160
Because here's how humans work, right?

1442
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,340
You're going to have your distribution.

1443
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:43,540
You're going to develop on that.

1444
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,720
It's either going to be a Wayland based distribution or a Mir based distribution.

1445
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,840
And whatever it is, that's the one you're going to properly test on because that's the

1446
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,800
one you use, and that's the one that the features are going to work correctly on.

1447
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,680
When I go to the next track in Clementine, whichever distro display server the Clementine

1448
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:02,680
developer is using for, that's the one I need to use if I want the next track onscreen notification.

1449
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,640
And that's even more amateur hour.

1450
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:09,160
We are introducing a level of fragmentation at the core of Linux that will mean that applications

1451
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,920
are even more hit and miss now in what they feature.

1452
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,700
Does this application have a screenshot button?

1453
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:14,700
Maybe it does.

1454
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:15,700
Maybe it doesn't.

1455
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:16,700
It depends on what desktop you're on.

1456
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:17,700
Do you get an onscreen display?

1457
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,700
Maybe you do.

1458
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,700
Maybe you don't.

1459
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,700
Maybe you don't care.

1460
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,200
Because if you only want to use Unity for the rest of your life, then Mir is going to

1461
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,200
work great for you.

1462
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,120
But if you ever want to use Ubuntu with another distribution, well you better learn how to

1463
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,400
install Wayland.

1464
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,480
You better figure out, this is going to be an explosion in blog posts on how to load

1465
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,500
Wayland on Ubuntu desktops.

1466
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:38,480
Because everybody out there that wants to use anything but Unity ever is going to need

1467
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,280
to learn how to install Wayland on their Ubuntu machine.

1468
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,060
And that's another reason why you should care.

1469
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,520
The reasons stack up.

1470
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:49,760
And this, these very issues, these fundamental issues are exactly the kind of thing that

1471
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:50,760
affect users.

1472
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:54,220
So why I might not care if it's Mir or Wayland, I sure as hell care if my application doesn't

1473
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,220
work correctly.

1474
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:58,000
I sure as hell care if I have to spend an hour figuring out how to install Wayland on

1475
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,400
my Ubuntu install so that way I can try out Gnome 3 whatever.

1476
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,280
It does absolutely affect users.

1477
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,600
It fundamentally affects users.

1478
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,800
I think it also slows down adoption in a very serious way.

1479
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,800
Big time.

1480
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,880
Yeah, and that's the piece that I see the biggest.

1481
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:17,320
Because at the end of the day, granted, I fall back to my old, the market will sort

1482
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:18,600
it out and it will.

1483
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,520
But we shouldn't have to sort it out in the first place.

1484
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:24,960
I mean, that's the big piece of it right there is that we're spending unneeded time sorting

1485
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,600
this out when it shouldn't have been an issue in the first place at all.

1486
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,600
Right.

1487
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,600
And it's going to get sorted, but it's going to be like a 10 year process.

1488
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,760
Developers are always like, oh, Linux is too fragmented.

1489
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,080
I don't know what I should target.

1490
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:38,200
This just changes the equation even more.

1491
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:42,440
You look at how 3D games capture the mouse pointer.

1492
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:46,640
That's going to be different between desktops or display environments.

1493
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,660
Game developers are going to have to think about this kind of stuff.

1494
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:52,860
And the other thing is, you know, from my old contracting background, and Aaron touches

1495
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:54,680
on this in his post and I thought it was really well done.

1496
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:58,580
He says, think about it from an IT support perspective, right?

1497
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:04,060
You already get people like, I had several clients that had Linux on the desktop.

1498
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:08,240
And you know, the problems would always arise if one person was on one distro and another

1499
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,720
person was another distro.

1500
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,180
One person would have something work.

1501
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,320
Another person wouldn't.

1502
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,400
And then it would be, oh, well, you need the build utils.

1503
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,060
Well, what's that called on Fedora?

1504
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,060
What's that called on Ubuntu?

1505
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:21,560
I mean, it's already the diversity that we have there, while in some ways it strengthens

1506
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:25,720
and empowers Linux, it also from a support standpoint is already too complicated.

1507
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,760
Well, that's what's just going to happen when the display server changes.

1508
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:33,560
Currently, as Aaron writes, guides and manuals covering Linux can assume that Xorg is running

1509
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,880
and other troubleshooting tips with that assumption can be in place.

1510
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,400
This is also one reason why the Linux world is standardizing on system D is such a good

1511
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,400
thing.

1512
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,120
Support will become easier when we don't have to ask, are you using system with system

1513
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,320
5 in it, system 7 in it, system D, Upstart?

1514
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,800
You just have to start troubleshooting at that level.

1515
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,440
Multiple display systems will produce a similar result.

1516
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:58,660
In commercial settings, this also translates to more cost, particularly to companies who

1517
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:02,300
provide professional IT support for companies running desktop systems.

1518
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,560
Does this matter to users?

1519
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:08,480
Well, it means less clear documentation, more difficult support for Linux and higher commercial

1520
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,480
support costs.

1521
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,280
So yes, I would argue that matters to users.

1522
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:17,320
And man, did that resonate with me because I have been, I have watched Linux go from

1523
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:21,800
the ha ha ha joke when I recommend it to, yeah, let's implement Linux, right?

1524
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,120
And I have been advocating the deployment of Linux in businesses for years and I was

1525
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:30,320
already feeling the pushback from like my doctor clients all wanted Macs and all my

1526
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,000
doctors wanted to get Macs.

1527
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,560
And I really, it is, you know, as soon as that support argument is brought up, my arguments

1528
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:41,760
are clearly deflated because how do you compete with Apple stores everywhere?

1529
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,580
How do you compete with a, you know, a warranty in writing and a system that's honestly less

1530
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,580
of a moving target?

1531
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,480
It's really hard for me to fight against that.

1532
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,480
Yep.

1533
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:53,120
It's a unified experience that I don't, even if we go system D, we go Wayland, we go the

1534
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,120
whole thing.

1535
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,000
We still don't have a unified experience.

1536
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,840
We don't at any level.

1537
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,900
And it's happening at a time where we could be coalescing around Wayland.

1538
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,000
We could be coalescing around system D, right?

1539
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,240
And these are major coalitions that could be happening.

1540
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,240
And he says, go ahead.

1541
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:13,240
I was going to say, if they get those two and they get the packaging figured out, you

1542
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,240
know, Bob's your uncle.

1543
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,240
You're good.

1544
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,080
Those three things together would do wonders.

1545
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:20,440
Aaron points out, you know, this matters to display systems.

1546
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:24,280
One thing free software does not have is enough of its graphic developers.

1547
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,360
With Xorg, there were exactly one place you could contribute to if you wanted to push

1548
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:31,160
forward the display stack on a free software operating system, such as Linux.

1549
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,740
Then Mir came along and introduced a split in the developer community, which means fewer

1550
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:39,960
human resources applied to a topic that really needs every single pair of hands we have.

1551
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,480
Instead of one system that as good as we can make it, we'll end up with a slower development

1552
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:47,620
of two systems with the risk of more of them being less than great.

1553
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:51,640
And I think this part could be argued because you could say good competition spurs good

1554
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,640
innovation.

1555
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:58,520
But at the same time, if you're familiar with the core X development, you know how bad that

1556
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:02,920
situation is and how much we do need all hands on deck for that kind of thing.

1557
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:06,200
And you know, Aaron points out this is obviously no minor task.

1558
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:12,040
Mir was originally promised to be the display system of choice and desktop Ubuntu in 2013-10.

1559
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:16,600
Then it was pushed back to 2014-04, and now it's pushed out to 2016-04.

1560
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:20,520
This is not a trivial sort of project, and making it harder by limiting human resources

1561
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,400
available is unwise.

1562
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:26,960
And I think what we fall back on too often, and I think something we can chant, there's

1563
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,760
a couple of things we chant a lot in the Linux community.

1564
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,640
Well, yeah, maybe KDE isn't making you happy, but you know what, it's great because you

1565
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:34,640
got choice.

1566
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:38,200
Well, that choice is not all that great if none of the choices are awesome.

1567
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,720
So but you know, Saigo says he's hopeful.

1568
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,360
He says, I do hold out hope.

1569
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,720
The free software community is speaking with a singular voice, and that voice is saying

1570
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,560
after X, it's Wayland.

1571
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,940
Wayland itself is still being worked on and has reached a level of maturity that allows

1572
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,560
real world use.

1573
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,400
Several of the major desktop products are well on their way of supporting it as a first

1574
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,160
class option, including Plasma by KDE, Gnome Shell, and Enlightenment.

1575
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,440
All the major toolkits upstream have support for Wayland today, and Wayland has the broadest

1576
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,840
driver support next only to X itself.

1577
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:07,840
So that's a good point to be made.

1578
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,840
So he's a little hopeful.

1579
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,360
And he goes on to say, the Mir team keeps bringing up these topics, although so does

1580
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,360
the KDE team.

1581
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,440
What's up?

1582
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,680
But he says maybe they need to defend their position, so does the KDE team.

1583
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:23,040
I can emphasize with how, how they, how, how, I don't want to repeat what he's saying here,

1584
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:26,040
but what he says is, I can emphasize that they are working on something they truly believe

1585
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,680
in, and they're being told it's the wrong thing to do.

1586
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:32,480
He says, I feel it is their right to develop Mir at their heart's content, and I cheer

1587
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:33,480
their moxie.

1588
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:37,880
Similarly, it is our right as developers and users to choose what to support and what not

1589
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:38,880
to.

1590
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,200
Such decision making is aided by having an accurate and complete information, and it's

1591
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,200
with that goal in mind that I wrote the post above.

1592
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:48,400
I thought this was a great post, because I think what we are entering into is an era

1593
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:52,800
of unprecedented fragmentation in the graphical space for Linux.

1594
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,160
And I want to, and I, and I, I want to reel it back in here, because I'm pretty upset

1595
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:02,160
about this, the more I think about this, because what I see this potentially as, is I see this

1596
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:07,680
as, I don't want to use the words I'm thinking of, but the,

1597
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:11,440
Is this a politically correct version, maybe?

1598
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:19,720
Well, it is, it is hobbling desktop applications in order to push forward the Ubuntu agenda.

1599
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:25,960
I don't believe we can, we have already seen Unity itself introduce a level of fragmentation

1600
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,880
that is below commercial desktops, that would be intolerable for commercial desktops.

1601
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:34,000
We have already seen that frag, we've already seen the play out of that.

1602
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:39,400
So when you introduce some fundamental stuff at the, at the display server level, you either

1603
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,520
have two options as a developer.

1604
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:46,200
You try to target both main display servers, and one of those targets is probably not going

1605
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,940
to be as optimal as the other, or you simply ignore one altogether.

1606
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:53,520
In either scenario, users lose.

1607
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:57,480
So if you don't care about what display server you're using, then you probably ought to stop

1608
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:01,600
using Linux, because at the, at the end of the day, this is going to fundamentally change

1609
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,520
how the application landscape looks on Linux.

1610
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:08,280
And even if it is just one application has an on-screen display on one display server

1611
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:13,440
and doesn't on the other, that is enough to have me upset, because that is unacceptable.

1612
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,800
It is not good enough.

1613
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,520
And I want the most kick-ass display server possible.

1614
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,440
We have the most kick-ass kernel possible.

1615
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:23,000
How about we get the rest of the stack as kick-ass as we can?

1616
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,360
And to sabotage a display server like this for one company's personal gain in a mobile

1617
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:31,340
market that is not likely to be tremendously successful anyways, feels awfully selfish

1618
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:32,340
to me right now.

1619
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:36,940
Well, you know, I honestly, and I think even Valve will be included in this, I don't think

1620
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:40,400
anyone's going to give a ripping rat's butt about Mir one way or the other going forward.

1621
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,400
I really don't.

1622
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:46,320
I think just from the backyard developer guy who's doing this in his boxer shorts down

1623
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,560
to the multi-billion dollar corporation, I don't, I think they're going to look at

1624
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:53,120
this fundamentally and be like, you know, honestly, uh, I'm going to go whichever

1625
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:57,460
way the community is going, whichever way the draw, uh, you know, the video card vendors

1626
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,320
are going, whichever way direction they're headed, basically it's a numbers game.

1627
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:05,360
And so I think this potentially, I'm hoping I'm right on this, that this could work itself

1628
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,680
out fairly early on.

1629
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,360
I'm hoping the more I think about it, the more I think that it's a, you know, look,

1630
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,640
I mean, it's definitely early days.

1631
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,680
And I think something I wanted to kind of kick around to the mumble room is maybe abstraction

1632
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,680
can solve it.

1633
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:22,000
Cause we're all looking at this with today's set of problems and today's set of tools to

1634
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
solve this problem.

1635
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Sure.

1636
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,280
And I think also, you know, uh, something that Martin and Aaron were trying to make

1637
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,260
the pushes is developers are users too.

1638
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:33,680
And in fact, I think developers make up a good user base of Linux, right?

1639
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,840
I think that's probably who a lot of the develop users are, are developers.

1640
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,920
So by impacting developers, you are impacting the users of Linux.

1641
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,000
And I think you're going to, that's it.

1642
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,120
That's a segment that's going to continue to outgrow any other segment of Linux usage.

1643
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,760
But I don't, anybody in the mumble room want to take a first shot at this?

1644
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,920
Is this a, is this a problem that future Chris and Matt aren't even going to have to worry

1645
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:52,920
about?

1646
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,640
Can I ask you a question, Chris?

1647
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,240
Go for it, puppy.

1648
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:05,000
What's the single most used display server on Linux right now, as in, in most, in most

1649
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
deployments?

1650
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Xorg?

1651
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
No.

1652
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,080
Surface Flinger on Android in way more deployments than anything else.

1653
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:15,080
Wayland, Mir, or Xorg?

1654
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,080
Hmm.

1655
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,080
Good trick question, Popey.

1656
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,080
That was a good one.

1657
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:24,960
Surface Flinger is the display server on Android.

1658
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:30,720
Nobody seems to have told them that they can't have their own internal project for a display

1659
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:34,840
server, which is used on millions of devices.

1660
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:35,840
But the difference there...

1661
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,880
Why do we get, why do we get that flag?

1662
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,360
But isn't the difference there, those are, but that's a, that's sort of, in a sense,

1663
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,120
a whole cloth creation, right?

1664
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:48,560
Where it's a whole new ecosystem with a whole new set of apps that are designed for that

1665
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,560
system.

1666
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:50,560
But on the Linux side...

1667
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,560
Just like Ubuntu 5.

1668
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:52,560
Yeah, exactly.

1669
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,920
Well, if anything, the most biggest problem is it's a whole different paradigm compared

1670
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,560
to our legacy or at least what everything else has ever been.

1671
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,720
I mean, I think Popey makes a good point, but I think that, I think the, the subtle

1672
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:08,760
difference is that you only have to target Surface Flinger on Android.

1673
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,760
All right.

1674
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,840
So when you're making your Android apps, it's not really something that even has to be a

1675
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:12,840
consideration, but on...

1676
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,840
No, you don't.

1677
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:14,840
You don't.

1678
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:18,320
Because the stack, that's abstracted away from you in exactly the same way that Robert

1679
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:23,040
and Robert Carr have both blogged about that stuff is abstracted away from you by the toolkit.

1680
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:27,400
You would disagree then with the assertion that Cygo and Martin are making that it's

1681
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,640
not quite as abstract as everyone would like.

1682
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:34,680
No, I'm suggesting that there are certain edge cases where you need to know about the

1683
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,120
underlying fundamental bits and pieces.

1684
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:43,000
And yeah, a screenshot tool is a real easy shooting fish in a barrel, you know, one to

1685
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,080
pick because it obviously needs interaction with the display server.

1686
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:53,100
But there are way more applications out there than there are screenshot tools.

1687
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:56,860
And there are way more developers out there developing tools with toolkits, which will

1688
01:27:56,860 --> 01:28:02,040
just work on these display servers and won't have this problem.

1689
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:06,280
So you say the canonical has the amount of influence and power that Google has when it

1690
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:10,920
comes to the mobile marketplace is just a little bit of a excessive state.

1691
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,440
Did I say that?

1692
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:17,160
When it comes to comparing surface slinger to mirror a little bit.

1693
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,720
No, you didn't.

1694
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,840
All I'm suggesting is that it's not actually important.

1695
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:28,480
All I'm suggesting is that it's entirely possible for someone to come up with a display server

1696
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:34,680
on Linux which isn't Wayland and isn't X and for them to deploy that to a large number

1697
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:40,320
of handsets around the world and it work and for application developers to do their work

1698
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:44,640
on top of that and not really care that it's surface fling underneath and not Xorg or Wayland

1699
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,640
or whatever.

1700
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:50,840
So I think the fundamental disagreement I see here is one side thinks that it's really

1701
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:55,760
not going to be that big of a ramifications for developers or application functionality

1702
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,920
and another side seems to disagree with that position.

1703
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:05,560
The surface area of mobile is also far smaller in a way that it's very specific.

1704
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:12,040
Its kernel is predefined other than the Cyanogen mods or whatever personally built mods that

1705
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,040
Android has.

1706
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:17,360
Otherwise the desktop is very, very different.

1707
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:20,000
There's a lot more ambiguity.

1708
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,520
And it's a lot harder to do which is one of the reasons why Mir hasn't landed in the desktop.

1709
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,880
It's kind of the point you mentioned that if it comes down to here's a toolkit you can

1710
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:34,400
use to build your app and it would guarantee it'll work, that works but that's not a model

1711
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,840
that Linux is typically gone with before.

1712
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,760
I think their argument is no toolkit is actually that comprehensive.

1713
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:46,840
There's bugs or there's just gaps in what it's capable of providing that eventually

1714
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,640
in a special case of Unity pretty much only.

1715
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:55,640
I think their argument is eventually you have to close a few gaps and when you do that you

1716
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:58,600
got to write directly to the display server, you can't write to the toolkit.

1717
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:05,440
And I think the concept of a perfect toolkit is sort of like a dream but I don't think

1718
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:08,720
we've ever in the history of computing achieved the perfect toolkit.

1719
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:15,080
No, and I agree there are going to be holes in every toolkit and there are bits that we're

1720
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:19,480
going to have to do at the plumbing layer and components that we're going to have to

1721
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:22,320
provide that won't be provided by Qt.

1722
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:28,360
We know that and we're building those as we go and yes it's a bit of a learning exercise

1723
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:36,520
for us as well but I don't think the criticism is necessary.

1724
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:41,160
I don't think it's as warranted as some might think.

1725
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:45,720
In some ways it feels like okay, right, we've got them to switch to system D, right, what's

1726
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,720
next?

1727
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,720
Oh yes, me.

1728
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,720
Let's have a go at them about that.

1729
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:52,760
Let's see if we can get them to change that one now.

1730
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:59,200
I guess what I'm worried about is I'm worried that wishful thinking is influencing that

1731
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:03,920
thinking because in an ideal world I think that's too ideal and I think the history of

1732
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:09,040
specifically desktop Linux shows us that things are very fluid and things are never quite

1733
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:14,320
as great as we want them to be and the idealism usually gives away a little bit of pragmatism

1734
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:20,080
and I think at the end of the day there's a lot of bets on things kind of coming together

1735
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,960
at the right time to make all of this work.

1736
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:31,240
I think Ubuntu's time is coming to an end soon because I mean they've been alienating

1737
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:38,840
and alienating the user base so much over the years with Unity, with Mirror, with...

1738
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:45,840
Yeah I don't know about that, I hear that a lot Riley, but the thing is you can't discount

1739
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,120
the massive cloud deployment that Ubuntu has which will naturally push a lot of developers

1740
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,840
and sysadmins to want to run Ubuntu.

1741
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:57,680
I mean they're doing really great there and I think also, I think let's look at it from

1742
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,320
an alternate perspective.

1743
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:05,920
What if we fast forward three years down the road or 2016 or whatever it is where we have

1744
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:10,520
like this great Qt based desktop which I think a lot of us think Qt has a strong future ahead

1745
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:11,520
of it.

1746
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:16,040
You know maybe this is a little bit further down the road but it's sitting on top of SystemD.

1747
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:18,200
The only piece that has a lot of questions is how is...

1748
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:24,240
I think what people are really worried about is the fragmentation being introduced at such

1749
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,240
a critical layer.

1750
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:29,040
I mean we can all argue about package names and how they're different between all distributions

1751
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:32,800
or the locations of certain libraries and how they can be different or where the config

1752
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,360
goes can be different.

1753
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:40,680
But we as a user base and as developers have never had to worry about that display layer.

1754
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:46,600
I mean yes it's gotten old and its time has come to be replaced but at the same time it

1755
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:52,240
has been at least a consistent thing not just across Linux but also across Linux and the

1756
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:53,240
BSDs.

1757
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:57,720
It is a consistent aspect for software development when you're targeting these systems that is

1758
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:59,920
now no longer going to be consistent.

1759
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:06,500
And I think you cannot undersell that except for that other platform that you keep forgetting

1760
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:09,800
about that has more deployments than all of those.

1761
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:14,960
Well I mean there is a reality to that but I'm very focused on the actual desktop aspect

1762
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,160
of Linux and maybe you know down the road I mean we're already seeing more and more

1763
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,280
laptops that are shipping with Android.

1764
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,800
I just recently saw a post for a full-fledged desktop with a keyboard, mouse and monitor

1765
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,840
running Android.

1766
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,960
So I mean you know it could be a fair point that again we don't know what the future has

1767
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:36,800
ahead of us but right now I'm really focused on you know making my desktop version of Linux

1768
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:43,160
better than ever and I'm really worried that if we cock this up and if we get this wrong

1769
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:49,320
at this critical time with new types of companies getting on board and making great products

1770
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:53,740
but also all of the desktop environments are getting to the point now where they're so

1771
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:58,000
good that it's these little things that bug us like the indicators and all this kind of

1772
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,840
stuff we're really getting to a good point and if we kind of screw this up I just Android

1773
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,280
and Chrome OS and and the Mac are gonna eat us alive.

1774
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,280
It's been a lot of fun having the spirited conversations.

1775
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,520
I think one of the things I love about Popeyes is always willing to have a great spirited

1776
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:16,040
conversation and then we have a laugh at the end of it.

1777
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:18,720
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1778
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:23,200
Linux Unplugged for me over 2014 has changed a bit and I really like where it's gone.

1779
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:26,880
It's become a place to openly talk about issues that we as Linux users experience.

1780
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,080
It's a place for Linux users to talk about this stuff.

1781
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:34,640
It's one part talk show maybe one part counseling a little bit and also we get those surprisingly
