00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 11 for October 22nd, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,560
Hi, everyone, and welcome to Linux Unplugged, Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly Linux talk show

3
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,880
that's writing checks our mouth can't cash, but we push on anyways.

4
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,120
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
My name is Matt.

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
Hey there, Matt.

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Episode 11, buddy.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
Look at us.

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
Already.

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
All in a row, too.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,840
Now, who knows, because we're coming up to those wily holidays.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,300
You never know what could happen.

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,300
This is true.

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,700
So people have to prepare themselves now.

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,360
So coming up on this week's show of Unplugged, I want to talk about something that's been

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,880
bothering me for at least a year, in fact, since November of 2012, to tell you the truth.

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,160
I could tell you exactly when, but as the Linux action show has gone on, we have gotten

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,300
a really good snapshot of what the Linux news looks like every single week for over the

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:23,200
last seven years, and there's been a change in tone, in quality, in amount, all of it.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,600
Linux news has gone bankrupt, and I want to talk about it on today's Linux Unplugged because

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,800
I think it's something that, because open source is done in the open, because it is

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,320
such a community effort, I believe the dialogue around open source plays an extremely critical

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,920
role in future development and in perception, and then that plays into participation and

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,920
all these things.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
So I think it has very, very large and wide-reaching ramifications.

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,160
So I'll talk about that today.

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,040
But you know, Matt, as is tradition, because this is a very community-involved show, I

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,680
want to get into the follow-up, and a couple of things.

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Oh, I can imagine.

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,720
Oh yes, let the beatings begin.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,800
I know, I know, you know, the Linux game cast, they call this section the hate mail.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,160
We do have a little hate mail today, but first I want to correct, oh actually, first I want

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
to do a thank you.

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,720
So let's start off on a positive note.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
All right.

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Integros.

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,760
In fact, the good folks over at Integros came out in full force to reach out after we talked

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,960
about them in the spotlight on Sunday on the Linux Action Show.

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,400
We had a visitor in our subreddit who answered some technical questions and also corrected

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,080
a mistake I made.

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,200
Their installer looks a lot like Ubiquiti from Ubuntu's installer, but it is actually

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,760
their own custom-done installer.

43
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,040
Oh, it is custom.

44
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
That's fantastic.

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,320
And you know, to defend myself, I made that assumption because I drilled into the GitHub

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:51,120
repo for their distro, went into the installer code, and I saw references to Ubiquiti.sh

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,040
and a screenshots folder that had Zubuntu screenshots in it.

48
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,980
So I thought, there's a good chance this is based on Ubiquiti because it looks like Ubiquiti.

49
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,600
There's Ubiquiti names in here, but the developers said, well, we were just pulling in different

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,640
bits of code to try different things out, and we're in the process of cleaning things

51
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
up.

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Oh, okay.

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,880
Well, that makes more sense then.

54
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,240
And so I just wanted to make that correction and also a big thank you because then also

55
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,080
I was contacted on our IRC server, if you go to irc.geekshed.net, that's our IRC server,

56
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,720
and then pound jupyterbroadcasting is the room, Alex from Integros reached out to me

57
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,640
and answered a few questions I had, talked about a few upcoming things they have, provided

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,200
me with an example, in fact, I think I have it right here, let's see if this plays because

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
I have.

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,760
That's how you're supposed to say it.

61
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
He generated that for us.

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
How cool is that?

63
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,960
That is cool because I'm going to literally play that.

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,720
Every time I have to say it, I'm just going to hit that button.

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,560
Yeah, Integros, so I wanted to say a special thank you to them.

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,120
For those of you who don't know, Integros is a distro that's essentially straight up

67
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
Arch.

68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,840
They pull from the Arch repos, they have a small repo of their own where they pull certain

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,520
things in like art and other things.

70
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,560
They set up a very minimal set of defaults, I mean, super minimal, like I don't even think

71
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,200
there's a video player installed, and as it installs, it pulls down packages from the

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,040
Arch repo.

73
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,400
And if you want to try out like Cinnamon 2.0 or Gnome 3.10.1, it's a great way to go because

74
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
you can be up and running.

75
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,580
Now, a lot of people have had some hardware issues, but they're working on new features,

76
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,180
so we'll keep an eye on it.

77
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,180
It looks really promising.

78
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,680
I know I'm going to be checking into it.

79
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, it's cool of them to reach out to like that.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,480
They definitely went the extra mile.

81
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,680
And then one other thing, you know, I was talking, we did a review, just a few corrections

82
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
from last.

83
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,320
We did a review of the Synology DissStation 4 Bay Network Attached Storage, the DS412+.

84
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, yes.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,600
And I gave it a pretty glowing thumbs up, all in all, if you want to pay a premium for

86
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,960
a small, silent, you know, sort of pre-done appliance.

87
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,160
Basically awesome in a box.

88
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,440
I really liked it, Matt.

89
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,080
I mean, in fact, I bought one on Monday.

90
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
So I bought one yesterday.

91
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Oh, did you?

92
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Yeah, I did.

93
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,080
I just went ahead and I said, you know, I'm going to buy it.

94
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
And so I did.

95
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,560
However, there is one thing that I totally forgot to mention, and it's probably my main

96
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
con is it uses an external power supply.

97
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,360
And on top of that, it's got a real funky, you know, proprietary power adapter.

98
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Oh, does it?

99
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
Okay.

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,520
So that could make replacing it interesting.

101
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
Sure.

102
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,640
Now, to be honest, in this rig, I would actually suspect that the number one thing to fail

103
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,400
would either be a fan or the power supply.

104
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,200
And if it was the power supply and it's integrated, that kind of, you know, is more of a pain

105
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
in the butt.

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,160
Whereas if it's an external brick, you just replace that brick.

107
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,320
I don't like that the connector is proprietary, but I bet you I could buy an extra one and

108
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
have it in a drawer.

109
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,560
And if it ever popped on me, I bet I could just swap it out real quick.

110
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,760
I like the idea of having a spare.

111
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,000
I think that's a wise idea.

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I think you're right.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,600
I think the fan would be the probably the next thing to go or either or, sure.

114
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,720
And then it was pointed out on our subreddit that the fact, let me go look for it, because

115
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,240
they have a, I didn't even know this because I just didn't, I was never really going down

116
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,960
the route of looking at a Synology NAS until I was offered to review one.

117
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Their five drive unit, Heyo, five drives, how about that?

118
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,480
It has a built in power supply.

119
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,760
So if you want to go that route, it has the plug and then you don't have to have that

120
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,880
external adapter, but it's like a hundred bucks more.

121
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Right.

122
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Right.

123
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Oh, that's a good looking machine.

124
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Yeah.

125
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,480
They also have a $200 version that's a two drive unit or like a $300 unit.

126
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Oh yeah?

127
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,760
So it has all the same features as the one I have, but it's a few hundred dollars cheaper

128
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,920
because it's only takes two drive.

129
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,200
And if you just want a nice fast network attached storage with some mirrors that runs Linux,

130
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
you know, that'd be a good way to go.

131
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,240
I have it linked in last week's Linux action show.

132
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Just do me a favor and click that link.

133
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
So that way we get credit.

134
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Yeah.

135
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Right.

136
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
No kidding.

137
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,100
And I got to ask, what if it has all the same functionality and features you were showing

138
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,100
off?

139
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,520
I believe it has the same OS and everything.

140
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
Yeah.

141
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Yeah.

142
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
I like it.

143
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Right.

144
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Yeah.

145
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
All right.

146
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
So now you're ready for your, my bit, my hate mail is coming up.

147
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Yeah, absolutely.

148
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Let's get it over with.

149
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
All right.

150
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,040
So John writes in, he says, greetings, Chris and Matt.

151
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,240
One of the common things I hear from Matt is if you don't like a distro, use something

152
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,800
else, which always makes me cringe just a little.

153
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,000
I realize that he's addressing the functional aspect of a distro, but I think the relational

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,560
aspect is also very important as Chris had recently, Linux distros are a type of art

155
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,520
and they're an evolving art, kind of like a movie franchise.

156
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,220
So Ubuntu doing something stupid is a bit like Hollywood bastardizing some franchise

157
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,640
that you loved with an unnecessary reboot, but it being told, why don't you care?

158
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Just don't watch it.

159
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,160
Sort of, I guess, maybe like the new Star Trek series.

160
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,320
Part of being in the Linux community to me is having some kind of attachment as hobbies

161
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
often have.

162
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,440
For me personally, I'm aware that if Ubuntu does something I don't like, I can hop to

163
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,440
another distro, but hearing it as the first response to a criticism sounds like just giving

164
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,100
Ubuntu a free pass.

165
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Just my two cents.

166
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,800
Thanks for the shows and keep up the good work.

167
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Not Brian T.

168
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,840
I think it's a valid point in that, well first I would actually clarify one thing that just

169
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,040
because I say don't use it doesn't mean I think it's awesome or that I'm acknowledging

170
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,920
that I think it's something we should just overlook or excuse.

171
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,880
I'm simply pointing out factually, and I'm going to throw out another one that's going

172
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,940
to irritate you guys.

173
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,120
If you ever tried to herd cats, it doesn't work.

174
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,920
Wait, did I just call up John O'Bacon?

175
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,320
What's going on over here?

176
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,900
But yeah, no seriously, if you ever tried to herd cats, there's certain limitations

177
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,900
to what you can do.

178
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,480
I'm talking with distributions and the people that design them and run them.

179
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,360
You have limited control, and so you have a choice.

180
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,560
You can either focus on that negativity or you can say, wow, I'm not really into this,

181
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,480
so I'm going to go participate in something that I am into.

182
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,160
It legitimately comes down to that.

183
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:38,240
I hate to play this card, but I think it's also the perspective of somebody who's got

184
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,600
a few years on not Brian T.

185
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,760
Because as you start to get a little, even in your mid-30s, you start to think, God,

186
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,080
I have a limited amount of even energy to devote to anything.

187
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,000
In my 20s, I would have been probably right there with him with a sign in my hand.

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,520
I could totally see myself doing this.

189
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,440
However, at the same time, I also acknowledge when I have issues with the new Star Trek

190
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,360
movie, I would not want to be told, well, just don't watch it.

191
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,800
I'm like, no, no, you don't understand Star Trek.

192
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
It's Star Trek.

193
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
You don't understand.

194
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
That would be my response.

195
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,640
I do see where he's coming from on that.

196
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,080
I guess it's almost not healthy, though.

197
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:26,040
It's almost not healthy to place your personal self-happiness onto an external entity like

198
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
that.

199
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,660
That's basically my message in that I'm not discounting the fact that you shouldn't be

200
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,080
bothered or even upset by something that is bugging you.

201
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,780
I'm not saying that, but you have X amount of energy to exhaust in a day, and you really

202
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,080
got to look at where you're putting that.

203
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,300
If it was me, and I'm really bent out of shape about what Ubuntu is doing, by God, I'm going

204
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,000
to put some effort into another distribution that I can get excited about and make it better

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,160
than the thing that I have a problem with, if I can.

206
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
That's just me.

207
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,580
I guess everybody's mileage is going to vary to that, but I think he brings up a valid

208
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,680
point because it's a valid concern that he has, and so I want to address that head on

209
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,800
and let him know that don't see it changing, but it's how I come from.

210
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,120
What you're also doing when you say that is you're reminding us that Linux is not Ubuntu

211
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,360
or Linux is not Fedora, Linux is not Unity, it's not Gnome.

212
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
It's a lot of things.

213
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,320
Be part of the market that helps decide what the direction of popularity is going to go.

214
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
That was the message of last week's episode.

215
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, it really was.

216
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,120
I definitely wouldn't poopoo his point because I think it's a valid point, but age definitely

217
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,440
plays a part into it.

218
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,080
The way I look at life compared to in my 20s compared to now at 40, just there's a lot

219
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,040
of factors, but I truly am trying very hard to remove as much negativity out of my life

220
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,600
as I can, and that's part of that process.

221
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,240
Yeah, and it is sort of like if something, and there is also sort of a zen-ness to if

222
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,680
something's bothering you, stop doing it.

223
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,640
It's like that old age old story.

224
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Every time I go to the doctor and I do this, hey doc, every time I move my leg like this

225
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,040
it hurts, and the doctor says, well stop moving your leg like that.

226
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,840
It's like Bob Newhart on Mad TV where he was doing therapy, and the entire therapy session

227
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,720
where he'd lean in real close and scream stop it to whoever was complaining about whatever

228
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,280
was ailing them, and that's really what it is.

229
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Yeah, it is.

230
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
It really is that simple.

231
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,040
All right, are you ready for my hate mail now?

232
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,920
This actually is probably more so the next one is actually more directed at me, but this

233
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,120
one starts with a name that's kind of hard, Adnan, A-D-N-A-N, Adnan, Adnan, let's go

234
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
with Adnan.

235
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,100
He says, hey guys, in last week's episode of the Ubuntu 13.10 review, you talked a lot

236
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,680
about rolling releases and how you missed that factor of innovation, latest features

237
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,780
from Ubuntu, especially from the last couple of releases, and how you found your peace

238
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,280
of mind in a rolling release such as Arch Linux.

239
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:44,660
Now I went with this one because we got a lot of emails about rolling release statements,

240
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,360
and I think maybe I came off as like you could only use rolling release, and if you don't

241
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
...

242
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
If you don't like rolling releases, go to hell or something's wrong with you or whatever.

243
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,960
What my argument was supposed to be was if you are technically comfortable, you can be

244
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,040
part of pushing the open source envelope forward by perhaps rolling on something a little more

245
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,160
cutting edge, a little more rolling, but it doesn't work for everybody.

246
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,720
However, I don't know, I didn't get that point across very well, and Adnan here points out

247
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,520
that one thing we don't really ever mention is the elephant in the room, and that is Debian.

248
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,920
I kind of feel like we do, but I wanted to give an honorable mention here.

249
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,040
He says, Debian testing, specifically the Jessie version, and unstable SID, which neither

250
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,700
is rolling in a full meaning of that word, but yet both branches still get rolling release

251
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,320
model where software is continually being developed and updated.

252
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,920
Thus, why couldn't Debian Jessie be everyone's perfect rolling release with its actual rolling

253
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,480
release until it becomes stable, quote, unquote?

254
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,120
If you think about it, Ubuntu became a rolling model of... Yeah, okay, so he goes on to

255
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,120
say that's essentially what Ubuntu did, yeah, and he says that Jessie can be a bleeding

256
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
edge distro.

257
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,260
Mentioning the 7.2 release in the last episode was a very nice gesture, but I'm sending this

258
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,680
email as a plea to provide your audience with more information and awareness about Debian

259
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,520
as perfectly portrayed from examples I used above.

260
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,520
Debian seems to be left out, even though it provides us all with the functionality and

261
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
features.

262
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Please inform me if you have any other questions or comments.

263
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Adnan.

264
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,160
I'm going to actually agree with him on that we don't talk about Debian enough.

265
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,120
I will actually completely agree with that, myself especially.

266
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm probably the biggest guilty party on that one, because we dance around Debian by talking

267
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,280
about all the derivatives, but we don't really talk about Debian specifically and its advantages

268
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
and disadvantages.

269
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,880
You know, my wife and I talk about the dishwasher a lot more than we talk about the foundation

270
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
of my house.

271
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,840
No, that's fair, but as a standalone distro, Debian does have a little something to offer

272
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,320
for those that want to go that route.

273
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,720
Now, that being said, we're not going to make an ongoing show about it.

274
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
That's not possible.

275
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
The Debian action show.

276
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Yeah.

277
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,200
So I think what we did just there really nails it.

278
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,280
I mean, it's like, this is an option you guys should check out.

279
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,760
You want an Ubuntu-like experience without the Ubuntu, give it a whirl.

280
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:56,920
Ubuntu, I mean, Debian is sort of, it's unbelievable in the sense that, so when I really first

281
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:04,680
started cutting my teeth on Linux, I worked at a school district and they have run systems,

282
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,020
you know, it was like, I guess what I'm trying to say is their IT department for a little

283
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,920
bit for me was like a time capsule, because I went back 10 years later, kind of like a

284
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,080
reunion at the time of my high school reunion, but instead I was like, I was going back to

285
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,840
that job to contract for three months and like I opened up the time capsule and what

286
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,360
I found was Debian systems that we had deployed that had just recently either been retired

287
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,020
or about to be retired, but like had been updated throughout the years and continued

288
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,020
to run.

289
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,400
I mean, it was, it was really like a, if you could do a long-term science experiment as

290
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,200
an IT guy, where you just like got grant funding to study something for 10 years.

291
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
It was like that for me.

292
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,800
I was like, holy crap, here it is.

293
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,240
In reality, here is, you know, the honest to God goodness of Debian just lasting this

294
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
entire time.

295
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,240
It was pretty cool.

296
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,520
So I think the long and short of it is that Debian is a great option if you want something

297
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,820
that you can install and honestly not think about ever again.

298
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,820
That's really it, you know.

299
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,820
Totally.

300
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,820
Yep.

301
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,340
I'm going to give you a ding for that, Matt, because I agree.

302
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,160
So now this next one.

303
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,560
Oh, also another good, another point that was made is by a few folks was that folks

304
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,240
in development shops, rolling releases are no good because if you, if you total, if you,

305
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,560
if like an enterprise, when you write software and then you certify it as something and then

306
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,080
you go to ship it, but the libraries change or something like that, that's a total, you

307
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,200
know, pulling the rug out from underneath the developers.

308
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,720
So they like to have, you know, totally snapshotted in time systems, although technologies like

309
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,320
Docker are alleviating.

310
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,520
I mean, so that's the other thing about this rolling release discussion is there are new

311
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,200
technologies coming out like virtual, well, not, not even coming out like virtualization

312
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:50,160
with snapshots and Docker and containers that sort of nullify some of the previous pains

313
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,640
with rolling releases.

314
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
And we'll just see where that goes.

315
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,360
I wonder if history won't prove me right in the long run because of these types of things

316
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,160
where you can isolate applications off into a safe environment.

317
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
I think so.

318
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,760
I think as things evolve with the virtualization technologies specifically, I think we'll eventually

319
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,200
hit that point to where it becomes a mood issue, but I'm not sure we're there yet.

320
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,760
I think there's still enough considerations that people need to really make an educated

321
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
decision.

322
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,280
So Jesse writes in, he says, uh, hello Chris and Matt.

323
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,520
I saw your recent Linux unplugged episode on your opinion about Ubuntu going to a rolling

324
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
release.

325
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,800
Only I have to completely disagree with all your points.

326
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,440
Last year I switched a few of my teachers to Linux Mint and most of us Linux Mint and

327
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,960
Ubuntu users don't know enough to fix our system if it crashed from an update in a release.

328
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,400
Now you remember one of the things I said is there is this fear of like, I need my distro

329
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,880
master to protect me.

330
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,360
And if I don't have the grand repo keeper checking every package before it hits the

331
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,400
repo, then I, you know, disaster is around the next update.

332
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
And I actually agreed on the whole point of it.

333
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Well, I'll get to that after the...

334
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
No, go ahead.

335
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
You can.

336
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,480
I was just going to basically point out, I said to be completely fair though, I actually

337
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,200
pointed out that it is different strokes for different folks.

338
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,480
There are use case scenarios to where it does not make sense to go rolling release.

339
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,880
Where Jesse's making the case right here.

340
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,760
He says most new Linux users don't want to spend time tweaking their computer to run

341
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,000
the way they like.

342
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,240
Most of them just install the distro and move over their data.

343
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,240
I hate doing this unless I'm re Linuxing, remastering.

344
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,440
Ubuntu is aiming for a new bus user base and rolling release would just turn them off.

345
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,320
Seems that you also forgot that corporate distros helped Linux get off the ground in

346
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
the nineties.

347
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,960
I personally don't care about pushing the envelope unless it's base packages.

348
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,600
Also I'm not very savvy and most Linux users are not either.

349
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,400
So where he says here that I hate where Ubuntu is aiming for a new bus user base.

350
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,800
I see people that take offense to that sometimes, but I do agree.

351
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,240
They're trying to, they're trying to do a wide spectrum.

352
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,600
They're doing a wide spectrum and also the whole corporate thing, the corporate stuff.

353
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,680
While I agree that, you know, it's an ancient thing.

354
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,440
A lot of people are using the long-term releases.

355
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,720
So for that, so that's a, that's a completely out of the argument already off the bat.

356
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,080
I think too, like, um, you couldn't, like you would, I think the best approach is sort

357
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,880
of the Debian and open Sousa approaches where you have your stable branch and here's your

358
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
rolling branch.

359
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,600
And that's really what I would want.

360
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,000
I mean, that's really how I think they should do it.

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,480
I think that absolutely, however they do a stable branches up to them and however they

362
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,280
make that work with the community, but have a stable branch, schools, corporations, nonprofits,

363
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,360
whatnot, or people just don't want something to update all the time.

364
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,680
And then of course, if you want a rolling release, that's available as well.

365
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,640
And that of course will then help with speedier development and less of the release party

366
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,480
and more of just getting it done.

367
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
All right.

368
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
All right.

369
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,280
Now watch out Matt, because now the flame throwers are fully focused on me.

370
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,080
Ben writes in, he says, Hey Chris, I love all the shows that Jupiter broadcasting, but

371
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,760
during the segment and episode 10 of Linux unplugged, you said you believe valve steam

372
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,960
OS is a sign of them not having confidence in Ubuntu as a desktop platform.

373
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,020
One thing I noticed that no one mentioned is that steam OS isn't necessarily meant for

374
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,640
desktop markets and pretty sure the point of steam OS is making an operating system

375
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,880
as optimized for TV and controller.

376
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,800
In addition for the desktop valve, probably just wants to provide users and OEMs an image

377
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,380
that they can throw onto boxes that start right up into big picture mode without the

378
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,280
overhead of a normal desktop OS.

379
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,800
Anyways, thanks for all the great shows, Ben.

380
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,920
Now we got a lot of emails to this that a lot of people did not agree that in fact,

381
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,880
here was another one.

382
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,280
Michael wrote and he said in the last show you voiced an opinion that valve's decision

383
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,480
to create steam OS was caused by a concern or lack of faith in Ubuntu.

384
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,040
I think we should look at it from valve's perspective.

385
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,280
Why should they say their new console will be running Ubuntu, even if it will?

386
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,400
It will not have an Ubuntu user interface, it will be a console.

387
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,800
You will get steam big picture interface and won't be encouraged to tweak with it.

388
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,880
For all purposes, consoles should be a black box to you.

389
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,320
There's no reason for telling anyone it's running Ubuntu, saying steam OS is also better

390
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,800
from a marketing point of view.

391
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,520
It sounds like something they created and tailored for their console.

392
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,840
To sum up, I don't think valve's move was a vote of no confidence for Ubuntu, but rather

393
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,600
marketing PR decision with a goal of creating a brand with a product without causing confusion

394
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,920
about the real nature of the OS.

395
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,720
Thanks for the great work, Michael.

396
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,440
Well two considerations there.

397
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,020
One as far as the branding and what not, that's easily done with an Ubuntu base, a simple

398
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,900
letter from the Ubuntu developers and basically removing all the trademark material and going

399
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,120
with what you want.

400
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,280
That's already doable with an Ubuntu base, so I don't think that's the whole reason behind

401
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
it.

402
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,920
Secondly, it comes down to a fact that by hedging their bets a little bit, taking a

403
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,960
Linux Mint approach like there with the Linux Mint Debian edition, by hedging their bets

404
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,600
and spreading out things a bit, they're not centralized on Ubuntu only.

405
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
That's just common sense.

406
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,920
Granted, the branding thing is accurate.

407
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,880
I mean, I agree, but don't put all your eggs in one basket.

408
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,360
That's a dangerous place to be.

409
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,760
I think my point to that was if Canonical had been successful and had really driven

410
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,920
the Ubuntu desktop and as a brand and all that had broken through, it would be a benefit

411
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,480
to say we run on Ubuntu, right?

412
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
It would be like a perk.

413
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,040
It would be like a good thing, like runs on Windows, right?

414
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,120
And because that never happened, it was sort of almost better to just sweep the whole Ubuntu

415
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
thing under the rug.

416
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,640
I agree though that at most, that's probably a minor factor in the decision process.

417
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,420
Overall, it's about branding.

418
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,620
It's about streamlining.

419
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,840
It's about keeping, it's about reducing confusion.

420
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,120
So I do agree.

421
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,200
I thought about that after I said it and I thought, well, actually there's a few arguments

422
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
against it.

423
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,520
So I was glad to see some folks wrote in with that.

424
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
So thanks to you guys.

425
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,880
Now, our last email, which is going to kind of in a way kick us into our main topic today,

426
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,240
comes from Matt, but it's a different Matt, but he does have two T's like a gentleman.

427
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,880
He writes, first, hey guys, I just want to correct Chris on something he said on last.

428
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,440
Linux is not the only open source community.

429
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
Obviously I think that.

430
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,300
A lot of the BSD code is open source as well, but isn't free software by the definition

431
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,280
of the term that was created by RMS.

432
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,580
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

433
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,920
But his main point was secondly, I've recently become more involved with the BSD community

434
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,280
and they really don't have the types of issues that the Linux community does with egotistical

435
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,040
talking, the blogs and writing something stupid that pisses everyone off.

436
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,480
I actually agree with this.

437
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,480
I wonder if this isn't the time that Linux community as a whole just says these quote

438
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,760
unquote founders, something like, Hey, we get that you've done a lot in the past, but

439
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,800
now that you're part of a problem, but now you're part of the problem and you're not

440
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,000
solving anything.

441
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,600
So please accept that this pat on the back and his heartfelt thanks and go away until,

442
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,960
until you can accept that this thing you created is much bigger than your ego.

443
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,080
I just think people like RMS and market shuttle worth are constantly causing subvert severe

444
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,480
divisions in the wider community and they've reached a point where their contributions

445
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:52,160
don't outweigh the harm they're causing by creating scenarios where the community attacks

446
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,800
itself.

447
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,800
I look at it, I look at it like a very hyperactive family.

448
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,280
There's a lot of debating going on a lot and even arguing and occasionally some fighting,

449
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,360
but it doesn't mean we stop being a family because of it.

450
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,880
And I think that's really what happens.

451
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,720
Oh, gosh, that makes me feel so warm.

452
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,520
It's like a warm and fuzzy feeling, right?

453
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,520
I almost feel like I don't want to even say what I think because mine is like, well, you

454
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,840
know, okay, so here's what I think.

455
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,160
I think if you, if you really believe the BSD community doesn't have arguments and big

456
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,040
fights you're fooling yourself.

457
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,400
Oh yeah, I'm sure.

458
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,100
What it is is it goes back to what I said during the intro.

459
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:39,200
It is our bankrupt media coverage of Linux because it is easy to write about the cult

460
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,360
of personality that we have because it draws clicks.

461
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,840
People recognize the name.

462
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,520
People click on the links and read the articles.

463
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,520
When Mark Shuttleworth or Linus Torvalds or RMS's name is in the headline, I do it too.

464
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
I'm a dumb monkey.

465
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
I click it.

466
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I read it.

467
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
And that's why it happens.

468
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,160
Now when somebody in the BSD community does it, you'll hear about it on BSD now, right?

469
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
Because that's the media coverage for BSD.

470
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:07,360
And obviously there's also the BSD talk and other and the BSD blogs, but like there's

471
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:15,560
not the scale and now industry is maybe not as a strong term, but definitely there is

472
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,080
a forming industry of Linux coverage.

473
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,040
And these people, these people are doing a disservice to the community because they're

474
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,440
lazy and because they're cheap and because you click it.

475
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,400
And because of that, these types of things get extraordinary coverage compared to, for

476
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,160
example today, Aaron Seigo wrote up a long blog post with lots of screenshots about the

477
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,040
future direction of a content delivery platform that's more than an app store.

478
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,840
It's like music and apps and books and open source code delivery and commercial software

479
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,580
delivery that they want to integrate in with like Plasma Active and the KDE desktop.

480
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,160
And they've got this whole backend infrastructure for it that's totally brilliant.

481
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,120
They've got a front end, they've got code they've been working on for the front end

482
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,680
delivery for two years and like he just wrote up all about it.

483
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,700
It's like it's going to be fundamental plumbing for app distributions for like distro agnostic.

484
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,660
It's going to be brilliant and nobody wrote about it.

485
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,880
Nobody wrote about it because everybody's writing about crap.

486
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,180
And I can tell you why as someone in this market is because quite honestly, unless it's

487
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,200
going directly into a subscribed mailing list, no one's going to click it.

488
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,800
No, that's not fair.

489
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Most people won't click it.

490
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,340
The smart people will.

491
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,880
But most people that are just scaling through titles, it's not necessarily going to grab

492
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,000
your attention unless it was done really, really well.

493
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,520
I mean like we're talking Star Wars type titles, it's got to be really good.

494
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,520
And that's hard to do especially with something like that because it covers so much ground.

495
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,360
And it doesn't have the click through rate of a – here's the top 10 reasons why you're

496
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
sick of reading these articles.

497
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Well, so –

498
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
You know, that sort of thing.

499
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,480
You know, Lass has a seven plus year history of following the news.

500
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,800
You've been a writer for years and writing in this space.

501
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,700
So I want to talk about this today because this is something that has literally been

502
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,580
bothering me for really more than a year, but definitely for the last year.

503
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,580
But first I want to tell everybody about something great.

504
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,960
So let's just focus on the good stuff.

505
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,600
And that is this week's sponsor, Ting.com.

506
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
That's right, friends.

507
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Ting is mobile.

508
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
That makes sense.

509
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,580
Now there are millions of reasons to switch to Ting.

510
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,800
So I want to tell you about just a few of them this episode.

511
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,280
Number one, no contracts.

512
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,640
No early termination fees.

513
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,720
And here's the third one.

514
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,840
Brace yourselves.

515
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,400
Pay for what you use.

516
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,560
Pay for what you use.

517
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,400
In the past, the only way to do pay for what you use is you had some sort of super special

518
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,560
deal with some monopoly carrier through your company.

519
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,280
If you ever left your job or that deal ended, there went your sweet deal.

520
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,280
No, Ting lets you take that power into your own hands literally.

521
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,840
So if you go to linux.ting.com, you're going to take $25 off your first month of service

522
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,440
or your first device.

523
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Lots of devices you can bring.

524
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,160
If you go over to the Ting help blog, the Ting help page, you can find out what devices

525
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
you can bring.

526
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
They also have a concierge service.

527
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,360
So you can get onto Ting with your own device, with a device they find for you, or a brand

528
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,760
new device that you own outright.

529
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,000
Now on top of the pay for what you use, on top of their excellent customer service, when

530
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,280
you call 1-855-846-4389, and a real Canadian answers the phone.

531
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,560
On top of all of that, they also have built in hotspot and tethering with every device

532
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
you grab.

533
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,880
So if you need Wi-Fi for a group of folks, and you know, if you're on one of these other

534
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,860
carriers, you know you've got that checkbox, if they haven't removed it, you've got that

535
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,800
checkbox in your Android settings, and man, you just wish you could just check that box

536
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,360
and wouldn't have to pay anything extra.

537
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
But you know they'll get you.

538
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,760
Maybe you've got to get the family share plan like I had to get a long time ago.

539
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,640
It's so ridiculous, Ting eliminates all of that.

540
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
They eliminate all of that.

541
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,660
Plus they have a savings calculator, if you're kind of on the fence, you go to linux.ting.com,

542
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,000
click on that savings calculator, put your bill information in there, and then just look

543
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,400
at the raw savings.

544
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,680
Now consider this, consider this, Ting is making it better than ever to switch.

545
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,700
Not only do they have the golden ticket program right now, and this is only until the end

546
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,960
of October, so it's almost over, where they're giving out six tickets for a year of service

547
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
for Ting.

548
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,520
Even if you bring your own device, you can still get one of these.

549
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,040
They also have introduced their early termination relief program where they give you up to $75

550
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,440
per line that you have to cancel to switch to Ting.

551
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,280
Now we're really starting to talk here, because if you're like me, I think the highest bill

552
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,240
I've ever had, I think my highest bill, even when both Ange and I were on it, was like

553
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
$24.

554
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
$25.

555
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
That's nothing.

556
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Yeah, that's crazy.

557
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
She and I are both big data.

558
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,780
We text, we do the web, but we don't do a ton of phone.

559
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,520
But if I did a ton of phone one month, then I'll only pay for what I use.

560
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,600
I don't end up paying into some plan, if you can call it that.

561
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
I don't know why they call it a plan.

562
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
I didn't plan that.

563
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,400
You don't have to pay some huge plan for something you don't end up using.

564
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,160
Go over to the Ting devices page, and while you're there, check out their new devices.

565
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
They've got the Moto X.

566
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,000
They've even got the Windows Phone, if you're of that variety.

567
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,760
They've got the HTC One now with the Android 4.3, which is rocking, and they have the pre-order

568
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,560
up for the new Note 3, Matt.

569
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Woo!

570
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
Man, I'm looking at that.

571
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,520
I love what I got now, but I would definitely love to go that direction.

572
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:12,200
And if you wanted to get in brand new for a crazy, crazy good deal, go check out the

573
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,600
Kyocera Kona, 63 bones with our discount.

574
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,200
That's like the perfect backup phone, right?

575
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,200
So first of all, since you only pay for what you use, put this in the glove box.

576
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Exactly.

577
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,400
Put it in the glove box and let it sit there, and if you ever have an emergency, you've

578
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,760
got a phone that's ready to go.

579
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,280
Not only does this thing have days of battery life, days of battery life, but it makes crystal

580
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,360
clear phone calls.

581
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,040
So that's a serious option.

582
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,960
They also have used devices, and I want to stress this.

583
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,120
Ting has really great customer service.

584
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,600
If you want to take advantage of their concierge service to find you a used device, you can

585
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
do it.

586
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,960
But if you want to get in on a Nexus S, check this out.

587
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,680
Unlocked, you own it outright with no early termination fees, no contract, Samsung Nexus

588
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:01,280
S with Android 4.1, $245, and you've got WiMAX in your area.

589
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,440
It's going to rock that, too.

590
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,360
You've also got the Samsung Galaxy S3, which has a little bit less of the Samsung bloatware

591
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,920
than the S4, 385 bones, you own it outright, no contract, no early termination fees.

592
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
What?

593
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
Love it?

594
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
It's crazy.

595
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
I know.

596
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Absolutely.

597
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,160
So go over to linux.ting.com, grab yourself something nice, and take advantage of that

598
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,480
early termination relief program if you need to, and maybe you'll even get a golden ticket.

599
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,160
Yeah, buddy.

600
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,480
So thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

601
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,800
I mean, how cool is that golden ticket program?

602
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
That is so cool.

603
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,200
When's the last time any other carrier's given you a gold in anything?

604
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Especially a ticket.

605
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
No kidding.

606
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
No kidding.

607
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,880
And I just feel like we need more Willy Wonka out there.

608
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
That's right.

609
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Yeah.

610
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,000
So the thing, I'm calling it the bankrupt news industry around Linux because I feel

611
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,480
like I've watched it devolve into crap.

612
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,180
We had three news stories last week, on last, right?

613
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,180
We had the...

614
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,180
Exactly.

615
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,180
Or maybe it was four.

616
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
It might have been four.

617
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,180
I mean, they all kind of blood together.

618
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,180
Yeah.

619
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,720
But the big one was, the big story was Mark Shuttleworth, branded people that disagree

620
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,800
with him, the open source tea party, Aaron Seigo took to G+, Lenart Pottering took to

621
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,920
G+, to respond.

622
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,300
That was the really big story of last week, right?

623
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,200
That was sort of like, I mean, it got coverage everywhere.

624
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,020
It was our top story.

625
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,760
And what, gosh, you know what really upsets me is, and how do you, do you know how do

626
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,280
you say Bruce, is it Byfield?

627
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Bruce Byfield?

628
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,280
Byfield, yeah.

629
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
Yeah.

630
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,120
Bruce Byfield wrote a great piece back in November 8th of 2012, kind of inspired by

631
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,880
a post that actually Aaron Seigo had made on his blog, but I really liked Bruce's take

632
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
on it here.

633
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,360
He says, he took on the, what he's calling the cults of personality that often dominate

634
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,880
the free software community.

635
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,840
And of course, you know, we think of Linus, right?

636
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
We think of Mark.

637
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
Yeah.

638
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,080
In fact, huge news, breaking news, everybody stand by, we all need to stop what we're doing.

639
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,720
Linus has insulted Fedora.

640
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,840
I've been waiting for him to, no, I've not, but I've been waiting for him to insult AMD.

641
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
That's what I'm-

642
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
I know, right?

643
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Yeah.

644
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
That's the joke.

645
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,560
But that's the joke now is, well, Linus puts his middle finger up and people jump.

646
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,660
But if you look at it, so yeah, so Linus Torvalds goes after the Fedora project this week and

647
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,080
calls him stupid.

648
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,320
I saw this transpire on G Plus in real time.

649
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,440
I was on G Plus when Linus made the post.

650
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,200
I think it even happened before last.

651
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,040
And I read it and I went, oh, okay, well, so Linus thinks that Fedora should generate

652
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,420
new ISOs periodically.

653
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,400
That way when you grab an ISO, you don't have super out of date packages.

654
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,460
I agree with that.

655
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,460
I agree with that.

656
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,240
I think really why make a thing about it, but whatever, I agree with this statement.

657
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,040
And then the Fedora project responds, oh, well, once we generate the ISOs, we don't

658
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
touch them.

659
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Those are the snapshot of the release.

660
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,040
And then we do updates and then Linus jumps back in and says, that's ridiculous.

661
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,680
And then they say, well, we don't have QA for the image.

662
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,520
It was this big back and forth, but I saw the thing and I thought, okay, no big deal,

663
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
right?

664
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Well, no.

665
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Huge deal.

666
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,240
Huge deal in the Linux media.

667
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,680
Softpedia has an article up, every news site that pretends to cover Linux has an article

668
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,400
up about Linus Torvalds smashing the Fedora project, calls them stupid, right?

669
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,560
And it plays into this whole cult of personality.

670
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:17,760
It perpetuates this, well, circle jerk of the celebrities in the Linux community.

671
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Exactly.

672
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,360
Well, and so here's the thing.

673
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,680
A lot of people have to realize that the cult of personality you see in a lot of the reality

674
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,920
TV stuff bleeds through into the written word as well.

675
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,760
And so you need something to basically scrape together to make these news stories out of,

676
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,000
especially when you're living in a big vacuum of things that don't present themselves well

677
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,520
to the masses.

678
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,960
They're important instances.

679
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,360
There's important things that are happening, but they're not always real easy to throw

680
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,120
into a title and guarantee a lot of click-throughs, which of course will then generate revenue.

681
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,080
And that's why these things tend to do really well.

682
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
Note the words in that title.

683
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,440
If you want to bring that back up on the screen for a second, the words smash, Linus, these

684
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
are not done.

685
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,340
These words are carefully chosen, put together to know.

686
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,880
So when you glance at this, even if you don't know who Linus is, the odds are you might

687
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,160
actually click through just out of curiosity to see what this Linus guy is smashing.

688
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Right.

689
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
He's smashing a project.

690
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,720
He calls that project stupid.

691
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
Definitely.

692
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,520
And plus, you get a picture of Linus in there and what every writer loves.

693
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:23,040
You get a few choice quotes to pull that you put in there, and then you just couch those

694
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,400
quotes around some sort of minimal write-up, and then you get a few thousand views or whatever

695
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,140
he gets for this.

696
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:35,400
And of course, the beauty of this is all you got to do is follow Linus on G+, or watch

697
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,260
Hacker News or something like that, and then it's like a story falls in your lap.

698
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,640
It's like Christmas time for the writer.

699
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,000
And Bruce tackles this.

700
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,200
Bruce says that these cults of personality are contrary to community values, whereas

701
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,120
they do untold damage imposing commercial values at the cost of community ones, or dividing

702
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,840
the community as those at the center of such cults decide to air their personal grudges

703
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,840
in public.

704
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Now, he wrote this in 2012.

705
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,960
We just saw this happen over just this weekend.

706
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,960
He says they can cause people to discard their own judgment and choose software on the basis

707
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,120
of who endorses what, and even to compromise themselves morally by choosing sides in a

708
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:16,080
flame war when they should be condemning everyone involved.

709
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,600
And I actually, when I came in, myself and of course the Ubuntu community manager came

710
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,000
in to actually address this when a lot of this stuff was going back and forth, we were

711
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
instantly attacked.

712
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,660
It's like, oh my gosh, this sort of thing.

713
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,440
It's unfortunate that we've come to that because we're feeding the problem and quite frankly

714
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,580
showing the writers that write this stuff that this is where you need to go.

715
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,200
And here's another reason why this is not only going to continue, but it's going to

716
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
get worse.

717
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,480
And a lot of people don't realize this.

718
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,920
Because of Google's constant algorithm changes, especially with their latest one, SEO is kind

719
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,920
of dying, I hate – I mean, in my opinion, I think.

720
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
And so because –

721
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,920
Yeah.

722
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Google said they want to kill SEO.

723
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,940
So rather than having reasons why something's awesome or something that has long-term value

724
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,760
in SEO, that's basically going the way of the dodo.

725
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,320
So you're – basically it's all or nothing in quick hits.

726
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,240
You got to publish often, got to have lots of content, and it has to have great titles.

727
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,720
Get people in, get people in, get people in, and it's got to continue.

728
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Right.

729
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,320
And the other thing is all of these writers are under big deadlines.

730
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,680
And like Bruce points out, the problem is that journalism, as it's practiced today,

731
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,480
finds cults of personality to be extremely convenient.

732
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Being able to just mention a celebrity in the headline guarantees you get increased

733
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
page views.

734
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
That's right.

735
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,400
And that, of course, means that the writer is still employed and, of course, the website

736
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
remains up.

737
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,980
And he also says it's convenient for the writer because instead of having to go out

738
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,040
of their way to back up their facts, if they mention someone famous, then it validates

739
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
their point.

740
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,280
Even if the celebrity fails to make a logical argument or offer a scrap of insight, readers

741
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,560
are more likely to be swayed by a viewpoint by learning that a celebrity, quote, unquote,

742
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
supports it.

743
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
Exactly.

744
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,080
And this – so one of the deciding facts – so I put Plan B on hiatus, even though

745
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,760
I'm – I think I'm still very fascinated by Bitcoin.

746
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,200
The problem what I saw happening was is sort of all of these bankrupt values being translated

747
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,240
over to Bitcoin where people who really had no business being quoted in a legitimate news

748
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,640
article were quoted.

749
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:24,560
And people who I knew to be sort of posers, quote, unquote, were writing articles talking

750
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,840
about how great something was.

751
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,400
And I see this all the time.

752
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,440
You know, in the history of the Linux Action Show, seven plus years, I have met a lot

753
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,240
of the people – I know a lot of the people behind these articles, and I know that some

754
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,260
of them never use Linux more than just starting it up on a VM on their Mac.

755
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:43,400
And that is, they're a total extent with Linux, and then they go on to write reviews

756
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:49,720
about, you know, new releases and all of this stuff, and it's totally ungenuine, but it

757
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,680
is all about they know how to phrase it, they have a bit of an established audience, and

758
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,200
they know how to get people to click on their stuff, and they know how to write vaguely

759
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,280
enough that you can't pin them down for not actually having enough experience.

760
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,240
And so while the write-up tends to be vapid with very little content, very little actual

761
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:13,720
value, because the state of Linux media coverage is so poor and so weak, it gets play.

762
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Exactly.

763
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
And that's just it.

764
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,440
And then you bundle that in with the fact that Linux is kind of coming into its own.

765
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,680
We're kind of at a lull right now because the gaming thing already happened.

766
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,920
The cloud stuff's already kind of doing its thing.

767
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:29,640
It's not really, you know, something that you can put into easy-to-understand terms

768
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,480
for the masses.

769
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,000
So there's a lot of play there for just fluff, and it's going to continue to get worse.

770
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,760
I really believe that.

771
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,200
He says, Bruce goes on to say that even a writer is not above from stooping to, however,

772
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,440
even when the writer is not stooping to such tactics, like we covered for us, for example,

773
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,800
you know, last tries not to get sucked into this, but we covered the Shuttleworth story

774
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
because...

775
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,960
And we had to.

776
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,960
It's news.

777
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,720
Like the audience, there is an expectation in the audience that you're going to talk

778
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,720
about, especially in that case, because we were drawn into it.

779
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,840
The Linux action show was actually drawn into the discussion, so it was like there's even

780
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,260
more impetus to discuss it.

781
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,280
But readers want, he goes on to say, readers want to hear about what famous people are

782
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
doing or thinking.

783
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,280
They are far less interested in ordinary people, which is why stories about people behind the

784
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,840
scenes, while often well-meaning, rarely keep people reading unless the writer can quickly

785
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,680
establish an interesting angle.

786
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,760
I think that's also really true.

787
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,840
It's like there's sort of this market pressure to play into this whole cult of personalities.

788
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,960
But what we get is this really watered down coverage of the open source community where

789
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,120
it looks like we're constantly bickering.

790
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,560
It looks like we're immature, we can't come together.

791
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,360
Even when there's great code being made, there's great strides that are being accomplished,

792
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,560
it sort of, it gets lost in the noise.

793
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,560
Right.

794
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
That's exactly it.

795
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,040
I mean, I remember back in the day where, you know, Bruce could do a really in-depth

796
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,440
analysis of Gnome, for example, and really dive in deep, or I could do some crazy futuristic

797
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Futurama think piece, you know, just having fun with, here's the existing technology,

798
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,400
here's where I think it's going to go, here's some considerations, blah, blah, blah.

799
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,040
Something that might actually be possibly entertaining, worth reading.

800
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,400
And now we're trapped in this space to where that's no longer possible, and I don't know

801
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,880
where that's going to lead.

802
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Yeah.

803
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,280
I've pulled back a lot myself, honestly, so.

804
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Yeah.

805
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,480
I think it's, I mean, and you've seen it from, you know, both angles where, you know, you've

806
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,520
been, you know, you've told me that people come to me and say, okay, well, Matt, we want

807
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
you to write about this.

808
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,400
You know, like, I'm not really interested in writing about that.

809
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Why would you want me to write about that?

810
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,800
And so, you know, well, we want another top 10 article, or we want something for our slideshow

811
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,960
because we get X amount of ad revenue by the slideshow.

812
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
Exactly.

813
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,680
And I feel like here we are now, a year after Bruce wrote that piece that I just read, and

814
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
it goes on more.

815
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,960
I'll have both Aaron and Bruce's piece linked in the show notes.

816
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,040
So this week, tuxmachines.org went up for sale.

817
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,040
Yeah.

818
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,040
It's coming.

819
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
I actually knew about it.

820
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,640
Phronix.com has been up for sale a couple of times.

821
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,300
The H Online is shut down, right?

822
00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:01,060
And so what we have here is either A, sites that couldn't make it work, even though they

823
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:06,480
had original content, or B, we have the elimination of some really good writing, like from the

824
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
H Online.

825
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Yeah.

826
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,720
And what we get left with is blog spam.

827
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Right.

828
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:17,320
And what I see happening is I see companies, you know, like Network World and other companies

829
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:22,760
out there that are really just sort of half-heartedly getting involved, like they have an open source

830
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,040
back page where they have people writing for that, you know, just write us something adorable.

831
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,240
We'll put it up, and maybe it'll get a few upvotes on Reddit, and then people will come

832
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,240
read it.

833
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,040
You know, it's like this total half-assed, half-hearted attempt to cover the industry.

834
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,240
Meanwhile, Linux is seeing more adoption than we've ever seen in the history of the platform.

835
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,400
We have more people using it in terms of mobile, on the cloud, and on the desktop, but yet

836
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,360
the writing and coverage of it has never been weaker or poorer, and it is so disappointing

837
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
to see this happen.

838
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
It is.

839
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,340
And, well, and the other side of it, too, is that you have two types of writers.

840
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,440
You have the writer that basically has to get approval for a topic.

841
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,920
Usually we present two or three to the editor, and then one of them is selected.

842
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,300
And then a lot of times none of them are selected, and we do have to settle for a top ten.

843
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,400
Or you have the person who is a syndicated writer, and these are my favorite, the Dvoraks

844
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,920
of the world, for a better example, that will go out, and because they're so burnt out,

845
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
they don't care.

846
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,120
They're literally just cranking out crap because they're done.

847
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,120
They're done.

848
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,360
They mentally checked out a long time ago.

849
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,800
They figured out what buttons to push to generate enough links to meet what that site needs

850
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,400
to keep them around.

851
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,520
You know, and like Big C points out, you see this definitely happen on Slashdot and all

852
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
the sites.

853
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,840
But you know, it's interesting, in all of this, and I think it's of some note, to keep

854
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,880
in perspective, LinuxLWN.net, LinuxWeekly.net, you know, a reader-supported news site, dedicating

855
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,200
to really producing deep coverage, which I've never found to be exceptionally compelling

856
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,400
myself, but totally respect the type of coverage that it is.

857
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
They're still around.

858
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,160
I don't know how they're doing, but I'm pleased they're still around, and I feel like you

859
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,080
touched on it, like what I want as a Linux user and a follower of this industry, and

860
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,400
I would want this even if I was ten times less involved with the Linux community.

861
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,740
If I was just following Linux news because I had sent OS servers deployed on my servers

862
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:15,460
at work, I would still want thought-provoking articles that are, you know, deep discussions

863
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:21,600
about things that are going on right now, that are well-done analysis, that go much

864
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,840
further beyond just the surface coverage, this top-level coverage we get now.

865
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,560
And LWN.net does exactly that.

866
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,240
They just don't happen to do it about things that I'm particularly passionate about.

867
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,880
Well, and the other side of that, too, because this is a great example.

868
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,360
They're still around because, of course, their expectations are not, you know, probably not

869
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,020
monetary in any way other than server cost.

870
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,240
They're sure it's volunteer authors and so on and so forth.

871
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,480
And I think even, was it opensource.com, I believe now, the Red Hat group, actually,

872
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
they do a lot of volunteer stuff.

873
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,820
I think a lot of the volunteer sites tend to do pretty well because the expectation,

874
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,840
people are doing it for the fun of it because they're passionate about it, maybe even just

875
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,760
to get their name out there.

876
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
But –

877
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Yeah, there are a few efforts.

878
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
Yeah, there are a few.

879
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,040
And opensource.com is lucky because they have a benefactor that, you know, Red Hat that

880
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,040
–

881
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,040
Right.

882
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,040
But it's all volunteer writers.

883
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,880
I mean, these guys are – unless it's an employee of the company, but most of them

884
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
are just volunteer writers.

885
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,800
And that's interesting that they're able to produce as well as they do for volunteers

886
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,360
because honestly, once the notoriety wears off as a volunteer, you kind of burn out pretty

887
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,120
quick because after a while, you find that you have X number of hours in the day and

888
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
you want to spend it elsewhere.

889
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
So –

890
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,160
I think Chatham is misinterpreting, so I want to correct because I'm sure some of the listeners.

891
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
Sure.

892
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,480
I don't mean that LWN isn't compelling.

893
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,360
I guess what I mean is like, I'm never like compelled –

894
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,880
The topics aren't maybe hitting it for you?

895
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,880
I mean –

896
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,880
Like, they're good.

897
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,760
Like, optimizing CPU hot plug logging, locking is interesting, a new direction for power

898
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,000
where scheduling, rationalizing Python packaging –

899
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Pretty hyper-specific, yeah.

900
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah.

901
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,160
And just not particular topics.

902
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:56,080
I mean, but, you know, I probably find myself on the site about once a week, you know, reading

903
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,600
something, but I would really like some deeper stuff.

904
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,600
And I feel like –

905
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Sure.

906
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,920
There are – you know, there are – like, you just pointed out two good examples.

907
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,720
You know, opensource.com is one of them where there's some that are beginning, but it's

908
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,760
still so far and the resources are still so thin and the market pressures are so high

909
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,040
on this problem.

910
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,960
Like, this is a trend that's been going on for a few years now and I really feel like

911
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,720
I've been witnessing the decline as the host of the Linux Action Show, just like, watching

912
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,720
the news every single week, you know.

913
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,240
You and I, we sit here and go, what are we going to cover?

914
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,720
And we watch it all week and then at the end of the week, we kind of – we literally take

915
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,200
it all in and then say, okay, well, this meets the cut.

916
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,440
And every single week, that – for a while now, like, that list is getting shorter and

917
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,440
shorter.

918
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,000
And in the last week, in the last couple of weeks, it's been shockingly small.

919
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,820
Like, so much so.

920
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,960
And unfortunately, the noise ratio hasn't gone down.

921
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
That's true.

922
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,280
There's still horrible things being written and posted on the blogs and all these other

923
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,280
places.

924
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,280
So it's so disappointing to watch it happen.

925
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,120
Well, and I also think it fills in the gap a little bit for the lack of actual news.

926
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,600
I mean, we need more, you know, Dell dumps Windows forever and goes nothing but Linux

927
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,500
or, you know, some crazy stories like that to where it's like really big compelling

928
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,160
stuff like what we saw with Valve and gaming.

929
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,560
We need more of that to drown out the noise.

930
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
You know what I mean?

931
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,760
So here would be a great example because ZooX is asking for kind of maybe like an example

932
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:22,000
is while this whole Shuttleworth kerfuffle is blowing up around Mir and Upstart and System

933
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
3 and all these things, wouldn't it be awesome to have like this like New York Times style

934
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,480
article with like, here is like the whole backstory, here's all of the stuff, here's

935
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,120
when this stuff happened, here's the people behind it, here's their goals.

936
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,460
Like this whole, like if there was just one spot you could go to and be completely up

937
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:44,560
to date on this whole kerfuffle and like get the timelines right and get the motivations

938
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,880
and you know, and have it be impartial third party documentation of it.

939
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,280
Because really, and I don't mean to toot our own horn right now, but one of the best ways

940
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,720
to get that is just to watch the entire back catalog of the Linux action show and then

941
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,680
you can just organically watch it come together.

942
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,840
But that's not how it should be.

943
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,960
Because quite honestly to get a writer to actually go that deep into something and to

944
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,480
do it right for that article alone, honestly, I can't see anyone doing it for less than

945
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,480
a grand.

946
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,480
I know.

947
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,480
Maybe two.

948
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,480
This is the problem.

949
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,480
This is the problem.

950
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,480
Yeah.

951
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,720
The internet makes things cheap and people don't, unless you've been involved in the

952
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,040
industry, people don't know the actual like.

953
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,160
And two is probably not enough, honestly, because it's going to be quite a job.

954
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,160
Yeah.

955
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,160
Yeah.

956
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,160
So, you know, just, I don't know.

957
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,160
I don't know.

958
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,000
Maybe if the mumble room has any thoughts on this, if you guys have, maybe you've noticed

959
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,220
an improvement in Linux news, if you've noticed a decline in Linux news, if this concerns

960
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,640
you guys or doesn't concern you, if anybody has any thoughts and want to chime in before

961
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:43,160
we move on, you are, the floor is open to you to do so.

962
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:50,280
Well, the paraphrase, the great philosopher of our time, Jessie J, from her infinitely

963
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:58,960
deep poem, Price Tag, again, I'm paraphrasing here, all about the cha-ching, cha-ching,

964
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,800
all about the bubbling, bubbling.

965
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,800
Yeah.

966
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,800
Yeah.

967
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,800
Yeah.

968
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:13,520
I mean, hey, Linus Torvalds, the term, Linus Torvalds hate Fedora, gets people a lot more

969
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,520
money.

970
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,400
Then, Alan Saigo introduces some new piece of technology or something like that.

971
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,400
Right.

972
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,080
You, you know this better than anybody, both of you, because, you know, you're actively

973
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,080
into this.

974
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,080
Exactly.

975
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,000
So, and it's all about the bottom line.

976
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,520
See, if they don't do this, they get sold and they get, they shut down and they don't

977
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,520
have any money.

978
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,040
If they do do this, they're, they're rolling in dough and everything.

979
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,040
Yeah, that's true.

980
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,520
There's, there's, there's so many incentives.

981
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,800
It keeps them in a holding pattern.

982
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,560
I mean, cause I mean really the writing industry is just hurting as it is, but it does, it

983
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,680
keeps them in a holding pattern.

984
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,100
If they do get bought out, when they look at which writers to keep and which writers

985
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,000
to fire, they will look at, they look at viewer counts.

986
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,320
What are your thoughts, Matt, on like, you know, having to be, have a certain level of

987
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,120
qualification before you're allowed to write?

988
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,920
I mean, like not allowed, but like before, like, do you think there's a responsibility

989
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:10,920
for some of these publication companies to like hire qualified writers?

990
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,480
Or is it, if they, I would say just more of the, the, the, the knowledge of the topics

991
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,480
themselves.

992
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,360
The problem is, is there, they spend all their time and, and you know, there's a lot of,

993
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,700
some of the sites you pointed out earlier are great examples of what happens when you

994
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,440
hire the guy with the English degree.

995
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
That's great.

996
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440
He's a fantastic writer.

997
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,800
He didn't clue what he's talking about, but he writes very well.

998
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Yeah.

999
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,200
And I, I don't know, maybe in an eighth or ninth grade level or whatever, put the point,

1000
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,200
but I know what I'm talking about.

1001
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,200
If you know the material, it's more important.

1002
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,480
If I know the material, I'm going to at least speak intelligently about it.

1003
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,480
So, you know.

1004
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,480
Yeah, that's true.

1005
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,480
That is true.

1006
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,480
Cause that's a whole nother problem.

1007
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,480
Yeah.

1008
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,480
Yeah.

1009
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,840
That's why I have an editor who has the English degree that can then take my mumble jumbo

1010
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,840
and make it into something legible.

1011
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,840
That's what I do.

1012
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,320
Can I get one of those for real life?

1013
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,560
Hey, I got, I got two.

1014
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,120
I have, my wife does initial edits and I have my final and then my final editor, but yeah,

1015
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:01,000
my wife just takes my stuff and she's just like, I don't even, she just cringes, she's

1016
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
like, Oh God, here we go.

1017
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So yeah.

1018
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Good.

1019
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
She takes one for the team.

1020
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Oh, big time.

1021
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I see it's kind of evolving into TV media.

1022
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It is.

1023
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,440
How all negative presses, all the hoopla, but no actually good miracle stories get coverage.

1024
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,440
Right.

1025
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,320
It's more American Idol and less Firefly.

1026
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,320
I mean, really.

1027
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,320
Yeah.

1028
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,320
Yeah.

1029
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,000
And you look at that email we got where the guy's like, gosh, it looks like the Linux

1030
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,920
community is a bunch of clown shoes.

1031
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,120
Yeah, see, it's, it's not a Linux thing.

1032
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,320
It's a, it's a human thing.

1033
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,380
It's a people thing.

1034
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,240
You see this in the gaming media.

1035
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,560
You see this in the technology media overall.

1036
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,400
You see this in, in regular media and yeah, this is a human thing.

1037
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,200
This is a phenomenon that is inherent to, I think media itself, not just Linux media.

1038
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,020
We are at the end of the day people.

1039
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,760
And so we want exciting stuff.

1040
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:58,520
We want short, sweet, exciting new stories, small content that can be easily consumed

1041
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,280
just and then we move on.

1042
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,480
And the thing is, is these sites recognize that and they manipulate us based on that.

1043
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,800
And so then they end up just producing shovelware.

1044
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,800
Exactly.

1045
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
Yeah, obviously.

1046
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,960
And see, it's not about the technical proficiency of the writer or the understanding that the

1047
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,040
actual journalist has about the topic.

1048
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,720
It's simply about what people want to hear.

1049
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,720
That's true.

1050
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,200
But the people that want to hear that generally tend to attract that class of writer though.

1051
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,080
They attract the one that can write or spin a really great tale but doesn't have a clue

1052
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,080
he's talking about.

1053
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,080
And of course then the market of course rewards that and that's the problem too.

1054
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,080
Yeah.

1055
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:38,120
Well, you know, Matt mentioned John C. Dvorak earlier and that guy can get away with writing

1056
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,240
just about anything strictly because of his name.

1057
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,280
He's a well-known writer.

1058
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,280
Everybody knows who he is.

1059
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,320
Well, there's also science behind what he does too.

1060
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,040
You know, he's very, very smart.

1061
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Yeah.

1062
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,040
He knows exactly what he's doing.

1063
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:59,720
I think anyone that survives in that industry knows, like I feel like if I wanted to manipulate

1064
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,240
our audience all the time I could because I think I really know what they all like and

1065
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,200
I think I know how to, we could title things, we could cover certain things just strictly

1066
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,200
to manipulate.

1067
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,480
And it's like, you know what, actually I'll even say this, there's sometimes I have to

1068
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,120
fight the urge and every now and then you do see it leak out in our titles where we'll

1069
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,080
go for a little bit of an outrageous title just to get you to watch.

1070
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:25,040
Even though we hope that the actual show normalizes it, I've learned that it doesn't.

1071
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,860
That title sets the expectation when they go in, they then watch it through the filter

1072
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:34,120
that that title set and they perceive everything we say through that.

1073
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,800
So now I've kind of backed off from doing that, but you know, it can literally for some

1074
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,000
of these sites, it could be the difference in thousands of clicks.

1075
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,080
So it's a hard thing to fight.

1076
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:48,240
Also another thing is, some of these mainstream writers, they still think of Linux as just

1077
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:54,680
a toy, like something you just play around with, like they're talking down to it almost.

1078
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,480
A lot of them are and a lot of times you also have to follow where their sponsors are coming

1079
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,480
from.

1080
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,520
If it's an AdSense sponsor or some network sponsorship situation where it's just rotating

1081
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,900
ads, you know, usually they're just truly, honestly believing that it's a toy.

1082
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,560
But if it's actually a purchased in place ad, a lot of times on a lot of these sites,

1083
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,560
that's by design.

1084
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,120
There are a lot of them are mouthpieces for Microsoft and other places and I can think

1085
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,400
of a few of them right off the top of my head actually.

1086
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,400
PC World.

1087
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,400
Yeah, exactly.

1088
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,400
Yeah.

1089
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,400
Exactly.

1090
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,400
Oh, snaps.

1091
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,400
Well, yeah.

1092
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,400
Yeah.

1093
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,400
Yeah.

1094
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,400
Yeah.

1095
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,400
I thought, you know, we could name and shame, but there's just, you know, let's just say

1096
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,960
that if they're pretty popular, it's probably safe to say.

1097
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,960
Yeah.

1098
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,960
Yeah.

1099
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,560
You know, now we're naming shame and I'm watching the chairman and they're naming shame.

1100
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,560
That's cool.

1101
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,560
All right, guys.

1102
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,560
Well, any final thoughts?

1103
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,560
Riley, I thought I saw you, you piped up with something, but I was going to move on.

1104
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,560
Oh, yeah.

1105
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,560
That was great.

1106
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,560
Okay.

1107
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,560
No, I was just talking about that.

1108
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,560
Never mind.

1109
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,560
Okay.

1110
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,560
Keep going.

1111
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,560
Keep going.

1112
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,560
All right.

1113
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,560
Well, I'm going to read a couple of emails before we run.

1114
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,120
And then I think, Matt, I'll wrap us up with the RMS wrap, which debuted on Coder Radio

1115
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,120
this week.

1116
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,120
Nice.

1117
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,120
So this email comes in from Roy.

1118
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,200
He says, Hi, Chris and Matt.

1119
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,200
My name is Roy.

1120
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,200
Say it like Roy.

1121
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,440
Hi, Chris, I'm from Israel and I'm a product manager in a software company, a longtime

1122
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,200
fan of the show, and even longer fan of Ubuntu.

1123
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,480
I switched to Linux where Ubuntu during 7.04 was the first thing I tried out.

1124
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,040
I'm a longtime fan of Ubuntu as they were the ones that made me realize a user has the

1125
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,100
options other than Windows.

1126
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,220
And it was a wonderful experience.

1127
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,680
At first, when you moved away to Arch and preached others to do so.

1128
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,240
I don't know if I really preached that.

1129
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,240
Shared excitement preached.

1130
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,240
Thank you.

1131
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,240
Shared excitement.

1132
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,240
It just shared in my experience.

1133
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:36,080
It's kind of like, you know, when we start the Coke action show and I share my knowledge.

1134
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,080
Oh my goodness.

1135
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,080
Hello.

1136
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,080
It's the internet, baby.

1137
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:45,800
He said, I could not turn on Shuttleworth as we were talking about it, but I guess maybe

1138
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,040
it was the Amazon collaboration that got me.

1139
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,920
I like Amazon, but I don't like to get results from Amazon and everything that I search in

1140
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,920
the dash.

1141
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,100
Anyway, I switched to Arch and the first thing I have to say is, oh my God, system D. As

1142
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:01,480
a power user, Arch is easy to learn and the Arch Wiki is wonderful.

1143
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,040
Then I realized, or then I installed a desktop environment.

1144
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,460
You talk so much about KD, so I gave it a try, but I felt it was too broken for my needs.

1145
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:12,800
Certain features were missing or perhaps just weren't quite done.

1146
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,160
But he goes on to say that I switched to Gnome, which has been great.

1147
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,600
I guess you can say it's more complete than KD.

1148
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,800
It's okay, but whatever you do, never write about Gnome.

1149
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:24,800
Best advice I can ever give you.

1150
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,200
He says it does work and it even works smoothly.

1151
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,160
The only thing missing for me in Arch is a respectable GUI for Pac-Man as I want to explore

1152
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,320
the repo in a comfortable way and there are some ways to integrate with the AUR easily.

1153
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,120
I've installed your, but I would rather have something embedded with Pac-Man.

1154
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,120
Keep up the great work.

1155
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:46,720
Now, on Manjaro, they use a GUI package manager, correct?

1156
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,360
Yeah, they call it Pac-Mac or slap mat or something, I don't know what they call it.

1157
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,360
Oh, I have it on, yeah.

1158
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,360
Yeah, Pac-Mac, I think, like a M-A-C.

1159
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,360
Pac-Mac.

1160
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,360
No, it's Pac-Man XG, right?

1161
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,360
Isn't that what it is?

1162
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,360
No, no, no.

1163
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,360
Oh, Pac-Man.

1164
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,360
For the integrated thing, it's like it's P-A-C-M-A-C.

1165
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,360
It's Pac-Mac.

1166
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,600
Now, there is a GUI one called like Pac-Man XG, too, which is...

1167
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,000
Yeah, I actually run that for all my AUR stuff.

1168
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,400
Yeah, so there is even a Arch Wiki entry about it.

1169
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,360
And I also, for installing packages from the AUR, I'm sure I'll get some...

1170
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,760
Whenever you say what you use, by the way, on Arch, just so you know, just brace yourselves

1171
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,080
for this, Roy.

1172
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,220
Whenever you tell people what you use, you will get 30 people telling you not to ever

1173
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,920
use that, it will destroy Arch.

1174
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,520
So with that disclaimer made, I use Packer.

1175
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,040
Packer I like quite a bit.

1176
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,720
And then you can also, there's a web search for the Arch user repository.

1177
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,200
And what I really love about that is the comments and the votes.

1178
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,240
You can use that to kind of suss out if it's, you know, workable.

1179
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,240
That's right.

1180
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,080
Myself, I'm a huge fan of Pac-A-U-R.

1181
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,080
Okay.

1182
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,080
Yep.

1183
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,080
It's a really good one.

1184
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,440
It acts just like Pac-Man, but also works with the AUR.

1185
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,440
Yep, yep.

1186
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,280
And then you can just say like Pac-A-U-R dash S, capital S.

1187
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,880
And then the name of the package, and if it's in the, if it's in the actual Arch repo or

1188
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,880
in the AUR, it don't care.

1189
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,880
It just go gets it.

1190
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,880
Right.

1191
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,880
Exactly.

1192
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,880
It doesn't bump you a million times.

1193
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,880
Right.

1194
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,880
Yep.

1195
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,880
So.

1196
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,880
The GUI is definitely Pac-Man XG4.

1197
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,880
Okay.

1198
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,880
Oh, L4.

1199
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,880
The general one is Octopi.

1200
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,880
Okay.

1201
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,880
Okay.

1202
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,880
Octopi.

1203
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,880
Yeah.

1204
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,760
But the ones that I use are two awesome command line AUR interfaces that I've found, Pac-A-U-R

1205
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
and Packer.

1206
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,760
Yeah.

1207
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,760
Like a P-A-C-K-E-R.

1208
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,760
Yeah, I like Packer.

1209
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,760
They're awesome.

1210
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,760
Yeah.

1211
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,760
I've always just used Yowert.

1212
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,760
Yep.

1213
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,760
Yep.

1214
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,760
And I want to call it Yogurt.

1215
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,760
Yeah, I know.

1216
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,760
Or Yoplait or something.

1217
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,760
It used to be French.

1218
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,680
Like it used to be from the French Arch community.

1219
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:39,720
And it was only French and holy smokes, it used to be used back in the day.

1220
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,240
We should rename it Activia.

1221
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:45,160
I find that Yowert prompts me more than Packer does.

1222
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,000
Not by a lot, but just by a little bit.

1223
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,200
And I don't know, I just kind of like Packer output a little better, but Yowert's awesome

1224
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,200
too.

1225
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,080
In fact, usually that's how I install Packer is by installing Yowert.

1226
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,600
I have a request for the Linux community.

1227
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:03,320
If the Linux community could just start naming stuff I can pronounce, that would be so awesome.

1228
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,780
People were giving Nome a hard time for calling the music app music and the photos app photos

1229
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:10,760
and the file manager files, but now looking back at that, I'm thinking that makes some

1230
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,760
sense.

1231
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,360
Well, even KDE, they just slap a K in front of everything.

1232
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,360
I mean, I'm good with that.

1233
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,360
Yeah, that works.

1234
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,360
Yeah.

1235
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,520
And what they don't is like Dolphin and that's easy, you know?

1236
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,520
Yeah.

1237
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,640
The next email comes in from James on the Mir debate.

1238
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,280
He says, Hey guys, I just had one point to make, which has been overlooked in the discussion

1239
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,180
over Mir versus Wayland.

1240
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:33,000
You were discussing in a different context what quote unquote needed to happen, but I

1241
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,020
think Mir needed to happen.

1242
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:39,600
In 2010, Canonical was first to say they wanted to go with Wayland, but Wayland moved very

1243
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,200
slowly and was apparently not responsive to Canonical's needs.

1244
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,680
From Canonical's perspective, Mir needed to happen, perhaps.

1245
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,440
But surely it's obvious also that Mir gave Wayland a giant kick in the butt.

1246
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,440
I don't think Wayland would have made anything like the progress it is now without competition

1247
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,440
from Mir.

1248
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,640
See, now the Wayland guys really hate it when you say that, especially if you say it on

1249
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
a podcast.

1250
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,640
They really hate it.

1251
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,640
Yeah.

1252
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,800
I was the one, that's where the whole monkey suit thing came about is at that time.

1253
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,600
And I realized this has changed, but to my knowledge, and I'm going to disclose this,

1254
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,240
to my knowledge at that time, I saw no evidence of Wayland doing anything.

1255
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,240
Oh man.

1256
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,240
I'm totally with you, Matt.

1257
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,040
I just didn't see it.

1258
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:22,360
I had the clown show where we did like two or three years of our yearly Linux predictions

1259
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,520
where like, okay, Wayland's going to ship this year, and it never happened.

1260
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:32,880
Now what I think did happen is it focused the supporters of Wayland into doubling down

1261
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,920
on what was actually already there.

1262
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:39,920
And Intel got more involved and started a dialogue with Red Hat, and they started working

1263
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,800
closer together to push Wayland forward.

1264
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,120
Server manufacturers started thinking about it a little more.

1265
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:51,880
So I think even if the core amount of contributors maybe to Wayland hasn't gone up, or if it

1266
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,600
has, I don't know, but I definitely think it's moved things forward.

1267
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:00,400
And we just had a great, thanks to Heaven's Revenge in the mumble room, a great pre-show

1268
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,120
technical chat about the differences between Wayland and Mir.

1269
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:11,200
And it actually, I should get him to try to post it somewhere, but the summary was there's

1270
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,800
also some long-term architectural differences they're making.

1271
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,960
So we could see this conversation, I think a lot of us are kind of just expecting it

1272
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,720
to ship and then we're going to stop talking about it.

1273
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,000
But I actually think once it ships, that's when the conversation's actually going to

1274
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
begin.

1275
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,720
We're going to look back at this pre-launch time stuff as like adorable because in a couple

1276
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,240
of years we're going to be living it, right?

1277
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,240
Or a year?

1278
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,240
I don't know.

1279
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,240
He says, he backs it up there.

1280
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,880
He says, five years of Wayland development show that open source software development

1281
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,920
needs competition.

1282
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,960
We're provided that and Wayland has a lot more progress as a result.

1283
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,040
I'd say bring on X.12 too, why not?

1284
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,040
James?

1285
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,040
All right.

1286
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,040
Yeah, man.

1287
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,040
Who needs X.11 when you can have X.12?

1288
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,040
There is a thing.

1289
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,040
There is a thing.

1290
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,040
All right, Matt.

1291
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,040
Well, I think I'm going to wrap us here.

1292
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,040
What do you think?

1293
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,280
Anything else you want to cover before we wrap up?

1294
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,280
I think that's it.

1295
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,440
The one thing I would leave on, well, as far as Wayland's concerned, I'd want to leave

1296
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,240
everybody with this statement is that when I made that statement initially, I was instantly

1297
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,360
given 101 reasons why, well, no, Wayland's developing just fine and it doesn't need to

1298
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,920
speed up and da, da, da, da, da, da.

1299
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:17,040
It's interesting that that happened and, of course, now, of course, with the whole Mirror

1300
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,960
thing happening, Wayland is, in fact, going really quickly and it's doing amazing things

1301
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,400
and it's coming along very nicely.

1302
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:29,360
Well, and I think what I want the meta message of this episode to be is the dialogue in the

1303
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:34,040
open source community actually does matter because that's what encourages people to join

1304
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,120
open source projects.

1305
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,120
That's what motivates people.

1306
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,840
It gives people passion.

1307
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,880
That's why the news coverage and the media around Linux is actually more important than

1308
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,400
it is around these commercial companies that have dictators and commands from above, right?

1309
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,280
There's actually a larger impact Linux media can have and in that same regard, there's

1310
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,160
a larger impact that competition has because it galvanizes each camp.

1311
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,160
It gets people focused.

1312
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,160
It gets people working.

1313
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:01,720
It gets people behind their effort and it pushes things forward and just like commercial

1314
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:06,220
competition helps commercial products, open source competition helps open source products

1315
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:11,240
and yes, I think both Matt and I acknowledge there is plenty of opportunity for display

1316
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,760
server fragmentation, right?

1317
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,760
Oh, totally.

1318
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,760
Yeah.

1319
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,320
We could be going down an uncharted path and forfeiting one of the cornerstones of Linux

1320
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:24,520
stability thanks to X11 that we've had for years, but in the end, we might also see ourselves

1321
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:29,160
evolving into something that's pretty awesome and with two folks going at it like this,

1322
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,200
now we've got our Coke and Pepsi of display servers.

1323
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,320
They're going to be pushing each other forward, I hope, at least for a while, at least for

1324
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,320
quite a while.

1325
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,320
All right, Matt.

1326
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,280
Well, so I want to give people a little heads up if they've stayed tuned this long.

1327
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,360
This week on the Linux Action Show, Matt and I will be reviewing Cinnamon 2.0.

1328
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:49,440
Actually, I guess it's technically next week, but Cinnamon 2.0 has been out for a little

1329
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,960
while and I've got it installed in a VM and I've also got it installed on my Benobes and

1330
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,680
I think we'll give you our full take on it.

1331
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,640
I know there's a lot of folks out there who aren't quite happy with any particular desktop

1332
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,240
and some of them are looking towards Cinnamon.

1333
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,280
I know we have some Mint 14 users in our Mumble Room right now.

1334
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,560
They're looking towards the next release of Mint with Cinnamon 2.0 and hoping that it's

1335
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,760
going in the right direction.

1336
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,600
So we'll give you our thoughts on the new version of Cinnamon in the next episode of

1337
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,600
the Linux Action Show.

1338
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,600
Good stuff.

1339
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,600
All right.

1340
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,720
Well, I'm going to end us with the RMS rap.

1341
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,000
So this was cut from this week's Koda Radio.

1342
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,440
It was put to the end of Koda Radio because during the show, about midway through the

1343
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:32,440
show, we had a Skype hiccup and something happened and Mike dropped off and you hear

1344
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,080
me trying to reconnect to him throughout the song.

1345
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:39,400
And so I decided to kill time by taking a song I like from Ronald Janke's called Side

1346
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:45,380
Tracked and pairing it with Richard Stallman, which is two great things that go well together.

1347
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:46,880
It's like peanut butter and chocolate, man.

1348
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,140
So here you go.

1349
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:53,240
This is a clip from the end of this week's Koda Radio and we'll end with this.

1350
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,240
Thanks for joining us, everybody.

1351
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,240
We'll see you right back here next week.

1352
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,040

1354
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,960
the dropdown.

be part of the dialogue.

1358
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,360
We are your internet lug.

1359
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,160
So just come and hang out with us and enjoy the RMS rap.

1360
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,160
See you next Sunday, Matt.

1361
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,160
See you then.

1362
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,160
There's nobody else here, Chris.

1363
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,160
You don't hear me?

1364
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,160
What are you talking about?

1365
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,160
Christopher.

1366
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,160
Oh, I hear you.

1367
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:35,600
You don't hear my wonderful beam or what about that?

1368
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,600
He's a jackass.

1369
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:37,600
Do you hear that?

1370
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,600
Or do you hear?

1371
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,600
I think it's wasted effort.

1372
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,600
Or do you hear?

1373
01:04:40,600 --> 01:05:04,680
I think we should all make those businesses fail.

1374
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:17,320
It's the Stallman rap, here it comes, here it comes.

1375
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:26,800
And the value of this is negative, and the value of this is negative, it's negative in

1376
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,800
the freedom dimension.

1377
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,800
I think it's wasted effort.

1378
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,800
Get it out of here.

1379
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,800
And the value of this is negative.

1380
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:37,920
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

1381
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,920
Get it out of here.

1382
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:49,640
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

1383
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:55,720
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

1384
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:01,180
Get it out of here.

1385
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:05,120
Get it out of here.

1386
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:11,120
And the value of this is negative.

1387
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:16,120
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

1388
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:21,120
And the value of this is negative.

1389
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,120
Get it out of here.

1390
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,120
I think it's wasted effort.

1391
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,120
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

1392
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,120
Get it out of here.

1393
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,520
The value of this is negative.

1394
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,020
Get it out of here.

1395
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:37,880
He is a jackass.

1396
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,980
He is a jackass.

1397
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,020
He is a jackass.

1398
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,340
Hello, everybody.

1399
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:49,920
Get it out of here.

1400
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,120
Get it out of here.

1401
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:57,120
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

1402
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,720
And the value of this is negative.

1403
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,120
And the value of this is negative.

1404
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,720
Negative in the freedom dimension.

1405
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,920
And the value of this is negative.

1406
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,320
I think it's wasted effort.

1407
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,020
And the value of this is negative.

1408
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,520
I think it's wasted effort.

It's negative in the freedom dimension.

1412

I think it's wasted effort.

1413
