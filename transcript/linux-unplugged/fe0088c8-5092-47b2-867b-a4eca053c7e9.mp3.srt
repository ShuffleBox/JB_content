1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,100
I tell you what it's one of them. It's one of them things that a girl goes through although although just to add insult to

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,940
Injury, I can't seem to actually build. Oh geez now. I just disappeared. I can't seem to actually build a right-click it so

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,460
And now I clicked on a menu

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,340
that

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,420
Existed for a plasma what I deleted and now the whole interface is locked up well shit

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,860
I had so many nice things to say and now my whole UI is locked up

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,860
But I got like a bajillion tabs open. I don't want to reset all those up, and I'm oh

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,340
man

9
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,380
And then I watch the icon little die. What what what just happened? What just happened?

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,500
I think plasma desktop is just going crazy on me my screen just went blank

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,760
Too many features something damn man that sucks

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,860
You know every time I get to a point where I'm like this is it and then then something happens to me in production

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,620
I'm like shit. I can't use this. This is no good. This is no good

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,460
And you know it's really what really sucks is now. I think I'm getting the point where I'm gonna have to restart X

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,980
Hmm, which could screw up HDMI capture which could mess up the stream is gonna close all my tabs which Chrome will likely reopen

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,100
But I had things played and paused in certain positions

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,620
I had certain pages zoomed in like I took about 15 minutes saying all that up

18
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,800
So I'm gonna lose about 15 minutes of work, and I may lose HDMI capture

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,060
Slow down before you do that. I tell you why to restart only plasma 5 there is oh yeah

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,500
Well if if it could take input, but well, maybe I could try also to get all tough to and it will always work

21
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,380
Ah, and I just gotta get you the command can give it to me. I'll tell you what this is no good

22
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,700
This is no good. No good because it always happens to me when I'm messing around with plasmoids. That's always when it happens

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,180
It's just you like that word though. I don't even know if I'm saying I'm right. There's plasma widgets

24
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,220
All right, so there is a command to restart plasma 5 yes. Yes. I'm just grabbing it

25
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,620
Don't go whoa whoa whoa look at that. There's Chrome so apparently the well

26
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,520
I'm using a totally different task switcher all of a sudden look at that. It's the one on the side

27
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,120
Wow, so there's all my tabs. You can see I'm gonna lose

28
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,140
Nicely set up, and I'm sorry you didn't lose these that's the good thing. Yes, I am just opening up

29
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,940
Okay, I have a shell script. That's why it seems like is there like if I just type restart

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Restart the computer nope

31
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,340
That's not the one wow this guy indexes like a son-of-a-bitch man

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,780
It's pulling out it's pulling out notes for I'd have from clients from like years back in my text. Yeah, okay. I'm ready

33
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,980
I'm gonna put it in IRC. Okay, okay, okay?

34
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,740
Don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go

35
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,820
All right, so let's see let's wait for it to come up in IRC

36
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,500
Okay, so I got it. I got a kill to come I gotta run two commands

37
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:40,260
Okay, no all right so P. So P kill f plasma shell, but that sounds dirty doesn't it all right so here

38
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,180
I'll pull it up on screen so you guys can see what happens

39
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,620
So I'm gonna put that in there P a P kill dash f plasma shell okay ran that and

40
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,420
Then now I got it now so nothing happened, but it's probably fault of two

41
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,820
Okay, alt-f two, and then I have to do what case start

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,020
Okay, so

43
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:04,140
Plasma shell dash dash shut up. Yeah, I know that that's stupid. I love that just means don't spit out all kinds of debug

44
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,140
I love it. I love it. Tell me shut up

45
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,420
Okay, so now I have I

46
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,820
Think I have my desk now look at isn't this weird these plasmas showed up on here that I wasn't using before

47
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,340
hmm, and they're blank

48
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,660
That's weird. Yeah, it is

49
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,460
But I have my dry have my dropbox icon down in the system tray. Hey yeah, there you go, so thank you, sir

50
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,860
No, no problem

51
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,340
I have that in a shell and use your local bin and

52
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:34,180
Every once in a while plasma will just freak right out so now all those widgets just disappeared when I opened up the drawer

53
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,780
Isn't that weird that's very strong. I'm glad you guys are seeing this. It's not just me

54
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,340
We would never believe you but the CPU monitors back which I thought was gone last time

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,060
I logged in I'm gonna stop playing with the plasma isn't dropbox icon. We're hanging out. Yeah, well

56
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,780
Thank you for helping me fix that. It's nice to not have to lose work. I

57
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,860
Like I like being able to recover on the fly. It feels very like Hollywood

58
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,940
Yeah, right, you know like reroute the primary operating system guys

59
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,380
Yeah

60
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:03,300
You know like I remember I was watching 24 one time and Jack Bauer asked Chloe to rewrite to reroute the primary operating system

61
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,180
There's something like that. I was like, I don't know what that means, but that sounds cool

62
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,220
I don't think they think that is anything

63
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,900
You know the thing I used to love from 24 was when he'd say send it to my screen

64
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,380
Yeah, and they're just like grab hold of a window and throw it across the room. Yeah

65
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,100
Yeah, I want that. I'm still waiting on that

66
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,580
Well, actually there was a package

67
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,180
we used to take the piss out of a friend of mine because he was the Debian maintainer for a package called xmove and

68
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,420
Xmove is a program that can do that and has been around for years and years and years, but I think it's broken now

69
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:38,200
But yeah, you could do that. You could send up an X program from one screen to another. This is Linux Unplugged episode

70
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
137 for March 22nd

71
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,420
2016

72
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,260
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating William Shatner's birthday

73
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:04,460
And has a few surprises up its sleeve like a huge box. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Do you like that one?

74
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,860
Oh, yeah, I was getting into that one. I was riding the jankies on that one

75
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,780
So coming up on this week's episode huge show big show unbelievable show get out of here. We're gonna have to charge you

76
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:19,500
It's so big Nvidia claims. They have Wayland working on their current driver, but that might be a little bit presumptuous

77
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,360
We'll tell you why later on in the show major major plans including a big Linux build coming up for Jupiter

78
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,660
Broadcasting right around Linux Fest Northwest. We're gonna tell you about a couple of secret projects that are in the works and big plans

79
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,660
around Linux Fest Northwest and

80
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,580
I'm gonna get psyched up about Noah's switching campaign then later on in the show

81
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,560
Happy birthday, Katie. Well, is it their birthday? What do you call it when they have a release because they do it more frequently than

82
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,120
Every nine months. Yeah, that's true. Happy release a day

83
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,620
That doesn't jazz it up for me enough half

84
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,500
Well, we'll come up with something later on the show because we're talking about plasma desktop 5.6

85
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Been running it for a few days it released today

86
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,380
Gonna do a little bit of follow-up

87
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,260
Some people ask some questions since we talked about a Linux action show

88
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,420
We're gonna do some follow-up on those questions Wes. You've been running right here on this rig

89
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,900
Yeah, you're gonna share your thoughts on it. So we'll discuss that also get the mumble rooms take on

90
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,760
We've got a few Katie users in there and then towards the end of the show

91
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,580
We're gonna do a live throwdown of two open source Google Hangouts killers

92
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:24,620
They look like they're better quality more control and use WebRTC and our private and safe and peer-to-peer in the background

93
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,540
So pretty cool show and obviously work on Linux

94
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,780
I guess that's kind of a given too and that's just like

95
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,200
The stuff we're gonna do after all of the updates we have to get into from all the projects we follow and stuff

96
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
That's broken since the Linux action show

97
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,020
Huge show Wes and get started. I was worried that we were gonna have a bad show today

98
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,580
I I got on the air before you got here. I was like we are screwed and

99
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,980
And I why are you telling everyone our secrets Chris? So I you know, so those of you don't know

100
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,500
There's a Wes had been bringing in great brewskis for us to try during the show and I thought well today won't be the day

101
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,820
He's got to go get a burger Rekai to talk to him into getting a burger for him

102
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,620
And I was like, so he's not gonna have time. I mean really good to the network, right?

103
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,980
Well, there's a burger currency within the network and you can buy favors with people by buying them burgers

104
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,940
So you say you've essentially put a burger in your bank

105
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:16,540
So that's not a bad move overall strategically for you down the road. I agree, but I was worried. We wouldn't have any beers and

106
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,480
No beers would be a bad show

107
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,260
It's not because we need the alcohols because it's like, you know how certain athletes have certain routines. They have to follow

108
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,440
You know wear the same underwear that kind of thing

109
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,380
Well, of course we're doing that too

110
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,180
but on top of that we like to have one beard or you know with the show and this week Wes brought him something really kind

111
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,740
of eclectic and

112
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,980
It's ecliptic. It's ecliptic brewing and I got the orbiter IPA and you got

113
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,660
Phobos single hop red ale. Damn. Damn

114
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,620
So those would be the brewskis

115
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,200
We're drinking on today's show if you want to drink along with us and maybe just maybe some folks in a mobile room will be

116
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
time appropriate greetings mumble room

117
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,660
That's on fire, I love it you guys are fired up ready to go. Okay, so you probably heard the news

118
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,420
It broke on the 21st NVIDIA has published patches for its driver to work with Wayland's Weston, you know

119
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,500
essentially the the reference compositor and

120
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,260
They've made a few tweaks in there and they're pretty happy. They say that this this set of patches

121
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,580
Will allow the Wayland Weston composite run with NVIDIA's new 364 Linux driver series

122
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,780
It's a big deal big deal Wayland support. Ladies and gentlemen, here we are

123
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,860
March 22nd 2016 NVIDIA ships Wayland support

124
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,320
This gets real

125
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,620
Yeah, it felt like a moment for me. However

126
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,020
Not to be a buzzkill but Martin the KWIN maintainer posted on

127
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,420
Google+, that one does not simply run Wayland on Wayland compositor with NVIDIA's new driver. It turns out that

128
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,920
NVIDIA is using EGL streams instead of GBM streams. Okay, what's that mean?

129
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,300
It means that there is code that still is pending in Wayland

130
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,060
To make Wayland work better with EGL

131
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,740
And so really it's coming to Wayland to support EGL and the things that it needs for NVIDIA's driver changes

132
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,460
But NVIDIA's patches essentially accommodate for a Wayland that's just a little bit down the road

133
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,320
Not actually fully shipping just yet from what I'm grokking from this Google plus thread

134
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:22,220
So while yes NVIDIA gets the headline of shipping Wayland support today. They're shipping support really for Wayland of tomorrow

135
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,020
I suppose that's better than being behind

136
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:30,580
Totally totally is better than being behind and I think I don't know much but I suspect that's probably a better arrangement from for mobile

137
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,020
Too I suspect there you go. And I mere support might have been in there too. I don't know

138
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:41,320
I didn't see people got Plymouth working a lot better now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So in between shows

139
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,720
a

140
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,760
Bit of a controversy and if anybody in the mumbo room has anything they want to say what we're talking about this story

141
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,680
Feel free to speak up. Just tag me in the chat room with mum and say what you want

142
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:57,400
I'll keep an eye out but I why don't I stop covering these these hardware these hardware server updates from the

143
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,560
From the guys over at valve because you know, you don't really ever know how how reliable it is

144
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,880
you don't really know like what triggers it and

145
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,880
You can't really compare it to without knowing all of the details

146
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,480
But that doesn't stop the press from running stories that Linux gaming is shrinking since the launch of we hate games so much

147
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,880
Yeah, Linux users hate spending money Linux users hate playing video games and Linux gaming is doomed

148
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,980
That was the end of last week this week

149
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,440
However, thanks to Liam over at Linux gaming the article has been reversed over a PC world

150
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,000
In fact, the author of the Linux is dying

151
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,640
Chris Hoffman has now written a piece saying the Linux gaming is actually much healthier than Steam's hardware survey implies

152
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,360
There's actually more Linux gamers than ever before. That's great. That is great

153
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,840
Now here's the kind of the basic things you have to understand when people are talking about that steam hardware survey and the the percentage

154
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,720
of Linux users

155
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,780
Well, first of all, do you know do you know what triggers that hardware survey? I do not I'm not completely clear either

156
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:03,040
But I do understand that a hardware change does and an OS change can sometimes and I guess from my understanding is it seems to happen

157
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,680
A lot more under Windows than it does under Linux like maybe driver changes or video card changes. I

158
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,840
Have only gotten the steam hardware survey once under Linux. Yeah, I have gotten under Windows a couple of times

159
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:22,120
And what's crazy about that is I've probably ran Windows three times four times, you know, at least in a steam capacity

160
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,600
In as many years, so the fact that I have actually got a Linux every day

161
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,520
Yeah, and that yeah, and I on some of my machine steam auto starts

162
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,760
So it's weird that I haven't gotten the hardware survey under Linux, but I have gotten under Windows

163
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,180
We don't know anything about the sampling rates or any. Yeah

164
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,780
So here's the obvious caveat though. That's really the elephant in the room

165
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Steam's user base is constantly growing

166
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,640
So while the Linux usage on the steam hardware survey has declined from about 2% in March of 2013

167
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,640
to

168
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,440
0.9 1% in February 2015

169
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,480
That's because it's just a small percentage from a larger overall user base and October 2013

170
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,280
Valve announced there were over 65 million steam users around the world in February of 2015. So that was October 2013

171
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,360
65 million in February 2015 valve announced there were over 125 million active users worldwide

172
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,520
Whoa, they doubled in less than a year. So that's it. Yeah, so it took it

173
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,180
Look, it looks you look at you're looking at percentages here in October 2013. You had

174
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,960
0.98 percent of Linux users. That's about six hundred thirty seven thousand Linux users in February 2015

175
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:33,580
0.9 1% would be 1.2 million Linux gamers. So we've gone up to 1.2 million Linux gamers

176
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Here's the other things kind of crazy

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,480
Valve's steam hardware survey doesn't include steam OS what and doesn't include machines in big picture mode. Oh

178
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,920
So if you've built your own steam OS box and use big picture mode

179
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,620
Or if you like that UI better and you use that under Linux or you're using steam OS

180
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
You're not getting counted towards Linux

181
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:01,160
So that's another reason why the numbers are a little low which is a little funky and valve doesn't really publish much. Go ahead. I

182
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,160
guess people just

183
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
That were using Linux

184
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,280
To play steam now use team OS a lot of people did the experiment in like and kids in you want to point something out

185
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Too that actually is kind of common for Linux gamers

186
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,120
yeah, one of the things that I find that I have to do to play the games that I want I have to run it and

187
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,200
Wine and I don't know if steam has a way of counting

188
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,440
Users that are running in wine and saying hey, this is not actually a Windows user. This is a

189
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,360
Linux user running it at wine and

190
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,480
That's a very important detail. Yeah wine users get counted as Windows users

191
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Val mentioned that before and the Linux

192
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,440
Gaming on Linux community has mentioned that this are the hardware survey seems to pop up more under wine because to steam it looks like

193
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,920
Your OS our hardware is changing sometimes. So yeah, that can be a thing

194
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,520
Any other thoughts on the steam OS stuff?

195
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:54,720
I mean

196
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,600
I guess I wanted to just my point in bringing this up on the show today

197
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,960
Was to sort of put a little anti spin on the whole Linux gaming is dying. It's actually grown from

198
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,340
700,000 to 1.2 million in the last year. That's a pretty big deal

199
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,440
It's like one of those things kind of like with political polls where yeah a lot of the reporting spins

200
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,080
How you think about it? Go ahead run. Yeah, I only ever use Linux for gaming anyway, and I've never seen

201
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:27,840
I've never seen a single hardware survey on Linux for my for my usage in six years. Yeah, I've seen it once I think

202
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,280
So yeah, yeah, you're right. It's just different stats and stuff like that

203
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,440
Okay, so this is the story that people brought up right before we started the show

204
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
He said you got to talk about this today. You got to talk about

205
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,840
Ubuntu BSD

206
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
Unix for human beings

207
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:47,240
today with they write we have the great pleasure in their opinion of introducing you to a new project that saw the light of

208
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,160
The internet for the first time this past week on March 12 2016 meet Ubuntu BSD

209
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,080
Ubuntu BSD promises to bring the power of FreeBSD kernel to Ubuntu Linux

210
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,900
It is based on FreeBSD 10.1 and Ubuntu 15.10 right now

211
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,600
And of course it's one of its a highlight Cadillac features is it's using the FreeBSD kernel ergo

212
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,000
you get the famous ZFS combined with of course things like

213
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,680
the port system and I

214
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,440
would imagine

215
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Ubuntu's user land

216
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,680
Ubuntu BSD is currently hosted on SourceForge, and it's got an ISO you could download we have linked in the show notes and

217
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
the code name for this release is

218
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,800
Escape from systemd but systemd is misspelled you're right it is I mean you wouldn't expect the BSD crowd to know that

219
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,720
It's a little bit of a Linux nuance. I agree

220
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,400
Yeah

221
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,600
You think if you're actually so that as the register points out one of the genesis of this distribution

222
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,120
Was to break away from to be a savior from FreeBSD

223
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,160
I'm sorry from systemd the systemd argument was you know remember how hot that was remember how what a big deal that was yeah

224
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,640
That was one of the reasons they created this was to save the world from systemd

225
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,820
So you think if they're creating a project to save the world from systemd?

226
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:09,100
You'd likely look into it a little probably know how to write it. It's in that is an interesting observation

227
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,860
But they did it deliberately. Yeah, they clearly don't like this a bit right in the face

228
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,280
That's why they create with a big D. Yeah, they did do it with a big D

229
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:26,220
2016 do you host a project on SourceForge? That was why I did specifically mention that just to see if anybody would catch that

230
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,200
I probably I'm dying to know what you think of Ubuntu BSD

231
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,280
Is there gonna be a trademark issue here? Do you think?

232
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,240
Sorry, I saw that on the the thread was on the WMBSD mailing list where it was first discussed and that's where it first

233
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,680
came to

234
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,120
my knowledge

235
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,240
And I think I've read all the mails in the thread and some of the the guy

236
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,640
John Bowden who created it was asked when there'd be a trademark issue

237
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,280
And I think definitely avoided that question or didn't see it or whatever for the benefit of the doubt

238
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,120
Um, I don't know. It's a community project

239
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,520
So much like Ubuntu Marte

240
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:14,560
It probably should be called something like Ubuntu BSD remix or something like that, which would you know fulfill the the naming conventions?

241
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,160
We use now but

242
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,680
No, I don't see there's gonna be a massive deal about it. I uh, I wonder what your thoughts are just on the concept a little bit

243
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,520
I

244
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,360
Think is interesting and I think it actually is a good thing because it highlights how people can take

245
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,400
what we've done in the Ubuntu project and remix it and change it and

246
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Make it to what they want

247
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,080
You know if someone wants if there's a demand for this if there are a bunch of users out there who feel

248
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:46,640
that there is a need that's serviced by this to have Ubuntu user land and all those the lovely big package repository that we've got

249
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,280
Plus the BSD kernel then knock yourselves out go for it

250
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,040
I personally speaking I think is a great idea and I think it's it's very positive thing

251
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,520
I think what initially turned me off about it was the

252
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,440
Sort of overreaction to system D and I'm not in the trenches

253
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,280
So I don't really know if it's been I have heard from some admins that say yeah

254
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,840
our life is a little more hell now because of system D and I've heard other guys say that

255
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,980
My life is a lot easier now because of system D. So I'm really I don't have a clear picture of it, but it seems like

256
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,120
It seems like a lot of the naysaying the gloom and doom

257
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,200
Really hasn't

258
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,880
Occurred. I mean things really have just kind of gone along as they always have now

259
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,040
I mean, I think we'll still see, you know, this it'll be a big deployment for system D machines. Yeah that space

260
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
But yeah, yeah, that's true. That is true

261
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,220
So yeah, go ahead. They're using XFC for this, right? Yes

262
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,360
Why not just use free BSD with XFC using like package ng?

263
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,120
Yeah, you could my question you could yeah why even bother with it

264
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,000
I wonder if this would help with the curve of the like Linux emulations like this would be a better way for some of the stuff

265
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,520
I doubt it was trying to do because you're still using the BSD kernel

266
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,320
So you'd have to be able to compiling things for the first toolchain anyway

267
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,880
So it's not even like it's the same toolchain or something. Yeah, well there is it

268
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,160
There is one reason you do it. It has the word Ubuntu in it

269
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,320
There you go. That's true. Yeah. Hmm. There you go. Hey everybody. It's got a moon doing it. So it must be good

270
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,440
interesting project and I kind of will I think would be interested in checking in on it and say I

271
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't know six months and see where they're at. Maybe see if they base it on 1604

272
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,160
It depends on to you like it's always weird when there's something like it's just like a source forge release and some mailing list stuff

273
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,200
It doesn't feel as much like a project that I will want to check up on it

274
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,340
It doesn't have like a actual infrastructure or a page where you get like real communication from the creator

275
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,160
It basically you you project snob

276
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,520
There are lots of little projects out there that use whatever hosting they can use

277
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
just because it doesn't have a

278
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,120
You know a fantastic Twitter page and you know

279
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:55,120
Discourse and it does have a Twitter page actually things, right? Yeah, but I mean like a wonderfully beautiful one. Yeah

280
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,720
I'm not gonna use it in my infrastructure until I know there's more than one package, you know

281
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,400
Of course, you're not gonna yeah in your infrastructure. Yeah, I would agree

282
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,680
I think if it grew a bit and got a community around it'd be worth checking out

283
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,240
I don't think you have to wait till it's like PCB SD size. No

284
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,440
Which is kind of interesting because PCB SD is grown quite a bit

285
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,200
So Ubuntu BSD at Ubuntu BSD and it's followed by poppy. So look at that. Whoa. Yeah. Yeah

286
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,920
I was following it when I only had 11 followers. Wow. Look at you now now I'm following it when it has

287
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,720
338 followers, so yeah, I like it. So I say now yeah

288
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,340
Kitson I wanted to give you the final word on it before we move on

289
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:46,860
Yeah, they said I believe was William that said oh, it's Ubuntu and that's why they're doing it

290
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,780
And that's why somebody would use it

291
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:55,620
I also think that the familiarity with the base OS would also be a big push as well because it is Ubuntu

292
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,020
Not necessarily the name but a lot of people know how to admin Ubuntu

293
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:06,960
That would like to use some of those lower level features in BSD. Yeah, and that's just a good way of you know

294
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,420
Getting it out there. It's not going to be because you don't have system D

295
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,680
Which Ubuntu and you definitely don't have upstart which Ubuntu would have had in the past

296
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:23,300
Yeah, and and fast instead of a traditional file system on Linux. Yeah, you're not gonna there's a lot of things

297
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,640
You don't get there's a lot of things. You're not gonna get you're not gonna get Docker or containers. You'll get jails, which is fine

298
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,900
It does feel like a kind of hybrid bastard child of two projects or like three or four projects really doesn't it?

299
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:40,220
Yeah, and I I'm I wonder too what happens when when FreeBSD finally gets around to developing their system D

300
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,760
You know, it's gonna happen and then where are all those guys gonna go where everybody needs a refuge from that

301
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,500
Where are they gonna go? Where are they gonna go? Gentoo? Slackware? Lumos?

302
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,420
No, this is just the dev one version of BSD

303
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,820
Yeah, you're right. You're right. I know I know I just tease a little bit. Yeah, I tease

304
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,060
Interesting discussion though and a project probably worth some of you keeping your eyes on

305
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,780
So if you end up trying out Ubuntu BSD

306
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:11,580
I welcome you to let us know let us let us know comment in the in the reddit thread or even better

307
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,300
You could join us

308
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,460
In the mobile room in a future edition of the unplugged show. Hmm

309
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,700
Ubuntu BSD, you know West

310
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:26,420
My problem is I got a lot going on these next few weeks Linux fest Northwest is getting crazy

311
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,780
Angela and I have like a little lie, you know meeting to this morning right after a tech talk and we were just going down

312
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,540
The list constantly. Okay, we gotta think about this. We got to take care of this. We gotta work on this

313
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,500
We got to make sure this is ready

314
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:43,700
it is nuts and part of it is because like we have very few opportunities where so many of the crew are in one spot right and

315
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,340
Because we all are fairly technically savvy. You can really pull off some cool projects

316
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,540
so like there's not only is there like the the Linux fest stuff and the

317
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,420
organization of getting everybody in here and getting this place ready to like bring a bunch of people in and

318
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:03,420
then figuring out like a whole bunch of accommodations for Linux fest Northwest and the booth and the technology to make that all happen and

319
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,180
The scheduling and coordinating needs to happen with the Linux fest people

320
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,220
But on top of all of that

321
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:14,540
We're gonna pull off a really cool project something that will change JB and bring way more Linux into this area right here

322
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:21,500
You're looking at over there where there's that wire cast machine. It's gross. I just don't look at it West super excited

323
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,380
I might be biting off more than I can chew and I I pain to tell you how many Bitcoin it has cost me

324
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,900
But first before we get into this new project the new secret project. I want to tell you about ting

325
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:39,120
Yes, ting ting is my mobile service provider and it's mobile that makes sense minutes messages megabytes and six dollars a month for the line

326
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,180
That's all you pay. No secret crazy plans. No dumb rollover gimmicks

327
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:49,340
It's just you pay for what you use for minutes messages and megabytes and a flat six dollars for the line

328
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,060
They have fanatical customer service. They have GSM and CDMA networks

329
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,620
So you can get probably at least a high probability that your device will be compatible with ting

330
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,380
Which means you'll get a $25 service credit average ting monthly line is $24

331
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,100
So your first month will be more than paid for if you're in a contract right now. They have early termination reliefs. Oh

332
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:14,420
Guess what? No contracts and no early termination. Hey, that's right phones are unlocked

333
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,140
You own them outright West you own that phone outright and they have the best control panel in the business

334
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,820
As we get ready to go pick up ham radio for Linux fest Northwest. I'll be bringing my ting hotspot

335
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,820
I just turn it off when I'm not on the road

336
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,460
Doesn't cost me a dollar. It's great turn it on and I just for that road trip. I use that hotspot

337
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,660
Okay, so what's it gonna cost me?

338
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,580
Cuz you know just be paying from I'm paying for my usage

339
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:40,740
So I go from not paying anything to like 35 45 bucks for one month

340
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,620
Average is out pretty nicely. Yeah, it does. Yeah, I mean, you know

341
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,980
I do that every couple of months it works so smooth and their control panel lets me turn it on and off

342
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,540
I invite you to go check it out. They also have a great blog, but first go to Linux dot ting comm

343
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,660
They have our app picks up on their blog

344
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,760
They have great great 4k online hints if you have a if you have a 4k television

345
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,260
I want to do online streaming your cord cutter and want to watch 4k. They got a great blog post on that

346
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:10,340
They have information on fiber internet. I mean, it's a great company backed by two cows who've been around for a long time

347
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:17,360
Linux dot ting comm go there support this show visiting that visiting that page letting them know you heard about it here

348
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,960
Supports the show try out their savings calculator. See if it's worth your money read their blog get to know more about the company

349
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,640
See why I like them so much Linux dot ting comm and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program

350
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,980
We love you guys. You think I'm chatty. I

351
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:41,540
Think so. Yeah, Jonathan riddle said I was chatty. That's not necessarily a bad thing though. No, no, I suppose not but I mean you are

352
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:47,320
A Linux I do talk personality. Yeah, kind of have to be I guess that's a lot quieter

353
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,020
You sure you're not trying to make me feel better cuz chatty feels like a bad description

354
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,080
Maybe I don't get well

355
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,360
I mean if you're like the noisy person in the office bothering everyone while they're trying to get work done

356
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,260
But this is your office. Yeah, you know, yeah wimpy. Do you think I'm chatty wimpy?

357
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,080
He's not answer he's left but he authorized me to say oh, do you think I'm chatty? Yeah. Okay, so it define chatty for me

358
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
I

359
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,720
Doesn't like there being dead air. Oh true. It's probably a fair. Yeah

360
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,160
Approximation. Yeah, if there's ever dead air

361
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:25,440
It's intentional dead air because that feels like a left feels like an American broadcasting golden rule though. You don't ever let there be dead air

362
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,560
Informal and lively. Yeah, that sounds nice. Yeah. Yeah, would you look it up? Well naturally you did

363
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,160
Yeah, I I guess I'll take that accusation, you know

364
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:43,720
every now and then though I go for the opposite effect and I let I let there be a pregnant pause just for

365
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,920
Effect so sometimes it's worth it. All right. Yeah, fine. Thank you. All right. I will so let's chat. Let's be chatty

366
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,960
Let's chat about Linux fest Northwest. So you guys know about I've talked about it a bunch and I won't I won't bore you

367
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,280
With the details. It's April 23rd and 24th. So it's next month. It's in Bellingham, which is a gorgeous

368
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,000
How long was the last time you went to Bellingham?

369
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,360
Mmm, probably like six months ago. Oh, that's actually pretty recently for how far it is from you

370
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
It really is beautiful though. Good

371
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,080
Super gorgeous super gorgeous hippie town

372
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,920
You got a while there might be some clouds of weed smoke. You gotta watch out for that

373
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,020
And I walk through one on your way to a restaurant. Yeah, that's true. So

374
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,680
I'm really looking forward to this and one of the things that we kind of did this year

375
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,720
it came out of our visit to system 76 is

376
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,360
Emma and Noah are thrown down and I first I hem and hawt about this and then I decided

377
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,000
Maybe we should really go crazy with this because like we're just switch this

378
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,480
I mean the end goal is to switch people to Linux right? So why not just go all out and have some fun with this? And

379
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,640
I don't have all like it all worked out yet cuz it's no way, you know, he's too busy

380
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,760
Yep, I should have brought him in for the show so I could put him in on the spot

381
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,920
But I feel like it's not calling him on here. Yeah. Oh, yeah

382
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,280
You should start calling him on here. Yeah. Oh, you call him. That'd be so funny

383
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,760
I

384
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,360
Feel like we got to get some of this stuff squared away and I want to go all-in on on making this work

385
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:13,200
So the goal here is handed to her Emma and Noah Emma from system 76 and Noah are gonna try to convert as many people to

386
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Linux and and get them switched over and happy with Linux now when they both have different approaches

387
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,280
Emma's gonna be giving away swag to people who switch we're gonna bring stickers and swag and Noah's gonna have SSDs. Whoa

388
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:31,120
Yeah, now here's what I learned and I'm not even joking with you. This is this is legit honest to God

389
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,760
I learned this Emma is doing a frickin dry run in Denver before she comes out. No way

390
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,400
She's doing like a practice run to get herself ready

391
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,800
So that way she's got like all the right moves and stuff Noah's life is basically a practice run though. So that's true

392
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
That's a good point, but I'm telling you

393
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,840
You better be prepared. Yeah, and so you and I quick a brainstorm

394
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,080
I'm also I've told him he should contact the local Linux users group up there

395
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:02,280
And other things like that and I'm hoping that maybe the listener Jed and Angela can maybe work because Jed's from up there

396
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:08,040
I'm gonna call some like local IT guys people unhappy with their computers bring their clients around. That's really good

397
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,080
That's really good or put that in slack. That's really good. But but you know what put a pin on that we need that one

398
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,720
That's good. Yeah, get the local IT or a USB drive that just wipes their whole computer and puts Linux on that's the other

399
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,360
I want to take it up a notch and we we have we're bringing a whole where here's my thoughts

400
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,880
We're bringing the crew in right? So we're gonna give jobs to the crew during this time. We're gonna go all in

401
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,760
It's gonna be a network-wide effort. We're gonna have people go out in the audience and like grab people

402
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,520
I don't know where we're ever at restaurants library bar at Linux fest

403
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:41,960
We're gonna have people go out into the crowd and like pre-screen and get likely candidates and and have them funnel them into Noah

404
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,360
So that he can sit there and rapid convert people. So we're gonna have the crew do preliminary work

405
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,360
I don't think she's gonna be doing I probably shouldn't be telecasting too much. I got other plans. He's not listening

406
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,200
Well, she she can't compete with we're gonna bring the army and the weight of the broadcasting network down on this thing

407
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,400
And there is a crew. There is a critical component that we are launching today

408
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,520
To help us with this effort and to help you with this effort

409
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,600
Teespring.com slash. Here's the thing. It is a brand new t-shirt hoodie and long-sleeve shirt

410
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,920
We're hoping to raise some funds for our efforts over at Linux fest and we're doing it now

411
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,280
So that way you'd actually have in time

412
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,680
To wear at Linux fest if you want to meet up with us and become part of our crew or just get it for yourself

413
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,200
Here it is. Look at this beauty West it reads on the front

414
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,200
By popular demand. It has a nice classy last breast logo over the wear that anywhere. Yeah on the front

415
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,520
It's nice and classy and we have multiple colors. We also have the hoodie and

416
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,960
We have the long-sleeve at teespring.com slash. Here's the thing and then on the back

417
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:51,020
It says here's the thing dot-dot-dot and then our last tux we're holding the Jupiter broadcasting rocket

418
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,020
Here's the thing

419
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Do you have a minute to talk about?

420
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,380
Linux that's great

421
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,160
This is your opening line to get people to convert to Linux right here

422
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,920
And if you if you want to grab it now

423
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,940
We're it's gonna go for 13 more days 5 hours 17 minutes

424
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:12,080
And it should ship in time for Linux fest Northwest or to have on your own and the funds for this will go towards

425
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,700
Supporting bringing people out here getting I mean just beginning

426
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,800
I mean, this is a massively expensive thing that we're doing but we got we can't run too far into the red

427
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,000
So we got to start something here. Plus this is an awesome shirt

428
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,680
We've had people been asking to have the logo on the front smaller because otherwise it's like this monster

429
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
It's as mastered like huge

430
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,020
Advertisement billboard on your belly. And so now we've got a logo over the breast pocket area

431
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,820
There's no breast pocket but in that general area and on the back

432
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,360
Big tux, isn't that awesome? And if you didn't want to show that break wear a jacket

433
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,320
But so teespring.com slash here's the thing three more needed to be ordered for it to ship

434
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,960
13 days total

435
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
This is part one. This is phase one

436
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,820
We'll be giving these out and will be probably there may be a special edition at Linux fest, too

437
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,800
If you have one you may be qualified for a special edition. We'll see I've talked to Angie about that teespring.com slash

438
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:08,640
Here's the thing. So that's phase one, right? That's phase one phase two is we got to change up a little software

439
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,780
We got to make a little front-end back-end change to get ready for this

440
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,640
Last time I went on the road trip. I used something called silver cloud to track my trip

441
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,500
So you could go to broadcast no columns last rover and watch where I'm going Chris creep on me

442
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,000
That was a proprietary piece of hardware and I want to switch over to using something open source

443
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,360
So, you know something run like on a mobile device and Poby I know didn't you play with track car Poby?

444
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,620
No, it wasn't me. I wrote my own. Oh, you did write your own now

445
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,620
Oh because it was running on Ubuntu, huh?

446
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,440
Yeah, it would have run on any phone, but I happen to write a problem, too

447
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,720
And so I'm looking at track car

448
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,160
I don't know. Did now did you look at track car before you wrote your own tracking or did you just say?

449
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,040
Yeah, this is easy enough. I just looked at yours and thought that was cool. I should read

450
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,380
Yeah, and I of course I just went the easy button I wanted a dedicated piece of hardware

451
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,560
But now now I'm thinking okay, I could probably make it work on the phone

452
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,160
So there's two projects and I'd like to the audience if anybody in the audience has tried this track car trac car

453
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,760
It is an open source GPS tracking system for various different types of devices

454
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,760
It could work on hardware or in my case on mobile and then it reports back to your own server

455
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,400
That you could be running anywhere, right? You could be running droplet or whatever

456
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,720
And then it lets you embed like a Google Map of your position

457
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,320
So that's track car and then Wes you found own tracks own

458
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,440
Tracks is a different project that allows you to keep track of your own location

459
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,840
And you can have a you could share it with just certain people or I could publicly I could publicly publish it

460
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,000
it's also open source and uses open protocols and

461
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Looks to be a little more mobile focused

462
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,240
Yeah, and it also is more like social networking focus

463
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,720
Like if you're looking at the app like you can see your friends on the map, right?

464
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,600
So I'm feeling like track car might be the better likes you want to meet up with all your JB friends

465
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
Well, that would be cool too, but I don't need to track their location

466
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,520
Yeah, you know they can track mine, but I don't need to track theirs

467
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,160
I kind of want to set up a track server on a digital ocean droplet

468
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,360
I hate asking this but if anybody out there is has experience doing this and wants to save me time and

469
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,220
Then just transfer me the droplet. I would totally love that because I got a lot coming up for Linux fest. So track car

470
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:20,880
Is I think how I'll do my live rover tracking so I don't have to pay for that proprietary solution

471
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:27,160
You have like ten phones in your pocket. Yeah. Well, yeah, and I'm trying to get as much Linux and open-source into Lady Jupiter as possible

472
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,520
So every part where I have a proprietary hardware solution or software. I'm trying to put something that's awesome

473
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,440
So track car org if anybody knows how to set that up and wants to set me up one, that'd be awesome

474
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,680
Otherwise, I'll try to get to it before they go pick up ham. So one of the things we're doing is

475
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,400
the weekend before

476
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,200
Linux fest Northwest

477
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,680
Where Noah if all goes as planned should be in town

478
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,760
Arriving Saturday night to do Linux action show Sunday in studio

479
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,160
Then we'll complete Linux action show in studio Sunday. We may do it early

480
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,320
Hit the road in Lady Jupiter head over to Idaho

481
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,960
Meet up with ham. Yeah

482
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Then potentially on the way back

483
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:12,040
There are rumors afoot that we may meet up with a few other JB audience members and do like a caravan back

484
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,360
From from Idaho. That sounds awesome. Yeah, it really does sound awesome

485
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,360
So the track car would be tracking all of that. So we're getting all of that set up right now

486
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,520
It should be yeah, right. Lady Jupiter is the rover. So like you have

487
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,800
Function the rover and you have the name of current rover, which is Lady Jupiter. Okay

488
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,840
part of our secret

489
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Linux fest Northwest plans

490
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,840
Are contained in this box West. Did you see this box when you walked in? No, I missed it. It's very secretive

491
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:46,280
You missed this box. It's right over there. I was delivering hamburgers and beers and beer. That's true. All right

492
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,280
I'll give you credit there. Oh, that's true

493
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,280
I uh

494
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,760
I have had a heck of a time with video and sometimes when power goes out we lose episodes because the best days. Mm-hmm

495
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,560
when power goes out, uh, so we

496
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,080
Oh boy

497
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,160
I know what everybody I'm you know what i'm stopping myself because i'm realizing all of the emails i'm going to get

498
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
Why don't you use a ups? Why don't you have?

499
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,800
I don't have a ups on our main broadcasting machine because in the past has been introducing buzz to our audio

500
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,800
So I removed a ups from our main broadcasting machine, which means when the power goes out

501
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,560
You lose the recording because the way the video files are written to hard disks

502
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,320
they

503
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:26,520
They close out the atom file at the end of the video file and if you don't write that atom file properly

504
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:32,280
The rest of the video is unusable. There are some recovery tools, but they suck and pretty much only work for mp4s not

505
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
lossless video

506
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,600
And this has sucked so bad because we we've lost hours of content before and um

507
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,040
Because it can get stormy here in the pacific northwest. That's like a thing and

508
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
so what we're going to do

509
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
is uh

510
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,520
Build a new solution build a new solution based on linux and obs

511
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,040
obs

512
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,400
and uh

513
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,320
So last week, I think it might have been after linux unplugged. I can't remember

514
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:06,840
You know, I've I uh, i've always sort of as a hobby followed bitcoin for a while. I did plan b as a podcast and um,

515
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
i've always been pretty good at

516
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,520
i've always been pretty good at watching when bitcoin bitcoin rises and when bitcoin falls, what is it right now?

517
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,240
Let's check it out. Yeah, will you check out? What is the bitcoin price right now if I uh,

518
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:26,040
Too bad you uh, let's see. So we're 19 29 4 16 at coinbase right now. And uh, what'd you see?

519
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,040
Well, this is bitcoin average 4 19 4 19. Yeah, that's pretty good

520
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:35,000
So the low has been like around 407 today or 4010 or 410. I mean and the high has been 4 17

521
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,320
So it got around I think it was up at 4 22 bitcoin was and I said to rikai

522
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:44,520
I said because rikai, you know rikai for say is pretty current on on hardware and I said to him

523
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,800
uh

524
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,120
Could you build me a list of a really powerful machine? I gave him all the things I wanted to do

525
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,680
uh and

526
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,200
The one caveat is all these things have to be shipped directly by newegg because if i'm going to pay in bitcoin

527
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,440
And bitcoin is only accepted by newegg when you ship directly from newegg. That's the little catch

528
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,800
Ah

529
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,600
If it's any of their third-party, uh marketer market providers, they don't accept bitcoin

530
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,160
And I wanted to buy this in bitcoin because uh, otherwise i'm i'm poor and uh all your money's in the coin

531
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:23,560
Well, no, but that's where any learning a bit about your portfolio any money I can spend is in bitcoin. Uh, and uh,

532
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,080
So, uh, I look at as a personal investment in the business a little bit

533
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,280
So what I decided to do was uh, I spent quite a bit of bitcoin actually

534
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,840
Um because I figured 425 was probably going to be the high point for a while. So spend while it's high, right?

535
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,440
maybe i'm wrong, but

536
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,800
Uh, my philosophy with bitcoin is is if you see it going up and down if you get it somewhere in the mid average up

537
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Even if it goes up a little bit you did pretty good

538
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,360
And so, uh, I ordered I don't remember all of the details now

539
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,440
I probably should have pulled this up before the show

540
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,000
But uh a six core processor a new motherboard, uh quite a bit of ram

541
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,800
Uh about 32 gigs worth of ram excellent, um ssd m sata m dot

542
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,840
Or 2.5 drives wherever the ones that go into the motherboard instead of uh, like, you know, the regular 2.5 inch

543
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,000
um

544
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,300
nvidia 960 I think gtx graphics

545
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,400
Lots of goodies

546
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,720
And the other thing I did is I bought two of everything

547
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,280
So what we'll do now is we will build two of these machines. That's great identical builds identical software configs

548
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,240
Both installed ready to be obs broadcast machines

549
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
And one will be over there

550
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,480
Doing all of our endpoint broadcasting and recording a real-time backup of the live stream

551
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,840
And then the second build will be sitting under this table the the broadcast the desk here

552
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,600
And if anything ever happens to the main broadcast machine

553
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:47,320
I just unplug the one under the table here and plug in over there and I can start broadcasting again

554
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,320
I have a I have a one-to-one backup

555
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,160
Uh, and that also means down the road

556
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,960
Like if we want to experiment with new crazy versions of obs or linux

557
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,000
We could switch over to the backup one run off that for a couple of days

558
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,720
Do our upgrades and experimentations on the new machine?

559
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,360
Maybe like a new patch or something like that

560
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,400
And if you ever need to you just fail back to the exactly one you haven't touched

561
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,600
It's going to be so so so so nice and it's going to get rid of so many problems of the mac pro caused

562
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,280
Uh, I am majorly looking forward to it. So that's one of the projects

563
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,960
So all of like all of like the little components showed up today in that box

564
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,240
What's still missing is I haven't picked a case. I'd like to have identical nice cases. Yeah

565
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
But I don't want to spend too much on that

566
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,040
and storage because the one thing is is the hardest thing is I don't know if I can really

567
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,920
I don't know if I can buy two sets of storage storage for this thing because the thing needs like two three terabytes

568
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,840
really fast

569
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,840
Maybe even more like five terabytes

570
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,080
Really fast and maybe even more than that if possible and I don't really want to buy two sets of those

571
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,640
So I haven't bought that yet. I haven't gotten a case yet

572
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
There's still a lot I have to buy and it's like

573
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,120
I only I only want to spend so much of my personal money

574
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,600
But the network can't really afford to do it right now

575
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,320
but this I think is going to be such a huge upgrade for us because

576
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,680
on the back end

577
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,440
We're going to rework a ton of stuff the way a ton of stuff works the way we broadcast

578
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,960
We should be it should open us up to a bunch of more streams and then down the road

579
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Hopefully take to our capabilities even further

580
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,400
So it's going to be a nice rig with with six physical cores and then hyper-threading on top of that

581
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,120
We should be able to stream to multiple places do multiple encodings

582
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,520
Live backups all that kind of stuff and then on top of all of that

583
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,160
We should be able to record the build of these things and the configuration of these things and get some content out of it, too

584
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,680
So i'm i'm i'm thinking it's going to be a big huge upgrade for us

585
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,720
And it's going to reduce a bunch of dependency on on on wirecast, which i'm really excited about

586
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,480
So yeah, that's a big call so obs can do it

587
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,000
Well, we'll see

588
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,840
I don't know if it'll handle all the camera switching

589
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:44,120
But it's definitely going to handle all of the streaming all of the master recording and switching of uh live stream to recorded streams

590
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,200
Which even if I just take all of that off of wirecast

591
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:54,600
That itself will make wirecast more stable and reliable and then we can just because a part of the problem is i'd have to

592
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,200
Buy all new capture cards, too

593
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Possibly we will go we what we what I plan to do is take it as far as we can take it

594
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,320
We may try taking the capture cards out of that machine and putting them in the new machine and seeing how far we can

595
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
Take it and if we can go all the way

596
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,240
We would go all the way but there's a lot of little things like green screening and compositing that

597
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,680
Uh, we would need to be able to do like dynamic stuff that

598
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,160
Possible but yeah. Yeah

599
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,920
Really excited about that and so for for us linux fest isn't just about the fest

600
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
And this emma noah competition

601
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,560
But there's also some really cool projects

602
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,440
We're going to be working on that are going to have big long-term improvements for the network down some network technical debt here

603
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,360
So i'm pretty excited so it all is so at least not all of it

604
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,120
I think but a huge chunk of it

605
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,560
It's funny because it's so much money that I spend and then I see it in one box like that

606
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,240
I'm, like I was expecting more boxes makes you feel just poor

607
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,240
but then again like amazon ships boxes within boxes within boxes, so I I guess I

608
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,240
I guess I can't complain too much and I don't know. I don't know. We'll see where it goes

609
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:58,120
Noah's already scheming about the setup. So I think it should be really fun. I know obs can do green screening, uh, but uh,

610
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,680
I'm particular

611
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:06,520
Yeah, oh that's super exciting. Thanks. Yeah, I I'm I it's been it's been a long time since i've had a really new

612
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,880
Uh computer to build right except for with the exception of these lebrons and the apollo

613
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,880
Which has been boom all of a sudden hit at the same time

614
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,760
But uh, you know, my main machine upstairs is like a original first generation i7. Oh wow

615
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,560
Uh, that is a that that broadcast machine. There's a 2012 model, right? So that's an old rig

616
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,100
So all these machines are getting several generations old so to get two of the identical current generation

617
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,440
Machines and build them and the nice thing is when that machine's over under the table acting is just like a backup

618
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,760
I'll use it as like all my visuals

619
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,960
It'll have a nice video card so I can I can show off some nice new steam games

620
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,040
And do you know like 60 frames per second gaming stuff like that, which will be really nice

621
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,680
Get captured you won't have any hardware excuses when your program that you're testing out on air brakes live. Yeah, I am

622
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,840
Uh, I it is it is it's funny, you know, because it's it's one point. It's a little crazy

623
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,400
It's a little scary because i'm I we're we're building up a whole bunch of stuff and i've just spent a whole bunch of money

624
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,360
on it

625
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,720
Uh at the south at the other time though

626
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:05,400
I can't wait to have it all sort of done and just have that stage that i've been waiting on for so many years done

627
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,360
It feels like i'll be checking off a box that has been years in the making i'm really excited about that

628
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,880
Uh, and just rekindle today we're talking about some of the crazy things we're going to be able to do now

629
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:18,280
Um, they're going to make other things that will make some of like the live stream experience smoother

630
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,000
we won't have to like bring the stream down between shows and

631
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,480
Um, but it'll also make it so that way we don't lose content for the released versions, too

632
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,200
So it's like it's going to improve the live streams and the recorded shows and it's going to be used and it's going to be

633
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,960
done using linux

634
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,800
That is awesome. Mm-hmm

635
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,600
I am really pretty super excited really coming along the way. Yeah, well, we'll see

636
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,240
We'll see now the next but the thing is to focus on right now

637
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,920
We got to get as many people switched to linux as possible. We got to come up with a game plan

638
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,920
So if you are in the bellingham area

639
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,160
Which has got to be just a few of you

640
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,720
And you could help us come up with a solid winning game plan where we could take noah and our crew

641
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,040
And interrupt people and not get them upset and convince them to try linux

642
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,360
And the other thing that was thinking is if you're going to linux fest northwest bring a friend who hasn't yet switched

643
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,560
Yeah, because they're going to get an ssd they're going to get swag and they're going to get switched to linux

644
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:12,040
So that's pretty cool and you can help our effort teespring.com slash. Here's the thing. That's a pretty cool shirt, too

645
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,840
I I want the long sleeve one myself. We're selling the t-shirt pretty much at cost

646
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,400
Uh with a slight markup just a real small one to hopefully raise a little bit of funds

647
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:27,720
Uh, I mean someone's got to buy those ssds shipping april 4th, hopefully or uh, not shipping april 4th

648
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:33,400
the uh, teespring campaign ends april 4th and probably printing several days after that to make it in time for

649
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,160
The end of april. So that's at teespring.com slash. Here's the thing

650
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,960
I'm, pretty excited

651
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah, it looks like we meet the threshold to uh ship so yeah awesome. Thanks guys

652
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,760
I think uh, I think this could be a thing that we do at other fests too

653
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,120
like if we could get the formula right we could do like a little sub event where we

654
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,320
You know because a lot of so uh lugs in washington

655
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,120
I would imagine everywhere but lugs everywhere will have um

656
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,660
Uh install fest days. Have you seen this? Absolutely

657
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,040
We have people, you know right there on site

658
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,040
You can ask questions as you're trying to get things set up

659
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,440
We could we could put together that kind of thing and like if this works like we could put together

660
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,560
A meetup and we could get audience members that would help out with the initiative and you know

661
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,380
Because really what you just need is like a production line people bring their laptops in or their desktops

662
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,200
And you know it'd be cool

663
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,640
Like if we really seriously got into this is if we could have like monitors and keyboards and mice there

664
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,200
So they if they want to get their desktop switch, they just bring their tower

665
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,520
They don't bring all their stuff and of course if they're bringing a laptop

666
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,040
It's super easy and get a little networking in there

667
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,280
So that way they could get we could send them home patched

668
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,920
And all that kind of stuff 100 up to date just ask it. Hey what oh my gosh

669
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,720
What are your favorite applications get their icons all set up for them?

670
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,720
Like we could really do this and we could do it like itself. We could do it at scale

671
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,480
We could do it at linux fest northwest

672
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,560
That could be like a really cool thing we do when we go out there and it would always make for great like a little

673
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,720
Like two minute update in the show, too

674
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,320
So anyways, oh, sorry wimpy says he's not i'm sorry wimpy

675
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,560
So anyways really excited about linux fest northwest

676
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,880
You'll probably be hearing obnoxiously more about it

677
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,960
And if you're uh, if you're ham radio

678
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,160
You're really gonna hear more about it because we're gonna be coming your direction ham prepare your body

679
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,120
Put pants on when they get there. We're coming for you

680
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,640
and uh

681
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,520
I got like a few things I got to fix in lady jupiter because you know

682
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:20,040
What i've realized is living in an rv is like living in a boat and there it is a constantly decaying

683
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,920
Object see in a house you you tell yourself that you could live in this thing for 30 years

684
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,360
And you'll just have to fix up a few things here and there but about five ten years into it

685
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,480
You realize there's like tens of thousands of dollars worth of work to do but with an rv

686
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:37,400
Every month there's something to do now. It's not always as big but there's always something so right now

687
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,320
Uh, I can't use my uh microwave when i'm on generator power. Why would you want to?

688
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,720
I can't go pick up ham without a functioning microwave. So I gotta fix that i'm gonna try to fix that tonight after the show

689
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:51,880
And so i'm beginning to repair it to get it ready for the road like each each major voyage you go on

690
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,880
There's like a little something you got to do afterwards

691
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,080
So that's mine is uh fix the uh fix the generator

692
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,040
So that way the microwave and more importantly the electric fireplace work while we're on the road

693
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,520
I mean ham has expectations about the mood in

694
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:12,600
In late jupiter, all right, uh, very good. Very good. So i'm looking forward to that and and uh, you'll probably uh,

695
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,360
Probably see some sort of video update soon with the ham smile and face on it

696
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,800
And more from linux fast northwest and then of course if you can't make it

697
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,080
We will be streaming it live and we'll have a meetup page hopefully launched

698
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,600
Soon. All right. So i'm itching to tell you about something that uh, i'm surprised i'm this happy about

699
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,360
Are you still are you in kd 5.6 right there? Uh, I switched back

700
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,040
But i've been using it. Oh, you are no longer. Yeah, and now i'm trying it out in a virtual machine

701
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,920
Oh, look at you. Look at you. Look at you. Well, okay, so it came out today

702
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,160
So we got to talk about i've been running it for a few days here

703
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,560
And uh, it's easier than ever now to try it

704
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,920
There's like many options and I know we have a few different people trying a few different ways

705
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,000
In the mummer room plus i'll tell you about how i'm trying it and we'll find out how west is trying it too

706
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,320
And how you can try but first

707
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,400
Let's talk about digital ocean

708
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,960
Love digital ocean, uh speaking of some of our plans for linux fest northwest

709
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,080
Yeah, some of them involve spinning up droplets when we go on location

710
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,860
You know if you want to stream to multiple destinations

711
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,480
You could do that from your connection

712
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,880
But if you really want to have high resolution streams

713
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,080
You could consider also streaming from a digital ocean droplet. OBS is very easy to send from one spot to the other in fact

714
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,320
Uh tax syndicate just recently did a video on this

715
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:24,280
We were kind of concocting this solution for our new setup digital ocean droplets are just our go-to infrastructure

716
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,640
You need a linux rig with a super fast connection a blazing fast cpu

717
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,360
That's crazy easy to manage and a beautiful ui to set up

718
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,440
That's digital ocean starts at just five dollars a month. You get 512 megabytes of ram

719
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,920
All ssds the five dollar one gives you a 20 gigabyte ssd with a terabyte

720
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,400
Of transfer and of course their pricing structure just works really simply and it goes up from there

721
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,520
If you just need it for a few hours easy peasy their interface is so simple. You can be a server master

722
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:56,280
Working on servers since servers were a thing or you could be a total noob and you will still find digital ocean's interface appealing

723
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:00,360
Isn't that like an amazing? It's awesome. That's like a line they have struck that is very rare, especially

724
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,360
Let's just be honest in a web app

725
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,640
Like it almost never happens in a web app and I mean if anyone's going to complain about it

726
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,720
It's going to be you so the fact that you like it. It's very I don't yeah, you're right about that

727
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,320
Also, they have a great api which meant love that api you can use that api

728
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,360
You can tap that api all you want or you can take advantage of the open source code

729
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,120
That's already done that and then you can just and it's like it's like one curl be like, yeah

730
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:25,320
Bam lazy web. You got it. Boom. Uh, check them out digital ocean.com use our promo code do unplug

731
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:31,720
That's how you support this show do unplugged all one word lowercase gives you a ten dollar dollar credit over digital ocean

732
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,360
You can spin up an ubuntu rig a debian rig a fedora free bsd

733
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,960
uh

734
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:43,080
I do generally ubuntu lds, but I don't judge if you do free bsd. I won't judge and the

735
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,560
Bsd now guys have talked about a few cool ways. You can use that html5 console on digital ocean

736
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,120
To actually install other bsds as well

737
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:57,160
Or arch or whatever you want. Yeah, i'll just the power of kvm. We're just gonna put that out there

738
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,760
Yeah, because they're using kvm as the virtualizer. Uh, it's a really great infrastructure

739
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It's a great infrastructure based on linux

740
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:09,080
A great way to run linux rigs and a great way to support the show digital ocean.com. Just use that promo code

741
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,880
Do unplugged all one word lowercase and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the linux unplugged program

742
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,600
And i'll just give a quick shout out too. Um, we haven't talked a lot about this features, uh, since it first came out

743
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:26,780
Floating ips are a brilliant way to make you to make a 10 operation look like a 50 million dollar operation

744
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,520
And team accounts if you're an open source project or in a business are also

745
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:37,800
Rocking so check them out digital ocean.com use the promo code do unplugged. They're really great data centers all over the world

746
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,960
Thank you digital ocean

747
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,800
Okay, so anybody in the mumble room running like a uh, um

748
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:52,920
Um leap or uh or tumbleweed with that with a current version of plasma desktop installed on their machine in the mumble room

749
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,600
I am

750
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,920
Oh, can you can you describe your setup a little bit to me?

751
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:05,320
Uh, yes, it's uh, just uh, the most current version of plasma on tumbleweed. It's very basic

752
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,560
Do you know is that five six already?

753
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,120
I believe it's five point five point six or something like that

754
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:16,600
Well, sir, that is no longer the latest because today plasma 5.6, which i'm sure you'll get very soon

755
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,600
Has been released and uh, it is interesting and also

756
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,760
It comes with a video. How about this? I don't think i've ever seen plasma

757
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,000
Kde desktop do this and it's it's kind of interesting. We could watch a few seconds of it

758
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:36,520
So it is the time to release plasma 5.6, which brings many improvements and features to your desktop

759
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:43,660
The default plasma theme breeze now follows the application color scheme allowing for a more personalized experience

760
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,260
K runner gained cleaner look and support for drag and drop

761
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:04,600
The much improved task manager in plasma 5.6 now displays proper

762
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:11,640
5.6 now displays progress of tasks such as downloading or copying files. This is actually kind of a neat feature

763
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,320
So, uh in dolphin when you're moving files around in the task manager

764
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:20,520
There's a little loading bar that goes across the dolphin entry to indicate the progress of the file copy

765
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,260
Isn't that kind of a nice little touch? It's a nice touch

766
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,800
Playback a music or video player shows beautiful album art and media controls

767
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:39,560
This actually hasn't worked for me yet. But the idea is like when you hover over a task bar, uh, um entry

768
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,800
For your task manager normally you'd get like a plasma window that pops up with a preview of the window

769
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:51,480
Well with like vlc or sandstorm or um, not sandstorm what app I don't know what application that is, uh or spotify

770
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,840
You you get not only a preview of the window, but you actually get little player control bars at the bottom of that little

771
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,800
Comp is like a pop-up preview. I don't know what you call that. So you never have to leave the application

772
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,800
You're currently working with

773
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:16,840
Users that place a folder applet in their panel can now choose between list and icon view

774
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,800
Additionally tooltip animations have become more subtle

775
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,800
I

776
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:37,240
Like this next one desktop widgets all windows get minimized and the widget explorer becomes semi transparent during drag

777
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,320
Isn't that cool? Yeah, that's nice

778
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:48,920
Activity manager backend was revamped so creating and switching between activities should be noticeably faster

779
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:53,480
This release brings back the weather and media frame widget I actually like that

780
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,780
If you enjoy using plasma, please consider donating to kde

781
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:05,240
So we can continue to work together and make the best free software possible. I guess I shouldn't cut her off

782
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,600
Uh, so there you go. She just sort of covered some of the features of 5.6

783
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,000
So here it was my takeaway and then I want to get your takeaway and then we'll go to the mumble room

784
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,400
um, and then we'll wrap it up, but uh

785
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:21,080
Something really weird happened to me this week and i'm really uncomfortable with it because i've never been in this position before

786
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,600
Never yeah, and i'm glad wimpy's not here anymore wimpy you left, right?

787
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,040
Good, oh good because I would feel bad even saying this if he was listening because I would just feel awful

788
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,800
I found myself. Uh, so this here is the libram that i'm running a 5.6 on

789
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:40,200
And I have the apollo still running abutu mattei 1510, which is now i'm just using as my portable and I have this one here

790
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,800
I know here's the thing

791
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:49,400
I found myself every time I wasn't using this desktop missing plasma 5.6. Wow little things. Um, like, uh,

792
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,080
I uh, I was at home and my mi-fi dropped out actually didn't drop out. I restarted it

793
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,640
And uh when I restarted it

794
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:05,880
I could never get abutu mattei to refresh my available wireless networks and connect to it again and right here on kd plasma 5.6

795
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,400
There's just a little refresh button

796
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:12,040
You just click and it just refreshes all the wireless networks. Now. I'm not saying that's what i'm saying. There's there's about a million

797
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,280
Of these little things now in 5.6

798
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:20,360
That have been refined and come together to actually make a really tremendous desktop

799
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:27,880
Um, it's really performant. It's really fast. I I don't I I mean mate is fast as well

800
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:33,960
But it's definitely faster than gnome 3 as somebody who drives gnome 3 all the time. It's definitely faster than gnome 3

801
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,800
uh, and there are things in it like the new krunner looks a lot better

802
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,400
You can do alt space to launch the new krunner and it's cleaner. It looks better

803
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,200
It searches like a son of a gun man. Yeah, it does

804
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,280
It is a one of the best test top searches krunner itself is really powerful

805
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,280
And there's a whole bunch of other functionalities. You know what too and I this is always something i've always known

806
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:58,040
And one of the reasons I always kind of have been sort of attracted to a kde desktop or a plasma desktop

807
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,240
Console is one of the best things to do. It's a lot of fun

808
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,480
Kde desktop or plasma desktop console is one of the best terminal emulators out there

809
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,440
Have you ever had like three or four tabs open to your servers?

810
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,520
Did you know you can send and the other terminal applications do this as well, but this is the default guys

811
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,640
Did you know you can send your input to all of your tabs at once?

812
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,640
So like if you want to do app dash get update across all your machines

813
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:24,920
You can be ssh'd in tab tab tab and just say execute this command right in console across all my tabs

814
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:31,160
And you could update all your you know, it's just it's a great console application. Kate is a great text editor dolphin

815
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,160
Is a great file manager like really good and the problem has always been

816
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,320
The problem has always been for me since they went to version 5 has been plasma shell itself now

817
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,360
It did actually crash on me in the pre-show and hopefully that'll be in the after show if you guys want to see that

818
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,160
Uh, but we're able to recover like I didn't have to restart

819
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,640
back up and running

820
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:53,160
Here's where i'm at with this and this is why i'm genuinely excited about this

821
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,640
Every single stinking release of kde

822
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:00,200
Since about 5.3 has been for me personally

823
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:09,000
Remarkably better and now 5.6 is the accumulation of much needed improvements to the breeze theme the breeze theme is

824
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:15,800
Much more consistent now. They have the icons much more flushed out. It adopts whatever color choices you've chosen

825
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:21,880
The default layouts at least on this kubuntu with neon, uh packages installed are much more

826
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:27,400
uh clean and sensible there's i'm not overloaded with choice and um

827
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,720
I kind of feel like it feels more modern than

828
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,280
Gnome 3 in some ways, uh, like, uh

829
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,440
The way the way okay. Here's just an example. So it's just been really nice

830
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,200
All of my icons down there are just working and I know that's not the case

831
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,160
My icons down there are just working and I know I don't know exactly why

832
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:53,400
But like I I have my chrome icon. I have my hangouts icon. I have my dropbox icon down there in my system tray

833
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,560
And you know what wes?

834
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,880
They don't have ugly white boxes around. They don't like they're not oddly sized

835
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,960
They're not mismatched in size like they used to be on the plasma desktop. They're all consistent

836
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:07,080
They all look good and I have the power to hide them if I want to

837
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,160
um

838
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:14,680
Yeah, I just for me I I i'm actually seriously considering putting

839
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:18,360
Plasma 5 6 on everything and just going all in for a little while and see how I feel wow

840
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,920
I've never uh, oh so I before I go too much further actually before I I will follow up

841
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,520
I i'll write it down so I don't forget because i've got a lot of questions after our our our

842
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,560
Our friday or sunday show so I will write down the questions

843
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,240
I wanted to hear your thoughts because i've been talking for a little bit. What would you try it out on the spot nick?

844
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,440
What did you think?

845
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,400
No, I was also similarly impressed. I feel like for a little while

846
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:43,000
Plasma 5 had felt kind of like the early days of gnome 3 where I really liked what they were doing

847
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,760
I liked all the changes. I liked seeing the updates

848
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,760
But it the same kind of thing where it just wasn't quite

849
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,320
Stable enough where I'd had enough problems or enough things had changed. I wasn't sure how they were going to work out

850
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:57,800
But I really enjoyed it. It worked really well. Um, I was using kubuntu on here. It's been working very nicely

851
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,080
I want to try maybe something like open seuss with it as well

852
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,560
I think that would be entertaining and that might be something that I would consider putting on like friends computers

853
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:12,440
Uh, but it has been it still might personally kde is always still feels like a lot of you know

854
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:16,520
It's a huge it's a huge desktop environment and it does what it does really well, but it takes over everything

855
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:21,320
So I don't know if i'll be using it every day. But for systems where that's what I want. That's an interesting

856
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,040
It works really well

857
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,120
That's an interesting comment and an interesting way to put it in kits

858
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:29,320
And I kind of wanted to let you jump off from uh from wes's point there because you say you like the way it feels

859
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:34,760
Yeah, I like the way it feels. Um, and i'm actually a traditional gnome user believe it or not

860
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,240
And I think that the reason that it works so well

861
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:42,600
And and I think the reason that you like it too is because it feels like how a computer should work

862
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,760
It doesn't feel like a touch interface

863
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,480
shoehorned onto a desktop

864
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,320
Wow, that is a good point. Yeah, that is a good point, you know the other thing that uh,

865
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,520
Because and because I haven't been using it for a while

866
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:58,920
So there's still novelties to me that uh are are fun. Like when you take a screenshot

867
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,080
They just have like one of the best screenshot applications and it like you have you can

868
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:09,160
With a little bit of work you can send like your screenshots to third-party services right from the screenshot application like imager

869
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,360
Or stuff like that. They have great online account integration

870
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,560
I'm going to stick with it for a bit and I might try loading on the apollo, too

871
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,800
Anybody else in the mobile room want to jump in on their thoughts on kde?

872
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,920
And i'd like to know if you've what distros you've been trying it on

873
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:32,840
I've used uh 5.5.6 on multiple different distros. I haven't used 5.6 yet, obviously, but uh

874
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:39,100
I mean everything that a lot of the stuff that they mentioned in this is actually already in 5.5.6

875
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:46,120
Like the media player, uh plasmoid is really cool because you can create custom shortcuts

876
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:52,760
So that when no matter what media player is playing you can actually automatically like pause something or move move songs

877
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:58,760
Regardless of what actual player you use so you can always have the same global shortcut and that's really awesome. Oh, that is nice

878
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,280
Mm-hmm. That is nice. So rotten sounds like you've been sticking with it for a while

879
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,160
What is it that's been sticky for you about plasma desktop? What's kept you there?

880
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,040
Uh, well, I switched uh a year ago actually about a little bit over a year ago

881
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:15,000
And i've i've gone back and forth with different ds, but i've always gone back to kde now

882
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,080
And it's because uh plasma has a infinite amount of control like if you want to have

883
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:27,480
Like for example, uh kissanay said that he liked it because it was a traditional desktop and it wasn't like a touch thing

884
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,440
But if you want a touch looking desktop you can do that

885
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,720
I actually have like if you've seen my setup it kind of looks similar to gnome

886
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,440
Because I can change it to the way I want it to look

887
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,560
But that that's one of the that's the power of plasma

888
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:47,640
But the the huge the biggest reason to use kde plasma is actually kwin

889
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:55,000
Because you can do that's fair pretty much anything you want to do with kwin anything that any other window manager can do

890
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:00,280
Kwin can do it and there's tons of things that only kwin can do. I am continually impressed with kwin

891
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:06,600
Yeah, and I think it's a big part of the why the 5.6 desktop feels so responsive to the based compared to the gtk

892
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:11,240
Desktops and i'm talking about like resizing windows or when the way they draw it just feels

893
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:17,560
It feels like a little bit like how good how good compass feels to me compass and kwin

894
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:23,240
I can perceive a difference in the way that mutter renders things or whatever gnome is using uh, so yeah

895
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,760
I mean just even on my virtual machine when you like drag drag the window around it

896
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:34,200
It's fast. It's yeah the transparency works like in a vm. Yeah

897
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:38,280
There's a really cool default feature a hold alt and then use your right click

898
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:43,400
The right click mouse on any corner and you can resize the window super fast

899
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,320
Oh, so you don't have to get like all accurate with where you grab it that is nice, right?

900
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,840
There's also the one of the things that I like this is actually the reason why

901
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:57,640
I was having a conversation with here on mumble and someone said uh, that

902
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,240
Like we have a conversation about games and full screen and stuff

903
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:06,360
And you know, sometimes window mode games are better. Yeah, then are better performers than right screen, right?

904
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:12,280
If in in kde with kwin you can use uh, there's the no borders rule

905
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:18,200
So you can actually just put a game in window mode and then right click the title bar

906
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:24,280
And go and go through the process of more options and click no borders. It removes the border full screen that window

907
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:29,080
And it looks like it's a full screen, even though it's not. Yeah, the thing that I love about windows is

908
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:33,560
It's a full screen even though it's not. Yeah, the things you can tweak are pretty impressive. That is really cool

909
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,600
Uh, so that yeah that I could see that making it sticky for you, uh

910
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,800
Wizard you've tried it on debian. I don't think we've gotten a debian take yet. What what's your impressions?

911
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:46,280
Uh, so i've had ups and downs with it all the way through I stuck around

912
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:52,520
I went through the kde 4 to kde 5 transition inside of debian and it was terrifying but uh,

913
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:58,920
It's uh, it was it ended up working out really well, uh, you know, there's there's been ups and downs

914
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:03,000
I've had i've been through the points where the desktop has crashed continually. That's actually why

915
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,800
That's I had that script sticking around somewhere

916
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,400
because my desktop crashed a lot at the beginning, but it's

917
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:16,760
It's been getting better every and like I it's getting to the point where I have to use that restart plasma

918
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,520
Uh the script I use maybe once every couple months

919
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:27,720
You know, it's it's really good now. Yeah, in fairness. I have a restart cinnamon script. So yeah. Yeah, isn't that built into cinnamon?

920
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:34,920
Yeah, but well, there were some other features. So, you know what really sucks super super bad, uh, uh, and it's

921
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:40,440
It's just what it is right now, but the discover or muon or whatever. It's called software center. Um,

922
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,240
Are you seeing this?

923
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:47,080
I mean, I know they're trying and I don't want to be mean but look how awkward this is

924
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:53,720
So let's go into oh, I don't know. Let's go into system settings, right? So that's a category system and settings and look at this wes

925
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,040
it's just

926
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:01,160
Blank like there's just there's just appear to be anything there. There's nothing there and like the icons are all strange

927
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,840
You know what's right here are widgets like the weather widget awesome widgets

928
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,600
uh compared to the software boutique or

929
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,840
Um app grid. Yep on for yeah, i'm just talking for ubuntu systems

930
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,480
The software boutique is what uh is what wimpy's been working on which is just awesome

931
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:23,160
This is I installed vlc, but I mean this is just this is a huge disappointment

932
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,840
I like that it's cross distro that is a nice like gnome software in that sense

933
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,080
I do I respect that I understand it's a big challenge, but I am not like

934
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,960
I need to deliver more what I want from the boutique and what I want from ubuntu software center

935
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,440
And what I want from muon discover, whatever you want to call it

936
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,840
I want to find a new app that it delights me and I want to install it on my desktop and I

937
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,960
I want to I want to then share it with linux action show audience

938
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,000
I want to discover new software via this I you know

939
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,840
I didn't necessarily do that with the software boutique, but you know, I installed a whole bunch of apps in about five minutes

940
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:03,080
That was really I mean for people they're going to get ubuntu mattei 1604 and they're going to they're going to launch that welcome center

941
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,240
They're going to in in five minutes

942
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:09,960
They're going to have their entire software stack and and what would they learn about what a ppa is?

943
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:10,760
You won't have to deal with anything

944
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:14,440
It just takes care of all of that for you and it gives you the best software on linux in minutes

945
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,880
This doesn't do that. This does speculate. Uh, this does speculate this does spotlight

946
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,600
Uh digicam vlc carita, you know some really solid qt applications

947
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,800
But just doesn't do just and marvel but just doesn't do justice to all the desktop applications available for linux

948
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,800
And I find it to be a major disappointment

949
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:39,000
That one actually used to be better but they started recently as in five point five point three update

950
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,800
They started porting it more because it used to just not be on framework five

951
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:48,120
Then they started porting it and they changed a lot of stuff that I don't really like

952
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:52,040
Like the update system is actually it used to be much better than it is now

953
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,720
So check this out, uh, just to kind of give you an example west now

954
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,480
I don't have anything loaded uh in this vlc media player. So it's not as cool

955
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,880
All the lower third is probably going to block this but as I hover over vlc and my task manager

956
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,720
You can kind of see it there west you see I have play and previous and next

957
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:13,000
And I can also it's so it's integrated now into the freaking task manager our playback controls

958
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:16,360
And the reason why this is a big deal for me is I play a lot of media through vlc

959
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,200
I'm usually using live streamer

960
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:23,480
Or i'm grabbing the rtsp stream of something and i'm tossing or i'm throwing an mp3 and i'm listening to a podcast

961
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,920
And so to be able to just play and pause right there is neat

962
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,600
It's it's neat because it's a different way to do it and it accommodates for multiple media applications at once

963
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,440
So whereas a media applet will just do whatever application is controlling the volume

964
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:42,600
This I can manage spotify vlc and the other just for me because i'm sometimes running several apps. Yeah, exactly really nice

965
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:50,360
This is just a really tight desktop really well performing and uh, one of the other things true to their word the kde neon project

966
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,040
Already has a developer version now. Remember this is really just for testing and developing

967
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,680
It's not for daily use. They already have an iso out with 5.6. I'll have it linked in the show notes

968
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,680
You can download this and try it out right now

969
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,320
The uh, the kde neon project

970
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:10,140
Has their files hosted at files.kde.org

971
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,140
Kde.org

972
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:16,700
They're all in with the kde project. Uh, so anyways if you want to try it out if you want to try out 5.6

973
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,460
We do have

974
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:20,940
Uh a link in the show notes you can cook. I i'm i'm i'm

975
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,380
This is kind of a big deal for me and I don't want to

976
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:28,940
For me this feels huge because not only am I thinking about switching to kde, but i'm thinking about switching

977
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:34,300
To neon specifically wow in anticipation of 1604. Yeah

978
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:39,500
And to be switching not only from gnome, but to also be switching from arch

979
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:44,060
That's a big change. It feels like a mistake almost but uh, because arch will have 5.6

980
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:47,580
Yeah, and I already have it but the neon project

981
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:52,940
Itself is such an interesting experiment and 16 of 1604. It looks like such a promising release

982
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:55,340
I know and even if I don't stay with 1604

983
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:59,260
It's like I feel like I have to install it and use it for a while just to like be in the zeitgeist of what?

984
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:02,540
It releases. Yeah. Yeah, so but it's funny because you know

985
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:07,020
My 1604 review is coming up and it's like I need to immerse myself in unity and yet here I am

986
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,900
I'm extremely attracted to 5.6. Yeah

987
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:14,220
So, uh, yeah, I don't see I know I know I know I know it gets in

988
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,500
You can go ahead and mention it on the air

989
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:19,100
You don't have to just type it you want to give a plug for tumbleweed. We should mention tumbleweed. Go ahead

990
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:24,780
Yeah, I actually think that you should uh, give tumbleweed a try. I think you'd have great luck with it

991
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:32,380
I have I really haven't ran into any problems or surprises updating anything and i've been running it for almost a month now

992
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,460
Sonic's 7-1-1 in the chat room says i'm chasing the dragon. I should be careful

993
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:41,020
You know, you might be right and here's what I was thinking is I would like to really try to give it a go

994
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:44,300
And so you want some of you listening might be wondering

995
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,300
Well, what about your sound problems chris?

996
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:50,300
And this was like the number one question that got sent into the linux action show now

997
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:57,820
Uh, yeah by all in on phonon. Am I am I super excited about phonon? No, but in recent uh, kde releases

998
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:01,340
I think I might have been in 5.5. Uh, they have they have

999
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,980
Well, who who who?

1000
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:08,220
So 5.5 started it. Yes, and then 5.6 is the more full

1001
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:13,340
Implementation. Yeah. Yeah, I kind of suspected those guys. Thank you for the clarification. Uh, so

1002
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,060
I can do a process of elimination now

1003
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:22,700
That essentially prevents problems it requires I manage it more but it allows me at the same time I can manage it

1004
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:29,020
So it's actually not bad. So if you're looking at my screen right now on the video version here of linux unplugged

1005
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,060
You see i'm in the audio volume settings

1006
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:37,020
And you can just get there by right clicking on the volume volume applet and going to um audio settings

1007
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:41,180
All the tabs are super important input devices output devices, but you see something here west

1008
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:44,860
You see how I only have one device listed in output devices. Yes, I do

1009
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:47,900
And you see how I only have one device listed in input devices now

1010
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:52,140
Uh, there are some instances where I have a machine that literally has three sound cards in it

1011
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:55,260
The hdmi port a usb sound card and the onboard

1012
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:01,180
Well what you can do now in starting like rotten said in 5.5 and continued in 5.6 and there's other things as well

1013
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:06,620
But uh, but one of the nice things is is I can simply just turn those other sound cards off

1014
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:11,660
And then the plasma desktop isn't even aware they're available and it can't cock it up

1015
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:14,620
It's literally it's you just choose what you actually want to use

1016
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:14,780
Yeah

1017
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:20,700
By a process of elimination by eliminating all the other sound cards as an available options to the system and only making the one sound

1018
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:23,340
Card I want available everything defaults to it

1019
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:28,060
Solve my problem. And so I am now able to use the plasma desktop and

1020
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,940
And drive the sound effects from this machine

1021
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:33,740
And not have it randomly change sound cards on me

1022
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:38,140
Or what was happening to me in plasma before is some desktop application would use one sound card

1023
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:41,580
And other ones would use another sound that's the worst he's awful

1024
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:46,620
So that was the number one question that came in after last is but what about the sound because i've gone on and on about that

1025
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:52,940
Problem. I don't think it's particularly solved but because I can disable devices that I don't want to use it solves the problem for me

1026
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,540
So there you go

1027
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:57,340
Problem solved if you don't have two three sound cards in a machine

1028
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:00,380
It's not as big of a deal. But most of us these days do have hdmi out

1029
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:06,460
And if that supports sound which it does then probably have your nice usb dag. I mean, yeah now, you know, I haven't

1030
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:09,100
Hmm

1031
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:14,300
I haven't tried it on the deck upstairs where I had a problem. It would reset the volume to maximum. Ooh, that would be phase two

1032
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:20,860
That's phase two. Yeah, it is because the speakers up there are my editing speakers and they are loud dude

1033
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:24,380
It literally I think I think it gave me a heart palpitation when the first time

1034
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:29,100
Because it was like a kd like error message like a bring air and it was so loud

1035
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:34,140
My ears rang afterwards and rikai. I I think came out of him says everything. Okay, like like it was

1036
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,760
ridiculous, uh, yeah, so

1037
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,620
Kitson has that happened to you?

1038
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:43,020
Where it just resets the volume to maximum for like an application like what happened if I recall was

1039
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:46,380
Is for some reason an application volume got set low

1040
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:51,260
But the system volume would be set to 100 and so a system message would come up at 100

1041
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,340
System messages. Have you gotten that kitson?

1042
01:13:55,260 --> 01:14:00,940
I've had that happen a couple times. Uh, not recently the one big thing that happens to me is

1043
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:06,540
Uh, my mic will get unplugged because I got an old mic and the connection's kind of janky

1044
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:12,380
And then i'll go to plug it back in and it'll be muted and I have to switch everything back over

1045
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,780
It doesn't default correctly. Yeah. Yeah, I you know, i'll see if I run into those kind

1046
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:19,020
I think the only way I can really find out is if I

1047
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:23,420
Try to jump in. Yep. Holy smokes. This is slick desktop

1048
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:29,500
Oh, oh also should mention speaking of martin and kwin and how great kwin is, uh five dot six

1049
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:35,340
Real solid like this one will run on wayland release. This is the will run on wayland release. That might be fun to try

1050
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:41,340
Yeah, big deal now not ready for production not 100 but so much work has gone into making this freaking work on wayland

1051
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,420
And a lot of that work is showing up in five six

1052
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:44,860
um

1053
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:50,940
Pretty cool pretty damn cool and you could probably just go try it out using the neon

1054
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,260
Uh iso in the show notes

1055
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:59,500
And you know all the you know, what's funny what's ironic what's ironic about this and the story of my life as a linux user

1056
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:06,540
Super I don't distro hop anymore. I desktop well actually i'm about to distro hop too. You are right god old habits die hard, don't they?

1057
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:14,060
Uh, what's what's really frustrating is all this freaking choice because also gnome 320 is about to come out and

1058
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,940
Gnome 320 is looking really good

1059
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:22,140
Yeah, so go figure i'm getting all excited about plasma desktop right as the new gnome is about to come out

1060
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:27,100
I just I uh, these are good problems to have though. Yeah. Yeah, we're first world problems for sure

1061
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:31,340
But yeah, I tell you what and you know what I I just uh, i'll just revel in it

1062
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,780
I'll just revel in it. I guess at least I have a place to talk about my problems

1063
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,780
You guys are like my therapy session. That's right

1064
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,980
Okay, uh mumble room any uh closing thoughts before we move on from plasma desktop 5 6

1065
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:48,560
Yeah, I thought with that video that uh, kde was totally going the gnome direction with release announcements

1066
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,180
but I think that they

1067
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:57,260
Really messed it up. The music was awful. The voiceover was boring. You still need a good mic

1068
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:00,700
Yeah, and there was a little bit too much echo the music was kind of robotic

1069
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:05,900
Yeah, the uh, the music could be a little more excited like you could do something like a you know

1070
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:10,860
Plasma 5.6 is a brand new release from the kd, you know or something you could you could you could spice it up

1071
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:15,420
Just talk to chris. He'll do it. Yeah, totally I would too. Uh, but I actually at the same time

1072
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:21,020
I'm really glad because uh, one of the things that I have complained about

1073
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:27,020
Is how bad linux journalism is and when the projects are releasing videos themselves?

1074
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:31,660
Like you've been watching the mycroft project has done this brilliantly. Uh is

1075
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,300
You don't fumble the message

1076
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,660
You don't have a chance for there to be a misinterpretation because the journalist

1077
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,380
Well, not only will they get to write about what you're what you're doing

1078
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,140
But they'll just also embed your video

1079
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:47,740
It gives you an opportunity to speak to the public directly about what's great and new and not having it lost in translation

1080
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:53,020
Um, and now it's just a matter of refinement make it a little peppier make it a little more excited

1081
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:57,340
This is a big deal. A lot of awesome stuff just happened and you are excited about it

1082
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:01,020
I mean, I am more excited about it than the person that video was not to be too critical

1083
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:05,180
But let's be real and also yeah, the music did suck. But you know what at least they had music

1084
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:09,900
Yeah, the old cloud project didn't even have music right? So we're seeing we helped him out though

1085
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:13,900
This is legitimately a new interesting trend. We are seeing an open source

1086
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:19,660
We are going from the community that barely even has screenshots of our shit to the community that is creating video

1087
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:25,980
Videos. Yeah about our shit like that is a huge transition for us and one I completely support

1088
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,020
because if nothing else

1089
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:33,420
It gives people an opportunity to share something. I know that sounds stupid

1090
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:36,460
But you know a two minute youtube video is an easy share

1091
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,340
And you can spread the word and people can watch it. It's a lot easier

1092
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:42,620
Yeah, it's so much easier to be like hey check out this cool desktop. I'm using rather than

1093
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:48,380
Github readme with just text and like q5 says to point out is to help some control their image in the message

1094
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:52,940
Uh, and so that way, you know, it doesn't get fumbled by the quote-unquote journalists out there

1095
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:57,660
I I actually think it's a good trend but the problem is doing a doing a video

1096
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,300
And doing a good video

1097
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:05,100
Are hard that was that was that was a good attempt and I really I respect them for trying it

1098
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,340
They could they could spice it up a little bit

1099
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:10,860
Um, and it's just it just takes a little bit of time of trial and error

1100
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:14,780
I mean look at my look at my people who know how to do it and my early stuff is embarrassing as hell

1101
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:19,420
Like my current stuff is embarrassing as hell and i've been doing it for 10 years. So I can't give them that much crap

1102
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:22,640
You know what? I can talk about that and I do love this linuxacademy.com

1103
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:28,380
Slash unplugged go support the unplugged program and learn more actually go support yourself

1104
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:32,620
This is a great opportunity to learn more about any of the technologies built around linux the linux stack

1105
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,900
Or any of the really good stuff that people make money off of on linux

1106
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:38,540
And what I love about the linux academy is it isn't just a feature

1107
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:43,980
For their training website gotta have that linux and open source stuff on there. It's really what they're all about

1108
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:50,460
They got in this as a way to be advocates for linux programmers developers linux enthusiasts system administrators

1109
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,580
They got together and they built the linux academy platform. They now have

1110
01:18:54,280 --> 01:19:00,060
2339 video self-paced courses downloadable comprehensive study guides seven plus distributions

1111
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:04,540
you get to choose from life server spun up on the demand with an ssh connection and

1112
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:09,020
Not only have they recently expanded into new offices launched an app for mobile

1113
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:15,340
But they've brought in a whole bunch of staff to get new content on board even faster and make sure older content stays relevant

1114
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,500
Because you know what turns out linux changes a bunch

1115
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:22,380
Like all the time and they get that, you know, it's not they're not going to just create something and let it rot

1116
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:29,020
They really have some interesting technology too like scenario based labs, which are right in the middle of a common everyday environment task

1117
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:31,500
So you really have hands-on experience and confidence

1118
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,360
Instructor mentoring is available, which is great

1119
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:39,640
Especially for stuff like this experts who like know what they're doing. Have you ever have you ever done like work training?

1120
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:40,840
Have you ever done like a work training program?

1121
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,480
I worked for a few places that would actually give me like a little bit like a like I was like like 1200 bucks a year

1122
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:47,560
Something like this. Have you ever had anything like that? No

1123
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:52,760
Yeah, I worked for a place or like well, we'll give you courses, uh, which is all on banking

1124
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,000
Uh, or you can get a 1200 budget

1125
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,160
And so I just kind of worked that in moving too when I went into contracting and I worked for somebody as a contractor for

1126
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,040
A while. I still I had like a 1200 educational budget

1127
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:08,280
um, but that was because I was going to community colleges and I was going to like professional court training courses for citrix and

1128
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:16,840
And uh vmware and nothing nothing like linux academy existed for me now today something like linux academy would have changed my game

1129
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:21,480
It would I could have taken on new clients and had the confidence to expand into different technologies fast

1130
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:25,080
I know I could have stayed current and part of that game was staying certified

1131
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:28,120
Even if it was for a review so that way I get a raise or if it was for getting a client

1132
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,440
It was just to make myself feel better and challenge myself

1133
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:36,440
Having a resource like linux academy would have blown my face off linux academy dot com slash unplugged go there to support the show

1134
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,720
And blow your own face off. They got courseware on amazon web services

1135
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:43,560
They got the red hat certifications python ruby android development

1136
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,280
If you want to get into that biz php if you know what's good for you

1137
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:51,080
Don't tell michael dominic and of course the entire linux stack nginx apache ruby on rails

1138
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,400
All of it's over at linux academy dot com

1139
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:58,200
And they have a community that's stacked full of jupiter broadcasting members because i've been talking about them for a while

1140
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,880
In-depth resources are great. Listen to it in the shower or while you're on the go

1141
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:06,680
Mix it in with your podcast playlist and advance your skill set linux academy dot com

1142
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,160
Slash unplugged and a big thank you to linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

1143
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,120
Check out their live stream archives, too. So

1144
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,280
Google hangouts

1145
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,800
pretty damn good

1146
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,160
hard to beat

1147
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:27,080
But not a ton of people no not open and uh, maybe a little creepy

1148
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:35,000
And so a couple of things have been submitted into the show recently one from producer rotten corpse and one from our very own

1149
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:35,800
wes

1150
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,600
and

1151
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:42,120
They both in their own corners are powerful open source google hangout and skype killers

1152
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,920
And there's been a lot of hoopla around skype recently on linux

1153
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:50,120
So let's start with the new contender the one that most of us haven't heard about before

1154
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,240
Hubble dot in you think i'm saying that right hubble dot in

1155
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,760
I think that's how you're saying it and I want to start up and I want it

1156
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:00,360
Let's do a let's do a meeting right now with our live chat room. So i'm going to go uh lup

1157
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,840
Well, i'm just going to do slash lup. So it's uh, h u b l

1158
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:10,440
H u b l dot i n slash lup i'm going to start up a video conference right now

1159
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:16,120
And we'll see it and then we'll compare this to the other contender the other open source contender, which has recently gotten a whole

1160
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,480
Bunch of real live science right here on linux. All right, so i'm going to set my name and look at this

1161
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,720
I like this right off the bat. So you set your name here?

1162
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:24,760
This is one thing that struck me

1163
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:31,000
But then look at this west choose your video quality low rate medium rate or awesome right up front. I'm gonna go awesome rate

1164
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:37,800
That feels good. Right? Okay, so now next. Okay. So now i've started it's going to ask for uh permission to use my webcam

1165
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,880
I'll say yes go ahead use my webcam

1166
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,280
And I could send email invites out to people

1167
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,360
Uh if I wanted to look at that, we already got we already got somebody in there. That's great. Yeah

1168
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,560
So there's poppy down there. That's awesome. That's really good

1169
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,160
Uh, that's cool. Hey guys, how's it going? Hello. Hi. Hi

1170
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,200
Hi, look at that

1171
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,560
Popey, oh, yeah, you're in the moment room. So you have your mic muted. That's cool

1172
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,680
And so you see it has uh, the little uh thumbnails down here

1173
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:09,640
Oh, we just had another another person join. So it's really easy for everybody get in there and uh, fatty fatso just got in there

1174
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,320
It's fatty fatso. He's in as the linux talks

1175
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,160
He doesn't have to use video if he doesn't want

1176
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,920
You can turn off your microphone or your webcam if you want to be private for a moment

1177
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,560
Which is a kind of a cool feature. I mean really a needed one for any like enterprise scale use

1178
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:25,500
Here's what I like though. I gave out I gave out uh one url hubble.in

1179
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,920
Slash lup and now we've got one two three four five six people who've joined

1180
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,360
Now some of them have like that some of them are we're getting a little playback. So

1181
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,280
Uh, but that is it is nice. You have the ability to start a chat

1182
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,520
Uh now two more people just joined look at that. Hello ptd. Hello patrick

1183
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,400
So there we go. A couple more people just came in. Hi guys. Good to see you

1184
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,080
uh

1185
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:54,680
I love my microphones in the shot. Um, that is really nice slick easy to do way way quicker than hangouts. And here's a nice thing

1186
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,840
Look at this

1187
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:01,400
It is using peer-to-peer web technology. It's not going through their servers. They're not recording it

1188
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:05,560
It's all happening peer-to-peer. All right, i'm gonna hang up on you guys, but thank you. That was a good experiment

1189
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,640
So okay, that's contender number one

1190
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:10,040
hubble

1191
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,040
Contender number two

1192
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:17,560
A well-established name someone we know with a varied history kind of trust

1193
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,120
Used to use it on the desktop, but now they want you to use it on the web. Yes friends. It's jitzy

1194
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,280
And rotten corpse. You're the one that submitted jitzy for a contender this week

1195
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:33,800
Do you want to mention what it was about the new jitzy updates that uh, got you all excited and wanted to plug it on

1196
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,800
the show

1197
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,120
And by the way

1198
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:42,520
Before rotten starts it's meat dot jit dot si slash love

1199
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:46,520
I'll put the hopefully i'll be able to put the full uh url in the show notes. But okay, go ahead rotten

1200
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:51,720
You might be in transit right now. Oh, okay. Okay. Very good. So here we go

1201
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,080
So you've joined charham join me. You can see me here. I'm on the uh, have you tried out?

1202
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:58,840
Have you tried out jitzy west? Yeah, i'm on there right now. Are you did you only?

1203
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,120
That's me

1204
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:08,520
Hi, chris. Hello west as you can see it's doing the automatic switching. Uh, hello fellow jitzer. So it just calls him fellow jitzer

1205
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:14,200
But I like how it's switching between them and also this one shows you the signal strength of individual people

1206
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,760
Which is kind of nice and oh look at this I can

1207
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:23,000
I can make I can make people disappear which is kind of nice. I can mute individual people. I can kick people out

1208
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:27,880
I'm digging this open close the contact list show or hide the film

1209
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:35,800
Oh, we should switch to this on last this just be google hangouts right there one button hide the strips that is really neat

1210
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:41,340
Look at everybody showing up. It's handling this connection just fine. So both of them using webrtc

1211
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,440
And we're both using it. Yeah

1212
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:50,600
This is this is a hard call, but I think I want to give the nod to uh, jitzy here for a couple of different reasons

1213
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:55,960
Uh a little bit these notifications when someone else connects too. Yeah, I like the jitzy notification system

1214
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:01,720
Jitzy meet also allows you to share documents with everybody participating share a prezzi session

1215
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,600
And it allows you to share your screen

1216
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,080
So I think it has hubble beat a little bit. Yeah, this is a new update allowing you to share

1217
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:12,280
Your screen is really cool. So I i'm I would try it

1218
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:16,280
But then I would just share my screen share my screen of sharing you should try sharing your screen west

1219
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,280
Do you want to try sharing your screen?

1220
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:24,760
And then I think I can click you to bring you up. So there's west right there. I like this. Oh, wow. Look at that

1221
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:26,760
I can oh

1222
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,640
I hover over your uh your signals there. Look at that west

1223
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:35,080
I get your exact bitrate that you're currently sending me right now and the resolution it says a little low resolution

1224
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,640
But of course, that's probably just your webcam. Yeah, probably so there's your screen up is the best

1225
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:44,120
Yeah, because here's uh, here's a mr. Uh, uh, let's see. What's it say?

1226
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:49,240
His name is lynn fax or something like that. He's sending me a different resolution than you are and uh,

1227
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:55,080
Uh, whoever this guy is he's sending me. Well, he's sending me the same resolution here. This guy looks like he's uh, hello

1228
01:26:55,080 --> 01:27:00,040
Fellow jits are i'm bringing you up on screen. He's sending me no 160 by 90. I'm not sure

1229
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:04,760
I gotta play. I gotta see if I can get a high definition. What about me? What am I sending? What am I sending?

1230
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:09,720
I'm sending 320 by 180. So that would be the one thing is if I could get it up. Let's see settings

1231
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,080
Listen, which it is. You can start without audio. That's kind of neat

1232
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:20,120
Hmm, yeah, okay. I think that I think these are both pretty good winners here, but uh sam radio you have 720p on yours

1233
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:24,360
All right, well that's something

1234
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,620
Huh? Hey citizen coming in with no video so you can still participate

1235
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:36,120
I like that. This is pretty cool. I think bit I think if you need a google hangouts replacement that you want to be open source

1236
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,840
That works in your web browser

1237
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:44,280
I think I think you give it to meet.jit.si. We'll have a link in the show notes

1238
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,960
I did have to install a chrome extension to get the uh screen sharing to work

1239
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:50,760
But it installed very quickly. Yeah, it did if you did it on air

1240
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:53,480
Yeah, I mean it was just like one hit add and so are you able to go?

1241
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:57,160
So can you bring your screen back? Oh, you turned your screen off. Oh, okay. No, that's fine. That's fine

1242
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:00,760
Oh, we have somebody else. This is really cool. Oh, there's poppy. So what's poppy coming in now?

1243
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:06,440
Poppy's coming in at 640 by 380 for some reason and he's yeah, I don't know why he's not higher resolution video

1244
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,440
I don't know why it's not higher resolution video

1245
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,840
That seems to be the thing

1246
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:14,200
Got to play with that. Yeah, but this is a more controlled trial be interesting

1247
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:19,240
You can lock the room down too so people can stop joining you can invite others to join

1248
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,800
That is great

1249
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,480
So there you go to open source google plus. Oh, are you back rotten?

1250
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,360
No, it's not rotten it's me

1251
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:37,480
um, but I just saying just saying that uh, the another advantage that gt has over all of the other competitors

1252
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:41,800
Is that it has the video bridge with the gt from the desktop?

1253
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:49,000
So if someone is on the regular gt can talk, oh, so you could still use the desktop. That is damn cool, dude

1254
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,960
That is really nice. I really like that the options something that

1255
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
That's something that they've been working on

1256
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,320
Uh to to make it work, you know

1257
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:01,960
Um, we could use this so when poppy talks poppy could be on video

1258
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:02,680
Yeah

1259
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,480
That so poppy try talking in the mumble room while you're on gitsy video. See if you can pull that off

1260
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:11,640
That could be kind of yeah, I can do that. Oh, look at that. That is so cool

1261
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,000
And it's almost synced up too. Look at that

1262
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:19,240
This could be a cool way to get the actual faces of the bumble room on the stream if we want to take it up

1263
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:22,760
And I mean we have the video stream anyway. Yeah. Yeah, that is really neat

1264
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,080
I could I could route my microphone through this as well

1265
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:30,840
You could but but I don't know I think it's more because we're because the nice thing is you could have some people on here

1266
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,600
I guess i'd have to know when to switch it

1267
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:37,400
I guess this could be used in place of mumble too, but I like the mumble room better for this kind of thing

1268
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:44,360
Yeah. All right. Well, very cool. So, uh, we'll have links to both of those open source google hangout and skype replacement

1269
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:47,400
So if you've been bellyaching about microsoft killing support for skype

1270
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:52,360
Uh, this might be a go-to replacement for family members chats with friends

1271
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:57,720
Yeah kits and you had something you wanted to jump in before we move on. Yeah, um, actually it's uh,

1272
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,120
Something that I found it's a different topic

1273
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:07,640
Did you see this thing about a uh rust written microkernel? I did and they were throwing some shade on linux if I recall, right?

1274
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:10,840
Yeah, this is really cool

1275
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:16,120
Redox. Yeah. Yeah, and they were they were slamming linux a bit in their announcement. But yeah redox

1276
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:20,200
A rust written microkernel open source os. Yeah

1277
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,400
Yeah

1278
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:24,680
Yeah, I have heard of it. I just don't it's impressive. They've gotten a pretty good way

1279
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:29,640
They've got a gooey up and yeah, they say the whole thing weighs in at just 26 megabytes for that. So

1280
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:37,480
26 megabytes, maybe i'll give that a spin this week. You should dude. Can you report back? Yeah, that'd be pretty cool. That'd be pretty good

1281
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:43,960
Uh, all right. So, uh, that's probably the end. I love this. I uh wave. Goodbye poppy wave. Goodbye poppy

1282
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:47,480
Oh that beautiful beautiful poppy. Bye. Bye. Bye now

1283
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:55,160
Bye guys, thanks for testing the different uh, uh html webrtc powered solutions. I'm hanging up on your face

1284
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:59,160
It is nice to know that it's you know, we're all just connecting as peers. Thanks for using jitsi meat

1285
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,040
Yeah, you're right

1286
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:05,560
And you know what that's going to mean is hopefully I better connection speeds right and better latency and whatnot because you're not routing through

1287
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:10,040
A server and the nice thing is of course since you're not running through a server if nobody's recording your session

1288
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:16,120
You could record your session, but nobody else we recorded that session. We did we did that's an example of that

1289
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:21,640
All right. So there's a lot coming up on future episodes of linux unplugged, especially as linux fest northwest gets closer

1290
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,800
But also as some major distros release

1291
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:27,480
There's going to be a lot of stuff and a lot of opportunity for you to get your thoughts in on the show

1292
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:31,800
So please do join us live go over to jblive.tv. We do the show on tuesdays

1293
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,240
You can go to jupyterbroadcasting.com

1294
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:38,280
Slash calendar to get that s converted to your local time zone and then you join our virtual log via mumble

1295
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:43,480
Which is an open source communications program and you can get the server in our chat room the information by doing bang mumble

1296
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:47,000
It's kind of like our little like that's like that's like the hardest part

1297
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,600
That's the test to prove you're worthy

1298
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:49,960
You got to join the chat room

1299
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:53,160
You got to do bang mumble and you got to install mumble and then that's it

1300
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,240
You just got to have a working nice to blaster

1301
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:56,840
That's probably a good idea

1302
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:58,040
Uh, and it's our virtual log

1303
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:00,920
You can hang out with us and share your thoughts and as some big stuff is coming up

1304
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,320
It's a great opportunity for you to get in there and take part of it

1305
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:04,620
So we'd love to have you go to jupyterbroadcasting.com

1306
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:11,320
Slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone and a big thank you to our virtual log for making it this week

1307
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,120
Thanks to west for once again saving the show by supplying the beer

1308
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:18,200
It's a close call to what I can the beer and the burger you want above and beyond this week, man

1309
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:21,160
That's pretty impressive. That means rika. I'll get this show out, you know

1310
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:25,480
Split greasely greased up with uh five guys grease that is gross

1311
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:30,280
Follow the network at jupiter signal for uh show announcements and live streams at chris

1312
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:35,480
Isles for my stuff about linux fest northwest linuxactionshow.reddit.com for feedback

1313
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:40,600
On this week's episode and topic suggestions. Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of linux unplugged

1314
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,740
And we'll see you right back here next tuesday

1315
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,600
So

1316
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,680
Why don't we why don't we kill a few minutes and talk about something I

1317
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,920
I started to bring this up in tech talk and I shut the conversation down because I actually wanted to talk about it here

1318
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:43,560
In linux unplugged saved it. I know it so android n has been out for certain devices

1319
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:47,320
I don't think you've tried it yet though. I haven't no, but you could right on your nexus 5. Yeah, maybe I should

1320
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:52,360
Yeah, uh, well, I don't know if you'll be able to try this on the nexus 5, but one of the hidden features in android n

1321
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,940
is

1322
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:56,760
Multi-windowed mode so not just like side-by-side windows

1323
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:03,720
But like full-on broken up multi-windowing desktop environment with a bar down at the bottom a system tray quick launch icons

1324
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:09,000
awkward black around chrome desktop icons on the desktop android n is

1325
01:34:10,180 --> 01:34:12,180
Potentially i'm looking at this thinking

1326
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,000
This could be a chrome os. This could be a chrome os killer

1327
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:17,880
Easily. Yeah, it looks like it

1328
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Wow, could it also be

1329
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,080
an ubuntu desktop killer

1330
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,440
Because you get a linux based os and the x86 project is even more

1331
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:31,560
So you get a linux based os you get mainstream corporate applications like microsoft office

1332
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:39,320
Uh adobe lightroom you get an official telegram evernote you get google chrome netflix hulu, uh, all of that stuff

1333
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,440
on a desktop environment

1334
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,520
That could run on arm or intel

1335
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:48,920
I mean, maybe if you're like, you know, so I was looking at the stack exchange

1336
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,800
Did you see the stack exchange survey that came out recently? Yes, I did

1337
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:56,760
And like the number one thing everybody's working on is web dev, right? That's like the well you could do web dev on this thing

1338
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:01,960
Potentially, you know, I suppose so take this thing like take this thing down to like like ang said in tech talk

1339
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,920
Take this down to like android q. So this has been around for a few years

1340
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,520
I'm not saying with n this happens

1341
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:13,800
But android q you have a really well flushed out multi-windowing system that you could download an iso for and set up on a laptop

1342
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,280
Or buy a chromebook that actually runs this

1343
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:22,120
Yeah, okay, I can see it yeah, I can see installing it on people's machines

1344
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:27,480
I mean I might if it was flushed out. I might rather install this on my like a friend's machine than say windows

1345
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:34,060
What do you think about uh, like uh wimpy? What do you think about like like, uh, more hardcore work cases that like production?

1346
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:37,880
Development do you think something do you think it's ever going to be possible on something like this?

1347
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:44,280
Um, my question to you is if this is an ubuntu desktop killer. Can you produce a show on it?

1348
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:47,560
You know, I don't know about today

1349
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:54,600
But uh, there are becoming some decent media production tools for android like uh, there are um ice cast

1350
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:01,320
And um live video streaming rtmp and and twitch you could do from android devices on ios

1351
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:04,200
There's full-fledged video editors. I have not looked on android

1352
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,760
Maybe I don't think I don't think today

1353
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:08,840
But maybe one day

1354
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,200
hmm

1355
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,280
Yeah, what about what about you wimpy? Could you do your?

1356
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:18,600
Could you do most of your daily driving on an android device if it was multi-windowed on a powerful considerably powerful hardware?

1357
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,760
So say you could pick your x86 box of choice

1358
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,640
I don't need much power to do what I do

1359
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:30,040
Um, but yes, um, I have used android successfully to do the things I would need to do of a day

1360
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,000
I could definitely see this on a tablet

1361
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,480
Like if you had a nice bluetooth keyboard and a good you know

1362
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:39,960
Like ssh program to get some work done and you have chrome up on one half of the screen terminal on the other

1363
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:41,960
That'd probably work for a lot of remote stuff
