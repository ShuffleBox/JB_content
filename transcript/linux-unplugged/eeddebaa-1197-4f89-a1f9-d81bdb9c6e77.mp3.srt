00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
We start the episode this week with a call out to you Linux users with old and weird

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,880
laptops.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,520
Direct quote there.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,520
We need help.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,600
Some backlight changes are coming to Linux 6.1 and users of old, weird laptops can actually

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,680
help make sure that we don't break things.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,200
I just think this is one of those great moments.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,320
So there are changes landing in Linux 6.1 that would allow setting the maximum brightness

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,160
amounts and then communicating that clearly when those controls are not supported.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,000
That seems like a great feature, right?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, early testing has actually shown that it's damaged some old, weird laptops.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So you're probably OK now.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,720
They've made some fixes there, but they still need testing.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,680
And there are ways you can just download and help test the next kernel today.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,680
Go help.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:01:01,760
Only you old, weird Linux laptop user can help.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,680
Hello friend, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,040
It's just me.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,360
My name's Chris.

20
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
Nobody else here today.

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,840
See, I let Brent off the hook because he had some sort of family hit he had to do.

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
It's family business.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,200
I can't get into it.

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,760
And then Wes got the sick.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,240
I think he was doing like some really important on location business for the show and he came

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,800
down with the sick.

27
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,400
So it's just me in studio this week.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,120
But I am joined by a fired up and ready to go virtual lug.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Time appropriate.

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Greetings.

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Mumble room.

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Hello.

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Hello.

34
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Hello.

35
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,600
Well, that is that's a I think that's a top five intro right there.

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Mumble room.

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Hello, everybody.

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Thanks for being in the in the silent listening today.

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,580
I hope you have your old weird Linux laptops ready to go because the kernel team needs

40
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,580
your help.

41
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,640
Coming up on the show today.

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,760
Let's discuss if I saw long time Linux users are holding Linux back a bit from the next

43
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
level of growth.

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,400
There's a couple of topics, both of which Liam at the register has just absolutely nailed

45
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
this week.

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,740
So I think, Liam, you are the unofficial co-host of the show this week because you've got two

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,640
pieces that I want to discuss with the Mumble room and with you listening out there.

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,980
And there have been some changes and some trends over time that have just been kind

49
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,760
of going in certain directions that mean kind of a fundamental way, a shift in a way that

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,200
the community communicates, organizes, develops.

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,300
Plus your good buddy, Leonard Pottering, the system developer, has a new idea on how to

52
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,960
really improve security for Linux.

53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:36,640
There's essentially one major change we could make and it may be good, may be bad, but it

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,100
also could reduce maybe the tinkerability of Linux, if you will.

55
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,640
So we'll talk about what that change could be, if it really is such a big deal and kind

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,840
of what the idea is and why some people are saying it gives Microsoft full control over

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Linux.

58
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
That's like the going all the way.

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,480
So I'll dig into that too.

60
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,780
And we'll round out the show with some boosts, some picks, and a heck of a lot more.

61
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,280
So before we go any further, I have to say good morning to our friends over at Tailscale.

62
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,440
They're like the secret sauce.

63
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,400
You know when you have some family member's food and it's just like extra tasty and you

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,520
discover they put butter in?

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,120
Tailscale's the butter for my networking.

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
It's so great.

67
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,480
It just makes everything work a little bit better.

68
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,800
It creates a mesh VPN powered and secured by WireGuard.

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,760
One flat network for all your devices that you can get going in just minutes.

70
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
We love it.

71
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,300
It'll change your networking game.

72
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,760
Go say good morning and try it for free for up to 20 devices over at tailscale.com.

73
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,560
Tell them the Unplugged program sent you.

74
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
So we'll see.

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,240
We'll see how we do today.

76
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Just me.

77
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,680
I don't even know how long it's been since I've done a solo show for the Unplugged program.

78
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,600
I wonder if anybody out there knows.

79
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,480
It's got to be hundreds of episodes, right?

80
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,040
I think the last time you did it, you were still doing the Linux action show.

81
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Probably.

82
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
Probably.

83
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Shoot.

84
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,080
Like I think I was in college the last time you did that.

85
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,200
That's 10 years ago.

86
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,600
Are you trying to make me feel old?

87
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Are you?

88
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:04,760
Look, man, you started doing this podcasting when I was in middle school, so I can make

89
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,840
you feel old by mentioning that fact.

90
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
You just did.

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
You just did.

92
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Yeah.

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,840
Yeah, I know.

94
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
That's pretty crazy.

95
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,400
I know this show is older than some of my kids.

96
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,080
That's also really weird because they're actual human beings that exist in the world.

97
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,960
You were not married when you started.

98
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Yeah.

99
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,440
And now I've been through divorce and remarried.

100
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,680
So how about that?

101
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,640
Well, the GNOME Project's going through a bit of a divorce with mailing lists.

102
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,800
The GNOME Project is preparing to shut down its mailing list towards the end of October,

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,840
which is right now.

104
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Happy Halloween, everybody.

105
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,560
And the Register has a great piece about that.

106
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,640
They interviewed the GNOME Project Executive Director, Neil McGovern, about this and several

107
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,800
others.

108
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,440
Neil points out, that's Neil from GNOME, not Neil from the Mumba Room, points out that

109
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,960
like many other projects that use Mailman, they find that relying on Python 2 is not

110
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,900
sustainable anymore, which probably means they have an old version of Mailman.

111
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,320
And so that's a reason that they're shutting down the mailing lists.

112
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,760
Evolution and other GNOME projects have made the announcement that their mailing list will

113
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,880
be retired at the end of October.

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,920
They write, as we've been communicating during the past few months, GNOME's Mailman platform

115
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
is being decommissioned.

116
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,520
And they cite the Python 2 deprecation.

117
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,080
And also, they cite a major burden with spam.

118
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,080
They say the deadline is currently set to be the end of October 2022.

119
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,280
Mailing list subscribers are invited to migrate to GNOME's discourse instance.

120
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
And they have some information about that.

121
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,380
And we'll come back to that discourse instance, because that's a major factor here.

122
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,280
Other projects are doing the same.

123
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,760
My read, and Neil, here in a second, I'd be curious to get yours, but my read is that

124
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,840
infrastructure kind of got out of date, both physically and software-wise.

125
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,480
The team has just had skills that evolved over those years.

126
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,600
They don't necessarily specialize in maintaining Mailman anymore.

127
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,560
So they don't necessarily have the right skills, people, or time to devote to replacing it

128
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,000
or upgrading.

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,720
And their mailing list has seen a steady decline since they rolled out that discourse.

130
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,760
And GNOME's infrastructure team coordinator told the register that, quote, the new platform

131
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:19,640
offers way more features than Mailman, including gamification, which newer generations in general

132
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:25,200
appreciate, but also markdown support, RSS feeds, proper spam support, multiple authentication

133
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,000
types, so on and so forth.

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,720
So I'm curious, Neil, because I know you've participated across the spectrum, are you

135
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,160
sad to see the slow death of mailing lists?

136
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,360
And it seems like it feels like, for some reason with the GNOME project kind of winding

137
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,000
this up, this is kind of a major one.

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,080
And I'm curious what your thoughts are.

139
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,800
So one of the big things I don't like about the elimination of mailing lists is that with

140
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,960
forums in particular, you have an interesting restriction on who you can talk to or communicate

141
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
with.

142
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,800
And that's all the people that are already there.

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,840
One of the unsung capabilities of mailing list-based communication that I've leveraged

144
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,980
over the years is being able to CC some other person somewhere else into a conversation

145
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:12,220
and deliberately bring them in and give them the ability to have context and whatever.

146
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,220
That's a great point.

147
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,600
I've also been told just behind the scenes that it's also how a lot of people scale across

148
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,480
multiple projects, which I'm curious if it's a tool for you, because you can aggregate

149
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,040
into one inbox.

150
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,840
It's the only way I can function.

151
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,580
Projects that have moved to the forums, I've mostly stopped engaging in because I can't,

152
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,180
in order for those things to work, I have to actually actively poke into those forums

153
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,220
and go look at them and whatever.

154
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,680
And yes, discourse has an email-based function.

155
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,480
No, it's not very good.

156
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,760
And RSS.

157
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
What browser has RSS support?

158
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,120
And yes, I could have a dedicated RSS reader.

159
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,320
I don't use one because I'm on different computers all the time.

160
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,380
And browsers are the only thing that stay in sync across all the computers I have.

161
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,600
And Google Reader killed it for all of us.

162
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Yeah, pretty much.

163
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Right?

164
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,160
So that comes back to, I don't have Google Reader anymore, so I don't exactly have a

165
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,880
good way of doing that.

166
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:11,400
But more seriously, this move to discourse, I suspect, is actually not driven by the things

167
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,940
you'd expect.

168
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,720
One of the things that has been going on undercurrent in GNOME infrastructure for the past few years

169
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,360
is that they've been retooling all of their infrastructure to run on top of Red Hat Open

170
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,480
Shift Container Platform.

171
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,240
And so all of their applications have to be able to deploy on Open Shift and run in the

172
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,200
Open Shift environment and scale with that and whatever.

173
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,000
They just recently redeployed the GNOME GitLab and broke everybody's ability to push via SSH

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,360
because the way that you have to do SSH, Git SSH in Open Shift or in Kubernetes in containerized

175
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,700
environments is completely different from non-containerized environments.

176
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,160
And so everybody has to adjust for that and stuff like that.

177
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,240
What about their argument that gamification appeals to a newer generation?

178
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
That's totally true.

179
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,600
That's why Fedora has the badges thing.

180
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,480
And we've got this whole big thing.

181
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,800
You remember a couple of years ago when the Butterfest stuff was going on, there was a

182
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,960
Butterfest badge for everyone who came in and tested.

183
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,600
That's still, I think, the most given away badge in the Fedora badges system.

184
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,840
So it was the most tested feature that we've ever done.

185
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,140
And that clearly shows the value of it.

186
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,740
But that's not the point.

187
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,600
The point is that they don't actually want to, they don't want to spend the effort to

188
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,760
move the mailing list onto Open Shift.

189
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,080
Maybe they could argue they don't have the right people on their team.

190
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Fooey.

191
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,280
If you can get GitLab to run on there, you can get Bloody Mailman to run on there.

192
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
All right.

193
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
Well, here's the other argument.

194
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,160
They say it reduces fragmentation amongst the GNOME communities.

195
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Improved integration.

196
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,160
They have a bridge with live matrix chat so they can move conversations between ephemeral

197
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,400
and something that's posted online.

198
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,040
And they say it's a modernization of the overall infrastructure project.

199
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,000
They've migrated IRC to matrix.

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This is the next thing.

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,840
This is akin to IRC moving to matrix, they say.

202
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,960
No, but sure.

203
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,560
There's certainly a modernization aspect to this.

204
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,280
But it's definitely not a, like, this is a strict improvement of the experience.

205
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,880
Each certainly allows richer formatting or whatever.

206
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,840
The biggest reason why email conversations aren't rich is because there's this convention

207
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,680
to use plain text emails and to do bottom posting and all this netiquette stuff from

208
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
the 90s.

209
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Whatever.

210
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
Fine.

211
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,240
Isn't there some truth, though, to the whole, you know, when you go on GitHub, all of a

212
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,120
sudden you get a lot more contributors?

213
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,440
Isn't that something to, like, when you go on discourse, all of a sudden you're going

214
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,640
to get a lot more people that can get their eyes on it?

215
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,260
Actually, here's another dirty secret.

216
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,320
All engagement in the GNOME project on various communication platforms has been going down.

217
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,320
So one of the GNOMEs told me privately that discourse is, like, kind of half dead in terms

218
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,600
of engagement from both developers and users.

219
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,240
And the mailing lists have also rotted, but so has everything else.

220
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:13,080
So if on the whole balance, engagement and communication is rotting and in decline, the

221
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,080
ones that are in decline the fastest are probably the ones worth kicking out.

222
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,400
And mailing lists are probably in decline way faster than all the other ones, because

223
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,600
people just leave and whatever, and sure.

224
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,280
And email, unlike the other platforms, is actually harder to keep up with because you

225
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,560
still have to do all the stuff to make sure you don't get listed as spam.

226
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,720
You have to update for the MTAs and all that other fun stuff.

227
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,480
But in general, like from what I've been told from a couple of from a few GNOMEs that are

228
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,560
involved in this, is that overall engagement in GNOME has actually gone downward in communication.

229
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,880
Discourse, mailing lists, IRC, all of it is all on a downward trend.

230
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
It doesn't feel like a technology problem to me, Neil.

231
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,480
It feels like a different problem going on there.

232
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
It's a different problem.

233
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,360
We're not going to talk about that.

234
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,400
I don't need that right now.

235
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,460
But basically, because there's a downward trend here and mailing lists are the harder

236
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,760
of the two to maintain, they're going to cut the mailing lists.

237
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,680
This is actually going to be a little painful because GNOME isn't the only project that

238
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,720
uses the GNOME mailing lists.

239
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,680
That was why I brought them up for discussion is because they're not the only project doing

240
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,840
this in the open source community broader.

241
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,360
So I wonder, if we zoom out from GNOME, what are we losing here?

242
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,260
I could think there's definitely an accessibility aspect we're losing because when you take

243
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,520
things out of plain text and out of email, you're automatically going to make it less

244
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,640
accessible to some folks, especially those that might be visually impaired or something

245
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,820
like that.

246
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:45,060
So I recognize that's a loss, but I'm wondering just outside of that, from a development community,

247
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,320
what else are we losing if we move away from that?

248
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,760
In some respects, you have to consider forms are a lot less asynchronous than email is.

249
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,920
Because in order for you to engage, there's a different set of expectations when you're

250
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
working with web forms.

251
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,140
But can't you argue they're more transparent because they're on the web and available to

252
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,140
anyone?

253
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,720
I think that depends.

254
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,000
It depends on how you run the form.

255
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,720
It depends on how the form works.

256
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
It depends.

257
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
There's a lot of factors here.

258
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
But there are some common things.

259
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,240
So web forms are pseudosynchronous.

260
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,000
And that means that while they're technically asynchronous, there's a lot of community expectation

261
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
of timeliness.

262
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,680
For example, the GNOME discourse auto locks discussion threads after so many days of inactivity.

263
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,020
That is a pseudosynchronous thing to do.

264
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,600
That means that there is an expectation that there is engagement continually.

265
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:43,000
But the way that discourse in most web forums work, you have to actually directly go there

266
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and pull the stuff.

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,240
So not push-based, pull-based engagement.

268
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,040
And because it's pull-based engagement, the effort is on you to find out what's going

269
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
on.

270
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,200
Yes, there are certain ways to mitigate some of this.

271
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,600
But you can't fully mitigate it because it's built into the model.

272
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,360
Whereas emails are push-based, generally when you subscribe to something, the engagement

273
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
comes to you.

274
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,160
And you make the choice to interact with it.

275
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,840
And there is not really a straightforward way to lock people out of a conversation.

276
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
True.

277
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,760
And it's pretty easy for you to develop your own tooling around that to manage it, filter

278
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,760
it, and sort it.

279
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,640
But I will say from a research standpoint, like when I'm investigating a story for Linux

280
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Action News.

281
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
Forums are easier.

282
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Yeah.

283
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
Way easier to search.

284
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Way easier to find stuff.

285
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,800
Way easier as an outsider to come in and get a get a good picture of what the conversation

286
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
has been.

287
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,120
A mailing list is a chore sometimes to track it all down.

288
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,960
I mean, there is that aspect to it.

289
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Sure, there is.

290
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,500
And also, it also depends on what kind of archiver is being used, right?

291
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,440
Some archivers have a search engine, others don't.

292
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Most projects using Mailman 2 or Pony something or other, I forget what the Apache one is,

293
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,560
Ponymail, I think, they don't have any of this.

294
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,400
And so it's, or God forbid you want to search the SourceForge ones, like that custom front

295
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,040
end is so garbage.

296
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,320
Oh, man.

297
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,520
Oh, man.

298
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,040
Painful memories there.

299
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Right.

300
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Those are difficult for sure.

301
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,840
But like, if you look at HyperKitty, shoot, there's groups.io is a mailing list platform.

302
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,280
It's a commercial SaaS based one and Google Groups and those it's Yeah, you're right.

303
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
They have decent search.

304
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,620
They're a lot more accessible to find these things.

305
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,080
They also all have the unique capability of letting you reply from the web.

306
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,720
I wanted to give NJCS a chance to jump in here in regards to email, accessibility, all

307
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
of that.

308
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Go ahead.

309
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,800
First, I'm seeing in the chat and I want to differentiate a couple different accessibilities

310
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,840
that people seem to be talking about.

311
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,400
There's information accessibility when it comes to this kind of thing, which is great

312
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,880
to mail client as long as you're pulling down copies of things, you can search through things

313
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,440
and a mailing list is super easy to get through with a control F or however you want to search

314
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,560
through that text.

315
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,880
But then there's also the accessibility of low vision users, I happen to be one.

316
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,260
And after a stint of several years working in large educational institutions that still

317
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:02,280
use Mailman specifically to do mass mailings and group discussions, I can say that from

318
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,580
a visual perspective or a low vision perspective, mailing lists are awful to get through as

319
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:14,480
a low vision user, unless you have a specialty client that's going to understand the conversation

320
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
nature.

321
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,200
Otherwise, you're listening to the entire wall of text.

322
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,880
So moving any type of mailing list for visual accessibility reasons to a web-based plant

323
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,920
that understands messages, that understands the web standards that can separate things

324
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,360
out for screen readers, big plus, something that I would be very excited about.

325
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,600
Well, that's great insight.

326
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Thank you for that.

327
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
That's good to know.

328
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,880
I want to give Gamma a chance to jump in on the demographics of users that could be using

329
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
these systems.

330
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Go ahead, Gamma.

331
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,880
Like Neil actually mentioned earlier, when you have an email, you can be subscribed

332
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,120
to so many different emails and pull them in fairly passively.

333
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,760
So you can be engaged in the community fairly easily.

334
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,080
There's a lot more passive, almost drive-by nature, and you really don't get that in a

335
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,200
forum where you have to go out and actively be engaged in it.

336
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:15,600
People who are going to the GNOME discourse are people who are actively seeking out GNOME

337
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,320
things, like maybe it's a news, it's a reactionary that they're going there, instead of they're

338
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,680
passively like, oh, they're seeing stuff as it's going on, no, they're going there for

339
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
a reason.

340
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
I could see your point there.

341
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,600
Well, ultimately, Neil, I kind of want to know your thoughts around just, I know I'm

342
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,920
sure you have lots, but my thinking is developers are really the target demographic here.

343
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,320
Developers are capable of using their own tooling and consuming this information in

344
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,080
their own way to work best with their particular workflow.

345
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,200
Is that not a factor in this, and don't mailing lists potentially suit that use case better?

346
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,840
Again, because we're not looking for everyday users, we're looking for developers here.

347
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
For sure, right?

348
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,080
Like everyday users, I think, totally can be satisfied by forums.

349
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,920
And I've actually made this point before in other venues that user support isn't well

350
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
served by mailing lists.

351
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,480
They're actually better served with web forums and things like that because you don't want

352
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,360
brandos being pulled in and all kinds of crazy places, and you generally want a more curated

353
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,680
experience there.

354
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,600
Whereas developer engagement, especially the highly distributed nature of open source development,

355
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,200
it doesn't work super well when you have islands for communication.

356
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,680
But also, I wanted to mention something else.

357
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,680
I forget which one, like someone made that point about the accessibility stuff.

358
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,840
This is actually also a function of what kind of web email archiver you have.

359
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:47,080
Some archivers do translate email conversations into something that screen readers and whatever

360
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,000
can actually handle in the same way that they would handle a web forum.

361
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,440
And I know that those are not terribly common in the open source space yet, but for example,

362
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,320
I think HyperKitty groups, I owe Google groups, they all actually use these tags and smart

363
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,140
detection to make it so that these conversations are handled in the same way that you would

364
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,200
handle, say, quoted messages and web forums, and you're able to ignore them and process

365
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,520
them properly and things like that.

366
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,200
Unfortunately not everybody is using that.

367
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,780
You've still got your mailman twos, you've got your pony mails, you've got your ML MMJs

368
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,360
and all these other older ones that just don't do any of this stuff.

369
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,320
Mailing lists are an email experience that you make of it, whereas web forums are typically

370
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,520
what they've made for you, and that's where I think the crux of the difference is.

371
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,440
That's not to say that anyone else's concerns about mailing lists are invalid, but it's

372
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:45,320
certainly something where the group implementing the mailing list has to care to deal with

373
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,720
these problems.

374
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,400
Linode.com slash unplugged.

375
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,200
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and it's just a great way to

376
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,000
support the show while you're really trying out the Linode platform.

377
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,100
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting with really the best support in the business because

378
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,320
Linode is architected differently.

379
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,640
They're built around a great product that had to do well in the marketplace, and they

380
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,400
had to actually compete for their customers by making something they'd want to use.

381
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,320
And so in that, they have created a fantastic support department that's available 365.

382
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,140
The first person you contact is the person who resolves it.

383
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,680
They don't have to do that silly game of escalation, but let's be real.

384
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,720
On the big hyperscaler platforms, the support situation is obtuse, it's a nightmare, it's

385
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,480
opaque, it's awful, and it always starts with a chat bot.

386
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,640
So Linode is a little differently because their product had to be great, so the systems

387
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:46,000
are fast, the dashboard is fantastic, the API is clear and easy to implement, the infrastructure

388
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,640
management tools are whatever you want to use, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, yeah,

389
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
it all works.

390
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,920
And they managed to do it while they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers that

391
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,820
just want to lock into their crazy platform that they like to pretend they invented.

392
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,120
But on top of that, the performance is just fantastic.

393
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
It's so good.

394
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,720
I've had an opportunity to try out their GPU rigs, I've had an opportunity to try out their

395
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,080
dedicated CPU systems, their monster systems.

396
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,220
I've got a matrix box with like 48 CPU cores and something like 96 or 128 gigs of RAM.

397
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,160
It's in the category of like the number so high that it just doesn't really even make

398
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,440
sense anymore.

399
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,720
The performance is insane, and we started that at a tiny little system, a tiny little

400
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,280
two-core box with eight gigs of RAM or something like that, that we just scaled up over time

401
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,720
as our matrix user base needed it.

402
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,280
I couldn't have done that with a physical box.

403
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,780
I may have, if I built something, I may have started with something a little more powerful

404
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:45,700
than two cores and eight gigs of RAM, but within a few months, I have way, way, way

405
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,440
outstripped what I would have been able to afford to build, and I just did it incrementally

406
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,440
as our user demand required it.

407
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,720
It was really simple to use their tools to do that.

408
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,800
Plus we have backups and snapshots.

409
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,480
They got 11 data centers for you to choose from.

410
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,360
They're bringing on a whole bunch more next year.

411
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,860
So go build something.

412
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
Go learn about something.

413
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,080
It's a great way to try out an open source project on incredibly fast hardware.

414
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,960
Go try it for yourself with that $100.

415
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
Really kick the tires.

416
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,440
Linode.com slash unplugged is where you go, supports the show, and you get that $100.

417
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,040
Linode.com slash unplugged.

418
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,520
Just a spot of housekeeping here because it's all on me this week.

419
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,400
Nobody else is here to clean up, and who's going to bring the meat?

420
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
This is rough.

421
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,400
I mean, I know it sucks for West to get sick, but did nobody think about me?

422
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,800
Anyways, just a few things to mention.

423
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,240
If you haven't checked out our new community-built website at jupiterbroadcasting.com, something

424
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,960
really special is going on over there, and it is totally open on our GitHub over at Jupiter

425
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Broadcasting GitHub.

426
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
I don't know, github.com.

427
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
You get it, right?

428
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,800
It's a URL, and then you put slash our name in there.

429
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,880
Anyways, you go there to the.com section, and you can open up an issue, and you can

430
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,640
all participate, and we're kind of putting a challenge out to the community.

431
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,480
I talked about this in Office Hours 15.

432
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:10,640
I think we are probably a few months away, if people worked on it, from a portable, open-source,

433
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,120
fully self-hostable, podcasting 2.0 compatible podcast network website.

434
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,600
You know what's weird?

435
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,400
There's no really good site built for a podcast network.

436
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,840
You know, like my buddy Joe and Michael, they have Tux Digital, and Joe's got his Late Night

437
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,360
Linux series of shows, and they've all kind of taken different approaches like I have

438
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,320
at trying to either centralize or not centralize all of the shows.

439
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,920
Like, how do you do that right?

440
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,380
It's not like anything just does it out of the box, and when you go look for like templates

441
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,840
for like Hugo or WordPress, what you find is like something that's designed for a single

442
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
person.

443
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,480
And it's all like old-school, like Apple sets the terms on what the RSS feed supports.

444
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,040
Just like an old janky way of doing it.

445
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,400
And I don't know if we'll ever get there, but I kind of put the challenge out in Office

446
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Hours 15.

447
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,280
So the details are at officehours.hair.com.

448
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,760
Episode is one PR at a time.

449
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,520
I don't think it'd be that much work to like make it possible to swap out the branding,

450
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,760
swap out the theming, and build your own network Hugo site, and the beautiful thing is this

451
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,920
thing builds itself.

452
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,440
When we release an episode, it just automatically builds itself.

453
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,400
Every post is automatically generated.

454
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
I don't have to do a thing.

455
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,400
It's so beautiful, and it's how it should be.

456
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
And we're building it out even more.

457
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
We're not done yet.

458
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,560
We're adding more podcasting 2.0 features and specs, and we're opening, we've opened

459
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,680
up the development to the community.

460
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,360
So there's all kinds of things that are open or can be improved.

461
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,160
We just recently had some big updates to the website to make it possible to automatically

462
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,000
update the sponsor segment and all of that.

463
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,320
We'll be talking about all of that more in Office Hours.

464
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,640
I've decided I'm putting it all in Office Hours, but I wanted to make you aware in case

465
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,080
you haven't been listening.

466
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,520
Our Matrix community has been growing like crazy too.

467
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,440
Details for that over at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Matrix.

468
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,520
I'd love to have you join us over there and hang out with a crowd.

469
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Go get the Element app.

470
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
It's open source.

471
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,000
You can use it in your web browser or you can use it as a downloadable standalone like

472
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
flat packer.

473
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't know.

474
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It's probably a snap.

475
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,680
I got some baller boosts I want to thank before we get into the big meat of the show today.

476
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,360
John A, you sneaky, sneaky SOB.

477
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,680
So I get it, man.

478
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,680
I get it.

479
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
Deleted came in.

480
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,240
She kind of threw you off your game, threw down a challenge.

481
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,360
She felt like it was a lot of pressure.

482
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
Stats aren't free.

483
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,920
They are on sale right now, but they're not free.

484
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,720
They recently went up a little bit in price.

485
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,400
I know how you're feeling.

486
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,960
You're feeling like I can't do this.

487
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,960
So John A boosts in 10,000 sats, he's like, OK, I got to go low this week, someone else

488
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,800
can have the glorious experience of paying to hear the Hey Rich Lobster song played after

489
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
their mention.

490
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,160
All right, John A, for you.

491
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,200
Hey Rich Lobster.

492
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,580
You see, John A likes to stay in touch.

493
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,880
So as the week goes on, John A sends another 5,000 sats.

494
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,800
As to my location, I'm actually in the Yakima area.

495
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
You ever heard of Yakima hops?

496
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,460
That's where it comes from.

497
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,980
The delicious Yakima hops in your beer.

498
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,980
That's where John A lives.

499
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,880
He lives in the valley of Yakima hops.

500
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,600
So if you guys ever go to Spokane for a meetup, I'd absolutely try to make it over there.

501
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,560
OK, all right.

502
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
That sounds great, John.

503
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,660
So then John A sends in another 5,000 sats and he says, I also will be in the Seattle

504
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,840
area sometime in the next two to four weeks.

505
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,760
I could always drop by the studio and say hi.

506
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,040
I would love to see your setup anyways.

507
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,400
I moonlight as a pro audio guy.

508
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,520
Well, first of all, I want to hear more about that, John.

509
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,320
You got any demos?

510
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,140
Got any examples?

511
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,180
But how dare you ask that?

512
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,180
How dare you?

513
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,180
No, I'm kidding.

514
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,180
Totally.

515
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,180
You could totally join us.

516
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,560
Send me a boost when you're getting close, when the date is approaching and we'll arrange

517
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,960
a little hangout here in the studio.

518
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,760
We got a third seat you can hang out in.

519
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,160
So I think that I think that in total puts you up to 20,000 sats, which puts you in the

520
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
baller section.

521
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,380
So you made it and you would have been our top baller.

522
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,240
But then out of absolutely nowhere, a sleeper baller comes in.

523
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,240
Two hundred thousand sats.

524
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,280
Hey, rich lobster.

525
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:19,120
From Enutech, it was actually one hundred thousand, but then because I got their name

526
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,280
right on the live stream, it became two hundred thousand.

527
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,180
So that's I've never been rewarded like that for getting a pronunciation right.

528
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,000
It totally restructures the motivation.

529
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,600
As humans respond to incentives, my friend, he writes, I stopped using GNOME because of

530
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,280
the member's attitude and hostility towards its users and the way they insult potential

531
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,600
contributors in downstream projects.

532
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,440
So this is a this is a sentiment that I've been hearing from the audience is something

533
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,760
we talked about in our members pre-show.

534
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,760
I'm curious to know if the politics or the communication style of the project matters

535
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,680
to you at all out there, dear listener.

536
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,000
We talked a lot about it on our live stream today.

537
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,680
I'm curious to know out there in the download audience, do you really care?

538
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:09,040
I realized one of the things I really enjoy about Arch and Nix is I can't really articulate

539
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,400
any political positions necessarily that any of the leadership take.

540
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,920
Now, if I dig around in my memory, I can.

541
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,360
But for the most part, I can't think of any like controversial things coming out of those

542
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
projects.

543
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Right.

544
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Like I could name some out of every other project.

545
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,600
But, you know, just as an example.

546
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,200
And there is something nice about that and something that is a factor when I choose a

547
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
distribution.

548
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,080
But I'm curious out there if that is true for you, like it is for any tech.

549
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,480
So you can let me know by sending a booster going to Linux some plug dot com slash contact.

550
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,760
I want to thank you guys for the baller boost.

551
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,320
I know they're still getting it's still kind of early uptake on the adoption outside of

552
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,960
just showing your support for the show.

553
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,800
Personally for me, it makes it makes me feel pretty good because I am I'm not totally comfortable

554
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,120
with the way the podcasting and just general ad market is going.

555
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,680
I don't actually know if we're going to be screwed, but I just keep hearing all of these

556
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,360
disastrous reports by by the podcast networks and and podcasters that are like, you know,

557
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,080
they get like two hundred, three hundred thousand, a million downloads of the really big numbers.

558
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,240
And I just keep hearing these devastating stories about how they've lost their sponsors

559
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,600
and like just seem sponsor spends are way, way down.

560
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,800
Wes isn't here today, but he was just recently telling me about a podcast that has dynamic

561
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,320
ads that he's listened to forever, but they just switched to dynamic ad insertion because

562
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,600
they lost their advertiser.

563
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,600
And I think he said, not only is it somebody that you can barely understand because their

564
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:44,280
mic's horrible, but to fit in a longer ad read into a smaller section, they like time

565
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,760
compressed it.

566
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,520
So it switched it switches to the ad read at like two X speed.

567
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:55,000
So the ad read sounds like a chipmunk going super fast, like just absolutely horrible.

568
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,160
What's going on right now, and I just it seems like a slow decline.

569
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:04,080
And I have to say, I hate to say it because it hurts me because I've been a customer of

570
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,600
theirs for, I don't know, 13 years, but I feel like Libsyn is undercutting the podcast

571
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,040
industry as well, the very industry they serve.

572
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,080
Libsyn is is doing their best to undercut advertising and podcasting at the time when

573
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,400
there's just a lot of pressure.

574
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,800
And I worry about the tough decisions that my friends out there will have to make and

575
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,880
that other small businesses will have to make.

576
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,120
And the boosts are just outside of all of that.

577
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,960
It's just a system that is outside of all of it.

578
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,120
And there's something that I fantasize that if everything went really bad and JB collapsed

579
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,680
and everything just totally fell apart, I feel like I would still be going down the

580
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:52,840
road and Lady Joop somehow fueled by corn fuel and podcasting powered by sats.

581
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,520
That would still be a thing that would still be that still would be online.

582
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,400
PayPal could be gone or I wouldn't use, you know, just like it feels like it's this, you

583
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,200
know, that there's like in the back of my mind, there's that Linux prepper in me that's

584
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,560
always thinking about how do I be completely non-dependent on any commercial platform,

585
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,620
on any centralized network, on anything that's closed source, that RMS in the back of my

586
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,160
head that says, don't trust the closed proprietary networks.

587
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,080
The commercial systems will always inevitably screw you.

588
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,480
So the baller boosts are really kind of a way that says to me, like, there's people

589
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,600
out there that get this, you know, you know, this is my livelihood, right?

590
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,600
If things just went really sideways, I feel like there'd be a community out there between

591
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,320
the members and the boosters and people who contribute to the website and people who show

592
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,280
up in the mumble room and people who participate in our chat rooms, the people who have contributed

593
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,880
to the meetups or have shared the show with somebody like all these ways.

594
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,080
So that's the core value, that would continue to happen.

595
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,040
That value for value would continue regardless of what happened with anything in the rest

596
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,240
of the market, what happened to the podcast landscape, that stuff's a foundation.

597
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,700
And that's why it's such a big deal to me.

598
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:01,320
So thank you to John A. Thank you to Enutech and we'll get to more boosts later on in the

599
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
show.

600
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,320
But I also have in the show notes a link to how the Serenity OS developer makes a living.

601
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,720
And that is some lean, lean living.

602
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,920
But it's interesting how they get it done.

603
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,360
So I have a link in the show notes if you're curious about that.

604
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,920
But let's shift gears and talk about the future direction of Linux and just how secure we

605
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,740
need it to be.

606
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:26,400
So Lenart Pottering, the system D developer, has written a lengthy, very technical, very

607
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,880
jargon heavy blog post.

608
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,440
He does put a glossary at the bottom.

609
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,920
It is entitled, quote, a brave new trusted boot world in which he outlines the current

610
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,840
issues with the Linux boot process, in his opinion, and how there could be a way for

611
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:48,800
providing a more secure, robust and trusted boot experience, leveraging your favorite

612
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:55,520
technologies like TPM, secure boot and things like that, specifically TPM 2.0 hardware,

613
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,480
sort of like Windows 11.

614
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,000
Essentially the issue that Lenart brings up is that there is this flaw.

615
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,900
No matter how secure you make everything else, when you update things that touch the current

616
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,760
kernel, your Linux system updates your initial RAM disk and builds a new one.

617
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,880
And there is an opportunity for nasty things to get slipped in there, he thinks.

618
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,280
You update, you know, a kernel and you get a new version of the graphics driver, you're

619
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,800
building a new init, right?

620
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,160
Like you guys, you've all seen this if you've updated Linux for a period of time.

621
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:31,960
So Lenart is essentially proposing a unified kernel image or a UKI for the kids out there,

622
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:38,440
which is a combination of a Linux kernel image and init image or init RD image.

623
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,600
My OBS system is freaking out because I'm talking about changing Linux right now.

624
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,220
That's kind of funny.

625
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:53,700
And a UEFI bootstub program that would all be loaded into a single UEFI PE file.

626
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,180
And the PE file stands for Microsoft Portable Executable, which you can probably start to

627
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,200
get why it bothers some people.

628
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,340
And a shim is a boot component that extends the public key database that secure boot maintains

629
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,240
and you can use that shim in there.

630
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:16,160
So all of this is a really sophisticated system to create this unified kernel that lives in

631
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,360
UEFI that would be completely signed.

632
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,360
And then you would know that absolutely everything is secure because what Lenart says the issue

633
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:30,920
here is somebody could just insert something in that init image and then you can have the

634
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:36,440
most secure system in the absolute total protected world, but none of it's going to matter if

635
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,280
that little init RAM image gets created and you got malware in there and it can just infect

636
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,200
the system over and over and over again.

637
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,760
And then you scan your system and everything looks good and you're not in that scanner

638
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,160
isn't necessarily like going to decompress and open up the image and look at the init

639
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
image, right?

640
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,880
Like that's probably not happening.

641
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,480
So you're just kind of blind to it and it can just attack a system over and over again.

642
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Hold up.

643
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,480
Why wouldn't it?

644
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Why wouldn't it open up the init RAM?

645
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
I mean, it totally could.

646
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
It should.

647
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,240
Like Windows malware scanners open up zip files and tarballs and all those things.

648
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
Yeah.

649
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,920
If we make the assumption that we're not going to scan like archives on our disk, we're screwed

650
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,760
a lot of different ways.

651
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,000
So let me ask you, what are your and I agree.

652
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,660
I'm just saying I'm just I'm just making I'm trying to I'm trying to articulate Lenart's

653
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,660
case here.

654
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,360
And I assume this is, you know, they're thinking primarily in server context and probably maybe

655
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
laptops.

656
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,120
And I think it's actually primarily driven by laptops and not servers.

657
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,360
That's my question, Neil, is what is the demand here?

658
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,700
Who is asking for this?

659
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,700
What is this use case?

660
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,280
OK, so first of all, nobody's asking for this.

661
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,000
That's the important part to remember.

662
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,200
The second thing is they're thinking about like this isn't super useful on.

663
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,300
Well, OK, of course it could be useful on servers, particularly ones that are like edge

664
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,840
devices that are actually floating around.

665
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,260
The key thing is this is primarily useful if the device that's running Linux is mobile.

666
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,560
It moves around.

667
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
It is.

668
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,760
It is not fixed into a secure location.

669
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,360
Most servers are fixed into a data center or a cloud or whatever.

670
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,920
And basically you have perimeter protections, you have fixed area protections, things like

671
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,240
that.

672
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,160
This just becomes redundant on top of all of that.

673
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,520
And then that's redundant protections, belt and suspenders.

674
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,080
That's all well and good.

675
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:27,780
But when you look at where most of the attacks are happening, they're not at servers anymore.

676
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,980
They're at customer premises equipment.

677
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:35,240
So those are edge devices, those are laptops, those are desktop computers or whatever.

678
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
What about Android?

679
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Android.

680
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,680
Yeah, Android has a similar system to this already.

681
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,340
They already do this.

682
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,320
But here's the problem.

683
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,680
Android devices can do this because the user is fundamentally not screwing around with

684
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,520
the host operating system.

685
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,340
The brave new trusted boot world that Leonard is talking about is immediately violated by

686
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,920
two particular conditions.

687
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,640
The first condition is if you need to install a third party driver.

688
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:10,240
Because in Linux land, your drivers need to be able to be part of the init RAMFS in order

689
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,260
to boot the system properly, particularly graphics drivers, storage drivers, things

690
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,320
like that.

691
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,840
In the server space, network cards frequently, and storage controllers, even more so, are

692
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,840
proprietary out of three drivers that you have to load into them.

693
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,100
So once you have those cases, you can't do this anymore.

694
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:35,680
Then you have hardware, you have accelerators and things like that, like the NVIDIA, what's

695
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,160
it the CUDA accelerator things for data centers, and things like that.

696
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,980
Again, you're back to the NVIDIA driver.

697
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,840
As soon as you have these things, you can't do any of this because you have to generate

698
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,480
a custom init RAMFS.

699
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,160
But what they're, I think, envisioning here is that the default case is what they're hoping

700
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,480
for, where you have your basic Intel laptop with all the hardware fully supported in the

701
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,480
mainline kernel.

702
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,760
You can produce an init RAMA disk, an init RAMFS unified kernel image server side, like

703
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,040
the distribution provides it, signs it with their key, does the whole kit and caboodle.

704
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,520
You do that up front, ship it out as an RPM or whatever, and then you install it on your

705
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,220
system and the keychain goes through like, okay, shim verifies against the Microsoft

706
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,200
third-party UEFI cert, boots that, grub is cross-signed with both the Microsoft cert

707
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,120
as well as the distro cert.

708
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,360
So that passes the validation chain so that the grub that trusts the distro cert then

709
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,480
boots the kernel, which then goes forward and does the PCR check and verifies that the

710
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,200
image is there and then goes forward into the operating system and then the Linux takes

711
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
over with lockdown.

712
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,880
Yeah, in reality, we can't do any of this because there's not enough integration at

713
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,680
the upper layers of the stack and there's no interest.

714
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:51,160
There's no interest in providing this kind of security because all of this requires giving

715
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,440
up control to the user.

716
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,280
The other obvious issue here is that, as you just articulated, it also builds a dependency

717
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
on Microsoft.

718
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,920
Well, no, the Microsoft dependency is not a given.

719
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,920
Right.

720
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,720
I know you could, you could, but most hardware manufacturers don't even allow you to load

721
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
your own keys.

722
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
The ones that do, you could.

723
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,320
Yeah, the ones that you do and some of them are buggy where you could break everything

724
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,960
by doing that.

725
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,320
The crux of the issue is that if you actually want to do this properly, you basically need

726
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,200
custom BIOS firmware too because you have to guarantee that you can articulate the security

727
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
at that level.

728
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,640
Now, this makes the assumption that your firmware is good, your CPU is good and all that fun

729
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,240
stuff, but you can't make that assumption because it's usually not.

730
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,240
Yeah, it's not.

731
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,720
Yeah, it never is.

732
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Right.

733
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,160
That's not to say that we shouldn't try to strive for more security in this stuff and

734
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:47,080
TPM is actually like, take aside the UKI stuff, you can do this TPM asserts on things to better

735
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
protect the system.

736
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,120
You can also do an indirect trust by saying, all right, your init remfs has been checked,

737
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:58,680
summoned, verified, and you store the verification on the ESP and the bootloader then verifies

738
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,560
that part and checks it to make sure that it hasn't been tampered with and the bootloader

739
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,280
image itself is regenerated to include the checksum inside the binary.

740
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,760
You've just described the NixOS boot spec.

741
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,160
That's a research project to do this.

742
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
Right.

743
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,200
So then if you go further down the road, then you want to have your root file system locked

744
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
down with that.

745
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,320
You want to have FSVarity or something like that, which then has authenticity, so you

746
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,200
do authentication to verify the integrity of the file system.

747
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,040
So all your operating system components are verified against the distro key, all imbued

748
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,840
into the file system, and that's trusted by the Linux kernel through something.

749
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,120
You could also do IMA to do other things.

750
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,040
You can have a kernel key ring of all these components, all files that are verified with

751
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
that.

752
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,400
There are a lot of different ways to do this to solve this problem.

753
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Okay.

754
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,800
So you're convincing me that this isn't necessarily the only way to solve this.

755
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:52,060
So I've noticed a much stronger than typical reaction of this is Microsoft because now

756
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,960
Linart works at Microsoft.

757
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,980
This is Microsoft just embracing and extending and everybody's conspiracy theories about

758
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,360
System D and Linart were true all along.

759
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,600
I've seen memes about it already, told you.

760
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,280
So this is definitely not a Microsoft thing because I can tell you that Linart's been

761
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,600
complaining about this for like 10 years now.

762
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,040
He's been complaining about this on the Fedora mailing list for God knows how long.

763
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,300
He's been complaining about it in System D mailing lists for even longer.

764
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,960
He's been pushing everybody to use System D boot even though the user experience of

765
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,880
SD boot is kind of crap.

766
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,860
And it just makes it so like he's not making any friends with this proposal because he

767
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,000
doesn't know how to communicate that.

768
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,560
And the other people that are actually signed on to this, like if you look at the bottom

769
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,320
blog post, there's a number of people who are also signed on to this.

770
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,320
Some of them actually do a much better job of communicating the value problem of this.

771
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,400
And I certainly understand it.

772
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,680
I work at a company where I help build freaking edge devices.

773
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,700
I of course see the value of this, but I also have to work with said edge devices that have

774
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,520
broken UEFI and can't actually do this correctly.

775
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,000
And the TPM doesn't work the way it's supposed to.

776
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,640
And like the CPU just bugs out all the time.

777
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,760
So like what am I supposed to do?

778
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,080
I don't know.

779
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,600
It makes me realize, though, that if System D were to start life today, Linart were to

780
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:11,120
start System D at Microsoft, there's no way it would have gotten the traction.

781
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,840
It would have immediately been called out as an embrace and extend technology.

782
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,400
It never would have taken off on Linux.

783
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Yeah, no.

784
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,360
Like Microsoft is not a company you want to have start like from a political perspective.

785
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,040
This is irrespective of what good or bad or whatever, irrespective.

786
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,040
You just don't want Microsoft to be creating Linux technologies because there is a large

787
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,560
contingent rightfully or wrongfully, I'm not going to make a value judgment here, that

788
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,880
Microsoft can't make a good technology choice for Linux stuff for the broader ecosystem

789
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,360
without surreptitiously screwing over everyone in the process.

790
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,400
So I have a question, and this is open to anyone in the Mumble Room, of course, open

791
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,400
to you too, Neil.

792
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,800
But I wonder if this isn't sort of symptomatic of a larger tendency in free software development

793
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,440
where the engineers, the bright people are always trying to build these really next advanced

794
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,280
systems and these complicated ways of doing things that are so great.

795
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,640
But when you look at the fundamental like pragmatic ways we could improve Linux security,

796
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,040
I was just taking a quick little look skis through the System D GitHub open issues and

797
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,600
pull requests.

798
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:18,120
They have almost 1800 open issues right now, 209 of those are labeled as bugs.

799
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,480
Some of those could be security issues, 22 are labeled as needing total rework.

800
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,280
There's even more that are labeled as needing like complete re-architecting.

801
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,900
There's 197 different labels that describe the various different issues that people are

802
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:35,160
having with different problems on System D. One of the most recent ones today, issue number

803
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:43,360
25,160, our syslog takes 100% of CPU on certain systems with System D when they interact with

804
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,120
each other, 100% CPU.

805
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,260
That probably doesn't leave your system at a very good state.

806
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,460
That probably exposes it to security issues as well.

807
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,000
It's like we don't look internally at the things that we could improve, the obvious

808
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,200
problems in front of us.

809
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,680
Instead, it's always like, well, what's the next big pie in the sky idea?

810
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,600
What's the next big thing?

811
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,480
Instead of just looking at the open issues and going, well, you know, if I fixed a couple

812
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,600
of hundred of these, or if we focused on a couple of these, we could just dramatically

813
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,080
improve security for multiple distributions across the board because so many people now

814
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,640
are shipping System D. What is this tendency?

815
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,480
This tendency is it's not fun.

816
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,480
Is it just that?

817
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,480
Because that just seems like such a...

818
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,080
So, Lenart at the core of it is an architect.

819
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:33,600
He wants to build architectures that align with what he believes are important.

820
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:38,760
Personal theory crafting thing here is, I think one of the reasons he went to Microsoft

821
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,280
is because as part of the Azure Linux team, he's working on CBL Mariner, and he gets to

822
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,280
do this.

823
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,000
He gets to be an architect to build out what he believes is the dream vision of a legacy-free

824
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Linux system.

825
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,320
And I'm curious to see it because I think he's an intelligent individual.

826
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,320
I don't mind.

827
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,320
Sure.

828
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,200
I mean, he's not always wrong, or actually, even most of the time, he's not wrong.

829
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,960
He does a really good job, and he comes up with things, and he solves hard problems.

830
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,720
But one of the things that he's struggled with, and this is true of many of the community,

831
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,640
I could name many, many people, and I'm subject to this sometimes myself, is we don't want

832
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,400
to think about what it takes to account for the real world when we want to solve a problem.

833
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,360
We don't want to think about what it takes to adapt to the ugly messes that we already

834
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,360
have today.

835
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:29,420
We don't want to think about, how do we build something where we minimize the pain to stakeholders

836
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,760
around us to make things better?

837
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,040
A good example of this is how we've gone around with sandboxing.

838
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,080
Sandboxing applications didn't require us to change the way we delivered applications

839
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,240
in the first place, but we tied the two together because that made it more interesting, and

840
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,800
it was more disruptive, and it meant that you could do more breaking things.

841
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,960
But we didn't have to do that, neither Microsoft or Apple did.

842
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,680
There are various ways that you could implement sandboxing without having to do that.

843
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,160
There are all kinds of other things out there that we could have done.

844
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,520
People are just not interested in working on the problems that we have today.

845
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,240
They want to work on the problems we might have tomorrow because those are more interesting

846
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,680
or more fun or more Greenfield or whatever.

847
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,400
Nobody likes working on brownfield projects.

848
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,520
Everyone wants to work on a Greenfield one.

849
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:20,000
What it sounds like to me is, if this were, say, executed on, to the degree that Leonard

850
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,960
outlines, which we have a link to his blog post in the show notes, it would kind of seem

851
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,340
like essentially the default bar would be Linux could only boot on systems that can

852
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,480
also boot Windows 11.

853
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,840
Like, you know that mark that Microsoft made that Windows 11, Linux would be hell...

854
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,600
And that, I mean, talk about, like, we talk about eliminating 32-bit support, or we talk

855
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,000
about eliminating 486 architecture support.

856
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,760
Talk about eliminating a lot of users.

857
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,600
And then on the ARM side of the world, Secure Boot often can't even be disabled.

858
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,120
Like, on x86, you can sometimes turn that stuff off, but you can't on the ARM devices

859
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,460
in most cases.

860
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,280
And so, as things transition to ARM, by default, you generally can't add your own keys.

861
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,600
If you can add your own keys, you potentially open yourself up to the vulnerability of malware

862
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,240
being able to add your own keys.

863
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,560
You also can't remove the Microsoft keys without breaking the system, even if it's supported.

864
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,560
That's awful.

865
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,240
And if you think about this, something people don't realize is that Microsoft's third-party

866
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,600
and primary search are actually used to sign option ROMs and things for the hardware that's

867
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
on the system.

868
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,160
And so, for example, booting network Ethernet, the network Ethernet option ROM has to be

869
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,520
signed by Microsoft.

870
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:30,640
If you remove the Microsoft certificate, the Ethernet hardware fails to initialize.

871
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,860
And in servers, video option ROM has the same problem.

872
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,240
You know what it sounds like?

873
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,240
It sounds like macOS.

874
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,240
Exactly.

875
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,240
It is.

876
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,520
I mean, it's the same setup.

877
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:46,080
And generally, computers are moving in this direction because in the proprietary systems,

878
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,600
you don't have any other way of securing the platform.

879
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,000
So is this the path that we inevitably set ourselves on when we accepted systemd into

880
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
our lives?

881
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
No.

882
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,360
This was the path we set ourselves upon when we didn't have any stakeholders of the Linux

883
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,000
community involved in the UEFI process.

884
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yes.

885
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Right.

886
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Very much so.

887
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I completely agree.

888
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,440
I mean, it starts with simple things like UEFI mandates PE binaries.

889
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,160
That doesn't even make sense because PE is one of the more complex binary formats.

890
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,840
But it's the one that's used in that.

891
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,840
That's a Microsoft thing.

892
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,840
Yeah.

893
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,840
Right.

894
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:26,880
The second thing is we have the PE system, the UEFI system has specific requirements

895
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,840
and structures that essentially force a little endian.

896
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,480
Well, what about big endian architectures?

897
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,840
What about power?

898
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,840
What about systemz?

899
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
Why can't they use UEFI?

900
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:43,280
Well, because UEFI is little endian because it was written for Itanium and x86 originally.

901
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,040
All other architectures support UEFI need to be a little endian.

902
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,760
But those also are all the same architectures that only Windows supports because Windows

903
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,920
doesn't support any big endian architectures anymore.

904
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,840
And other choices are based on the people that are actually involved in the project.

905
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,720
Red Hat and SUSE and all these other companies, they got involved in the UEFI stuff way too

906
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,720
late.

907
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,280
It was just Apple and Intel and a couple of others up front, and HP and a few others up

908
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,280
front initially.

909
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,360
And of course, what they chose were the ones that they were working with.

910
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,560
And because of that, we're stuck with this long legacy of choices that make it harder

911
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:22,120
for the Linux side to actually really be part of this story.

912
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,680
There's no innovation in the boot space from the Linux side because there can't be.

913
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,000
You know what I like about you when you visit Neil is you always drop the member berries.

914
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,880
You know, like, oh, yeah, I'd forgotten about that whole way the UEFI thing went down.

915
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,960
It really did start with Apple and Intel and they brought a few others in.

916
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,040
The Linux folks basically didn't get involved until everything was set.

917
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,640
The Linux world didn't start getting involved until I think it was like 2008, 2009.

918
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:52,560
That was when Matthew Garrett started working on this because Microsoft with Windows 8 started

919
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:57,560
having PC makers do secure boot and then people flipped out over it because like initially

920
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,040
you couldn't boot Linux systems.

921
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,520
By the way, almost 15 years later, we are now getting laptops where by default you can't

922
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,440
boot Linux on them because the UEFI third party certificate is now turned off or not

923
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,400
installed by default on quote unquote secured core, which are all systems that are I think

924
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,680
12th gen Intel and Ryzen fifth generation and newer.

925
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,360
So like that's a that's a big deal, right?

926
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,000
Like you're going to have your fourth generation Ryzen.

927
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,360
I forget what the Ryzen 5000 series, whatever.

928
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,000
Anyway, point is that's happening and like I actually had to help somebody just last

929
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,320
week saying I'm trying to get Fedora to boot on this laptop.

930
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,320
It's like, hold up, you have a yoga, don't you?

931
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:44,160
All right, go into the bootloader, turn on the UEFI third party certificate because that

932
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,040
was that's not on and that's why it doesn't boot.

933
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,840
And that nobody knows that.

934
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,760
Nobody knows that that's a thing.

935
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,160
And it basically invalidates the whole reason we went through all this crap to do secure

936
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,880
boot support in the first place.

937
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,760
But we can't not do it because if because we're moving Microsoft certificates, by the

938
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,680
way, NIST actually recommends that you remove the Microsoft certs when you're securing something

939
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,760
for high security environments.

940
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,400
But in order to do that, you have to do all kinds of other crazy things to make sure that

941
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,640
the system still boots afterwards.

942
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,080
But like in order to do proper security with secure boot, you have to remove the Microsoft

943
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,440
trust and put your own.

944
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:26,960
But in most computers, especially consumer ones, doing so bricks them permanently.

945
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,720
Linode.com slash unplugged.

946
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,880
Go there to get a hundred dollars and 60 day credit on a new account.

947
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,520
And it's just a great way to support the show while you're really trying out the Linode

948
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,520
platform.

949
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,440
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting with really the best support in the business because

950
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,640
Linode is architected differently.

951
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,960
They're built around a great product that had to do well in the marketplace and they

952
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,740
had to actually compete for their customers by making something they'd want to use.

953
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:57,400
And so in that, they have created a fantastic support department that's available 365.

954
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,480
First person you contact is the person who resolves it.

955
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,040
They don't have to like do that silly game of escalation, but let's be real.

956
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,080
On the big hyperscaler platforms, the support situation is obtuse.

957
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,080
It's a nightmare.

958
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,080
It's opaque.

959
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,080
It's awful.

960
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,840
And it always starts with a chat bot.

961
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,540
So Linode is a little differently because their product had to be great.

962
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,020
So the systems are fast.

963
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,820
The dashboard is fantastic.

964
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,880
The API is clear and easy to implement.

965
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,280
The infrastructure management tools or whatever you want to use, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible,

966
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,960
yeah, it all works.

967
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,280
And they managed to do it while they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers that

968
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,180
just want to lock into their crazy platform that they like to pretend they invented.

969
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,480
But on top of that, the performance is just fantastic.

970
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,660
It's so good.

971
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,920
I've had an opportunity to try out their GPU rigs.

972
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:47,440
I've had an opportunity to try out their dedicated CPU systems, their monster systems.

973
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,560
I've got a matrix box with like 48 CPU cores and something like 96 or 128 gigs of RAM.

974
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,520
It's in the category of like the number so high that it just doesn't really even make

975
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,920
sense anymore.

976
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,840
And the performance is insane.

977
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,080
And we started that at a tiny little system, a tiny little two-core box with eight gigs

978
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:11,880
of RAM or something like that that we just scaled up over time as our matrix user base

979
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,880
needed it.

980
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,600
I couldn't have done that with a physical box.

981
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:18,120
I may have, if I built something, I may have started with something a little more powerful

982
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,140
than two cores and eight gigs of RAM.

983
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:25,200
But within a few months, I have way, way, way outstripped what I would have been able

984
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,680
to afford to build.

985
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,760
And I just did it incrementally as our user demand required it.

986
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,000
It was really simple to use their tools to do that.

987
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,640
Plus, we have backups and snapshots.

988
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,800
They got 11 data centers for you to choose from.

989
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,720
They're bringing on a whole bunch more next year.

990
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,200
So go build something.

991
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,200
Go learn about something.

992
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,400
It's a great way to try out an open source project on incredibly fast hardware.

993
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,300
Go try it for yourself with that $100.

994
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,300
Really kick the tires.

995
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:53,760
lino.com slash unplugs, where you go, supports the show and you get that $100, lino.com slash

996
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,760
unplugged.

997
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,720
We got some emails into the show this week.

998
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,720
Matthew wrote in.

999
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,720
He loves NixOS.

1000
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:08,280
He says, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, NixOS, oh my God, oh my God, oh

1001
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,280
my God, oh my God.

1002
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,200
I just wanted to shoot you an email to thank you for NixOS.

1003
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,200
I finally pulled the pin out and just wow, just wow.

1004
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,040
I never have to fully configure the system again.

1005
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,680
I believe the NixOS challenge was a screenshot of HTOP.

1006
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,160
Well, here's my screenshot from inside Terminator.

1007
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,160
Oh, that's great.

1008
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,800
Also, I noticed the host name.

1009
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,000
I'm loving that host name.

1010
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Picard at Enterprise.

1011
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,280
Call yourself Captain Picard.

1012
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,720
That's so funny.

1013
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,720
That's so funny.

1014
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,040
I know, I know, I know.

1015
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:45,240
Not everybody, Neil, loves NixOS, and that's why every week my personal struggle is not

1016
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,480
to make the episode about NixOS.

1017
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,520
That's my battle.

1018
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:53,800
That's my burden, and I take that, and I try not to make every episode about NixOS, but

1019
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,080
behind the scenes, I'm still freaking out.

1020
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:03,960
Lowpalm wrote in, and he says, I have a suggestion for the cupboard display in JOOPS.

1021
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:10,880
So I want to install like a tablet or a touch screen in my cupboard, and because this particular

1022
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,880
cupboard that I want to install actually has an outlet in the back of it, and I want to

1023
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:19,380
have the JOOPS home assistant dashboard kind of embedded into this cupboard.

1024
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,720
So they write, to make it an appliance, you should use the NURVS project.

1025
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,820
A kiosk NURVS system for the Raspberry Pi or 3 is available.

1026
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:32,040
You can configure the kiosk system to go to a URL in a web view on boot.

1027
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,880
NURVS is a project for creating a Linux-based firmware that boots, oh, cool, Elixir in Erlang.

1028
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,560
It's in a little VM.

1029
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,440
It's made for embedded stuff, and I suppose if I was an Elixir guy, I'd probably love

1030
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,440
that.

1031
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,520
He says, but you can ignore the Elixir stuff and just have it display the home assistant

1032
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,560
dashboard.

1033
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,580
Now you're talking my language.

1034
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,580
That's great, Lowpalm.

1035
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,800
I currently use WallPanel, I think it is, on Android tablets.

1036
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,840
I might have that name wrong.

1037
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:01,320
I think it's WallPanel though, and that's also just basically a kiosk web browser, and

1038
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:06,600
I plug that in to the home assistant dashboard URL, and because I'm a fancy boy, I have different

1039
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,240
dashboards for like different things.

1040
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,560
Like I have a heating dashboard, and I have a lighting dashboard, and I have an electrical

1041
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:16,560
use dashboard, and I got like an admin dashboard, because, you know, dashboard for days is my

1042
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,560
thing.

1043
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,600
So different tablets point to different dashboards.

1044
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:25,680
So like heating and energy and lighting, and man, if that system doesn't work great, I

1045
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,200
don't know what does, but the problem is that Android tablets are crap.

1046
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:34,720
They're just terrible crap, and they just get junkier over time.

1047
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,000
And then to make matters worse, I'm buying the cheapest ones I can because I'm plugging

1048
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,200
these things in 24-7 and mounting them on the wall and just displaying a web page.

1049
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,460
I'm not like playing Angry Birds on the thing.

1050
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,520
You get where I'm going.

1051
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,440
We got some boosts into the show.

1052
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,960
True Grit's boosted in with a Trek Boost 17-01 SATS.

1053
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,600
I'm surprised you guys haven't noticed.

1054
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:01,800
The reason Wes is so good with the AI prompts is because Wes is an AI, akin to Data from

1055
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,800
Star Trek.

1056
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,800
Now, well, now, hold on.

1057
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,600
This is before we go on.

1058
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,160
If that was true, True Grit's, then why isn't Wes here today?

1059
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,200
Do artificial life forms get sick?

1060
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,220
I'd say you could argue either way.

1061
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:19,840
If it's later Star Trek, Data is always the one that isn't affected by like the gas that

1062
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,800
gets released on the ship or the alien influence.

1063
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,680
But if it's season one, episode two, and everybody's getting drunk and you know what happened when

1064
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,640
Data and Tasha got drunk, well, then if you prick him, does he not bleed?

1065
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,840
So I don't have an answer for you.

1066
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:38,020
But Josh the Techie boosted in with 500 SATS and again, it's not the amount anymore.

1067
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:41,300
It's just the boost message, but I want to get to that more.

1068
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:45,080
But 500 SATS from Josh Techie, first time booster here from Florida.

1069
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,520
I try to listen to the show each week in between calls and meetings at work.

1070
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,520
Thanks, Josh.

1071
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,240
I don't know how you guys just kind of process and consume the show.

1072
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,760
I'm always curious.

1073
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,200
Just like to picture that.

1074
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,840
The boost for me, personally, SATS aside, because there is an amount, whatever it is,

1075
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,840
you know, it could be dollars.

1076
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,840
It could be dog coins.

1077
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,840
Well, not really.

1078
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,840
Don't send me your dog coins.

1079
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,840
I don't know.

1080
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,840
There's something real.

1081
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,840
It's like it's a name.

1082
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,400
It's the episode you're listening to and it's a message and there's a value attached to

1083
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,400
it.

1084
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,780
It's more, it's just more visceral.

1085
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,760
And so that's why I love them.

1086
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,360
It doesn't have to be some incredible message.

1087
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,760
She goes on to say, thanks to the show.

1088
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,880
I've gotten back in the Linux community and really enjoyed watching the evolution of links

1089
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,880
on the desktop.

1090
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,880
Yeah.

1091
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,880
That's quite the show, isn't it?

1092
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,880
Keep up the great work.

1093
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,160
Look forward to listening to the next episode.

1094
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,160
P.S.

1095
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,800
I hope you put NixOS with BetterFest on the new Office Thalia.

1096
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,800
Yeah.

1097
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,080
I haven't ordered it yet.

1098
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,320
I'm just been too busy, but I'm going to.

1099
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:43,480
And I have been reliably informed and Intel Arc GPU is inbound, so I may have an update

1100
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:45,120
on that next week.

1101
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:50,720
Trolley the Hellhound boosted it with 7,000 SATs.

1102
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:55,200
This is my first boost ever here to congratulate you all on the new website.

1103
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,680
Hope you have better luck on your road trips in the future and the tech and for podcasting

1104
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,680
2.0.

1105
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,960
A podcast I worked on and got caught up on was in iHeart Media Blitz.

1106
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,240
Oh, it was about the show Firefly.

1107
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,040
It didn't last too long after that, but I wanted to throw a curveball question to see

1108
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,840
if you guys know of a program I can try.

1109
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:16,680
What is a good open source alternative to Kit Cineris, which I think is a screenwriting

1110
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,680
app?

1111
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,200
The problem is the program I have doesn't resize well.

1112
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
The budget is zero.

1113
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,280
So if you know out there of an open source screenwriting app, please put the name of

1114
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,200
it in the matrix chat or boost it in out there.

1115
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,800
And then they did follow up with an additional 777 SATs.

1116
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:35,160
So the slot machine boost is for 7,777 SATs, right?

1117
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,160
You get it.

1118
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,360
It's like 777s on a slot machine.

1119
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,440
Load it up with 777 SATs to just round it all out.

1120
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,360
If you want smart tech without Linus Tech Tips and the hype, you could listen to Linux

1121
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,360
Unplugged.

1122
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,360
Wow.

1123
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,360
I didn't say it.

1124
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,360
I didn't say it.

1125
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,600
We got a row of ducks from BHH32.

1126
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,240
This old duck still got it.

1127
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,440
I want to see how much the Steam Deck is a success story for our community.

1128
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,640
I finally got mine last month and it's going to be my go-to gaming device now.

1129
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,560
I'm choosing this over my PS5.

1130
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,960
The icing on the cake.

1131
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,440
Is that on release day, Gotham Knights ran flawlessly.

1132
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,480
This was unheard of in the past and I believe it's still taking Linux to new heights.

1133
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:20,360
I'm even thinking of selling my console and going back to strictly PC gaming because of

1134
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,040
it.

1135
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:27,600
The Stream Deck got my oldest definitely more interested in PC gaming again.

1136
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,760
And he's thinking about things now in terms of if I get it on Steam, then I can play it

1137
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,760
on my laptop.

1138
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,440
I can play it on dad's Steam Deck.

1139
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,640
I can install it on my future computers, but if I'm playing on the iPad, I can only do

1140
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:40,640
it on Apple's devices.

1141
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,680
If I play on the Nintendo, so it's got him thinking about things in a different way,

1142
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,520
which I think is really positive.

1143
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:50,560
And I think it also kind of restored his faith in Linux gaming a little bit because he was

1144
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:55,440
fading because some Geometry Dash game was only available for Windows or Android or something

1145
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,440
like that.

1146
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,360
So his faith was fading and the Deck came along and I think it kind of turned things

1147
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,360
around for him.

1148
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:07,440
Kelz09 boosted in with 5,000 sats, B-O-O-S-T, hello JB, I've been holding on to some sats

1149
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,260
until I had something thought provoking to say.

1150
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,260
That's not happening.

1151
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:12,760
So just take my sats already.

1152
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,760
You guys do such great work.

1153
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,720
I'm usually always up to date on the latest LUP coder and LAN.

1154
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,000
Throw a little self hosted in there Kelz.

1155
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Well thank you.

1156
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,120
And then Mississippi Mayhem came in, which let's be honest, that would have, that would

1157
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,120
be a great, that would be also a really great boost.

1158
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,120
I should have a Missy.

1159
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:34,540
If anybody wants to clip me a little Mississippi Mayhem boost, go ahead, but 300 sats to say.

1160
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:37,600
Just a quick peep to let you guys know I'm still alive.

1161
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,320
Having some issues that are making it difficult, although I do want to be involved as a member

1162
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,380
of the community and boost into the show.

1163
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,560
Maybe next time I'll have something worth reading on air.

1164
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,280
All right, stop the show.

1165
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,160
I got something I got to say to you guys.

1166
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,160
I feel like I've set the expectations too high.

1167
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,000
Just hearing from you and knowing you're out there is really a lot.

1168
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,560
That's 80, 90%.

1169
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:02,760
A great message gets it on air, but hearing from you, knowing you're out there, knowing

1170
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,480
you're listening, seeing the boost is sort of like a yes, keep going.

1171
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,840
You did a great job.

1172
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:12,120
That kind of stuff, that is super invaluable to us as a team motivator.

1173
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,720
So don't wait if you have something.

1174
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,640
Don't wait for some great inspiration.

1175
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,140
Just say hi and let us know you're listening.

1176
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,920
And a special thank you because not all the boosts do make it in.

1177
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,320
A couple of more, but there's more that gets sent in.

1178
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,000
We are just selecting just several to read on air.

1179
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,200
We got 100 sats from the Bosch, the Boosh.

1180
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:31,200
Hopefully would be willing to listen to an AI generated version of our podcast voices.

1181
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,000
If you don't know what he's referring to, check out last week's episode.

1182
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,760
We also got a 555 sats from Nomadic Coder 5.

1183
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,960
I'll be listening for the next few weeks to hear your take on the Odroid H3 experience

1184
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,920
to get an idea if I should buy one.

1185
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,920
Good Nomadic Coder.

1186
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,520
I hope that's value we can offer to you.

1187
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:47,520
I will update you.

1188
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,000
I have a couple of more components arriving.

1189
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,220
I have the Odroid H3, which is a little tiny.

1190
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:57,640
They call it a Raspberry Pi killer, but I call it a Raspberry Pi alternative.

1191
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,600
It's obviously x86.

1192
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:05,920
It's got two SATA ports, it's got an NVME slot and two RAM slots.

1193
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,800
So just like, and two gigabit, 2.5 gigabit NICs actually.

1194
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,520
So just like, it's just a huge upgrade over the Pi 4.

1195
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:18,520
And I'm waiting for a SATA cable and an eSATA power cable or whatever they call them.

1196
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,880
You know, the ones that have the weird adapters.

1197
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,520
I'm waiting for that still, but once that arrives, I am building my box.

1198
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,560
20,000 SATs came from Mitch, the lead developer over at Podverse.fm.

1199
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:33,400
This is sending Bitcoin boosts to your favorite podcasts with Podverse and Albie couldn't

1200
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,400
be easier.

1201
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,560
And it's all open source.

1202
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,560
Go podcasting.

1203
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,720
Thank you, Mitch.

1204
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,220
Podcasting 2.0 apps are coming along at a remarkable pace.

1205
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:45,180
And Podverse is one of many that are getting better every single week.

1206
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:49,860
If you'd like to boost to the show, support new features, support an open podcasting ecosystem

1207
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,160
go to newpodcastapps.com.

1208
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,160
Try one out.

1209
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:56,360
Podverse is the one we mentioned a lot because it's GPL.

1210
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,360
It's fully open source.

1211
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,120
It's what we've embedded on our website.

1212
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,880
People love Fountain FM, you hear it get mentioned all the time because you can earn SATs while

1213
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,880
you listen.

1214
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,080
Of course, there's Boost CLI if you're a Ninja and all of that.

1215
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:12,360
So go over to newpodcastapps.com and grab one and then say, hey.

1216
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,760
Two picks this week.

1217
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,160
One is an honorable mention for Brent.

1218
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,440
He submitted it even though he couldn't be here this week.

1219
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,920
And one is going around the internet like crazy.

1220
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,120
So I really, I can't take credit.

1221
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,160
I did technically flag it, but you probably have already heard of it.

1222
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:31,600
If you've been lurking on the internet in the last week, it's called VHS.

1223
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,560
I got my attention.

1224
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:40,200
It's actually, it's like a GIF recorder for your terminal or a GIF, your choice.

1225
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,740
So you can do something on the terminal.

1226
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:45,480
You know, maybe you're a neo-fetch, maybe you got a bug.

1227
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,120
You're trying to get the, you know, you got the output of the air, something like that

1228
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:52,200
to build fails, whatever you're trying to capture, maybe logs on your command line.

1229
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:56,720
And you want to make a GIF GIF that you could like toss into a chat.

1230
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,000
Well, this is the tool that just makes it happen in seconds.

1231
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,280
You just do like the command and then you add a, so like, say you're going to open up

1232
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,280
a document.

1233
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:13,720
So you do nano demo.tape and then when you're all done, you get the output of that.

1234
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,360
You can give it the size, the width you want.

1235
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,240
You can add some dramatic effect, like having it type it all out slowly.

1236
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:26,280
Kind of like, you know, hunt for red October, text promptings now.

1237
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,960
That's called VHS.

1238
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,120
You've probably seen this.

1239
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,120
If you haven't, you're welcome.

1240
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:37,600
But the one that like everybody's talking about, even our chat room was talking about

1241
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,480
it before we got started is ffmpeg.guide.

1242
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,520
It is finally here.

1243
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:52,880
Hold the perfect ffmpeg command or filter with a graph GUI interface.

1244
01:05:52,880 --> 01:06:00,240
It's so gorgeous.

1245
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:05,240
You have boxes with lines that connect to other boxes where you set your filter parameters.

1246
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,080
The thing connect to other boxes.

1247
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:11,760
It's a graph style, kind of a mind map to give you a visual.

1248
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,160
It's a bit of a mind map.

1249
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,520
Then you put it all together and out comes the perfect ffmpeg command and they got a

1250
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,720
beautiful live demo on their website.

1251
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:26,320
Simple GUI to create complex ffmpeg filter graphs quickly and correctly without having

1252
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,760
to mess with cumbersome filter syntax.

1253
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,180
So you know, my old school approach was I go on like stack exchange or Reddit or something

1254
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:39,160
and just find people's like really long, super long commands, copy it and then try to like

1255
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,300
reverse engineer what that command was doing.

1256
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:46,640
No longer, no longer shall you be subject to that ffmpeg.guide.

1257
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:54,360
Of course, we'll have a link to that in the show notes at linuxunplug.com slash 482.

1258
01:06:54,360 --> 01:07:01,660
And I can't help but notice we're getting close to 486, getting real close.

1259
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:06,520
I'm feeling like we should do a retro episode from 486, especially with the hot talk about

1260
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,380
the 486 architecture getting worked out of the Linux kernel.

1261
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:14,120
If you didn't know about that, you missed linuxactionnews, linuxactionnews.com, there's

1262
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,920
a real short and tight one this week.

1263
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,120
That's kind of our deal with LAN.

1264
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,740
We're not going to waste your time.

1265
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:23,120
We're not going to fill it with stuff that you don't need to know about.

1266
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,960
And you know that Wes Payne, when he's not puking in toilets, he's a hell of a news analyst.

1267
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,960
Let me tell you, you'd be surprised.

1268
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,960
A bit of a news hound.

1269
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,960
See you next week.

1270
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:30,960
Same bad time.

1271
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:31,960
Same bad station.

1272
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:32,960
All right.

1273
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,160
I would love to have you join us.

1274
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,440
We do the show live on Sundays.

1275
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,060
You do it at noon Pacific, 3pm Eastern over Jupiter.tube.

1276
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,920
This week, big round of applause to our mumble room.

1277
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,920
Thank you everybody in there.

1278
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,320
Really helped round out the show this week and you could do that too if you joined us

1279
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,080
live at Jupiter.tube.

1280
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:52,760
And details for our mumble room, which is going 24-7, that's at jupiterbroadcasting.com

1281
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,760
slash mumble.

1282
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,760
All right.

1283
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,760
You get in the theme like slash matrix.

1284
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,760
Made it real easy.

1285
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:59,640
Made it real easy for you.

1286
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,120
Just made it nice, nice and simple.

1287
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:03,660
Let's go check it out and join us live sometime.

1288
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,080
But if you don't want to, no problem.

1289
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,640
We have RSS feeds for you to get the show any way you want, anytime you want.

1290
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,280
Just thanks so much for joining us and I'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1291
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:49,880
All right.

1292
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,120
Now I know we had a couple of more things to touch on.

1293
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:58,160
That topic, we could have talked about the Secure Boot stuff forever, but Jeff, you had

1294
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,560
a comment that maybe there's a communications thing that could be improved here that would

1295
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:02,960
at least help end users.

1296
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,540
I consider the end user to probably be the distro maker, right?

1297
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:13,760
So if there would be a little bit better communication, kind of going back to that whole GNOME topic,

1298
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:19,600
maybe what you brought up, fixing older bugs and stuff like that would be better.

1299
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,600
It might happen more often.

1300
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,960
I mean, we see lack of communication in other industries all the time and these engineers

1301
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,920
come up with these great big grandiose ideas that are supposed to make everybody's life

1302
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,840
better, but nobody speaks to the person that's actually using these products, right?

1303
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:37,160
So it ends up making things worse in the long run and I just kind of wonder if that, you

1304
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,720
know, the same idea, the same thing's happening here.

1305
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,720
Right.

1306
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,200
I actually would love to have anyone out there in the world.

1307
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,960
This show reaches far and wide across the world of Linux users.

1308
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,100
Lots of you are out there in the industry.

1309
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:56,320
Does anybody want this sort of unified kernel that gets loaded into UEFI that's signed,

1310
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,080
it's full Secure Boot from top to bottom?

1311
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,560
Do you want that?

1312
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,560
And no judgment.

1313
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:07,560
I'm just curious, is there actual user demand, like maybe, you know, Lenard's working at

1314
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,480
Microsoft and Microsoft's hearing from, I don't know, maybe it's government contractors

1315
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:15,640
or maybe it's defense people, then they have a certain minimum bar of security and they're

1316
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,480
pushing back and saying it's just not good enough.

1317
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,080
And so, you know, the team at Microsoft has been tasked with coming up with a solution

1318
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,920
and Lenard's on it.

1319
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:27,600
Or maybe it's a problem looking for a solution.

1320
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,540
I really would love to know if you're listening out there and you're like, no guys, trust

1321
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:32,540
me in our industry.

1322
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,540
We need this.

1323
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:34,540
It's a problem.

1324
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:35,540
Let me know.

1325
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,800
Send a boost or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact or ping me on matrix.

1326
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,000
Maybe Microsoft can start a discourse forum.

1327
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,800
And then just to really put things over the top, and you tech boosted live while we were

1328
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,780
streaming another 300,000 sats, keep that change you filthy animal.

1329
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,760
Let's push the total to 500,000 sats for today's show.

1330
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,360
This boost is for some extra support for Brent and Wes.

1331
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:02,560
Brent, I hope everything's OK with the family and Wes, I hope you feel better soon.

1332
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,580
And Chris, keep the great shows coming.

1333
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:06,280
And you tech, thank you so much.

1334
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,680
Truly our baller booster this week.

1335
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,680
Much, much appreciation.

1336
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:28,840
Hey, Rich Lobster.
