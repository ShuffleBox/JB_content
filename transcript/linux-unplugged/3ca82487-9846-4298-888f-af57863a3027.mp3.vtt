WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
Okay, alright, so I was gonna ask if you guys, before we get started, before we get into

00:04.640 --> 00:10.800
all the serious Linux discussion, all Linux content all the time, did you see IT, cards

00:10.800 --> 00:13.420
against IT, that's what it's called, cards against IT, I'm such a spaz.

00:13.420 --> 00:17.000
Cards against IT, you're familiar with cards against humanity, so like here's the white

00:17.000 --> 00:23.560
cards rotating the backup, a PCAP, RM-RF, my rooted phone, and then you go down to of

00:23.560 --> 00:31.900
course the actual phrases, the new IT director has a sick tattoo of blank, the last consultant

00:31.900 --> 00:36.640
was fired over blank, forgetting the blank in the data center is a firing offense, nothing

00:36.640 --> 00:42.320
transfers data faster than blank, so it's, yeah, blank is a layer 8 of the OSI networking

00:42.320 --> 00:47.100
model, we're going to use blank instead of updating to IPv6, blank is the last stage

00:47.100 --> 00:50.880
of our blank rollout, these are good, if you've been in the industry for a while, these are

00:50.880 --> 00:54.440
all pretty good, so I recommend if you want to blow off a little steam, you go print this

00:54.440 --> 00:59.560
out, we'll have the PDF and the show notes, it's just the same kind of like spirit of

00:59.560 --> 01:03.820
cards against humanity, but it's cards against IT.

01:03.820 --> 01:20.160
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 109 for September 8th, 2015.

01:20.160 --> 01:25.560
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that really, really needs a shower.

01:25.560 --> 01:26.560
My name is Chris.

01:26.560 --> 01:27.560
My name is Wes.

01:27.560 --> 01:34.960
Hey Wes, so I'm sorry if I stink a little bit, I've taken showers recently, but not

01:34.960 --> 01:35.960
like today.

01:35.960 --> 01:36.960
I'm sorry.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.400
I'm going to sit as far away as possible over here.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.560
Yeah, that's cool, you can scoot the mic away, it's alright, actually, I'll tell you more

01:42.560 --> 01:46.120
about that in a little bit, but we have a really great show coming up, some feedback

01:46.120 --> 01:49.080
we've got to start with from the community that touches on a couple of topics we've been

01:49.080 --> 01:53.320
following for a couple of weeks, and then I want to jump into this convergence demo of

01:53.320 --> 01:59.760
some pretty performance-demanding applications running under Exmere, yeah, desktop open GPL

01:59.760 --> 02:01.720
applications running under Mere.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
Whoa.

02:02.720 --> 02:06.640
Yes, yes, Exmere being pushed a limit, we're going to talk about that, and then also, did

02:06.640 --> 02:11.700
you see this headline, Wes, how Debian is trying to shut down the CIA and make software

02:11.700 --> 02:12.920
trustworthy again?

02:12.920 --> 02:13.920
I sure did.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.920
That's a hell of a title.

02:14.920 --> 02:16.480
It sure is, dramatic, but important work.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.680
Yeah, we're going to talk about what that actually is, why the Debian project wants

02:19.680 --> 02:25.240
reproducible builds, see if I can say it, if I can reproduce the words, and why other

02:25.240 --> 02:28.720
projects are probably going to be picking that up, including FreeBSD, NetBSD, and maybe

02:28.720 --> 02:32.840
some other Linuxes, we'll be talking about that in just a little bit, and then, towards

02:32.840 --> 02:39.120
the end of the show, I'm going to do my darnedest to convert Wes back to Gnome, because I'm

02:39.120 --> 02:43.520
going to tell him what is so badass about Gnome 3.18 that's not even in the release

02:43.520 --> 02:44.520
notes.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.520
Oh, no.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.840
And we might just get you to switch to Gnome by the end of this episode, Wes.

02:48.840 --> 02:49.840
I'll be the judge.

02:49.840 --> 02:50.840
Yeah, right.

02:50.840 --> 02:51.840
Okay.

02:51.840 --> 02:56.580
So, why don't we get into a little bit of business, some follow-up and some show-specific

02:56.580 --> 02:59.360
stuff before we launch into the rest of the episode.

02:59.360 --> 03:03.680
The first thing I want to do right here at the top of the show is give a plug to an old

03:03.680 --> 03:07.900
friend of the show, Mr. Matt Hartley, for launching Freedom Penguin, which you can find

03:07.900 --> 03:11.840
at freedompenguin.com, and one of the cool things he's doing is he's brought on some

03:11.840 --> 03:14.600
friends, other friends of the show.

03:14.600 --> 03:18.600
You guys are familiar with Albert Westra, Odyssey Westra, who joins us frequently, and

03:18.600 --> 03:20.280
of course you're also familiar with Jed.

03:20.280 --> 03:25.680
He contributes a lot via email and subreddits and our online community aspects.

03:25.680 --> 03:31.320
Now there are, and also Joe Collins is writing over there, now working with Matt on Freedom

03:31.320 --> 03:36.760
Penguin, freedompenguin.com, so that was Matt's project that he was working on for a while,

03:36.760 --> 03:40.920
and it's been in the works since he stepped down from Linux Unplugged, and now it is here

03:40.920 --> 03:44.460
and kicking, and you can check it out at freedompenguin.com.

03:44.460 --> 03:45.460
Very exciting.

03:45.460 --> 03:46.460
Yeah.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.460
Nice to see some new stuff from Matt.

03:47.460 --> 03:50.240
I bet if you're a solid contributor, too, I bet you he's looking for contributors.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.240
I would guess.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.320
I would guess.

03:52.320 --> 03:58.040
So along that same bit of line of thinking, why don't we also say hello to somebody special.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.040
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.900
No, not Mr. Leo Leport, our new co-host on the show officially, Mr. Wes.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.500
Wes, remind me of your last name.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.560
My last name is Payne, P-A-Y-N-E, Chris.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.320
Oh yeah, look at that right there on my screen, right there.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.320
It's right there on my screen.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.320
You'd think I'd know that.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.320
It's just right there.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.320
I like that.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.160
When I heard Payne, I thought, well, that's a pretty good last name.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.160
Well, thank you.

04:18.160 --> 04:23.080
Now, I would go just for your on-air persona, P-A-I-N, you know, just go for it.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.080
I mean, just own it.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.080
Pick it up a level.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.080
Yeah, really, because it's a DJ name.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.440
You've got to have a DJ name.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.960
So Wes is going to be joining Linux Unplugged officially as the co-host going forward, which

04:30.960 --> 04:35.040
is great because when I'm on the road trip, Wes will be here in studio and he'll have

04:35.040 --> 04:36.700
local audio and hopefully I'll have local audio.

04:36.700 --> 04:39.920
Show should still sound great even when I'm on the road, but it'll be nice having somebody

04:39.920 --> 04:43.280
here that can physically push the record button and make sure we get the show out and things

04:43.280 --> 04:44.280
like that.

04:44.280 --> 04:49.160
Yeah, we'll hopefully have an editor coming on, another editor, to help put it all together

04:49.160 --> 04:50.160
when we're on the road.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.240
But yeah, so Wes, I'm super glad to have you here and congratulations to Matt for launching

04:53.240 --> 04:55.940
Freedom Penguin and we have a heck of a show to get into.

04:55.940 --> 04:59.240
So before we go any further, why don't we bring in the next critical piece of the show.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.320
That's our mumble room.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.120
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.120
Hello.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.120
Hello.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.120
Hello.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.120
Hello.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.120
Hey, guys.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.120
A great showing.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.120
Whoa, whoa.

05:09.120 --> 05:14.120
All right, so I wanted to know right off the top, are you guys all ready for a system

05:14.120 --> 05:15.120
D killer?

05:15.120 --> 05:16.240
We have a brand new one, ladies and gentlemen.

05:16.240 --> 05:19.080
I want to bring it into the show before we go any further right here.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.080
It's super important.

05:20.080 --> 05:24.440
I present to you, and Wes, you help me with the official pronunciation because otherwise

05:24.440 --> 05:27.200
I'm going to say System 16?

05:27.200 --> 05:28.260
I guess so.

05:28.260 --> 05:29.740
System X V1?

05:29.740 --> 05:30.740
What do you call this one?

05:30.740 --> 05:31.740
It's a V?

05:31.740 --> 05:32.740
Yeah, yeah.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.760
So System 16 is a modern take on service management.

05:34.760 --> 05:38.440
It aims to incorporate useful functionality while maintaining a modular design in the

05:38.440 --> 05:39.680
Unix tradition.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.520
System 16 uses KBuild as used by VirtualBox.

05:42.520 --> 05:47.680
There are minimal dependencies you need, like a proc CPS and a lib KQ, I'm sorry, in the

05:47.680 --> 05:51.400
development formats, and then you just install your distros package for KBuild, and you can

05:51.400 --> 05:53.620
run KMK, and you are good to go.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.760
It's free software.

05:54.760 --> 05:59.600
It's licensed under GPL3, and it's here to replace System D. And you know what?

05:59.600 --> 06:02.840
I'll tell you one thing that's got way better than System D, that logo.

06:02.840 --> 06:03.840
Yeah.

06:03.840 --> 06:04.840
System D don't got that.

06:04.840 --> 06:05.840
No.

06:05.840 --> 06:06.840
Colorful, bright.

06:06.840 --> 06:07.840
I love it.

06:07.840 --> 06:08.840
Does it have any example configuration files?

06:08.840 --> 06:09.840
Yeah.

06:09.840 --> 06:16.200
You can play on System 5, and obviously, but it's pretty, it's just the System D alternatives,

06:16.200 --> 06:17.200
they never end.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.520
I would, I dare someone, I challenge someone in the Mumble Room to run this.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.520
Anybody want to take it?

06:22.520 --> 06:23.520
Anybody want to try it?

06:23.520 --> 06:26.000
Like, got a throwaway rig you could try this on?

06:26.000 --> 06:34.160
Well, given the only result I find on Google for this is a 4chan thread, no, probably not.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.160
Damn.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.160
You got me.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.160
Okay.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.160
All right.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.160
Very good, very good.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.000
Let's move on to the feedback then.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.440
So actually, can I deviate, Wes, you know, can I get Wes?

06:45.440 --> 06:51.480
So Wes got here a little early today, and so we went out to lunch, and Wes has had to

06:51.480 --> 06:56.040
have already heard, unfortunately, quite a bit of this, but I want to share my weekend

06:56.040 --> 06:57.620
just really quickly with you guys.

06:57.620 --> 07:04.420
So Friday, right after the Linux Action Show wrapped up, I took the trailer out camping,

07:04.420 --> 07:06.000
and I went boondocking, quote unquote.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Boondocking?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.800
Boondocking is when you're dry camping, you're off the grid.

07:09.800 --> 07:16.940
So all I had was my Dell XPS 13 with me, and I had my S6 with me, and that was pretty solid

07:16.940 --> 07:17.940
for two nights.

07:17.940 --> 07:22.600
I lived off the camper's batteries, lived off the tanks, the propane, the water tanks,

07:22.600 --> 07:28.800
and I was able to get data connectivity using my XPS just tethered to, or actually hotspot,

07:28.800 --> 07:29.800
to the S6.

07:29.800 --> 07:30.880
It worked okay.

07:30.880 --> 07:35.840
But I wanted to live like a king, and my trailer came as part of the whole deal I got.

07:35.840 --> 07:40.160
I inherited a Thousand Trails membership, which I didn't really know anything about that,

07:40.160 --> 07:42.960
but it turns out it's like a campsite you can go take advantage of without having to

07:42.960 --> 07:44.000
pay anything.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.640
So for the last couple of nights, I've been hooked up on the beach with water, and sewer,

07:51.640 --> 07:52.640
and power.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.640
Look at that spot.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.640
It's beautiful.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.280
Yeah, it's a very quaint town called La Conner in Washington that I've been living out in

07:58.280 --> 07:59.560
the trailer, just getting it ready.

07:59.560 --> 08:03.360
And the whole idea is wrap my head around what it's like, because I have to live in

08:03.360 --> 08:06.920
this thing for 17 days, but the thing is, I don't just have to live in this thing.

08:06.920 --> 08:13.080
I have to work in this too, and I need to understand what I'm up against, and I can't

08:13.080 --> 08:17.160
be always learning absolutely everything while I'm also working and traveling, right?

08:17.160 --> 08:18.840
And wanting to also have some downtime.

08:18.840 --> 08:27.800
So I've been spending so far the entire weekend, since I got off the air, in the rig, out there,

08:27.800 --> 08:29.800
trying different things out, and I'm living like a king right now.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.060
I really love it.

08:31.060 --> 08:34.840
And so I'm trying to get my head around the road trip, really excited about how things

08:34.840 --> 08:35.840
are coming together.

08:35.840 --> 08:40.560
Zach the Penguin writes in, and he said, hi, I was listening to Unplugged today and I figured

08:40.560 --> 08:43.220
I'd make some suggestions to name the road show.

08:43.220 --> 08:48.060
How about Nation Migration, March of the Penguins, or Roll Your Own?

08:48.060 --> 08:49.060
Just a few ideas.

08:49.060 --> 08:50.060
Hope it helps.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.120
I don't know if any of those are resonating with me specifically, but I thought they were

08:52.120 --> 08:53.120
good.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.120
So I want to keep the ball rolling.

08:54.120 --> 08:57.000
If anybody has any names, we've got to name the road trip something.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.720
Like today, we're trying to figure out how we're going to do live tracking so you guys

08:59.720 --> 09:02.520
can see where I'm at so we can do meetups and you can suggest where I go and stuff like

09:02.520 --> 09:03.520
that.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.440
We're going to try to have live tracking during the trip, but we still don't have a name for

09:06.440 --> 09:07.440
it.

09:07.440 --> 09:08.440
Can't track until you have a name for it.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.440
Got to say what you're tracking.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.440
Very important.

09:10.440 --> 09:11.440
Very important.

09:11.440 --> 09:12.440
So I need ideas.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.440
I need ideas for the road show.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.440
The Penguinator?

09:14.440 --> 09:15.440
I don't know.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.440
I don't think so.

09:16.440 --> 09:17.440
Not punny enough, really.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.440
Yeah.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.440
I do like that.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.440
Now it does have a bird on it.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.440
It has a jaybird on it.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.440
Okay.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.440
Because it's a Jayco trailer.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.120
And so I was thinking something to do with the bird is in there.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.300
There's something there.

09:26.300 --> 09:29.920
But I was thinking that might be the name for the trailer, but the trip itself.

09:29.920 --> 09:30.920
The show has its own.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.320
Because there could be multiple road trips.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.940
So we need to be able to differentiate the different road shows.

09:34.940 --> 09:35.940
The journey to Jupiter.

09:35.940 --> 09:37.720
Well, because there could be future trips.

09:37.720 --> 09:38.720
So we got to...

09:38.720 --> 09:39.720
We got to start with the journey to Mars.

09:39.720 --> 09:40.720
No, that doesn't make sense.

09:40.720 --> 09:44.680
What happens when I run out of plan is when I stop taking road trips, we need a bigger

09:44.680 --> 09:45.680
solar system.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.480
The final destination, well, so for those of you who are not familiar, I'm going to

09:48.480 --> 09:49.480
Grand Forks, North Dakota.

09:49.480 --> 09:54.400
I'm going to do a show of Linux, an episode of Linux action show at Noah's house.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.640
Try to get a last Cribs episode in, something we committed to a while ago.

09:57.640 --> 10:02.800
And then meander my way, meander down to Utah and visit a few national parks down there

10:02.800 --> 10:05.320
and then make my way back up.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.040
Linux road show seems too obvious.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.160
Seems too obvious.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.160
Forking Jupiter.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.160
Jupiter ascending.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.160
Okay.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.160
I don't want to get copyright takedowns.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.160
All right.

10:13.160 --> 10:17.440
So then let's move on to the next email that is maybe a bit more appropriate for feedback.

10:17.440 --> 10:21.280
Sean writes in about Jose, who wrote in about his MacBook.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.520
He says, I've been running Linux on my MacBook Pro for about four years now.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.800
I just switched back to Fedora 22 from OpenSUSE.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.840
I've been rocking SUSE since 2007 and my MacBook has never worked better.

10:29.840 --> 10:34.080
Now he's on Fedora 22 and he says, he thinks it's because it has kernel 4.1.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.840
It's finally given me good hardware support for the keyboard backlight, the thermal fan

10:37.840 --> 10:42.160
controls, CPU scaling, and the battery life is better.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.320
One thing that I've done to extend battery life is buy the Fluendo codec suite and switch

10:45.320 --> 10:46.960
to Gstreamer based video player.

10:46.960 --> 10:51.400
The Fluendo codecs have much better video acceleration for video decoding, taking the

10:51.400 --> 10:52.400
load off of the CPU.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.320
Well, that's a good tip.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.400
Also, not all Gstreamer video players are created equal.

10:57.400 --> 11:02.360
Totem is still pretty heavy on the CPU, 24% when playing a 1080p HD 64 video, but streaming

11:02.360 --> 11:09.040
something lightweight like MPV sits around 12% and this is on a Sandy Bridge i5.

11:09.040 --> 11:13.160
I haven't tried Arch on here yet, but I imagine getting a similar setup wouldn't be too hard.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.960
I wish Jose the best of luck.

11:14.960 --> 11:15.960
Don't give up on Linux.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.720
Well, that's really cool.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.240
If 4.1 brought in thermal fan control, holy crap.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.240
That's a huge deal.

11:23.240 --> 11:26.040
I think MacBooks are definitely one of those areas where you get to see the exciting march

11:26.040 --> 11:28.000
of kernel progress in terms of hardware support.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.520
I actually surprised tech this long considering that Linus uses a MacBook Air.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.520
You know what I mean?

11:33.520 --> 11:34.520
Yeah.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.520
That is surprising.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.520
Yeah.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.520
Yeah.

11:37.520 --> 11:38.520
All right.

11:38.520 --> 11:39.520
So Mumbo, did you guys have any ideas for a roadshow name?

11:39.520 --> 11:40.520
Nobody?

11:40.520 --> 11:41.520
Come on.

11:41.520 --> 11:46.240
Everybody's got to have something very punny and quippy, no?

11:46.240 --> 11:50.800
Well Chris, you know that there's the Empire Builder train from North Dakota to Washington,

11:50.800 --> 11:52.080
so Empire Penguin Builder.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.200
Wait, should I just be taking the train?

11:54.200 --> 11:55.200
Is that what you're saying?

11:55.200 --> 11:57.280
Maybe I'll just take the train next time.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.280
Yeah.

11:58.280 --> 12:03.520
Dubstep Alan, oh my god.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.180
If Alan approves it, I almost want to call it that.

12:06.180 --> 12:09.680
I almost want to call it that if he approves it because it doesn't make any sense, but

12:09.680 --> 12:11.920
if you've been around in the chat room for a while, it's so perfect.

12:11.920 --> 12:15.120
Can we print up like a vinyl of his face and stick it on the side?

12:15.120 --> 12:20.280
If somebody can politely get Alan's consent without harassing him, chat room, it's okay

12:20.280 --> 12:21.280
to name it.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.400
Now don't tell him it's my idea.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.400
I think it should be Corky.

12:24.400 --> 12:29.160
I think Corky has been elected for this.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.760
He might make us put Beastie on there.

12:30.760 --> 12:34.240
Yeah, or maybe like have to name like a future roadshow the FreeBSD Trip or something.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.240
That's a reasonable compromise.

12:35.240 --> 12:38.240
No, I don't think so actually.

12:38.240 --> 12:41.080
Oh man, I don't think I can do it.

12:41.080 --> 12:44.000
Alan Jude types with one finger, he points out with the keyboard and the keyboard does

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
the rest.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh my god.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Great.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
This is what...

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Legends of Alan.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.360
This is how egos are born, ladies and gentlemen.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.880
This is how nice guys get egos.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.840
All right, so let's get your ego better.

12:55.840 --> 12:56.960
How do I say I know, right?

12:56.960 --> 12:57.960
How do you do that?

12:57.960 --> 12:58.960
I'll tell you how.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.360
Learning, making yourself smarter, making yourself more employable.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.920
Yeah, I'm talking about Linux Academy.

13:02.920 --> 13:09.400
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and get our 33% discount, like a boss, 33% discount

13:09.400 --> 13:10.400
is nuts.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
It's crazy.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.360
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and check them out.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.480
So Linux Academy is a great resource to learn more about any technology around Linux.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.700
I mean, obviously all the Linux basics and the essentials.

13:19.700 --> 13:20.700
That's what you're going to get there.

13:20.700 --> 13:26.120
And then everything around, you know, NGINX, Apache, OpenStack, virtualization, containerization,

13:26.120 --> 13:27.120
all of that.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.120
You're going to get that.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.120
Self-paced too.

13:29.120 --> 13:32.840
The courses are really good with videos and there's downloadable comprehensive study guides.

13:32.840 --> 13:36.440
And PDFs that you can take with you or audio files you can listen to while you're naked

13:36.440 --> 13:37.440
and wet in the shower.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.000
I mean, good stuff.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.600
And stuff that's going to stick with you too.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.720
The kind of stuff that sticks on your bones and you remember because it's hands-on.

13:43.720 --> 13:44.720
It's scenario based.

13:44.720 --> 13:47.000
So you're really using the technology and you're working with it.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.480
And you get to choose from seven plus Linux distributions, which is pretty sweet.

13:50.480 --> 13:54.880
And the nice part about that is it's not just the courseware, which man, can you imagine

13:54.880 --> 13:58.800
how dedicated and passionate you have to be just to create seven different iterations

13:58.800 --> 13:59.800
of the courseware?

13:59.800 --> 14:02.920
How do you systemize that in a way that makes that straightforward?

14:02.920 --> 14:04.640
You still have to input all those different variations.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.200
I mean, you still have to check it.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.200
It is nuts.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.200
They clearly love what they do here.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.200
Seriously.

14:09.200 --> 14:13.080
And the nice thing is it also adjusts the virtual machines that spin up.

14:13.080 --> 14:16.880
So everything comes with labs and you can do this stuff on, well not everything, but

14:16.880 --> 14:18.560
all the courses that need to come with labs.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.280
And when you turn them on, they match the distribution you've chosen.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.280
It's brilliant.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.360
Now you've heard me talk about Linux Academy for a while.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.840
Did you know you could actually go work for them too?

14:25.840 --> 14:29.180
Linux Academy is hiring and they're looking for some great new content creators.

14:29.180 --> 14:32.600
They're also looking to fill some DevOps professionals and developers.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.640
They're looking for anybody that does Linux development like C and C++, Bash, Perl, Python.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.620
They're also looking for big data and machine learning developers who would love to share

14:39.620 --> 14:40.640
their knowledge.

14:40.640 --> 14:44.840
So they have educators that can help you put this into a format that's presentable.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.640
But if this is an expertise you have, they really want to dive into that.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.120
And if you're not even interested in video creation, they're also looking for certified

14:50.120 --> 14:53.200
professionals to help increase just the exam database.

14:53.200 --> 14:57.920
The Academy is going to pay $1 to $25 per question depending on the quality, depth and

14:57.920 --> 14:59.480
accuracy of the questions.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.400
Maybe if you just want to write up some good questions, that might be something to check

15:02.400 --> 15:03.400
out.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.400
Here's how you can get started.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.400
Email career at linuxacademy.com.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.600
And if you want to take advantage of Linux Academy, and I really think you should, it's

15:07.600 --> 15:10.480
a great resource, especially if you can get your work to pay for it.

15:10.480 --> 15:11.920
Oh man, that's a real slam dunk.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.000
And work, by the way.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.240
They have team accounts.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.240
That's pretty cool.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.640
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged business or personal.

15:17.640 --> 15:18.640
You can get our discount.

15:18.640 --> 15:22.160
Try it out for a little while for a 33% discount rate, which is nuts, essentially.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.160
What a deal.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.760
I think like a month of your first quarter is paid for with that or even more.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.760
It's a really good deal.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.760
It's super sweet.

15:28.760 --> 15:33.080
I mean, it's such a good opportunity to get started, and it's something where your money

15:33.080 --> 15:36.400
is going to a company who's crazy passionate about the ecosystem around it.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.000
It's not just a feature checkbox for their online learning platform.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
It's actually what they do.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.040
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

15:45.040 --> 15:50.520
the Linux Unplugged show, program, talk show, whatever you want to call it, we think.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.520
Experience.

15:51.520 --> 15:52.520
Yeah, that's good.

15:52.520 --> 15:55.880
We should just call all these shows experiences, because you experience it however you want.

15:55.880 --> 15:59.600
So Poby was busy this week in making sure that the MIR propaganda pumped out to all

15:59.600 --> 16:04.280
of the usual presses and made sure that Joey over at OMG Ubuntu wrote up this great article.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.280
I'm totally kidding.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.120
But actually, Joey did catch a good spot.

16:07.120 --> 16:11.160
Some Canonical employees were at a recent developer sprint, and this video was distributed

16:11.160 --> 16:15.640
internally at Canonical to distribute the progress made on Xorg compatibility for MIR.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.880
So like X apps running on top of MIR, you know, like XMIR.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.420
And I just want to show a little bit of the video, even though you might be listening,

16:21.420 --> 16:24.880
it's actually still pretty obvious if you just listen what they're doing here.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.240
And it's looking pretty good.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.440
So this is at the sprint.

16:28.440 --> 16:32.440
We have our legacy X app icon.

16:32.440 --> 16:37.760
So this is Unity 8, and they're showing here like the Chrome icon, the Firefox icon, GIMP,

16:37.760 --> 16:39.240
and these are all X applications.

16:39.240 --> 16:46.320
Chrome, UM, Firefox, G-Edit, UM, D-Brack Office, and XChat Ganon.

16:46.320 --> 16:52.640
My screen isn't touch, so I have to do everything via quick pad, but we will start this out

16:52.640 --> 16:53.640
out of the way.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.640
There, he launches Firefox.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.640
Cool about it.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.160
Because whenever you exit, it thinks it's crashed, but it's okay.

16:59.160 --> 17:03.200
So this, my understanding, and if I'm wrong, anybody feel free to correct me, but this

17:03.200 --> 17:06.280
instance of Firefox is in its own container, I believe.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.680
It's like, it's isolated from the rest of the operating system.

17:08.680 --> 17:13.080
It's an X application running under MIR right here using, on the Unity 8 desktop.

17:13.080 --> 17:38.600
So now here's the OpenGL demo that actually impressed me.

17:38.600 --> 17:43.600
This is running, this is WebGL running in Firefox, and you know, he has a ton of fish

17:43.600 --> 17:44.600
on the screen.

17:44.600 --> 17:55.200
Remember, this is under MIR, but this is Firefox in X application.

17:55.200 --> 18:08.240
And that's not necessarily a very nice laptop either, I was just about to say that, yeah.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.240
That is pretty good.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.200
Now, I don't know much more than what's in this video.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.200
Is there any background, Poppy, you want to fill in, or any details you want to point

18:15.200 --> 18:17.000
out that we might have missed?

18:17.000 --> 18:21.400
So this was done, the video was taken a couple of weeks ago when we were all in London for

18:21.400 --> 18:27.880
a sprint, so we get together now and then in various places around the world where it's

18:27.880 --> 18:31.560
just faster for you to all work sat next to each other.

18:31.560 --> 18:35.080
You can have meetings and stuff as well, but it just works out quite nicely.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.480
You can work pretty efficiently and quickly.

18:38.480 --> 18:44.160
And Chris Townsend, who's the guy operating the laptop, was just giving a demo to Kevin

18:44.160 --> 18:49.640
Gunn who made the video, and Kevin was just asking him to just do a demo of the progress

18:49.640 --> 18:52.040
that they'd made that week.

18:52.040 --> 18:57.960
And you're right, it is all containerized, and the reason for that is so that it respects

18:57.960 --> 19:01.060
the architecture we've got for MIR applications under MIR.

19:01.060 --> 19:04.840
So all the applications on the phone and on the desktop under MIR are siloed.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.720
They're containerized, so that they can't interfere with each other and stomp on each

19:08.720 --> 19:10.560
other's files and so on.

19:10.560 --> 19:16.320
And we want to allow legacy apps to run under MIR as well, but also not be able to stomp

19:16.320 --> 19:21.780
on all the other files, and don't allow Firefox to be able to read your contacts database

19:21.780 --> 19:23.600
or whatever.

19:23.600 --> 19:31.920
And so they've developed this tool called Libertine, which is on Launchpad, which is

19:31.920 --> 19:36.400
the tool that containerizes all of this and makes it all kind of work, and it's pretty

19:36.400 --> 19:37.400
cool.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
Yeah.

19:38.400 --> 19:44.280
So if you wanted to try this, is this something people could get their hands on yet?

19:44.280 --> 19:45.280
Or how exactly?

19:45.280 --> 19:46.280
Yeah, I mean, you could.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.280
You could.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.280
I know you probably would want to, but...

19:48.280 --> 19:49.280
I mean, he's got a dedicated...

19:49.280 --> 19:53.200
He actually, you see on his desk, he's got two laptops, because the one on the right

19:53.200 --> 19:58.720
is the one running Unity 8 and MIR, and he has it set up in a very specific way.

19:58.720 --> 20:02.680
It's an Intel machine because of drivers.

20:02.680 --> 20:09.520
So it's a little bit tricky to get going, but once it's in a state where it's something

20:09.520 --> 20:12.720
we can share, I'm sure more people will use it.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.120
I mean, it's all open source.

20:14.120 --> 20:17.480
It's all on Launchpad, so it's not like we're hiding it or anything.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.480
It's all available.

20:18.480 --> 20:22.800
We just haven't made an image with it in or anything yet.

20:22.800 --> 20:29.000
It seems like the key thing here is these XMIR applications are actually working pretty

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
well.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.960
And that's got to be a pretty big point because I would think, I don't know, but I would think

20:35.960 --> 20:40.260
a large percentage of the applications people are going to be using on a Unity 8 MIR desktop

20:40.260 --> 20:45.960
is old X apps for a long time, especially the most critical ones like Firefox and Chrome

20:45.960 --> 20:46.960
when they're using it on the desktop.

20:46.960 --> 20:47.960
Right.

20:47.960 --> 20:48.960
There's going to be a few.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.880
I mean, there's going to be a few apps that everybody...

20:50.880 --> 20:51.880
Maybe the majority.

20:51.880 --> 20:57.120
If you look down your list of apps that you have open right now, they're X apps and many

20:57.120 --> 20:59.880
of them won't run under Wayland or MIR.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.960
So yes, we need to provide...

21:01.960 --> 21:05.800
I mean, this is the whole part of the strategy of heading towards convergences.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.640
We still need to provide a way for people to run their existing apps.

21:08.640 --> 21:13.000
We're not just going to drop everything and say, ha, all that stuff you've built up over

21:13.000 --> 21:16.760
the last 15 years, screw that stuff, throw it all away.

21:16.760 --> 21:17.760
That's not what we're doing.

21:17.760 --> 21:21.680
We're trying to make it possible for people to run those applications that they're familiar

21:21.680 --> 21:28.280
with, but in performant way, but siloed so that they don't stumble over each other.

21:28.280 --> 21:32.680
Because if we go back to having all the applications able to stumble over each other, then we're

21:32.680 --> 21:34.600
no better than running under X.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.400
We might as well just stay with X.

21:36.400 --> 21:45.800
So it's a nice way to allow people to continue to run the apps they love on a new desktop.

21:45.800 --> 21:51.240
So I'm going to ask you, Wes, since you're a practical tiling window manager kind of

21:51.240 --> 21:57.040
thing, if you were going to do this, so you're on, like your home rig right now is Mint?

21:57.040 --> 21:58.040
My home rig is Arch.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.040
Oh, your home rig is Arch.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.040
Your work rig is Mint.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.040
Yes.

22:01.040 --> 22:04.880
So if you were going to upgrade one of these machines, would you look at the apps you're

22:04.880 --> 22:05.880
running?

22:05.880 --> 22:10.320
I mean, is this at a stage, say in a little while, would you switch to something like

22:10.320 --> 22:13.920
Wayland or Mir if almost every single app you're using is X-based?

22:13.920 --> 22:16.280
Or is it just one of those things where you would just stay on X?

22:16.280 --> 22:20.760
I'm trying to decide from my standpoint, when does it make sense for me to switch over and

22:20.760 --> 22:21.760
why?

22:21.760 --> 22:25.480
And I'm looking at, it's got to be based on, that decision, which could be down the road

22:25.480 --> 22:28.080
quite a ways, maybe I don't need to worry about it right now, it seems like that decision

22:28.080 --> 22:31.120
is going to be based on the apps I use.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.520
What are you going to base the decision on?

22:32.520 --> 22:36.480
Well, you know, obviously if I'm running Arch, I'm interested in new interesting things.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.200
So I do want to give them a try.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.200
I'm very interested.

22:39.200 --> 22:45.080
The fact that you can just run your X app sandboxed in Mir, that's kind of really likeable.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.240
So you might try just from the experimentation.

22:47.240 --> 22:50.160
Yeah, and the fact that they're already sandboxed is awesome.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.160
Yeah.

22:51.160 --> 22:52.160
Yeah.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.160
Hmm.

22:53.160 --> 22:59.000
I'm not sure now is a good time to switch or any time really soon.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.040
Or even if I would, I personally, I don't think I would switch to this right now.

23:05.040 --> 23:13.040
And that's because I'm using a lot of Debian packages on my Debian-like style desktop.

23:13.040 --> 23:16.040
And as we keep saying, that's not going away.

23:16.040 --> 23:20.640
Everything's baked from those raw ingredients, which are the Debian packages.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.640
Yeah.

23:21.640 --> 23:27.320
So, you know, I can see people like expert users like you and me, and you know, many

23:27.320 --> 23:31.600
of your listeners are already used to that and will just carry on using that.

23:31.600 --> 23:36.440
But someone who goes into a store and buys a laptop that has Ubuntu pre-installed, maybe

23:36.440 --> 23:38.360
in a couple of years, right?

23:38.360 --> 23:45.680
That may have Unity 8 and Mir pre-installed, but have a nice button that lets you install

23:45.680 --> 23:50.320
apps that they're familiar with, that they've seen before, or that some online guide or

23:50.320 --> 23:52.040
an expert friend has told them to get.

23:52.040 --> 23:56.880
So I think probably those are the kind of people who would probably move first.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.200
But we might experiment.

23:58.200 --> 24:01.600
Like you say, Wes, you know, have a look at it, have a play with it.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.600
Maybe it won't-

24:02.600 --> 24:03.600
I wonder.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.600
I think so.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.600
I think a percent, a niche of the niche will.

24:06.600 --> 24:10.920
But I also wonder if many people, if the threshold's always going to be, well, what are my applications?

24:10.920 --> 24:13.120
Then I wonder if it's going to be one of those things that just keeps getting delayed and

24:13.120 --> 24:14.240
delayed and delayed for the most people.

24:14.240 --> 24:19.200
But I'll give Northranger a chance to jump in with visions of if we no longer had to

24:19.200 --> 24:20.200
deal with X.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.200
Go ahead, Northranger.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.200
Yeah.

24:22.200 --> 24:28.400
I mean, with your desktop environments like KDE and GNOME on the desktop, getting much

24:28.400 --> 24:35.960
improved support in the last 12 months, and the push from folks like Canonical on the

24:35.960 --> 24:43.640
mobile side, I think we might see a switch to these next generation, whether it's Wayland,

24:43.640 --> 24:46.160
Mirror, et cetera, on the various platforms.

24:46.160 --> 24:50.640
We'll see that switch happen sooner rather than later because we'll get benefits in performance

24:50.640 --> 24:52.600
of the actual desktop environment.

24:52.600 --> 24:59.760
You know, on a tablet, you definitely want every last little bit of frame rate, the fewest

24:59.760 --> 25:05.760
milliseconds of touch response time where technologies like Mirror are a real benefit.

25:05.760 --> 25:10.840
So as long as your base desktop is running it, even if your apps are containerized and

25:10.840 --> 25:17.600
running through the second layer X server, we can live with that.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.600
Yeah.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.600
Yeah, I agree.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.400
Yeah, if there's quick adoption there, that would be...

25:21.400 --> 25:26.520
I could see myself like when I run on a GNOME desktop, I try to run like all GTK applications.

25:26.520 --> 25:29.640
And when I run on a KDE desktop, I try to run all QT applications.

25:29.640 --> 25:35.000
I could see a time where if there's enough applications, I might use one web browser

25:35.000 --> 25:38.040
over the other if it was native to Wayland versus an X app.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.040
Could you see yourself doing that?

25:39.040 --> 25:40.040
I could definitely, yeah.

25:40.040 --> 25:45.960
And if running the X app still works really well, then why not switch to the back end?

25:45.960 --> 25:50.160
That Firefox WebGL demo was fairly impressive to me because that doesn't seem to be much

25:50.160 --> 25:51.160
of a...

25:51.160 --> 25:55.260
Even if there is a performance penalty, if it can do that fairly successful, the performance

25:55.260 --> 25:59.160
penalty is not going to be that big to your web browsing session.

25:59.160 --> 26:02.800
And so if you're curious what we're talking about, we have the video embedded in the show

26:02.800 --> 26:03.960
notes.

26:03.960 --> 26:08.120
And I'm glad you guys decided to post that, Poppy, because I know it's not like the most

26:08.120 --> 26:09.680
polished video, but it's really cool to see.

26:09.680 --> 26:10.680
Very interesting.

26:10.680 --> 26:11.680
Yeah.

26:11.680 --> 26:12.680
To really see it.

26:12.680 --> 26:13.680
And it's nice.

26:13.680 --> 26:14.680
I think you're going to see some more of those.

26:14.680 --> 26:15.680
Good.

26:15.680 --> 26:16.680
I think that was the first of...

26:16.680 --> 26:18.840
A trial balloon?

26:18.840 --> 26:24.800
I think we want to show off some of this stuff because we get a reputation for sitting in

26:24.800 --> 26:30.520
rooms and doing stuff privately and all the code is on Launchpad, but because people don't

26:30.520 --> 26:36.460
build it and run it and see it, they think that it doesn't exist when in fact it's actively

26:36.460 --> 26:37.460
worked on.

26:37.460 --> 26:38.460
And that video is two weeks old.

26:38.460 --> 26:40.920
It's on Launchpad, there's really loads of changes since then.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.320
So this video shows us it is true.

26:43.320 --> 26:48.080
You guys are working together in closed rooms, but now you're just showing it to us.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.080
Documented closed rooms.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.080
No, it's just funny.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.400
Because it's cool that you're publishing that.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.400
It's a good point.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.400
Well taken.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.440
And for me, it was like, well, this is...

26:56.440 --> 27:00.680
And you know what the other thing is, Poppy, is the Internet's full of lazy cats.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.360
Who wants to sit there and build all that stuff when you can just watch a YouTube video

27:03.360 --> 27:04.360
of it?

27:04.360 --> 27:07.580
And one of the things that some of the other desktop projects have going for them is they

27:07.580 --> 27:13.560
just have super enthusiastic fans that go and do video production.

27:13.560 --> 27:17.700
We're going to talk about when we get to GNOME 3.18, we're going to talk about some of these

27:17.700 --> 27:22.920
videos that show off GNOME 3.18 and some of these write-ups that the GNOME Foundation

27:22.920 --> 27:24.760
should be paying these people for it.

27:24.760 --> 27:25.760
It's so well done.

27:25.760 --> 27:29.840
And so it's good to get your version of it out there, too.

27:29.840 --> 27:30.840
That's what I say to that.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.760
And I like seeing that WebGL demo.

27:32.760 --> 27:33.760
I'm not going to admit it.

27:33.760 --> 27:34.760
Slick.

27:34.760 --> 27:35.760
Yeah, very slick.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.760
You know what else is real slick there, Wes?

27:36.760 --> 27:37.760
This is super crazy slick.

27:37.760 --> 27:38.760
In fact, I love them.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.520
I use them all the time.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.520
DigitalOcean.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.520
Heck yeah, it's DigitalOcean.

27:42.520 --> 27:43.520
Where's my...

27:43.520 --> 27:44.520
Hold on.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.520
Here we go.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.520
You got to go there right now, actually.

27:46.520 --> 27:50.040
I was going to say, if you don't know about DigitalOcean, then I got bad news.

27:50.040 --> 27:53.560
You have been under a rock because something really cool has been developing for a long

27:53.560 --> 27:54.560
time.

27:54.560 --> 27:59.440
And you can get on it for two months for absolutely free when you use our promo code, DOUNPLUGGED.

27:59.440 --> 28:02.060
Go over to digitalocean.com and remember DOUNPLUGGED.

28:02.060 --> 28:03.760
And now I'm going to tell you about them.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.960
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

28:06.960 --> 28:10.240
easy way for you to get your own Linux machine up in the sky.

28:10.240 --> 28:14.360
Now yeah, you could also deploy FreeBSD, but come on, you're listening to Linux Unplugged.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.960
And they have CoreOS, which is really cool.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.200
They work with the CoreOS folks.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.760
And they have Ubuntu on there, and they've got the LTSs, and they've got the 1504.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.840
They even have the latest Fedora.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.600
Like after a couple of weeks after...

28:24.600 --> 28:29.240
I mean, I'm not trying to burn you Corora guys, but come on.

28:29.240 --> 28:33.800
DigitalOcean has Fedora 22 up on DigitalOcean for immediate deployment before the Corora

28:33.800 --> 28:35.520
project even gets their respin out.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.400
Now come on guys, I know you're busy, but come on.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.400
Come on.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.400
Come on, DigitalOcean.

28:40.400 --> 28:41.400
I mean, of course, you know what?

28:41.400 --> 28:42.400
The problem is they're just super badass.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.120
In fact, check out their interface and you can see how it's a priority for them.

28:45.120 --> 28:49.320
They've managed to take something complicated like managing servers around the world and

28:49.320 --> 28:51.120
make it in a super simple, straightforward interface.

28:51.120 --> 28:54.400
In fact, the other thing that's really cool about that interface is they have an API.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.520
And that API lets you do all the things you want to do, either automated or through some

28:58.520 --> 28:59.880
of the great community apps.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.480
So remember that promo code DOUNPLUGGED?

29:02.480 --> 29:04.800
Here's what I want you to remember.

29:04.800 --> 29:09.200
Go over there and use it because you're going to get a $10 credit and the base rig starts

29:09.200 --> 29:10.200
at $5 a month.

29:10.200 --> 29:15.760
They get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

29:15.760 --> 29:19.440
Now the nice thing is if you wanted to do something really beefy, like I decided when

29:19.440 --> 29:23.520
I went Minecraft for my son, I wanted to go just kind of a little bit more beefy.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.180
The pricing is really straightforward.

29:25.180 --> 29:29.280
It's just $10, you get an even nicer rig, $20, you get an even nicer rig.

29:29.280 --> 29:30.280
It's obvious.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.280
It's right there.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.520
And then the other thing that's really cool is if you want to do some testing or production

29:34.520 --> 29:37.500
load balancing, they have hourly pricing.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.500
It's really neat.

29:38.500 --> 29:41.440
And then the other thing that they don't really mention a lot on their site, but I think they

29:41.440 --> 29:44.820
should, I think they should put it in here as like a little asterisk, is they also have

29:44.820 --> 29:46.760
private networking.

29:46.760 --> 29:52.440
And you can set up private networking between your different droplets and then you can have

29:52.440 --> 29:57.180
like a front-end web server and a back-end database server or a front-end X2Go server

29:57.180 --> 29:59.640
and a back-end NAS server, right?

29:59.640 --> 30:02.440
And the transfer over that private networking is free.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.580
So you don't have to pay for any data.

30:04.580 --> 30:08.280
So if you're doing like backups, that's really nice.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.760
In fact, here's what you can go to DigitalOcean.

30:10.760 --> 30:12.180
You can read more about it.

30:12.180 --> 30:13.560
It's really straightforward to set up.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.760
It's a really cool system.

30:14.760 --> 30:18.940
And I think it's like we did an episode about remote Linux desktops at the Linux Action

30:18.940 --> 30:20.720
Show a couple of months ago.

30:20.720 --> 30:25.200
You combine a front-end X2Go server with a couple of back-end droplets, and all of these

30:25.200 --> 30:29.760
things are like $5 a month, plus you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you get the $10 credit.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.320
It's a really cool way to do this.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.660
And you can start kind of thinking about things a little differently because you can really

30:33.660 --> 30:37.920
build your own private infrastructure up there, all running on top of a Linux KVM server,

30:37.920 --> 30:41.800
all SSDs throughout, and the pricing is very straightforward.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.480
Go check them out, DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thanks

30:45.480 --> 30:48.300
to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

30:48.300 --> 30:49.480
You guys got a great service.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.480
You rock.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.480
Oh, man.

30:51.480 --> 30:52.480
I wish I could do a good...

30:52.480 --> 30:53.480
Can you do any accents, Wes?

30:53.480 --> 30:54.480
I can't.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.480
I wish I could do a Scottish accent.

30:55.480 --> 30:56.480
Oh, I can't.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.480
I wish.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.480
I can do bad accents.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.480
Can you do Canadian?

30:59.480 --> 31:00.480
No?

31:00.480 --> 31:01.480
Usually all Americans can do Canadian, Wes.

31:01.480 --> 31:02.480
They just don't want to.

31:02.480 --> 31:03.480
All right.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.480
So let's move on.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.480
Let's talk about how Debian is going to shut down the CIA.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.480
Oh, man.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.200
I don't know about this.

31:09.200 --> 31:15.480
So Motherboard, which as we were talking about in the pre-show, is a vice company, is really

31:15.480 --> 31:18.680
getting into a nitty-gritty topic in the Linux distro world.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.160
And I was kind of surprised to see this.

31:20.160 --> 31:24.160
So that was one of the reasons why I actually wanted to cover it in the show today, is this

31:24.160 --> 31:29.120
is new territory for Motherboard, and they're obviously trying to drive clicks with that,

31:29.120 --> 31:35.040
how Debian is trying to shut down the CIA headline and make software trustworthy again.

31:35.040 --> 31:39.580
But the effort is almost worth a grabby headline like that.

31:39.580 --> 31:46.800
So this is from a presentation that was given at the Chaos Communications Camp in Germany

31:46.800 --> 31:47.800
earlier this month.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.680
So I have the full presentation linked in the show notes.

31:50.680 --> 31:55.640
And by a Debian developer, Jeremy, oh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it, Bobbio, or

31:55.640 --> 31:59.760
something, B-O, Bobbio, B-O, B-B-I-O, B-O, B-B-I-O.

31:59.760 --> 32:00.760
I love it.

32:00.760 --> 32:01.760
Whatever it is.

32:01.760 --> 32:02.760
But this I can say.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.160
He's better known online as Lunar.

32:04.160 --> 32:08.680
And he told the audience how Linux-based operating systems are working to bring reproducible

32:08.680 --> 32:15.400
builds to all of its 22,000 software packages, so all of Debian's packages.

32:15.400 --> 32:19.920
So here's a layman's breakdown of what a reproducible build is if you're not familiar.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.440
As the name suggests, it makes it possible for other people to reproduce the build process.

32:23.440 --> 32:27.120
The idea is to get a reasonable confidence that a given binary was indeed produced by

32:27.120 --> 32:28.880
the source.

32:28.880 --> 32:32.120
This is a quote from Lunar's presentation.

32:32.120 --> 32:36.160
We want anyone to be able to produce identical binaries from given source.

32:36.160 --> 32:41.260
A software package reproducibility build should be byte for byte identical to the publicly

32:41.260 --> 32:43.260
available package.

32:43.260 --> 32:47.520
Any difference would be evidence of tampering.

32:47.520 --> 32:51.680
Reproducible builds rely in part on David A. Wheeler's solution to this problem called

32:51.680 --> 32:52.880
diverse double compiling.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.320
Are you ready for this one, Wes?

32:54.320 --> 32:55.320
Well, let's hear it.

32:55.320 --> 32:56.320
Are you excited?

32:56.320 --> 32:57.320
I am.

32:57.320 --> 32:58.320
Okay, good, good.

32:58.320 --> 32:59.320
I'm giddy.

32:59.320 --> 33:05.040
So Lunar explains you need two compilers with one that you somehow trust.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.680
Then you build the compiler under test twice, once with each compiler, and then you use

33:08.680 --> 33:13.160
the compilers that you just built to build the compiler under test again.

33:13.160 --> 33:16.500
If the output is the same, then there are no back doors.

33:16.500 --> 33:20.200
But for this scheme to work, you need to be able to compare that both outputs are the

33:20.200 --> 33:21.200
same.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.040
And that's exactly what we are enabling with having reproducible builds.

33:24.040 --> 33:30.120
According to Lunar, 83% of Debian's packages are now built reproducibly with more of the

33:30.120 --> 33:31.160
join the party every day.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.440
So does this sound kind of like in line with what you've read about reproducible builds?

33:34.440 --> 33:37.280
Is this essentially you can take the source and when you build it, it's exactly what the

33:37.280 --> 33:39.440
source should be, exactly what the author says?

33:39.440 --> 33:40.440
Yes.

33:40.440 --> 33:44.360
So one of the big challenges is making sure that you've got a build system set up in such

33:44.360 --> 33:47.680
a way that you can easily do that and that other people can easily replicate.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.880
Yeah, because there is the issue is the compiler compromise.

33:49.880 --> 33:53.920
Like if you're really worried about a state actor, the compiler could be the weak link.

33:53.920 --> 33:59.140
So that is a key piece of this.

33:59.140 --> 34:04.120
So when I see this, I think to myself, well, this seems like A, from a technical standpoint,

34:04.120 --> 34:05.640
an amazing feat to pull off.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.760
Okay, so let's read this part again.

34:07.760 --> 34:12.640
You need two compilers with one that you trust, then you build the compiler under test twice,

34:12.640 --> 34:13.640
once with each compiler.

34:13.640 --> 34:20.040
Okay, so you build the compiler twice, once with each compiler, and then you use the compilers

34:20.040 --> 34:23.280
that you just built to build the compiler again under test.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.840
That's how you verify a compiler.

34:24.840 --> 34:25.840
Wow.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.200
If the output is the same, then that compiler has no back doors.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.200
Wow.

34:29.200 --> 34:34.240
Yeah, that just verifies that the compiler doesn't have any back doors.

34:34.240 --> 34:35.240
Right, but you need, yes, right.

34:35.240 --> 34:38.640
The idea is you have to have a verifiable compiler and then you have to have verifiable

34:38.640 --> 34:39.640
packages too.

34:39.640 --> 34:41.560
Like it's not just one or the other.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.160
That's the tricky thing, I think, right?

34:44.160 --> 34:45.160
Am I following this right?

34:45.160 --> 34:46.160
That seems like, yeah.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.160
Well, it's not that tricky.

34:47.160 --> 34:52.740
Even though they say reproducible, you can also say it verifiable, or authentic build

34:52.740 --> 34:56.720
builds because the output will be identical from either compiler.

34:56.720 --> 34:57.720
Break it down.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.080
So why do you say authentic?

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
What did you say?

35:01.080 --> 35:02.960
Or because you can just hash or-

35:02.960 --> 35:03.960
Oh yeah, okay.

35:03.960 --> 35:04.960
Verify.

35:04.960 --> 35:05.960
Because it's binary.

35:05.960 --> 35:10.960
So bit per bit compatible or comparable and exact to what the other compilers put out.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.440
So you can have an official version.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.440
Right, yeah.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.440
That makes sense.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.440
That's what they mean.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.720
Instead of just reproducible builds, they're just using a different name.

35:17.720 --> 35:20.220
Verifiable builds are a lot more common.

35:20.220 --> 35:21.220
You disagree, Wimpy?

35:21.220 --> 35:22.220
No.

35:22.220 --> 35:29.080
Yeah, I do because the issue here is ensuring that your origin compiler wasn't backdoored

35:29.080 --> 35:34.840
at the outset and therefore everything you compile contains a backdoor that was in that

35:34.840 --> 35:35.840
compiler.

35:35.840 --> 35:36.840
Right.

35:36.840 --> 35:41.200
Like the big boogeyman story is the NSA gets credentials to a repo and replaces FTP or

35:41.200 --> 35:43.080
something like that.

35:43.080 --> 35:48.880
Or you go back to the very first version, the very first compiler that Richard Stallman

35:48.880 --> 35:56.920
used to build the GNU toolchain and was that backdoored and compromised and therefore is

35:56.920 --> 36:03.600
every GNU compiler since compromised or rather everything that the GNU compiler creates compromised.

36:03.600 --> 36:10.800
So this is a real tinfoil hat example, but the issue here is making sure that there isn't

36:10.800 --> 36:15.560
a backdoor in the compiler that introduces backdoors into your compiled code.

36:15.560 --> 36:16.560
Yeah.

36:16.560 --> 36:20.920
That's also why they need to have the same Blitzy in all the libraries that they link

36:20.920 --> 36:21.920
to.

36:21.920 --> 36:25.280
They have to include them in order to have the reproducible builds.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.360
Yeah.

36:26.360 --> 36:33.440
So this is something that is essentially more of a process problem than it is a technology

36:33.440 --> 36:34.720
problem for these distros.

36:34.720 --> 36:38.240
So essentially what Debian is implementing is a process, right?

36:38.240 --> 36:42.400
And so this is something that other distros should probably look at, I would think.

36:42.400 --> 36:47.000
Should this be something that Red Hat can claim as well?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.880
Wouldn't SUSE want to be able to claim this as well?

36:49.880 --> 36:50.880
I would think.

36:50.880 --> 36:56.080
It might help their verifiability or static analysis.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.080
So like-

36:57.080 --> 36:58.480
It adds one more thing to there.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.480
Yeah.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.480
Because this is, as the motherboard article points out, this is a staple of the Bitcoin

37:02.480 --> 37:04.280
and Tor project today.

37:04.280 --> 37:08.800
Obviously these projects, they need this kind of verifiability, so they already do this.

37:08.800 --> 37:15.960
And FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenWRT have announced that they'll also be doing this.

37:15.960 --> 37:19.880
So it seems like there's a big movement here to me for people that want to be trusted.

37:19.880 --> 37:23.800
So you've got to figure it's something that's on a lot of people's minds.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.080
And Red Hat's been looking into a lot of this stuff, so I don't know.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.240
I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see an announcement at some point.

37:28.240 --> 37:31.160
Kind of similar to the functional package managers like Nix.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.160
Yeah.

37:32.160 --> 37:35.240
They have like a hash of all the dependencies that go into building.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.360
They kind of do this by default.

37:37.360 --> 37:38.360
Huh.

37:38.360 --> 37:41.500
I don't know if all the implications are there necessarily, but-

37:41.500 --> 37:43.080
I'm going to make a prediction right now.

37:43.080 --> 37:46.800
Red Hat 8, one of the features on the box, reproducible builds.

37:46.800 --> 37:47.800
You watch.

37:47.800 --> 37:48.800
You've called it.

37:48.800 --> 37:49.800
Yeah.

37:49.800 --> 37:50.800
What was it?

37:50.800 --> 37:51.800
I know somebody was going to say something.

37:51.800 --> 37:56.160
Also, they don't even need to just be built for security reasons.

37:56.160 --> 38:03.160
Building for containerization and virtualization and cloud purposes also benefit from this

38:03.160 --> 38:04.720
reproducible build stuff.

38:04.720 --> 38:05.720
Oh yeah.

38:05.720 --> 38:06.840
Yeah, that's a good point.

38:06.840 --> 38:07.840
Yeah.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.160
There is that aspect to it, just ensuring you're delivering your software completely

38:10.160 --> 38:11.160
and things like that.

38:11.160 --> 38:12.160
Yeah.

38:12.160 --> 38:18.120
I think the reason why we took the bent of the NSA and CIA is because, well, Lunar says,

38:18.120 --> 38:21.600
he says, what was the line he said here?

38:21.600 --> 38:24.120
The great thing is that free software is... No, that's not it.

38:24.120 --> 38:25.120
This is actually a good quote.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.120
I'll read this anyways.

38:26.120 --> 38:30.640
The great thing with free software is that we have the freedom to study the source code,

38:30.640 --> 38:35.680
that it does not contain any malware, malicious code, or security, but how, Lunar asks, do

38:35.680 --> 38:39.160
we know that the compiler binary was not built from the published source?

38:39.160 --> 38:43.860
How do we know the CIA or other malicious attacker has not tampered with the build process?

38:43.860 --> 38:46.120
He says, we are not discussing a hypothetical attack here.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.120
This is a real attack.

38:47.120 --> 38:51.460
We are talking about developers in totally good faith producing software with the binary

38:51.460 --> 38:57.720
they would give you, and even if they are of good faith, we could be totally owned still.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.680
Reproducible builds already are a state of... Oh, I read that part, of Bitcoin and the

39:00.680 --> 39:01.680
Tor project.

39:01.680 --> 39:05.520
So he argues that it's already a real attack problem, and he's kind of the one, I think,

39:05.520 --> 39:07.800
put the CIA spin on it, that the motherboard took and ran.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.240
Well, and it does sound here, it looks like the CIA tried to break into Apple, which is

39:11.240 --> 39:12.240
...

39:12.240 --> 39:13.240
Oh, yeah.

39:13.240 --> 39:16.160
And I also think there's been some questions about the Debian project itself, too.

39:16.160 --> 39:20.560
Yeah, I mean, they distribute a lot of software.

39:20.560 --> 39:26.600
There was a talk given on this subject at FOSDEM earlier this year, and it wasn't just

39:26.600 --> 39:27.600
related to this.

39:27.600 --> 39:31.760
It was also the auditability and the fact that actually some of the packages in the

39:31.760 --> 39:39.880
archive were built not by the builders, builders in the cloud, but actually on developers'

39:39.880 --> 39:44.840
local machines, and what really should happen is all of those builds should move to the

39:44.840 --> 39:48.420
server where they can be verified, because if they're being built on a local machine

39:48.420 --> 39:52.520
by a developer, then it makes it even harder to verify that it's not been compromised.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.960
Yeah, because who knows the state of that developer machine?

39:54.960 --> 39:55.960
Yeah.

39:55.960 --> 39:56.960
Oh, you developers.

39:56.960 --> 39:57.960
Developer machines are notorious.

39:57.960 --> 39:58.960
Developers, developers, developers.

39:58.960 --> 40:04.880
Yeah, interesting, and it's an area that is sort of new to me, but it sounds like actually

40:04.880 --> 40:09.440
once you kind of take away some of the... You just change the words you use, and it actually

40:09.440 --> 40:10.440
makes a lot of sense.

40:10.440 --> 40:13.440
It looks like they've got a link to the full slides and discussion.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.440
Yes, sir.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.000
I'll put a link to that there in the show notes directly.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.560
Now, it is a PDF, but it's his whole presentation that he gave.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.240
It looks like a lot of good information.

40:20.240 --> 40:22.400
Yeah, and he has some good quotes in there, too.

40:22.400 --> 40:25.440
He starts out with a really good quote, so it's worth a read if you're fascinated by

40:25.440 --> 40:26.440
this topic as I was.

40:26.440 --> 40:29.840
I probably will pick it up after the show, actually, because I don't have very good connectivity

40:29.840 --> 40:32.840
out in the trailer, but I can download that to my Instapaper, too.

40:32.840 --> 40:33.840
There you go.

40:33.840 --> 40:34.840
Just read it offline.

40:34.840 --> 40:35.840
I might actually do that.

40:35.840 --> 40:36.840
That's a good idea.

40:36.840 --> 40:39.680
I have a little bookmark that just sends it right into my queue.

40:39.680 --> 40:40.680
Very nice.

40:40.680 --> 40:41.680
Yeah, it is nice.

40:41.680 --> 40:42.680
All right.

40:42.680 --> 40:46.760
Speaking of connectivity, I've got to tell you about my good friends over at the Ting

40:46.760 --> 40:47.760
Network.

40:47.760 --> 40:48.760
I want you to go there and check them out, too, won't you?

40:48.760 --> 40:51.800
Because we have a special $50 promo at linux.ting.com.

40:51.800 --> 40:57.400
linux.ting.com will give you the $50 promo off a device, or if you have a compatible

40:57.400 --> 41:01.280
device already, then they're going to give you $50 of service credit, which is really,

41:01.280 --> 41:02.720
really, really, really slick.

41:02.720 --> 41:05.600
This is only going on until the end of September, so I want you to go over there and try them

41:05.600 --> 41:06.600
right now.

41:06.600 --> 41:11.080
If you're a small business, too, this is a really slick way to get not just good devices,

41:11.080 --> 41:14.920
but just constant connectivity and communications that doesn't require an arm and a leg to pay

41:14.920 --> 41:15.920
for it.

41:15.920 --> 41:16.920
Here's why.

41:16.920 --> 41:20.680
No contract, nor the termination fee, and you only pay for what you use.

41:20.680 --> 41:24.280
Six dollars is the starting rate, and then it's just your usage on top of that.

41:24.280 --> 41:28.060
Now, if you can be really handy with your Wi-Fi usage, like we are here at the studio,

41:28.060 --> 41:29.280
it's really slick.

41:29.280 --> 41:32.240
You can get SIM cards right now as low as $5.

41:32.240 --> 41:36.980
So if you've got a device that works with Ting's GSM network, $5 SIM card, and you're

41:36.980 --> 41:37.980
on Ting.

41:37.980 --> 41:39.200
It's really, really nice.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.320
Free shipping right now.

41:40.320 --> 41:42.560
Also, they've got some great phones on sale.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.840
You can get the Kiosar Kona for $68.

41:44.840 --> 41:49.360
If you just want a great feature phone with a good screen and the battery that lasts forever

41:49.360 --> 41:52.840
ever, like five days, $68.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.200
No contract, nor the termination fee.

41:55.200 --> 41:58.420
Refurbished Samsung Galaxy S3, $122.

41:58.420 --> 42:00.600
Now here's the good one.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.880
Samsung Galaxy S6.

42:02.880 --> 42:03.880
My baby.

42:03.880 --> 42:04.880
My baby.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.920
You can get $80 off.

42:06.920 --> 42:10.200
Now it's $568, but you own that phone like you would a laptop or a smart, you know, like

42:10.200 --> 42:11.680
a real device.

42:11.680 --> 42:13.280
Not a toy, but a real device.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.280
That's nice.

42:14.280 --> 42:16.880
And then the nice thing is if you ever get stuck, Ting has no hold customer service.

42:16.880 --> 42:19.360
You call them at 1855 Ting FTWs.

42:19.360 --> 42:23.520
But even better than that, they have like the best dashboard ever to manage all of this.

42:23.520 --> 42:25.240
You can do everything from the Ting dashboard.

42:25.240 --> 42:28.280
You can get a real easy, like they have this promo picture right here, and you're like,

42:28.280 --> 42:31.280
oh, that's a nice mocked up image of what the Ting, no, that's what the Ting dashboard

42:31.280 --> 42:32.280
looks like.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.560
It's really what it looks like.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.720
It's very, very, very slick.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.920
And this video shows you some of it.

42:37.920 --> 42:39.920
And it kind of gives you an idea.

42:39.920 --> 42:40.920
Yeah.

42:40.920 --> 42:41.920
Oh, yeah.

42:41.920 --> 42:42.920
Go Wes.

42:42.920 --> 42:43.920
Nice, buddy.

42:43.920 --> 42:44.920
That's right.

42:44.920 --> 42:47.080
And the next thing you can do, so we have several, we have several phones on our, on

42:47.080 --> 42:48.640
our line and you just go in there and name them.

42:48.640 --> 42:49.880
So I don't have to like remember the numbers.

42:49.880 --> 42:51.680
It just shows me the name of each device.

42:51.680 --> 42:55.120
I can see the usage so I can see like who's taking up all the data.

42:55.120 --> 42:59.000
I can set alerts if I need to or want to, but it's not really a big deal since we're

42:59.000 --> 43:02.160
only paying like 40 bucks a month for all three phones at the most.

43:02.160 --> 43:06.440
You can also do things like if you want one line that maybe hides caller ID or a one line

43:06.440 --> 43:08.980
that can't do video messaging or something like that, you can go turn those individual

43:08.980 --> 43:11.920
things on and off in the dashboard, all kinds of stuff like that.

43:11.920 --> 43:14.720
You can also just disable the line for a little while if you don't need it.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.120
So it's pretty cool.

43:16.120 --> 43:20.480
And it also all integrates in with the dash app on the phone for iPhone or Android.

43:20.480 --> 43:24.280
You can get push notifications if you want them, but I don't really, again, because the

43:24.280 --> 43:25.280
ting rates are so low.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.280
I don't really care.

43:26.280 --> 43:30.120
But you can manage all the aspects of the plan from the device right there if you need

43:30.120 --> 43:31.120
to.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.280
That's particularly nice if you've got like a teenager or something who's burning through

43:33.280 --> 43:35.360
that data watching YouTube.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.920
My son is six years old and he's already doing it.

43:37.920 --> 43:38.920
So I feel your pain.

43:38.920 --> 43:41.560
But the nice thing is I can get alerts if I need them.

43:41.560 --> 43:42.560
And it works pretty good.

43:42.560 --> 43:47.600
And you can also call them at 1-855-TING-FTW anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. and you can

43:47.600 --> 43:48.680
talk to a real human being.

43:48.680 --> 43:50.520
Just get started by going to linux.ting.com.

43:50.520 --> 43:54.120
They'll take $50 off your first device or if you've got a compatible device, you can

43:54.120 --> 43:55.120
get $50 of service credit.

43:55.120 --> 43:59.160
Now, I'm telling you, I've got three phones, okay?

43:59.160 --> 44:02.360
Now I'm very Wi-Fi savvy to be honest with you, but I've got three phones and I'm paying

44:02.360 --> 44:03.440
like 40 bucks a month.

44:03.440 --> 44:07.520
So if you can get a $50 service credit by bringing a compatible phone because I've got

44:07.520 --> 44:09.600
a CDMA and GSM, that's pretty sweet.

44:09.600 --> 44:10.600
That's pretty sweet.

44:10.600 --> 44:12.960
Plus, you know, just checking them out also helps us out.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.640
Go to linux.ting.com and try their savings calculator.

44:15.640 --> 44:16.920
Maybe it's worth your time.

44:16.920 --> 44:21.600
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

44:21.600 --> 44:26.240
Okay, Wes, brace yourself, my friend.

44:26.240 --> 44:28.760
Are you ready to switch to GNOME?

44:28.760 --> 44:32.520
Say no if you're not because maybe by the end you will be.

44:32.520 --> 44:33.520
Maybe I need a little more convincing.

44:33.520 --> 44:34.520
Okay, all right.

44:34.520 --> 44:35.520
All right.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.520
Okay.

44:36.520 --> 44:44.840
So I got to start with a shout out to World of Goo or WooGoo or whatever, WooGoo, W-O-G-U-E.

44:44.840 --> 44:49.560
And this guy is essentially blogging on Google Plus about features about GNOME.

44:49.560 --> 44:51.620
And he just does a really, really, really, really great job.

44:51.620 --> 44:53.920
So I want to give him a shout out because a lot of the stuff he's pulling out that are

44:53.920 --> 44:57.360
not in the release notes specifically, they're not really...

44:57.360 --> 45:00.960
GNOME is not doing a particularly good job about promoting these features.

45:00.960 --> 45:07.500
So he goes out of his way to put really great videos together that cover all the different

45:07.500 --> 45:09.560
cool features of GNOME that you don't see.

45:09.560 --> 45:12.080
Watch this one here.

45:12.080 --> 45:13.080
They have one of the things...

45:13.080 --> 45:16.360
Okay, Wes, this is going to be one of the first new features I want to show you.

45:16.360 --> 45:17.360
See if he...

45:17.360 --> 45:20.360
Oh, hi there, ladies.

45:20.360 --> 45:21.360
So here's the...

45:21.360 --> 45:22.360
Did those come with the terminal?

45:22.360 --> 45:24.240
No, no.

45:24.240 --> 45:27.880
So he has these videos that show the new features of GNOME and he does a really good job of

45:27.880 --> 45:28.880
going through this.

45:28.880 --> 45:30.200
But check out this new feature, Wes.

45:30.200 --> 45:33.800
One of the first new features that's coming to a GNOME 3.18's terminal is they've made

45:33.800 --> 45:35.280
the terminal much slicker.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.680
But he's got a lot of good music going, doesn't he?

45:37.680 --> 45:38.680
Oh, yeah.

45:38.680 --> 45:39.840
Okay, Wes, watch this terminal.

45:39.840 --> 45:40.840
Watch this terminal.

45:40.840 --> 45:41.840
You see that?

45:41.840 --> 45:42.840
Okay, hold on.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.880
Sorry, he's got his titles in the way so you can't quite see it.

45:44.880 --> 45:45.880
There it goes.

45:45.880 --> 45:49.400
All right, so he's got the GNOME terminal up right now and he's changing one setting

45:49.400 --> 45:52.720
in there and check this out.

45:52.720 --> 45:53.720
You can drag tabs around.

45:53.720 --> 45:54.720
See that?

45:54.720 --> 45:55.720
Look at that.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.720
That's very...

45:56.720 --> 45:57.720
Look at that.

45:57.720 --> 45:58.720
Very nice.

45:58.720 --> 45:59.720
Okay, so the new GNOME terminal...

45:59.720 --> 46:01.020
This is the only weekend that I'm building up.

46:01.020 --> 46:04.440
The new GNOME terminal has a very much like Firefox tab-like thing.

46:04.440 --> 46:05.680
You can drag them around.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.760
You drag them off the terminal where they pop up into their own tab, that kind of thing.

46:08.760 --> 46:09.760
That's not bad, right?

46:09.760 --> 46:10.760
Yeah.

46:10.760 --> 46:11.760
You're with me so far?

46:11.760 --> 46:12.760
Oh, yeah.

46:12.760 --> 46:13.760
Okay.

46:13.760 --> 46:14.760
All right.

46:14.760 --> 46:15.760
Honestly, I already like GNOME terminal.

46:15.760 --> 46:16.760
It's pretty reliable.

46:16.760 --> 46:17.760
Yeah, yeah.

46:17.760 --> 46:18.760
But that's not bad.

46:18.760 --> 46:19.760
Okay, I'm still getting there.

46:19.760 --> 46:20.760
Of course, Northern Ranger, if I don't get to it, then you can announce it.

46:20.760 --> 46:21.760
But now here's the next one.

46:21.760 --> 46:25.440
Wes, we were talking about Wayland earlier today and I want to make the case, even though

46:25.440 --> 46:32.840
the Kaywin project is coming very far on its Wayland support, I have to say, GNOME 3.18

46:32.840 --> 46:35.800
is introducing some impressive Wayland features.

46:35.800 --> 46:39.240
The most anticipated feature, for me at least, is somebody just finally said, so we're really

46:39.240 --> 46:41.080
here with Wayland, but we're close.

46:41.080 --> 46:43.280
Because NVIDIA doesn't support Wayland yet, so that's a big stopper.

46:43.280 --> 46:48.160
But if you can get around the fact that NVIDIA isn't supporting Wayland, the GNOME 3.18 desktop

46:48.160 --> 46:49.760
is pretty rock solid now.

46:49.760 --> 46:53.440
A bunch of improvements have gone into Mudder specifically, so it's very performant under

46:53.440 --> 46:54.440
Wayland.

46:54.440 --> 46:58.400
They've set up shared clipboards now, so your X applications and your Wayland applications

46:58.400 --> 47:00.920
can copy and paste between each other.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.840
It's really good stuff.

47:02.840 --> 47:09.640
And so the world of GooGuy or WooGoo or whatever, he has been blogging like a machine about

47:09.640 --> 47:13.460
all the different things that are working and not working and problems like that.

47:13.460 --> 47:18.760
But it's looking like Wayland support is looking really good, almost good enough for everyday

47:18.760 --> 47:21.600
use, especially if you're on Intel now, starting with GNOME 3.18.

47:21.600 --> 47:22.600
Everyday use.

47:22.600 --> 47:23.600
Everyday use.

47:23.600 --> 47:24.600
Whoop.

47:24.600 --> 47:26.240
Are you ready for this?

47:26.240 --> 47:27.920
I might be.

47:27.920 --> 47:33.280
You know, I swear I muted my phone before the show started, and somehow during the show

47:33.280 --> 47:34.280
it got unmuted.

47:34.280 --> 47:35.600
I do not know how that happened.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.080
All right, so okay, the next feature.

47:38.080 --> 47:41.080
Are you ready for the next feature of GNOME 3.18?

47:41.080 --> 47:42.080
Are you ready for the next feature?

47:42.080 --> 47:43.080
Let's hear it.

47:43.080 --> 47:47.760
All right, the next feature for GNOME 3.18 is going to disable that crappy search in the

47:47.760 --> 47:53.360
open dialog box and on network drives, recursive search that kills Nautilus and makes it die,

47:53.360 --> 47:54.360
and finally fixes that up.

47:54.360 --> 47:55.360
What do you think of that one?

47:55.360 --> 47:56.360
What do you got?

47:56.360 --> 47:57.360
Nothing?

47:57.360 --> 47:58.360
Long overdue.

47:58.360 --> 47:59.360
Yeah, I'm not.

47:59.360 --> 48:00.360
I'm not surprising you.

48:00.360 --> 48:01.360
About damn time.

48:01.360 --> 48:02.360
All right.

48:02.360 --> 48:03.360
Okay, now you're ready for the...

48:03.360 --> 48:04.360
Of course, I don't know if I'm going to sell you with this one, but one of the big features

48:04.360 --> 48:06.440
that's making a lot of headlines today, this is the one that everybody's talking about

48:06.440 --> 48:11.680
as we record, GNOME 3.18 is going to allow you direct access to Google Drive right in

48:11.680 --> 48:12.680
Nautilus.

48:12.680 --> 48:13.680
Oh, really?

48:13.680 --> 48:14.680
Yeah.

48:14.680 --> 48:15.680
Right in.

48:15.680 --> 48:16.680
Built right in Nautilus.

48:16.680 --> 48:17.680
GNOME, you're going to have access.

48:17.680 --> 48:19.360
That's going to mount to kind of like a web drive, kind of share, so it's going to be...

48:19.360 --> 48:24.200
What is it using in the back end?

48:24.200 --> 48:25.200
Probably some kind of web drive.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.200
It's not full sync.

48:26.200 --> 48:27.200
Okay.

48:27.200 --> 48:28.200
Far as I know.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.200
But NorthRanger, was that what you...

48:29.200 --> 48:30.200
You thought the big lead was the Google Drive support, or something else you're excited

48:30.200 --> 48:31.200
about?

48:31.200 --> 48:32.200
I was actually excited about the Wayland clipboard support.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.200
Yeah.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.200
And it's full like drag and drop even.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.200
Like you can...

48:36.200 --> 48:37.200
Oh, wow.

48:37.200 --> 48:38.200
Yeah.

48:38.200 --> 48:39.200
It's real nice work.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.200
They've really done...

48:40.200 --> 48:41.200
That's a big improvement.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.200
That's awesome.

48:42.200 --> 48:43.200
Yeah.

48:43.200 --> 48:44.200
It really is kind of...

48:44.200 --> 48:46.560
It's going to make it much easier to coexist with Xapps and Wayland apps on the same desktop.

48:46.560 --> 48:49.200
So that's a huge deal, but if you're not running Wayland yet, it's not app big.

48:49.200 --> 48:52.400
But the fact that they're basically saying we're getting close to everyday use is really,

48:52.400 --> 48:53.800
I think, pretty exciting.

48:53.800 --> 48:56.960
I think GNOME 3.18 is actually going to look like a really good release, and I didn't really

48:56.960 --> 48:57.960
know.

48:57.960 --> 49:01.560
One of the things is, I started digging around before we started this episode to kind of

49:01.560 --> 49:05.400
see, okay, well, here's what the GNOME project sort of outlined about what's really cool.

49:05.400 --> 49:08.360
But when you actually start digging into some of the release notes and things like that,

49:08.360 --> 49:11.200
there's things they're not putting in the release notes that are...

49:11.200 --> 49:14.120
There's a lot of little small improvements that they're bringing into GNOME 3.18 that

49:14.120 --> 49:16.000
I don't know.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.760
I think it's looking like a really great desktop.

49:17.760 --> 49:19.760
So if you're going to try out Wayland...

49:19.760 --> 49:20.760
That seems like the way to do it.

49:20.760 --> 49:22.000
It seems like, I think.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
I think if you're going to try...

49:23.000 --> 49:25.920
I don't know how your awesome window manager is going to work, Wes, but I think if you're

49:25.920 --> 49:26.920
going to try...

49:26.920 --> 49:27.920
I just love that I don't...

49:27.920 --> 49:29.760
I don't think this is looking like you're having a hard time.

49:29.760 --> 49:33.080
I think if you're going to try out Wayland, I think you're going to have to try out GNOME

49:33.080 --> 49:34.080
3.18.

49:34.080 --> 49:35.080
I think you're right.

49:35.080 --> 49:36.080
Okay, we'll see.

49:36.080 --> 49:37.080
I mean, GNOME is fast becoming, you know, it...

49:37.080 --> 49:38.840
All right, second prediction of the show.

49:38.840 --> 49:42.560
Second prediction of the show, Wes switches back to GNOME.

49:42.560 --> 49:43.560
I swear.

49:43.560 --> 49:44.760
Because right now you've got Awesome and Cinnamon.

49:44.760 --> 49:45.760
Yep.

49:45.760 --> 49:48.200
Does anybody know, anybody know what Cinnamon's plan is for Wayland?

49:48.200 --> 49:49.840
What's the, what's the plans there?

49:49.840 --> 49:50.840
Is...

49:50.840 --> 49:51.840
Are they working on that right now?

49:51.840 --> 49:52.840
I know they're using GTK 3.

49:52.840 --> 49:53.840
Yeah, yeah.

49:53.840 --> 49:54.840
I guess as long as...

49:54.840 --> 49:55.840
And they're...

49:55.840 --> 49:56.840
What are they using?

49:56.840 --> 49:57.840
What's the compositor for?

49:57.840 --> 49:58.840
They're...

49:58.840 --> 50:01.800
Well, it's, it's called...

50:01.800 --> 50:04.000
It's forked from mutter and there's...

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
Yeah, that's right.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
It's called...

50:06.000 --> 50:09.240
It begins with M, muffin.

50:09.240 --> 50:15.720
But when I spoke to Clem about this a little while ago, he's just waiting for Wayland to

50:15.720 --> 50:20.120
really get to the point where it's got mass adoption behind it.

50:20.120 --> 50:26.400
And I think what that really means is that the, the GPU vendors support it.

50:26.400 --> 50:27.400
Yeah.

50:27.400 --> 50:31.520
And you know, he also probably wants to see just where things play out with, with Mir

50:31.520 --> 50:35.540
too, because I mean, if he's based on Ubuntu, that might end up being a way to go too.

50:35.540 --> 50:39.360
So the GNOME 3.18 release, why, why am I talking about this right now?

50:39.360 --> 50:42.520
Because it's supposed to come out by the end of the month and I might be on the road when

50:42.520 --> 50:43.520
it hits.

50:43.520 --> 50:45.320
And I don't know if I'm going to have the bandwidth to download it and give it a review.

50:45.320 --> 50:48.880
So I just wanted to kind of talk about it right now because I'm going to be jonesing

50:48.880 --> 50:49.880
for it.

50:49.880 --> 50:50.880
When I have that...

50:50.880 --> 50:51.880
Oh man.

50:51.880 --> 50:52.880
Oh, that's going to be rough.

50:52.880 --> 50:53.880
If GNOME 3.18 hits.

50:53.880 --> 50:56.440
I bet it doesn't hit stable repos, but I bet by the time I get back, I bet it's not in

50:56.440 --> 51:00.240
stable, but before I get back, I bet, I bet, I bet it won't hit the stable.

51:00.240 --> 51:01.340
Can you wait?

51:01.340 --> 51:02.340
I don't think I could.

51:02.340 --> 51:03.340
I think I'll...

51:03.340 --> 51:06.640
If it hits stable repos while I'm on the road, I think I will probably find a spot to get

51:06.640 --> 51:07.640
wifi.

51:07.640 --> 51:08.920
And I think I will do the updates.

51:08.920 --> 51:09.920
I have to man.

51:09.920 --> 51:10.920
You kind of have to.

51:10.920 --> 51:11.920
I mean, I can't go a couple of days.

51:11.920 --> 51:12.920
Yeah.

51:12.920 --> 51:13.920
I'll go to a Starbucks.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.840
I'll go to XT and I'll do the update there.

51:15.840 --> 51:16.840
Yeah.

51:16.840 --> 51:17.840
I will know.

51:17.840 --> 51:18.840
I'm hoping.

51:18.840 --> 51:21.520
I haven't, I haven't got all the details yet, but hopefully Ting's going to be providing

51:21.520 --> 51:25.440
connectivity on GSM and CDMA networks for me along the trip.

51:25.440 --> 51:31.920
So we'll see, but still it feels like an abuse of a privilege to update my, my arch boxes

51:31.920 --> 51:32.920
while on the road.

51:32.920 --> 51:36.600
Cause I'm going to have probably two of them, maybe three of them with me on the road.

51:36.600 --> 51:40.640
And I don't know if I want to be doing package updates on three arch boxes because they're

51:40.640 --> 51:41.640
all running GNOME.

51:41.640 --> 51:42.640
Is that just...

51:42.640 --> 51:43.640
McDonald's?

51:43.640 --> 51:44.640
Yeah.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.640
I would totally do it to McDonald's.

51:45.640 --> 51:46.640
I could do that.

51:46.640 --> 51:47.640
Nice.

51:47.640 --> 51:48.640
All right.

51:48.640 --> 51:51.760
So any other Wayland or a GNOME 3.18 thoughts before I move on anything I missed?

51:51.760 --> 51:54.360
There's also other features that they're adding, but those are just ones that I don't think

51:54.360 --> 51:55.360
are going to be in the release notes.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.680
But I figure we'll all be talking about the ones that are in the release notes when it

51:57.680 --> 51:58.680
comes out.

51:58.680 --> 51:59.680
Yeah.

51:59.680 --> 52:00.680
So, okay.

52:00.680 --> 52:01.680
Going once, going twice.

52:01.680 --> 52:02.680
All right.

52:02.680 --> 52:07.140
Well then I will just, I'll just leave with a little mention that as, if you are curious

52:07.140 --> 52:12.120
on the state of the, of the whole road trip and where that's going, as I get kind of ramped

52:12.120 --> 52:15.960
up to it, I have posted a couple of videos up on our YouTube channel.

52:15.960 --> 52:19.960
I think I mentioned this at the end of last, last week.

52:19.960 --> 52:20.960
Or I guess this week.

52:20.960 --> 52:21.960
Yeah.

52:21.960 --> 52:22.960
I did.

52:22.960 --> 52:23.960
Oh no, I actually, that's right.

52:23.960 --> 52:24.960
I mentioned at the beginning of last.

52:24.960 --> 52:25.960
Boy, I'm an old man.

52:25.960 --> 52:26.960
Good.

52:26.960 --> 52:29.360
So you probably already know about this, but if you don't, there is a road trip playlist.

52:29.360 --> 52:30.440
I've only got two videos up there now.

52:30.440 --> 52:32.400
I'm in progress of making the third.

52:32.400 --> 52:38.000
And it's just updates because this is a whole new experience and there's a surprising connection.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.640
There's a maker aspect to it because there's a lot of build and cut and drill and solve.

52:43.640 --> 52:47.160
And there's an interesting technology aspect to it too.

52:47.160 --> 52:50.400
And of course for me it's also, I'm using Linux in a lot of spots.

52:50.400 --> 52:57.000
So it's really kind of been a fascinating kind of adventure so far and it's just starting.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.040
So I've documented two of it so far and I'll have a third up probably the next day or so.

53:01.040 --> 53:04.280
Connectivity is limited when I'm staying in the trailer, but I'll get it out eventually.

53:04.280 --> 53:09.040
So you can find that at the Jupiter Broadcasting YouTube channel, youtube.com slash Jupiter

53:09.040 --> 53:10.040
Broadcasting.

53:10.040 --> 53:13.520
There is a trailer walkthrough in the second update.

53:13.520 --> 53:14.600
It's a quick one.

53:14.600 --> 53:15.680
There's a quick trailer walkthrough.

53:15.680 --> 53:20.080
When it was empty, like I had not moved a single thing into it and I was parked out

53:20.080 --> 53:23.680
in the road in front of the studio and I'm sitting there with my Patreon poll.

53:23.680 --> 53:24.680
Don't ask.

53:24.680 --> 53:25.800
I'm taking a video.

53:25.800 --> 53:26.800
So you can find that.

53:26.800 --> 53:29.160
It's just on the Jupiter Broadcasting channel.

53:29.160 --> 53:30.160
And yeah.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.160
All right.

53:31.160 --> 53:32.160
Well that'll wrap us up.

53:32.160 --> 53:33.160
So let's see.

53:33.160 --> 53:34.440
So next week's Linux Unplugged.

53:34.440 --> 53:40.240
I'll be here for the 15th and then I will be on the road for episode 111 and episode

53:40.240 --> 53:44.200
112 for the ones recorded on the 22nd and the 29th.

53:44.200 --> 53:46.480
We should be doing that the same regular time I think though.

53:46.480 --> 53:50.760
So I think that all is if you listen live, oh, I could pre-warn you though.

53:50.760 --> 53:55.720
The download might be slightly delayed because the intention is for me to have a local recording

53:55.720 --> 53:59.560
on the road so that way my audio quality isn't that much worse when I'm doing the road show.

53:59.560 --> 54:04.480
But to do that, the show will have to pass through another set of editing to combine

54:04.480 --> 54:09.000
my remote audio track, Wes's local audio track and the Mumbles audio track and any computer

54:09.000 --> 54:10.340
audio that we have.

54:10.340 --> 54:15.320
So potentially four or five different tracks may have to be lined up by an editor and then

54:15.320 --> 54:18.120
delivered for production into video as well.

54:18.120 --> 54:24.920
So during the road trip there may be an eight hour delay or so on the release of the show.

54:24.920 --> 54:28.980
So maybe instead of coming out Tuesday night it might come out Wednesday morning or Wednesday

54:28.980 --> 54:31.520
midday or Wednesday afternoon, I'm not quite sure.

54:31.520 --> 54:32.840
We don't know yet because we haven't tried it yet.

54:32.840 --> 54:36.480
But just as a pre-warning for those of you that might notice that, I wanted to get you

54:36.480 --> 54:39.960
a couple of weeks' heads up because if you're a little bit behind by the time you're catching

54:39.960 --> 54:41.160
this, that'll be affecting you.

54:41.160 --> 54:44.240
But hopefully it won't be a big deal and you just grab the RSS feed and you'll get them

54:44.240 --> 54:45.240
when they come out.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.680
Or be here live for all the fun.

54:46.680 --> 54:47.680
That's right.

54:47.680 --> 54:48.840
That is the fastest way to get it.

54:48.840 --> 54:51.880
And there are clever solutions for recording the live stream too.

54:51.880 --> 54:53.560
Yeah, I know people do that.

54:53.560 --> 54:56.680
All right, well that'll wrap us up for this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

54:56.680 --> 54:57.680
We'd love to get your feedback.

54:57.680 --> 55:01.680
You can go over to linuxactionshow.reddit.com and leave a note in the feedback thread there.

55:01.680 --> 55:06.200
Or you can go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact and where you'll find a contact form

55:06.200 --> 55:08.300
for Linux Unplugs specifically.

55:08.300 --> 55:11.720
And that's always nice because then I filter just on the Unplugged show and I get all of

55:11.720 --> 55:12.720
that.

55:12.720 --> 55:13.720
So that's a good way to send your thoughts into the show.

55:13.720 --> 55:16.960
And don't forget we are live, like Wes just mentioned, over at jblive.tv.

55:16.960 --> 55:18.940
We do the show at 2 p.m. Pacific.

55:18.940 --> 55:23.280
You can get that converted to your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

55:23.280 --> 55:27.520
Any topics you want to also suggest, that subreddit's also great, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

55:27.520 --> 55:29.640
Those are all the great places to get all the info.

55:29.640 --> 55:33.520
And at Jupiter Signal, for any last minute changes during the road trip or things like

55:33.520 --> 55:36.600
that, at Jupiter Signal is the network's news feed.

55:36.600 --> 55:39.280
All right everybody, well thank you so much for your time.

55:39.280 --> 55:41.960
Oh, wow, geez, hang up on me already, why don't you?

55:41.960 --> 55:42.960
Thanks for tuning in.

55:42.960 --> 55:59.040
We'll see you next week.

56:13.240 --> 56:21.680
Bye.

56:21.680 --> 56:24.840
Another suggestion for GPS tracking coming in right now.

56:24.840 --> 56:28.760
Boy, this is, we're all about the GPS tracking right here on the Linux Unplugged program.

56:28.760 --> 56:31.560
I tell you what, this is a serious endeavor because I want to make sure you guys know

56:31.560 --> 56:35.320
where I'm at so that way you can tell me the cool places to get brews, food, or meet up

56:35.320 --> 56:36.320
with me.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.260
So this is worth the effort.

56:38.260 --> 56:40.360
We got to spend a little time talking about this.

56:40.360 --> 56:44.160
While we all go vote for titles, JBtitles.com, we've got to get into this.

56:44.160 --> 56:52.640
This is kind of neat, so I could use this on the road trip somehow.

56:52.640 --> 56:57.440
You can use an APS droid to connect to the APRS network via different means, either via

56:57.440 --> 57:00.680
internet, Wi-Fi, or mobile data connection, audio connection between your radio and your

57:00.680 --> 57:05.480
smartphone, wow, how about that, or a Bluetooth serial connection to a TNC.

57:05.480 --> 57:10.120
Once connected, your beacon and presence see what stations are around and send and receive

57:10.120 --> 57:14.120
APRS messages.

57:14.120 --> 57:17.600
So this could be an APRS transmitter itself, it looks like.

57:17.600 --> 57:21.840
Here, I'm going to put the QR code on the screen if you guys want to grab that.

57:21.840 --> 57:22.840
I want to grab it too.

57:22.840 --> 57:23.840
Where's my phone?

57:23.840 --> 57:24.840
I want to get that.

57:24.840 --> 57:28.880
Come on, Google, do I have a QR code reader?

57:28.880 --> 57:30.800
Can you just tell Google to open a QR code reader?

57:30.800 --> 57:31.800
Yes.

57:31.800 --> 57:32.800
Okay, you think so?

57:32.800 --> 57:33.800
Let's see.

57:33.800 --> 57:34.800
Well, if you have one installed.

57:34.800 --> 57:37.200
All right, let's see if it does it.

57:37.200 --> 57:38.200
You ready, Wes?

57:38.200 --> 57:39.200
Let's see.

57:39.200 --> 57:40.200
Let's give it a chance.

57:40.200 --> 57:43.480
Okay, Google, open the QR code reader.

57:43.480 --> 57:48.560
Ah, I don't have one installed.

57:48.560 --> 57:53.000
And I like, though, the link it brings up is the QR reader for iPhone on the App Store.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.720
Mine brought up like a list of apps.

57:54.720 --> 57:55.720
I hate you, Wes!

57:55.720 --> 57:56.720
What did you say?

57:56.720 --> 57:57.720
Oh, you got the same thing.

57:57.720 --> 57:59.720
I just captured you, spy.

57:59.720 --> 58:04.000
You captured the same exact audio, and you got App Store play results, and look what

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
I got.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Now, how the hell is that?

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
I don't know.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
How did that happen?

58:08.000 --> 58:09.880
It should be the same Google now, you would think.

58:09.880 --> 58:15.840
Okay, Google, QR reader for Android.

58:15.840 --> 58:16.840
And okay, look what it gave me there.

58:16.840 --> 58:18.280
Yeah, I got the Kindle link, too.

58:18.280 --> 58:19.280
That's unhelpful.

58:19.280 --> 58:20.280
That's totally unhelpful.

58:20.280 --> 58:21.280
Very hit or miss.

58:21.280 --> 58:22.280
This is no good.

58:22.280 --> 58:23.280
This is no good.

58:23.280 --> 58:27.720
Anyways, I got to look into this app, because you know what, the Play Store should just

58:27.720 --> 58:29.720
have a freaking QR code reader built into it.

58:29.720 --> 58:30.720
It should, yes.

58:30.720 --> 58:33.280
Why doesn't it do that?

58:33.280 --> 58:36.280
QR code reader.

58:36.280 --> 58:37.280
Didn't get it.

58:37.280 --> 58:38.280
Hello?

58:38.280 --> 58:39.280
Hello?

58:39.280 --> 58:40.280
Hello?

58:40.280 --> 58:41.280
QR code reader.

58:41.280 --> 58:42.280
There we go.

58:42.280 --> 58:43.280
There we go.

58:43.280 --> 58:45.280
Now I'm in like, okay, now I'm in like Flynn.

58:45.280 --> 58:47.320
Oh, but there's so many to get, though.

58:47.320 --> 58:48.320
This is the problem.

58:48.320 --> 58:49.320
Oh, I know.

58:49.320 --> 58:51.800
There's too many, there's so many lovely QR code readers.

58:51.800 --> 58:56.920
All right, so, okay, has the chat, Chris last, non-vanilla camera apps have integrated

58:56.920 --> 58:57.920
QR code readers.

58:57.920 --> 58:58.920
Yeah, I know.

58:58.920 --> 59:02.040
I got, okay, anybody know if I have to be a ham to use this app?

59:02.040 --> 59:04.780
That's what I need to know right now, because this is happening.

59:04.780 --> 59:05.780
This is happening.

59:05.780 --> 59:11.360
According to a forum posted on the internet, it looks like you do.

59:11.360 --> 59:20.320
But does it actually have to, oh man, okay, so it's a $5 app if you get it from the Play

59:20.320 --> 59:21.320
Store.

59:21.320 --> 59:27.440
To make use, you'll need an APRS passcode for your call sign.

59:27.440 --> 59:28.440
Ah, there you go.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.440
There you go.

59:29.440 --> 59:32.840
Well, that kills that.

59:32.840 --> 59:34.120
That kills that.

59:34.120 --> 59:39.520
Does anybody else have something else that doesn't require to be a ham, to have a ham

59:39.520 --> 59:44.400
license and have an APRS, IS passcode?

59:44.400 --> 59:46.640
Because I don't think I'm doing that.

59:46.640 --> 59:48.720
Man, you guys got me all excited.

59:48.720 --> 59:53.440
All right, there's got to be a way to solve this, though, right?

59:53.440 --> 59:54.440
Come on, Wes, you got something on there?

59:54.440 --> 59:57.160
I know last week you were looking at the track car.

59:57.160 --> 59:58.160
Yeah, what is that?

59:58.160 --> 59:59.160
Remind me about the track car.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.160
I should look at that.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.360
Someone in Mumble Room linked something, a tutorial based on it, it looks like.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.360
Really?

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.360
The track car.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360
Now, did I...

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.760
Yeah, I did, track car.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.160
I did save this from last week.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.160
Track car.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.000
Track car is an open source UOS tracking system for GPS tracking devices.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.080
It supports more than 80, but so is a client that allows you...

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.080
All right, you know what?

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.080
I'm desperate enough.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.360
I'll give this a shot.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.360
Let's give this a go.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.680
XTWV in the IRC linked us to something.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.360
Create your own vehicle fleet tracking management system which also links to track car.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.600
That is blowing my face off.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.600
All right, I'm putting this...

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.560
You know what I hate about Google Play is they list my Samsung Edge.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.160
First of all, they use the OEMs like internal code names for your phones.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.160
Oh, yes.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.160
I hate that they do that.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.160
Hammerhead or whatever.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.280
Well, yeah, so if I click install here, like for my Edge, instead of saying the US...

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:53.640
Instead of saying Samsung Edge, it says US Samsung SMG925T.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:54.640
Very helpful.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.420
Yeah, and then it's not even the right picture of my phone.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.200
It's a picture of a different model of my phone in a different color.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.000
So it's just super lame.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.200
Anyways, okay, so now I'm installing...

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:12.080
This is called track car, and it's available for Android.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.720
Track car is a free open source server that supports more than 80 different protocols

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:16.880
and GPS tracking devices.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.520
You can use the application with your own hosted instance of track car.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.520
So that might be something I could do is I could put it up on a droplet.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.600
Well, what do you think?

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.080
Should I give this a shot, Wes?

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.080
Yeah, I think so.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.080
Sounds interesting.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.120
I don't know if I feel like setting up my own server though, but I think I might try

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.120
it.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.400
If the service setup isn't so bad, yeah, the app doesn't look so bad.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:41.200
Yeah, okay, so I have to give it a server to connect to, and a port, and a frequency.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.120
It's in the AUR.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.080
Mixed provider, so I can do mixed providers, so I have a mixed source of...

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.080
It is an AUR, huh?

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.080
Yeah.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.640
I think it runs on Java, so...

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.720
This is getting more and more likely actually.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.000
I got to look into this.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.240
I got to look into this because the only problem is I'm going to be...

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.760
I wonder what it does when I go to areas that don't have tracking.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:01.760
We should check out this...

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.760
Maybe I call it private time.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.760
...Osmend too, maybe.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.760
Oh, Osmend, huh?

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.760
Just while we have it invested.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.760
Yeah, let's take a look.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.760
What's this here?

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.600
So this is coming from Mr. Odyssey Westray over there in Spokane.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.100
So this is Osmend...

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.880
What is this thing here?

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:15.880
This looks neat.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.400
An automated navigation directions and is a map and navigation application with access

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.800
to the free worldwide high quality OpenStreetMaps data.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.800
Yeah.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.520
Okay, this is for offline.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.520
But I don't know if it does...

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:34.040
It doesn't look like it broadcasts my location though, right?

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.800
Yeah.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.000
I think for track cars...

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.800
See with track car, I think the way it would work is I could have a page that people could

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.240
go to and actually watch my trip in real time.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.240
Check in with Chris.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.240
And they'd be like, hey, I want to meet up with you.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.240
Okay, I really...

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.200
Now I'm talking about this, I'm really getting excited about this.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:57.200
Okay, so here's a Gizmodo article that talks about different options.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:03.240
The Motorola i290 nationwide walkie-talkie, wireless web, GPS enabled, hands free...

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.400
What's this?

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400
Get a phone.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400
What is this?

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400
Instamapper.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.360
Have you heard of Instamapper, Wes?

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:10.360
I have not.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.360
Instamapper.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.880
You can install it over the air.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.920
It's easy to use.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.320
Accu tracking is another one.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320
Oh, Instamapper.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320
Connection refused.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.320
What?

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320
Lame.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.320
Yeah, totes lame.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:22.320
Totes lame.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.200
I wonder if I have to use Internet Explorer.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.200
I'll try their HTTP.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.600
Yeah, Instamapper was a popular GPS tracking location service after nearly five years of

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.600
operation.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.600
It shut down in 2012.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.600
Womp, womp.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.840
Wow, how old is this article?

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.840
This article is...

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.060
Oh, my gosh.

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:43.000
You guys, chat room, look at the gear they recommended you use in this.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.700
What is that?

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:47.880
That's like a Motorola feature phone from 2002.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.640
Guys, how old is this article?

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.200
Chat room.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.200
Ooh, check in with Chris.com.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.200
I love it.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.400
Check in with Chris.com.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:57.400
Is that available?

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.400
Somebody grab that for me.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.400
Jeez.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.400
Let's see here.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.440
High quality, low cost GPS tracking with AccuTracking.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.120
Track GPS trackers or cell phones.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.760
Real time location, history reports, emails, text, and alerts.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.760
AccuTracking.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.760
This might be it.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:12.880
They have starter kits, a pre-configured tracker for you.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.880
What's the price like?

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.880
I don't know.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:18.160
I'm going to go look on their Amazon page, but here's what I don't want.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:25.720
This looks like it's for private tracking, you know, to track like a fleet of businesses.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.720
Right.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.280
Whereas you want something that you can easily share.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.280
Yeah.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.280
Yeah.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.280
Oh, that's neat, though.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.280
Here's what I love about this.

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.280
I've seen this.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.280
Verizon has this, too.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.320
This is so cool.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.940
This tracker, look at that, Wes.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.940
This tracker plugs into...

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:38.940
Ooh, industrial.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:43.080
It plugs into your ODB2 port, your diagnostic port, gets power from that, has a SIM card

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.920
in it and a GPS in it, and it can also do a mic.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.920
Oh, dang.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.920
Wow.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.400
It's free to go, no contract, no activation fee, so it's 77 bucks for this off of Amazon.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.840
Prepaid SIM card is included.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:54.840
What?

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.840
Ooh.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:56.840
And what is this?

01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:00.440
Real-time 24-7 GPS tracking, vehicle diagnostic data included.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.440
Oh, my God, that's cool.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.440
That's actually pretty handy.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:07.520
Geofence speed, ignition, AC unplugged, SOS panic, check engine light on.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.520
That's neat.

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.520
With the DTC code.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.520
Detailed tracking reports.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.640
You'll never be able to hide from Andrew, I guess.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.540
Excellent reception with built-in GSM and GPS antenna.

01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:22.000
So here's the thing, though, is I still don't think it's doing public maps.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Right.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.080
Would you have to give people your login to their service to be able to see it or whatever?

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.920
Yeah, that seems like a deal-breaker to me.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.040
That seems like...

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.040
That's no good.

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.280
That's no good.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.040
So I'm gonna stick with the track car and see how that goes.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.400
I'm a little concerned about that.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.400
We will see.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:47.000
I'm a little concerned.
