1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
I gotta imagine some of you out there are VLC users.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,300
I think it's important that everybody knows

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,280
that VLC just released version 3.07,

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,680
which is sort of a minor feature update,

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,840
but the release is special in another way

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,240
because it has the most security issues

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,180
that have ever been fixed in any version of VLC ever.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,140
Yeah, that's right.

9
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,240
And actually it's kind of neat

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,120
because this high number of security issues

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,560
is due to the sponsoring of a bug bounty program

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,200
funded by the European Commission.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,420
The two most important issues are an out-of-bound right

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,520
and a classic stack buffer overflow.

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,560
And there's a couple of mediums in there

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,120
and some low ones in there as well.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,600
A couple of them only affect actually version 4 of VLC,

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,480
but either way, probably worth making sure

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,320
you got the latest version

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,600
because you don't want to download something.

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,000
Yeah, especially if you happen to throw

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,080
strange media files at that application.

23
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,280
Yeah, you know, I also saw this week

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,240
that Ubuntu Mate announced they're switching

25
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,540
to GNOME MPV for their media player.

26
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,960
If you haven't tried out MPV, I mean, I love VLC

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,840
and it's great and that's a super great project,

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,640
but MPV is wonderful too.

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,160
And GNOME MPV is simple.

30
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,840
Just a nice, easy wrapper on top.

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,680
I love it.

32
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,840
So if you haven't checked out MPV in a while,

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,960
why not this week?

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,800
Give it a go.

35
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,020
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 305 for June 11th, 2019.

36
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:31,420
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show

37
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,260
that I'm pretty sure got trolled this week.

38
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,220
My name is Chris.

39
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,420
My name is Wes, and I mean, if not that,

40
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,660
then we might be kind of inadequate.

41
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,980
Thanks, Wes, at least as a team though, right?

42
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,820
So that's good.

43
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,660
That's right.

44
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,340
Yeah, we all got a little trolled this week.

45
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,620
We'll tell you about our attempt

46
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,500
at giving resilient Linux,

47
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,500
the indestructible Debian-based Linux, a try.

48
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,820
We only got so far, hence the trolling.

49
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,460
But we also have a bunch of community news,

50
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,860
including OpenSUSE is looking at renaming.

51
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,760
Firefox is considering a premium paid edition.

52
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,600
Say what?

53
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,300
Yeah, I'm curious to see if you'd pay for that.

54
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,780
Plus we've got some feedback

55
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,940
and we've got some pics this week,

56
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,860
but before we get to any of that, Wes,

57
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,820
we've got to bring in Cheese and Elle.

58
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,640
Hello, Cheese and Elle.

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,480
How are you?

60
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,300
Hey, hey.

61
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,140
Hey, hey.

62
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,960
Thank you for joining.

63
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,800
We've got a lot to get to,

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,780
so let's also bring in that virtual log time.

65
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,000
Appropriate greetings.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
Mumble room.

67
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,660
Hello.

68
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,500
Hello.

69
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,340
Hello.

70
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,160
Hello.

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,000
Hello, it's so good to talk to you

72
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,060
for the very first time right now.

73
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,800
I have never talked to you before this very moment,

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,180
obviously, of course.

75
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,140
So it's good to see you in there, Brent and Bruce and Carl.

76
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,420
Drewbert, Matt's in there.

77
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,780
Minimech, Skull Leader took a break

78
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,900
from leading all the Skulls.

79
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,520
And of course, Tech Mav in there,

80
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,220
as well as Dave and Rotten,

81
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,940
and the bros up in quiet listening.

82
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,340
Aren't we happy to see you all?

83
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,180
It is.

84
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,020
It is really nice to see you.

85
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,840
It's a good crowd.

86
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,680
It's a good crowd.

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,520
So let's kick things off

88
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,620
with something I just mentioned there.

89
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,820
This seems like a big story that's unfolding.

90
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,080
A lot is still up in the air.

91
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,260
It's early days.

92
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,740
And the takeaway headline that people

93
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,740
are really talking about over at LWN

94
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,220
is that OpenSUSE is looking at potentially renaming.

95
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,680
Wes, you would agree that the hardest thing about a project,

96
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,100
no matter if it's a software project

97
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,020
or a media project, is the name.

98
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,860
Oh yeah, I mean, heck,

99
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,340
I just struggle with variable names.

100
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,100
But right, we want names to represent us.

101
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,620
They're a big part of how we identify

102
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,460
and how we present ourselves to the world.

103
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,700
And that means everyone has to disagree.

104
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,580
Yeah, that's so true.

105
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,660
That is really true.

106
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,580
And when I heard this story first,

107
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,420
my first reaction was, what?

108
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,700
Like, OpenSUSE, they're like established.

109
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,980
It's not the first one I would have thought.

110
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,300
Why are they renaming?

111
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,660
Well, this is actually all part of a larger conversation

112
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,660
that's happening in OpenSUSE

113
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,820
as they look to define their independence.

114
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,540
And instead of us telling you about it,

115
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,260
I thought we would just kind of go inside

116
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,380
one of the board meetings.

117
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,660
Richard Brown, the OpenSUSE chairman, breaks it down

118
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,860
in a board meeting that, thankfully,

119
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,460
they had audio recording.

120
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,520
And so we're going to play that for you.

121
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,280
Sort of conference board meeting.

122
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,260
Last year, we had a whole bunch of topics

123
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,920
and we kind of rambled on about all of them

124
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,500
for the better part of an hour

125
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,660
and then had questions at the end.

126
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,300
This one is a little bit different

127
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,860
because if you've been kind of keeping up

128
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,540
with the mailing lists,

129
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,860
there's pretty much only one topic

130
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,260
that's on the board's mind at the moment.

131
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,100
This idea of a foundation or some legal structure.

132
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,500
An OpenSUSE foundation.

133
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,060
A need for a legal structure under the distribution.

134
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,880
And you might wonder,

135
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,180
what are some of the main drivers of that?

136
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,380
Well, they'll tell you.

137
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,900
What we've noticed in organizing the last conferences,

138
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,180
but as well in sponsoring other projects

139
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,260
or receiving money from sponsors,

140
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,500
it is an issue that the OpenSUSE community

141
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,760
has no legal entity behind it.

142
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,440
And if there is a company, for example,

143
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,900
that wants to sponsor us or we as a community think

144
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,380
this project is beneficial

145
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,100
and we want to donate some money for it,

146
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,740
we just can't do it at the moment.

147
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,860
Just for legal and as well for tax reasons.

148
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,420
So the idea is now let's put a legal structure

149
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,820
in behind of OpenSUSE.

150
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,820
So you want a legal structure that is behind OpenSUSE,

151
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,860
but if you're using the SUSE trademark and brand,

152
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,260
there are tons of restrictions that come along with that.

153
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,820
And so that's something they're beginning to be

154
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,140
a little concerned about.

155
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,380
I mean, you could see how there would be

156
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,260
some impedance mismatches between a company

157
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,100
and what they need to do

158
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,380
and how they're trying to represent themselves

159
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,480
and an open source project

160
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,860
with maybe totally different aims in some communities.

161
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,940
Yeah, but today there's alignment

162
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,300
between what SUSE, the parent company wants

163
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,500
and what OpenSUSE is trying to do.

164
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,100
There's alignment and they're very supportive.

165
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,780
Five years from now, will that be true?

166
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,220
How will that work if SUSE is sold to another company?

167
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,300
You know, imagine like a Microsoft or an Oracle

168
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,600
were to buy the SUSE division for their cloud.

169
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Then where does OpenSUSE fit in that picture?

170
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,180
So having a separate legal entity is a really good idea,

171
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,300
but you run into all these trademark issues.

172
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,060
And that's where the name issue comes up.

173
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,780
It's well, maybe we need to call it something else.

174
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,200
And I don't know where they're gonna go with this.

175
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,580
They say the primary motivation for the name change

176
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,180
as described by Richard Brown,

177
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,100
is that OpenSUSE that contains the words SUSE,

178
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,260
the company will have to retain a significant amount

179
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,980
of control over what the foundation could do

180
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,240
with its own name and likewise the distribution.

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,640
The other consequences of the current trademark situation

182
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,020
Brown said is that OpenSUSE says board spends

183
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,540
a significant amount of its time

184
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,460
dealing with trademark issues

185
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,080
to the detriment of the rest of the project.

186
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,920
Yeah, okay.

187
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,760
Didn't realize that.

188
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,580
Wasting a bunch of time.

189
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,500
No, I wouldn't have imagined that at all.

190
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,160
Unsurprisingly, others in the group,

191
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,220
other board members feel that the name change

192
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,780
would be a bad idea.

193
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,660
Some say it would cause the distribution to lose its users.

194
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,860
Some say the brand is the most important part

195
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,540
of keeping the distribution alive.

196
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,420
Throwing it away means throwing away the distribution.

197
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,900
I think that's a strong statement.

198
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,540
I mean, you could see it though, right?

199
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,060
If you weren't already interested and you didn't,

200
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,540
you maybe knew what SUSE was,

201
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,620
but you didn't really know what this other non-branded

202
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,960
or new name project,

203
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,120
are you gonna check that off on a list

204
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,980
even if it's up on DistroWatch?

205
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,820
I don't know.

206
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,180
Yeah, it just could become yet another Linux distribution.

207
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,180
Versus a route of, oh, SUSE, interesting,

208
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,660
I see their name or their products or.

209
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
There's a historical legacy here.

210
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,060
What do you think about this, Cheesy?

211
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,900
Yeah, you know, I mean,

212
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,660
I think this is a great step for SUSE, OpenSUSE,

213
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,620
to kind of pull themselves out of that SUSE umbrella.

214
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,180
This is a good opportunity for them

215
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,980
to maybe, you know, be funded and have a few projects

216
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,100
that they really focus on to bring to the community.

217
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,020
So I think this could be a good thing for them.

218
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,740
You know, whenever you change brands, names, logos,

219
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,220
titles, colors, you're always gonna get backlash.

220
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,780
It is kind of important for them to pick a name

221
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,820
that represents them well.

222
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,080
But I think that the majority of the OpenSUSE users

223
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,700
are going to migrate over to whatever it is they call it.

224
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,340
I mean, if they call it ketchup,

225
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,500
people are still gonna use it

226
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,340
because it used to be OpenSUSE

227
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,260
and that's what they're used to.

228
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,100
So, you know, I think it's a good step for them

229
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,660
to kind of pull themselves out from that umbrella,

230
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,740
that SUSE umbrella, remove all that branding,

231
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,500
you know, kind of like what Fedora has done, right?

232
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,480
Yeah, they argue that Fedora was harmed

233
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
by their name change,

234
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,740
but I see it more the way you're seeing it.

235
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,220
It would actually, to me, be an advantage for them.

236
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,060
And there's another way around this.

237
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,780
There's a middle ground they may be able to tread here.

238
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,540
They may get away with coming up

239
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,540
with something like the Green Lizard Foundation

240
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,140
for the name of the foundation.

241
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,900
And then OpenSUSE is what the foundation takes care of.

242
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,180
And then if the need ever came along

243
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,500
to change the name of the distribution

244
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,220
because of what the parent company was up to,

245
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,260
then the foundation name would be established by that point

246
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,900
and everybody would know, oh yeah, that's the same thing.

247
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,780
You at least already have a strong association

248
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,140
and you could pivot then to put all your eggs in one basket.

249
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,980
Right. Right now.

250
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,360
Those are lizard eggs, to be clear.

251
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,200
Sure.

252
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,380
And you avoid all those trademark entanglements

253
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,500
by calling it the Green Lizard Foundation or whatever it is.

254
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,340
So that seems like a middle ground that could go here

255
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,180
that we might see.

256
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,680
It also seems like at this point, no one really agrees.

257
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,660
I guess it's early days for the conversation.

258
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,380
It is neat though that we, I mean,

259
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,660
we get to watch this from afar as it's all playing out.

260
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,980
Elle, would you install open ketchup on your laptop?

261
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,980
You know, it might just get a little messy.

262
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,820
It already does.

263
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,500
So, nice, nice.

264
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,580
Well, there's one element that would remain the same

265
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,900
and that is SUSE's involvement in picking the chairman

266
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,420
that runs the whole thing.

267
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,700
At the moment, if you look at the Wiki page for OpenSUSE,

268
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,660
there is the existing rules

269
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,180
that we define how the board is elected.

270
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,660
There is the existing rules for how members,

271
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,480
well, who can be a member

272
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,300
that Richard needs to put back there.

273
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,060
But basically the idea is,

274
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,300
without having gone through a lawyer yet,

275
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,300
fundamentally we don't want that structure to change.

276
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,740
The chairman will still be appointed by SUSE.

277
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,660
The board will still be voted by the members

278
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,380
in the same way it is now.

279
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,700
Now, that is also possible

280
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,740
that if the members of the board

281
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,940
don't like the chairman being appointed by SUSE,

282
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,900
they can vote to change it.

283
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,740
So that is still an option to them.

284
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,060
And it's not something Richard Brown asked for,

285
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,140
but that's how it's gonna work.

286
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,020
And I have the policy linked in the show notes

287
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,180
if you wanna see it.

288
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,580
The way the board election rules work

289
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,220
is the chairman is appointed by SUSE.

290
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,500
So there's still some connection there.

291
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,700
Yeah, but I mean, I guess that could also be a good thing.

292
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,520
It could change too.

293
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,360
There's a certain amount of involvement

294
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,860
right from the parent organization

295
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,860
saying that they care about what's happening there.

296
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,780
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

297
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,580
They wanna make sure, you could argue that, exactly.

298
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,460
You could argue they wanna make sure

299
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,660
the mission is carried out or whatever.

300
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,220
We'll let you know.

301
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,300
If they come up with a new name

302
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,100
or if they get a foundation established,

303
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,940
we'll let you know.

304
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,540
I mean, Red Hat has CentOS,

305
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,860
so maybe SUSE could have $OS.

306
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,700
Yeah, something like that.

307
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,540
I was thinking it's kind of like the opposite

308
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,660
of the CentOS situation where CentOS,

309
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,440
well, actually, not really.

310
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,520
CentOS is based on RHEL.

311
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,460
OpenSUSE, or at least OpenSUSE Leap,

312
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,220
is based on their enterprise distribution,

313
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,120
OpenSUSE or SUSE desktop, enterprise desktop.

314
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,720
So there is a lot of similarity there

315
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,100
where CentOS is connected but rebranded.

316
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,220
It's not like the first time we've seen this trademark issue.

317
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,920
This isn't like an unknown thing.

318
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,460
I think my biggest takeaway was is

319
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,740
I'm kind of surprised SUSE is at this stage right now,

320
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,660
but they kind of have a unique situation too.

321
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,500
And there is a part of me,

322
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,060
like it seems like if SUSE was huge,

323
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,200
like if it was a blowaway success,

324
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,060
these issues would have been long resolved.

325
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,260
Yeah, yeah, it is interesting

326
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,740
that we're kind of hitting them right now.

327
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,660
It speaks both to its success and to its relative size.

328
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,740
Yeah.

329
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,700
Now, speaking of foundations,

330
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,820
the Matrix Foundation has been formed,

331
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,620
along with Matrix 1.0.

332
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,940
Now, I know some of you may not be Matrix users right now.

333
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,500
Just as a quick reminder, it's an open source project

334
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,860
that creates an open source standard

335
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,200
for secure, decentralized, real-time communication.

336
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,860
And it's like Slack plus 10 all under the Apache license.

337
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,940
Yeah, I like to think of it as like a,

338
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,220
it is kind of, it is like a matrix or like a web mesh,

339
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,580
a signaling standard for the internet in the modern era.

340
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,420
Yeah, because you could use it

341
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,380
for so much more than just basic communications.

342
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,800
It's such a cool project.

343
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,180
And so that's why it's really exciting too

344
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,640
that they've just released version 1.0.

345
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,760
I remember talking to the team five years ago

346
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,140
when they just launched this thing

347
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,460
and they've finally now reached 1.0 and exited beta.

348
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,140
That's fantastic news.

349
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,540
It probably means if you haven't already tried Matrix

350
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,560
or some other stuff,

351
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,460
like you can get the Riot 1.0 app going

352
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,580
and try it out that way, maybe run a server yourself.

353
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,820
Now's a great time to try.

354
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,700
We've got some integrations even in the JB Telegram chat.

355
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,780
Yep, and the System76 Pop OS community is using it.

356
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,460
So when you want pop in there, you can chat with people.

357
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,660
I think this is really, this is great.

358
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,260
This is a huge milestone and-

359
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,180
I mean, it really does take a lot to get this far.

360
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,620
Five years is a long time to keep working

361
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,980
on the same project and calling it 1.0, right?

362
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,020
They're making it a big deal.

363
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,580
They're saying this is stable, self-consistent,

364
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,900
self-contained, ready for use.

365
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,940
That's big.

366
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,700
That means it's ready for the enterprise,

367
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,100
it's ready to compete with Slack and much, much more.

368
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,060
And then to combine it with the announcement

369
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,940
of the foundation, which we've known is coming,

370
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,640
it's been in the works for a long time,

371
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,200
but they're doing it in such a great way.

372
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,700
As of today, they've finalized the foundation,

373
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,340
as of like today, the day we're recording.

374
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,180
Everything's been finalized and all of the assets

375
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,300
for matrix.org have been transferred from New Vector,

376
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,260
which was the startup they formed in 2017 for the project,

377
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,100
for the core team.

378
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,480
They've transferred all of the assets

379
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,900
from that startup to the foundation.

380
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,740
Whoa.

381
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,580
Yeah.

382
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,400
Interesting.

383
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,240
They're going all in.

384
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,160
That is, yeah, that is a sign right at the start

385
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,100
that this is legit.

386
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,660
But they don't stop there.

387
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,900
You ready for this?

388
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,820
They've also created

389
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,620
guardians of the matrix.org foundation.

390
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,460
Amazing.

391
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,420
How about this?

392
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,100
The guardians are legal directors

393
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,700
of the nonprofit foundation

394
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,540
and are responsible for ensuring that the foundation,

395
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,780
and by extension, the spec core team keeps on mission

396
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,140
and neutrally protects the development of matrix.

397
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,340
And they've started the foundation

398
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,760
with five of these guardians,

399
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,020
two of which are the original founders of matrix,

400
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,420
and the other three are entirely independent,

401
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,700
which they say ensures the original matrix team

402
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,920
forms a minority,

403
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,000
which can be kept in check by the rest of the guardians.

404
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,140
Well, that's an interesting governance structure.

405
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,980
Yeah.

406
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,580
That's pretty humble,

407
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,440
to create something like this,

408
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,020
to birth something like this,

409
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,940
to have this be your passion for years,

410
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,460
and then to cede full control like that over.

411
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,200
It's like an anti-Zuckerberg, is that how it works?

412
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,380
It's exactly what something like matrix needs to have.

413
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,780
Like they've really honed in on the audience.

414
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,740
They've really got it figured out.

415
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,860
And this is the kind of long-term arrangements

416
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,940
that could make this thing like the glue

417
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,460
that we need it to be.

418
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,620
I find this to be really exciting.

419
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,700
I think this is a very important project.

420
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,500
And I can't wait to see like all the applications

421
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,980
like Riot and other ones built off of it

422
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,820
just get better and better.

423
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,340
Now that it's 1.0 and it's a stable API,

424
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,740
it's a self-contained project,

425
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,060
it's ready to be built off of.

426
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,020
Matrix.org, it is still a little bit difficult

427
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,420
to search for, but they have a great domain name.

428
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,460
Yeah, that's true.

429
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,300
Yeah, it is a lot of foundations these days.

430
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,740
Like we need like a foundation bingo game or something

431
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,420
because we've got a lot of foundations.

432
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,500
I thought, I don't know, I thought we'd have like

433
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,660
some meta foundations and people would work under those

434
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,620
like the Conservancy and whatnot, but nope, nope.

435
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,940
No, we're just gonna have all the foundations, I guess.

436
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,180
But congratulations to them, 1.0 is huge.

437
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,380
Okay, now I'm curious to know your take on this next one.

438
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,820
I'd like to know the Mumble Room's take on this too.

439
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,740
Firefox Premium, if it were to launch later this year.

440
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,140
Now we have very little details,

441
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,780
so we're gonna do a little guessing here.

442
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,180
Speculation, you know.

443
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,620
The CEO of Mozilla, Chris Beard, revealed the plans

444
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,580
in a conversation with a German media outlet,

445
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,340
T3N, through a stream.

446
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,700
It sounds like Mozilla will make a privacy

447
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,500
and security feature service available.

448
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,380
And one would probably be correct to assume

449
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,060
that it will include their VPN partner

450
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,460
amongst other things that they already have.

451
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,020
And in details that we got in an update,

452
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,020
there's a quote that reads,

453
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,520
"'We'll probably launch some new services first

454
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
"'and then we'll think carefully about which bottle

455
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,540
"'makes the most sense while ensuring the best user safety.

456
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,220
"'Firefox and MIDI security features and services

457
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,980
"'like enhanced tracking protection will still be free.'"

458
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,460
Beyond that, we've got little details.

459
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,620
So we don't really know where the line's gonna be.

460
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,980
But if you have Firefox Premium,

461
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,060
then what's Firefox non-premium, Firefox standard?

462
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,900
Substandard.

463
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,100
Firefox free, Firefox basic?

464
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,300
Maybe just Firefox.

465
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,820
I think that it's a possibility

466
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,980
that this is going to be just a weird branding

467
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,820
that they've been doing.

468
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,220
So they have Firefox Monitor and Firefox Sandwich

469
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,980
have nothing to do with Firefox itself.

470
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,680
And that this might be like premium service

471
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,260
in the sense of like, hopefully in the same kind of vein

472
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,020
that the Librem One stuff is.

473
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,260
That's what I was wondering.

474
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,260
And if Mozilla came around and kind of offered

475
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,160
the same suite of services that Librem One is offering,

476
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,580
I'd probably be more inclined to buy it from Mozilla.

477
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,680
What about you?

478
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,520
Oh yeah, absolutely.

479
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,740
If Mozilla was the one doing it,

480
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,300
that's when I first heard Librem One was announced,

481
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,220
I was like, I mean, that's a great idea,

482
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,300
but I'd be more comfortable if another organization

483
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,220
has have a bigger backing and has been around longer

484
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
to be doing it.

485
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,580
And one of the examples I gave was Mozilla.

486
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,140
Right, because they have a wider interest

487
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,740
in keeping the web open too.

488
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,580
Yeah, right.

489
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,780
I mean, they're already running services.

490
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,460
They've just been doing more of the password stuff, right?

491
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,860
So they have a long history of keeping user data.

492
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,700
I also wouldn't mind coming up with a way

493
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,780
to directly contribute to Mozilla.

494
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,860
So that was gonna be my answer.

495
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,900
If this was some sort of premium browser,

496
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,100
I might still pay for it,

497
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,460
probably not for any sort of features,

498
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,300
but just as a way to have an easy way to just like,

499
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,060
hey, Mozilla, here's some money, thank you.

500
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,940
I have over the years just bought like a t-shirt

501
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,900
or I'll buy like a, I bought a backpack,

502
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,860
which I've used for like a decade now.

503
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,700
Well, you got that.

504
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Yeah, yeah, it's time to replace that backpack too.

505
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,540
Like over the years, I've just bought Swag to support them.

506
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,500
And I encourage them looking for viable,

507
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,380
sustainable revenue models that get them off

508
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,100
the search engine bandwagon,

509
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,980
cause that's how they're making money right now.

510
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,460
And that's not a good idea long-term

511
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,500
for what they wanna do for the web

512
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,940
and for where they want their leverage,

513
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,540
they need to get off that sauce.

514
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,940
Brent, I can't remember if you're a Firefox or Chrome user,

515
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,060
but what would your thoughts be

516
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,780
on somebody who travels a lot,

517
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,900
if you got a VPN service and a couple other things,

518
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,980
would you pay for it?

519
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,260
And would you wanna go through somebody like Mozilla

520
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,020
or would you do like what I'm doing right now?

521
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,900
I have an air VPN subscription, for example,

522
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,580
that's my VPN provider, no affiliation or anything,

523
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,500
it's just who I use right now.

524
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,420
And I kind of trust them to do a better job at that.

525
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,940
I'm curious what your thoughts are.

526
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,140
I would say my first reaction to seeing this last night

527
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,740
was like, oh no, like the model for a browser

528
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,140
that I use every single day is changing

529
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,620
and what does that mean?

530
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,580
But now hearing a few of your perspectives,

531
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,260
I think that, wow, yeah,

532
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,900
we definitely should have an easier way to support Mozilla.

533
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,620
They're certainly a group of people

534
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,660
that I've really believed in for a decade now,

535
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,100
can you say that?

536
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,220
And so if they're coming out with some products like VPNs

537
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,700
and things like that,

538
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,820
I actually think I would be first to trust them

539
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,180
over even some dedicated VPN providers,

540
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,100
simply because they've built so much trust

541
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,300
around the internet and the open source community

542
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,340
in the last many, many years.

543
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,180
So I think it's a good thing.

544
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,300
If it goes that direction,

545
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,420
I mean, we're gonna have to wait for some details, right?

546
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,220
We know that the VPN is more than likely

547
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,260
going to be using the Proton VPN

548
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,100
because there was a partnership announcement

549
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,540
last year sometime,

550
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,940
where they were gonna be doing something with Proton.

551
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,300
Though, I mean, as far as trusting them,

552
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,020
if people trust Proton Mail, that's a good option.

553
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,860
Yeah, fair point.

554
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,700
It does seem like that.

555
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,180
That would be the most likely service provider that goes.

556
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,020
So that's a fair point.

557
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,020
I think looking at this whole thing in totality,

558
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,180
the thing in the back of my mind is,

559
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,020
I've had some questionable moments when I watch Mozilla

560
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,060
and some of the decisions they've made even like this year

561
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,900
or in the last year,

562
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,500
there's been some questionable moments for sure.

563
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,300
And you have to take everything in its totality.

564
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,100
However, I also like to judge people based on their work

565
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,620
and Firefox has been consistently getting better.

566
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,880
They really, truly made a focus.

567
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,580
And Mozilla as an organization

568
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,460
has been making the right moves for both user privacy

569
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,660
and for open web standards now.

570
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,460
And they really haven't deviated on that course.

571
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,580
And so I would actually say,

572
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,780
their trust level in my book

573
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,300
has gone up considerably over the last year.

574
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,140
Isn't that interesting?

575
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,980
Yeah, that is what it is.

576
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,460
We just feel good about them

577
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,140
because we've seen what they do

578
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,500
and believe that they have the right intentions behind them.

579
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,980
I wanna get Elle's perspective, last take on this.

580
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,820
Elle, would you pay like a monthly fee,

581
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,060
like 10 bucks a month,

582
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,300
if you got a Firefox VPN and some other services

583
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,460
and it goes towards Mozilla?

584
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,380
Is that something you'd be interested in actually doing?

585
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,940
I mean, I already pay for their VPN,

586
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,940
so can I just get rolled in?

587
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,060
You're ready to go.

588
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,900
I'm good.

589
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,940
I mean, you know, every time you guys are like,

590
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,220
oh, load up Chrome, I throw a fit.

591
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,620
So I'm already there.

592
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,460
Yeah, that's true.

593
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,900
That is a huge, good point, good point.

594
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,860
All right, very good.

595
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,720
Well, why don't you tell us a little bit

596
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,220
about something pretty amazing that happened recently

597
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
at a Hacker Family dinner.

598
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,940
And I think it's something

599
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,340
that the whole audience should hear about.

600
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,580
So this was an event held before B-Sides.

601
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,420
One thing I've gotten into doing is just kind of throwing

602
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,900
a B-Side event next to our large conference,

603
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,340
just to get to know people.

604
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,340
And so I had about 25 people show up

605
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,420
and, you know, we get down to the tables

606
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,020
and this is a family dinner.

607
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,860
People have drinks in their hands

608
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,060
before we even have the table.

609
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,540
Their appetizer's going, everything's great,

610
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,900
we're all talking.

611
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,140
And about an hour and a half in,

612
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,820
the guy next to me turns around and he's like,

613
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,380
hey, Elle, I've got to go.

614
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,100
I'm like, oh, you know, we're going to miss you, bye.

615
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,020
And then he comes back by the table and says,

616
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,420
just let everybody know that up to this point,

617
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,500
I went ahead and took care of the bill.

618
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,020
And it didn't register in my brain.

619
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,460
Like, I thought he was telling me,

620
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,980
hey, I already paid for my food, bye.

621
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,420
And so I was like, okay, have a,

622
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,140
and I didn't even finish the sentence

623
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,820
by the time the guy is gone.

624
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,020
So yeah, it took me a minute and I'm, wait,

625
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,360
I look over at Allie and I said,

626
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,060
did he just say he paid for the meal?

627
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,000
She's like, no, no, he must've meant his.

628
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,820
So I went over to look for the waitress

629
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,820
and she's like, no, he covered the bill.

630
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,520
And I was like, for everyone?

631
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,600
Yes.

632
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,340
All the drinks, appetizers, everything?

633
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,100
And she's looking at me like, are you daft?

634
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,440
Yes.

635
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,940
There were two tables worth of people

636
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,420
and he was out the door before we could even acknowledge it.

637
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,700
I tried to find out how much the bill was

638
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,380
and another waiter was like, no, it was his gift.

639
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,940
And just kind of like cut me off there.

640
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,320
So a very, very special thank you to,

641
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,220
and I'm just gonna call him by his Twitter handles

642
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,900
not to out him for privacy at Jedi Mammoth

643
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,300
for that great gift.

644
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,140
That's so great.

645
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,980
Amazing.

646
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,540
The best community in the world.

647
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,140
And a classy move.

648
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,340
Yeah, that is a really classy move.

649
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,180
And that's another thing,

650
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,800
we've been doing these study groups

651
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,080
which are posted on the Meetup,

652
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,260
but also if we're at an event and like Elle's dinner,

653
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,540
for example, that was on the Meetup page,

654
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,860
meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

655
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,740
Thank you to Jedi Mammoth for doing that.

656
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,580
That's super cool.

657
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,720
He's a interesting individual himself.

658
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,620
I'll put a link to his Twitter profile.

659
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,740
He's, we have the coolest community.

660
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,580
We really do.

661
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,100
He's a very interesting guy.

662
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,380
And I'll put his Twitter profile in there.

663
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,380
Well, that's really great, Elle.

664
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,180
How was all of B-Sides and all of that?

665
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,060
Was that a good event?

666
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,460
It was a lot of fun.

667
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,180
This is the one conference that I really try to stay away

668
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,660
from volunteering so I can just enjoy it.

669
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,060
And every single year I'm trying to figure out

670
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,700
how they make it happen for as little as they pay,

671
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,400
or as they charge for the tickets.

672
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,960
Hmm.

673
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,040
Yeah, and B-Sides, okay, so for those people

674
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,880
that are not familiar,

675
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,640
because it's kind of not fully well-known yet,

676
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,960
B-Sides is happening all of the time,

677
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,040
and it grew out of a larger, more well-known

678
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,400
and more established conference.

679
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,320
So B-Sides grew out of Black Hat.

680
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,720
When Black Hat was going on,

681
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,560
there was only so many talks they could establish

682
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,040
or they could host.

683
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,640
And there was a little bit of arguments

684
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,300
to really how they should pick these talks.

685
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,880
And so a great guy by the name of Chris Nickerson

686
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,600
and a few others, I could miss them all by name,

687
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,280
but of course, because I'm talking, I've forgotten them all,

688
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,920
decided, you know what, we'll rent a mansion.

689
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,320
And in every room, we're gonna have a talk.

690
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,040
And just invited all of the conference speakers

691
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,680
that didn't get accepted to come and give their talks.

692
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,360
And it's just continued to grow.

693
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,400
And last I counted was I think 52

694
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,320
with B-Sides Cairo being the latest one.

695
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,280
And the name comes from running B-Side, a major conference,

696
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,040
or the major conference being the A-side of the record.

697
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,020
The B-side of the record, yeah.

698
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,160
So you're saying, how many are this year?

699
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,360
I think it was 52.

700
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,200
Now I wish I would have looked it up before I got here,

701
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,320
but it's huge.

702
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,080
That is.

703
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,200
It's really neat because it's a good example

704
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,240
of a grassroots community conference.

705
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,240
And the name B-Sides is so good

706
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
because it is beside another conference

707
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
or it is the B-side of a record.

708
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,920
I love it.

709
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,160
All right, well, we have some things to talk about

710
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,500
in the housekeeping.

711
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,160
First of all, you may have noticed

712
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,240
that the AWS DevOps Professional Certification Exam

713
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,800
has just been updated as they often are.

714
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,680
Well, the good folks over at Linux Academy

715
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,880
have got your back, check it all out.

716
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm gonna put a link in the show notes

717
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,520
for a lab and some information about the AWS Developer Suite.

718
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,360
This is a big area right now.

719
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,480
AWS, I'll tell you what, changing like crazy.

720
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Yeah, you gotta stay up to date.

721
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,320
And it's easier this way, let me tell you.

722
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,840
Exactly, so I'll have a link to that.

723
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,180
If you haven't heard BSD Now for a while.

724
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,400
It's hot and fresh.

725
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,680
Hot and fresh.

726
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,640
You know what?

727
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,480
You know what?

728
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,360
This calls for a special moment, don't you think?

729
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,340
You ready for a classic?

730
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,480
You ready for a classic?

731
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,380
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show

732
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,840
that's too busy getting actual work done

733
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,080
to care about what your silly display server.

734
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,040
My name is Alan.

735
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,860
Still hurts.

736
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,700
Yep, but you probably want more Alan Jude, we all do.

737
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,040
Yeah, BSD Now has been refreshed.

738
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,800
Starting with 301, we are recording in a brand new format,

739
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,480
high fidelity audio, and Mr. Drew is editing each show

740
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,440
so we try to fix up as much crosstalk and things like that.

741
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,600
The show is tighter and better than ever.

742
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,480
300 too, congratulations to them.

743
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,520
So go check out BSD Now, I'll have a link to 301,

744
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,200
bsdnow.tv slash 301.

745
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,720
Also, Foss Talk Live happened.

746
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,040
Man, that looked like so much fun, I was jealous.

747
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,760
Yeah, so that's an event that happens across the pond

748
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,840
that we've never really been to,

749
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,880
but it's a night of podcasting, of Linux podcasting.

750
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,840
Live!

751
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,480
And our friends at the Ubuntu Podcast participate

752
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,280
and Late Night Linux and others are all participating

753
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,400
in what is basically just a great night

754
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,520
of Linux podcast geekiness in a nice,

755
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,360
really kind of intimate venue.

756
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,080
It seems like you can find beers there too.

757
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,720
Yeah, rumor has it.

758
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,000
And I believe the first episode from there,

759
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,360
Late Night Linux, is out, and I bet you our friends

760
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,920
over at Ubuntu Podcast have something too.

761
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,920
So check out a link for that or go to Late Night Linux.

762
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,800
Speaking of podcasts, the best 17 seconds

763
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,320
from Texas Linux Fest did indeed make it

764
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,240
into the Friday stream, fridaystream.com, fridaystream.com.

765
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,720
I really, really enjoyed this last episode.

766
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,320
Make sure you stick around for the post-show

767
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,800
because we did a live version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire

768
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,760
where it was Elle versus Allie and we gave away a game

769
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,560
to a live stream audience member.

770
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,400
That was fun.

771
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,640
Woo, exciting stuff.

772
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,760
That really was fun.

773
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,120
That was great.

774
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,960
I mean, if you wanna see stuff like that too,

775
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,640
you can watch it all live on the actual Friday.

776
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,600
That's true, you could.

777
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,400
Yeah, 1 p.m. over at jblive.tv

778
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,840
or jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar

779
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,720
to get it converted to your local time zone.

780
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,400
Now, we do have some other details

781
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,840
on the meetup page about upcoming events.

782
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,720
We just finished up the Linux Permissions Basic study group.

783
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,840
Yeah, oh, that was good.

784
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,600
Like, I think we're gonna, I'm not quite sure

785
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,800
how we're gonna actually deliver it

786
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,200
because we may split it up into multiples, we're thinking,

787
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
but we'll soon have an update on that,

788
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,800
but we just did another study group

789
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,920
where we had a fantastic presenter,

790
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,880
Alex from Rackspace, sat down

791
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,320
and went through the basics of Linux permissions,

792
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,160
but then some of the more advanced things

793
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,520
that I think most Linux users have sort of glossed over

794
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,400
that are so crazy powerful.

795
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,880
So that information will be out soon,

796
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,040
but if you wanna attend those kinds of things live,

797
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,960
meetup.com slash jupitabroadcasting is where you go for that.

798
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,960
Also, it's cheesy.

799
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,920
We should tell people about the Telegram sticker pack.

800
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,440
Oh yeah, it's got all of,

801
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,320
well, it's the first six stickers

802
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,960
that we've released in the pack.

803
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,600
It's pack one, there are more to come,

804
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
but we do have some of your favorites in there,

805
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,000
like get it out of here, patch your shit,

806
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,720
negative in the freedom dimension.

807
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,160
I encourage everyone to go there.

808
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,400
If you're on Telegram, go ahead and pick them up.

809
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,480
There'll be a link in the show notes.

810
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,760
If you're not on Telegram, then you should be,

811
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,960
and just go on over to the site

812
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,440
and click on the little Telegram icon

813
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,080
at the top of the site, and you'll be prompted to join.

814
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,200
Now, Al, this is your moment.

815
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,480
Now, was there anything else,

816
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,720
any meetups we should mention,

817
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,240
or any other things that you wanna plug

818
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,560
before we wrap up the housekeeping?

819
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,840
So the next meetup is going to be understanding burnout,

820
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,960
and I think this is a really important topic

821
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,800
that we're not discussing in the community

822
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,240
is kind of mental health, so please join us.

823
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,080
That's a good one.

824
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,320
Okay, yeah, the burnout one's good.

825
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,160
It's important.

826
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Yeah, it is, it is.

827
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,440
So meetup.com, you know where that's gonna go.

828
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,520
Go there, why do I have to keep telling you?

829
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,040
Jeez, just go do it, gosh.

830
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, gosh.

831
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,960
Okay, I think we got pretty trolled this week.

832
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,360
I don't actually know, I don't know if this was a long con

833
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,760
or if our team has peaked,

834
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,200
and it's time for us to all go home.

835
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,120
I guess maybe we should survey.

836
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,680
I'm curious how far everyone got.

837
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,200
Yeah, I am too.

838
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,760
So this was a suggestion that came in by SW listener.

839
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,800
He wrote to us at Chris and at Wes Payne,

840
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,480
how about you take a look at the Tinfoil Hat Brigade,

841
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,160
take a look at resilientlinux.com.

842
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,760
So we went over to resilientlinux.com,

843
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,040
which looks like it might be ripping off

844
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,760
the elementary OS background,

845
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,520
and we read around and saw what we liked,

846
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,320
a resilient Debian GNU slash Linux derivative

847
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,800
for indestructible installations for desktops

848
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,720
and servers that are 64-bit.

849
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,520
Ooh, yeah, a persistent partition that contains only diffs

850
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,560
from the stock installation, things like that.

851
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,400
Yeah, and based on Debian Stretch

852
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,840
with a unique partitioning scheme

853
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,680
crafted for maximizing the strength

854
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,600
against file system corruption,

855
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,600
as well as persistence, and a friendly installer.

856
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,120
So you end up with a nice, clean-looking Linux desktop.

857
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,120
You write to a USB, you boot off that,

858
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,600
and they write, in less than a minute,

859
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,840
the installer will easily install Resilient Linux

860
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,720
onto your PC hard drive.

861
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,840
You could optionally set a password for encrypting

862
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,520
the persistence partition, and then you can test

863
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,720
and use it in a virtualized environment as well.

864
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,800
So this is pretty nice.

865
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,760
It has a lot of potential.

866
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,200
It looks like it's a passion project of two individuals.

867
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,040
So we're not gonna try to bash on or anything,

868
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,600
but I'm not actually sure if it's actually meant to be run.

869
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,520
I will start with the honesty.

870
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,920
I couldn't get it to boot.

871
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,160
In fact, I can't remember the last time

872
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,680
I have come on this podcast, or on any of my podcasts,

873
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,560
and said, I can't get this Linux distro to boot.

874
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,040
I don't know if I've ever, if that's ever been my...

875
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,440
I mean, you remember to press F12, right?

876
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,440
Yeah, I could not get it, I could get to grub.

877
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,880
I could get past grub, but from there,

878
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,360
I just got various versions of fail.

879
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,520
What about yourself, Futchese?

880
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,800
Were you able to get this to boot, Resilient Linux?

881
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,240
Yeah, I was able to get it to boot.

882
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,200
Did you get to a desktop?

883
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,040
I did.

884
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,360
Actually, I'm running it right now.

885
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,200
You're shitting me.

886
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,480
Okay, Elle, did you get it to boot?

887
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,240
No, I don't believe him.

888
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,520
No, Wes, did you get it to boot?

889
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,960
No, not quite, I kept running into issues

890
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,800
in the init room, I guess.

891
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,520
I know, Wes wanted to be the one to get it to work, too.

892
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,360
Like, he was on a mission.

893
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,200
No, there's a couple things to try,

894
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,320
but just like in a virtual machine,

895
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,360
and I tried, yeah, I tried writing it to a USB stick.

896
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,680
I tried it on my T480, raw dog off a USB thumb drive.

897
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,320
I tried it in a KVM virtual machine.

898
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,560
I couldn't get it to boot in either places.

899
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,880
Wow, guys.

900
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,040
All right, so Elle, how far did you manage to get it?

901
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,240
Did you get to grub, at least?

902
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,160
I don't know, I got to grub,

903
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,400
but then I started cyberstalking the person,

904
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,880
because I thought this was a joke.

905
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,840
So I even got into their GitHub

906
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,080
and was looking at the code going, wait a minute.

907
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,440
Yeah, I thought maybe we were getting punked.

908
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
Like, I thought, this isn't actually meant to boot,

909
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,680
because, see, the reason why I didn't think Cheese

910
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,280
had ever got it booted, because he sent me pictures,

911
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,360
and when it first booted up, it put everything upside down.

912
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,040
And so his whole screen was upside down.

913
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,560
I thought, well, he must've given up.

914
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,320
So, Cheese, did you get past the upside down screen stuff?

915
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,120
Yeah, yeah, I did.

916
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,280
It should be said, too,

917
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,760
that whenever you go to download this image,

918
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,720
it's a zip file, there's no checksum there,

919
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
which would be nice to see if you're gonna do this.

920
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,960
It's an image file, too, not an ISO file.

921
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,040
I got it to boot.

922
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,320
It did take some finessing to get it to work.

923
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,880
Running it on, I think it's a Dell Inspiron 3000,

924
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,200
like two-in-one inexpensive old Windows laptop.

925
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,400
And one of the problems that most GNOME-based distributions

926
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,160
have on this particular laptop

927
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,680
is that the IIO sensor proxy,

928
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,320
which is basically the accelerometer,

929
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,760
so whenever you flip it over into tablet mode or whatever,

930
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,240
it'll rotate the screen.

931
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,200
Well, by default, it rotates the screen.

932
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,440
By default, so your screen's rotated by default,

933
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,480
out of the box. Out of the box.

934
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,520
Because obviously that's gonna be a super common use case

935
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,160
for all those GNOME Shell tablets out there.

936
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,280
And what's super weird is if I reboot the machine

937
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,800
right after, then it'll reboot right side up.

938
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,800
So there's some commands you can run

939
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,280
and you can remove the IIO sensor proxy package

940
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,600
and stuff like that so that you don't have those issues.

941
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,440
All right, hold there.

942
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,600
Now, I'm curious to know, once you got things,

943
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,720
that's funny, could you imagine him doing that?

944
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,440
Once you got things right side up,

945
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,560
I wanna hear how it went.

946
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,200
But I know, Brent, you also tried to give it a go.

947
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,320
How far did you get with Resilient Linux?

948
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,360
So while I was downloading, I got super interested

949
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,720
in all of it, and I read up on some of the founders

950
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,880
and stuff and got super jazzed.

951
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,520
And then, same as you, I tried it in a VM with nothing.

952
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,920
And then I was like, okay, I got this brand new,

953
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,720
well, brand new, I got this new-to-me X240

954
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,040
and I'm just gonna do it on bare metal.

955
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,600
And I got the same as Wes, this initramfs.

956
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,680
I couldn't get past it and I thought,

957
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,040
I think I know what I'm doing for the most part.

958
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,280
Like, I can't remember the last time I couldn't get,

959
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,960
I think it was like Crunch Bang was the last time

960
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,400
I couldn't get something running.

961
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,960
And I just couldn't get past it

962
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,440
and I wasn't motivated enough.

963
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,760
Once I read into, I started getting confused.

964
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,320
I think L just linked a page that was an installer as well

965
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,760
that was a dev installer.

966
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,600
And I was like, I love the sounds of this project,

967
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,240
but I'm just not that motivated.

968
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,080
It is a little confusing.

969
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,160
Like, if you go over to the GitHub page,

970
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,520
there's a release, oh, four days ago, actually.

971
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,840
That one has an ISO file.

972
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,280
And then, yes, they also have this dev

973
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,520
that is a Python package that will install on a USB stick.

974
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,080
So probably they're still working out

975
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,480
some of the fundamentals.

976
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,080
Because you'll note some of the previous work,

977
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,000
stuff like LiveEng, they've put a lot of time and thought

978
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
into rethinking some of how live environment works.

979
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,760
That probably affects the image we're trying to put.

980
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,080
Right.

981
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,520
Yeah, I just kept getting dropped down to a busy box.

982
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,120
So Cheesy, once you got the desktop going,

983
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,760
what's the takeaway experience like?

984
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,400
I mean, it's not bad.

985
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,200
It's pretty standard GNOME.

986
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,080
So all the apps that you would expect

987
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:00,800
are there, Chromium, Firefox even.

988
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,880
I think it's Nautilus as the file manager, Rhythmbox,

989
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,160
and so on and so forth.

990
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
One thing that I did find kind of interesting

991
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,640
is that on the applications page panel, wing, whatever

992
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,880
it's called in GNOME, there is a software icon.

993
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,560
It says software dot dot dot.

994
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,960
Once you click on it, it actually

995
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,480
brings you to the software sources

996
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,880
and not to the software store.

997
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,040
So the software store is found under utilities.

998
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,120
I think that's just something they just maybe didn't look

999
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,320
over whenever they were pushing this out.

1000
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,720
But all in all, it's really not bad.

1001
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,760
I mean, it's snappy.

1002
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,720
I like the fact that it boots relatively quickly.

1003
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,120
The three applications in the drawer,

1004
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,920
the panel at the bottom, terminal, text editor,

1005
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,160
Firefox, I love that.

1006
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,400
The installation of Inkscape was super painless.

1007
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,520
I'm kind of playing around in Inkscape with it right now.

1008
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,200
It does support the touch screen that

1009
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,360
is built in to this 2-in-1.

1010
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,280
So I can move objects around in Inkscape or whatever just fine.

1011
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,280
It might not be the snappiest, but it's definitely not bad.

1012
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,560
If you're on one of these 2-in-1s like me

1013
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,120
and have that problem, once you remove that sensor proxy

1014
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,880
package, it seems to work all right.

1015
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,640
Well, I'll tell you what I like about this.

1016
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,440
I like what they're trying to do.

1017
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,080
We've talked a lot about an indestructible Linux before.

1018
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
I think it's a good idea.

1019
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,320
Something that has this persistent partition that

1020
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,680
only contains the diffs from the stock installation

1021
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,800
is a solid idea.

1022
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,760
I like where the project's going with this.

1023
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,040
Now, Brent, what do you think from a perspective of somebody

1024
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,920
who just tried to give it a go?

1025
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,960
When you delve into the project, does anything

1026
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,600
alarm you?

1027
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,760
Is there anything people should take away from this

1028
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,920
before they try it?

1029
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,760
Things like that?

1030
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,240
I would say that I love the direction of where

1031
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,120
all of the writing went that I read.

1032
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,120
The thing that really stood out to me

1033
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:16,560
was right on the front page, it says,

1034
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,680
resilient Debian Linux derivative

1035
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,400
for indestructible installations.

1036
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,640
And that's the first time I come across that term.

1037
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,280
That just, to an endlessly curious being like me,

1038
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,960
that just felt like a taunt.

1039
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,400
And I thought, ah, this is great.

1040
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,440
I'm going to install this.

1041
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,280
And I want to dive in more and figure out what it's all about.

1042
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,360
So I was a little disappointed that I never got as far as

1043
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,840
cheese.

1044
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,600
I'm glad he did.

1045
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,160
Same.

1046
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,400
He's going to have to school us a little bit, maybe.

1047
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,400
But I think really what I took away

1048
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,200
was that I'd love to keep an eye on this

1049
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,160
and just maybe, in a month from now,

1050
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,680
to come out with a little bit more maybe support

1051
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,160
around all this so that we can get some checksums

1052
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,880
and get this running.

1053
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,800
Something that's a little more mature, maybe.

1054
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,240
That's it.

1055
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,040
Exactly.

1056
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,960
I would be totally up for trying it again, for sure.

1057
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,320
Brandon, the issue is just you weren't resilient enough.

1058
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:07,820
Oh.

1059
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,320
Oh.

1060
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,000
I knew these were coming.

1061
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,120
It was destructible for me.

1062
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:13,720
Yeah.

1063
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,280
I think it's sort of in the same camp

1064
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,280
that right now I put Clear Linux and Silverblue in now.

1065
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,080
It's like, I'm watching these because this

1066
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,600
might be a new way I do my desktop or at least a work

1067
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,280
station in the future.

1068
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,640
It's like, I'm watching you now.

1069
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,000
That's not the great part about open source stuff.

1070
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,200
We don't have to use it.

1071
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,800
We don't have to rely on it.

1072
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,560
We have plenty of options for great real world

1073
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,280
everyday installs.

1074
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,880
And then these can be research projects

1075
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,480
that might eventually make it into the tech we use every day.

1076
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,040
It's also neat to see another Debian-based distro.

1077
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,240
I just love that.

1078
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,200
A lot of times you see them based off of Ubuntu

1079
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,480
these days, which is fine.

1080
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,840
But it's cool to see those that are still based off of it.

1081
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,000
They went all the way up.

1082
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,840
Yeah, that's right.

1083
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,560
So you can check it out if you want to give it a go

1084
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,800
and tell us what we did wrong, resilientlinux.com.

1085
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,600
If you do get it going, let us know.

1086
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,560
Because apparently we weren't that successful.

1087
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,720
And maybe try to break it.

1088
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,800
Yeah, see if it is unbreakable.

1089
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,600
All right, there you go, resilientlinux.com.

1090
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,880
It looks like a good initiative.

1091
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,720
Although I think they got to work

1092
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,400
on that art at the top of the old website there.

1093
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,240
That's my take on it.

1094
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,400
That's what happens.

1095
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
You tweet us, see if we'll give us a challenge

1096
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,520
to see if we can get something working.

1097
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,600
And we gave it a go.

1098
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,760
The whole team gave it a go.

1099
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,400
No guarantees.

1100
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,320
That's our new little ad online.

1101
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,200
Oh, I also want to mention, we're

1102
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,360
going to get to the pics now.

1103
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,760
So just a little bonus information

1104
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,660
before we get to the pics.

1105
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,960
Because I didn't know when we were talking

1106
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
about the B-Sides stuff.

1107
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,640
But Elle wrote up a hell of a post.

1108
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,240
We call them articles on B-Sides 2019.

1109
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,080
We'll have a link in the show notes for that.

1110
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,720
Some pictures, if you want to know a little bit more

1111
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,400
about what B-Sides is about and sort

1112
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,600
of that organic community stuff, check it out.

1113
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,680
We'll have a link in the show notes for that.

1114
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,080
Now let's get to the pics.

1115
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,560
Mr. Payne, I have something I don't think

1116
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,600
I tried to keep from you.

1117
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,040
You may have seen it if you've been really watching my links.

1118
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,400
I won't talk about Chobb.

1119
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,240
Have you heard Chobb?

1120
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,740
No.

1121
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,720
Chobb.

1122
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,600
Anybody have a guess of what Chobb is?

1123
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,440
Anybody want to guess?

1124
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,680
It sounds like Trute almost.

1125
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does.

1126
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,760
It does, doesn't it?

1127
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,640
No?

1128
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,760
You guys have no idea.

1129
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,320
I've stumped you, haven't I?

1130
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,640
Don't Google it.

1131
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,280
Don't Google it.

1132
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
That's cheating now.

1133
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,880
Yeah, just use dot dot go.

1134
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,600
Yeah, OK.

1135
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,080
You have maybe a 50-50 shot there.

1136
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,560
All right, are you Googling it?

1137
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,080
Is it Chobb?

1138
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,320
Chobb.

1139
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,720
I'm saying Chobb, like cob, like C-H-O-B.

1140
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,200
Like brats, B for brats.

1141
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,960
Yeah, like B for brats.

1142
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,200
All right, anybody have a guess?

1143
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,080
Anybody?

1144
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,080
I'm going to guess on this one.

1145
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,080
All right, go ahead, Brett.

1146
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,480
I think O-B just sounds like obvious to me.

1147
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
So I don't know if Chobb admitted to obvious.

1148
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,680
Is it a link de-mystifier?

1149
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,760
Oh, that's a good guess.

1150
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,400
I can see that.

1151
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:39,880
Good guess.

1152
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,120
No, it is not a link de-mystifier, though.

1153
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,400
Does it do something to change object files, output

1154
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,480
from a compiler, maybe?

1155
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,200
Oh, Wes, you've been doing too much code on radio.

1156
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,880
No, it is not changing object files in a compiler.

1157
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,240
Why did I make that a pick?

1158
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,560
I thought maybe it was listening.

1159
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,520
I don't know.

1160
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,720
All right, anybody else have a guess before I reveal one?

1161
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,800
This is a lot of fun.

1162
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,040
I'm really enjoying this.

1163
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,160
I cheated, and there is no way I would have figured it out,

1164
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,040
just by guessing.

1165
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,600
Fair enough.

1166
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,080
Fair enough.

1167
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,160
All right, all right, all right, fair enough.

1168
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,080
All right, here we go.

1169
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,280
Get it out of here.

1170
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,800
Chob, C-H-O-B, is a nice little helper tool

1171
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,040
that you can run on the command line that

1172
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,600
will search across Flathub, SnapCraft, and app

1173
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,960
images for an application, and then present you a menu,

1174
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,760
and then proceed to install whichever one you prefer.

1175
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,760
So if you are sick and tired of figuring out,

1176
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,440
jeez, is there an app image, or a SnapCraft, or a FlatPak

1177
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,180
for this particular thing, you use Chob,

1178
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,920
and it will give you all of the results.

1179
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,960
So an example that they have on their GitHub page,

1180
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,320
and it works great, is Chob.

1181
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,780
You could type in the Chob command

1182
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,840
once you have installed, I just love the name, Chob code,

1183
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,640
and then it'll give you all of the results

1184
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,720
across SnapCraft developers, app image developers,

1185
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,440
and FlatPak.

1186
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,400
Unfortunately, if you try to use it to search for itself,

1187
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,320
it's not listed.

1188
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,600
Meta, dude, meta.

1189
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,400
And then you just pick which one you want,

1190
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,840
and you're off to the races.

1191
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,360
So now you have a universal search

1192
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,360
for all of those universal packages.

1193
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,800
It's a meta universe.

1194
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,600
Yeah, it's kind of nice, and you can just grab it as a binary

1195
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,680
and run it directly, or there is a deb as well.

1196
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,920
And I think, I would bet, there's probably

1197
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,120
other ways to install it.

1198
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,280
I think it's using Node.

1199
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,360
It would be nice if it had a little bit more version

1200
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,000
information.

1201
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,640
It would also be neat if it could hook into your distros

1202
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,440
package manager, maybe compare and show,

1203
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,440
here's the different versions you can get,

1204
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,640
here's what you have natively.

1205
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,400
That would be next level cool, right?

1206
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,200
So then you can make an educated decision.

1207
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,080
Should I go with the one that's in the repo,

1208
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,080
or should I go with the one that's in FlatPak?

1209
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,200
There's downsides, upsides, lots to consider.

1210
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,000
Yeah, I don't think so.

1211
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,320
They do have just a binary you can run, download it,

1212
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,280
Jamad plus X, and you're set.

1213
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,080
They also have a deb file, it looks like.

1214
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,840
How did I come across this?

1215
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,240
I think I was trolling blogs and Twitter feeds.

1216
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,600
I found it on Reddit just now.

1217
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,140
It was posted a month ago, and I saw it,

1218
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,800
and it completely ignored it because it said Chobb.

1219
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,200
I think I saw it just recently, because I tagged it

1220
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,660
in the last seven days, so I must have just seen it recently.

1221
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:09,560
I can't remember.

1222
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,760
I can't remember where it was.

1223
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,000
But I follow a lot of the different Snap developers

1224
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,160
and AppImage guy and the FlatPak developers,

1225
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,800
and I've been doing a lot of digging

1226
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,280
around for my Fedora machines.

1227
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,800
So I think maybe I found it when I was looking for FlatPaks,

1228
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,360
but I can't remember.

1229
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,600
I tagged it forever ago, which in my world

1230
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,840
is more than three days.

1231
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,400
And don't worry, it is based on JavaScript.

1232
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,920
Well, OK, it's TypeScript, but I'm

1233
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,720
pretty sure it bundles Node in there for you.

1234
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,720
Phew.

1235
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,400
Oh, good.

1236
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:37,960
Oh, good.

1237
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,160
All right, well, there we go.

1238
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,640
Um, there's your pic of the week.

1239
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,160
There you go.

1240
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,080
Kind of love Mario.

1241
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,000
I just love it.

1242
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,200
I just love it, you know?

1243
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,960
It just makes you happy.

1244
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,560
All these years later, still love it.

1245
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,400
Still good.

1246
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,280
Still really good.

1247
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,880
Stay a while and listen.

1248
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,040
Now, if you love these shows, I want to remind you

1249
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,240
that we are part of Linux Academy.

1250
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,920
You should go check out linuxacademy.com,

1251
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,540
and you can tweet them, linuxacademy.com,

1252
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,120
and tell them how much you appreciate

1253
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,160
them here for making these here shows,

1254
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,520
because we appreciate them doing that for us.

1255
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,240
We sure do.

1256
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,840
linuxacademy.com on the Twitter.

1257
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,720
Send them some love.

1258
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,480
Let them know you appreciate them making these shows

1259
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,120
sponsor-free for the community.

1260
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,400
Yeah, we're not here just selling you some crazy.

1261
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,560
They didn't ask me to say that.

1262
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,720
I just was thinking about it this morning.

1263
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,200
I was having an argument in the chat room.

1264
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,360
And I had a realization, like, it's a huge deal.

1265
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,280
We've dropped all ads.

1266
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,840
Like, that's really great.

1267
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,520
So great for me.

1268
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,200
I was thinking the same.

1269
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,880
I was listening, and the local NPR station

1270
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,840
was doing a pledge drive.

1271
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,480
Well, we also don't do that, right?

1272
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,720
We could if you want, but we're not going to.

1273
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,760
Feels good, though.

1274
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,720
I know, it's been nice.

1275
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,240
I think we should send them some love.

1276
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,400
There's a lot of gratitude going around for that.

1277
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,520
linuxacademy.com on Twitter.

1278
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,840
Let them know.

1279
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,480
And also, the community edition, by the way, free.

1280
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,280
Oh, with video.

1281
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,440
That's right.

1282
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:49,960
That's right.

1283
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,640
And mobile apps now, too.

1284
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,760
It's getting better and better all the time.

1285
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,680
Now, we do this show here on Tuesdays over jblive.tv.

1286
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,160
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

1287
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,240
is where you can go to get that converted to your local time.

1288
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,280
That Mumble Room is open to the community.

1289
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,000
We'd love to have you come and share your opinions.

1290
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,360
That's our virtual lug.

1291
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,400
Not everybody can get to a lug in their neck of the woods,

1292
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,560
so come be part of ours.

1293
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,480
We'd love to have you.

1294
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,280
Thanks so much for joining us, and we'll see you right back

1295
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,600
here next Tuesday.

1296
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:40,480
OK, bye-bye.

1297
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:57,280
This story didn't really kind of fit the theme of the show this week, so I didn't include

1298
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,760
it in the show, but I kind of wanted to save it just to talk about it with you guys.

1299
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,480
Because it makes me feel like people that never update their machines have got it right

1300
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,480
all along.

1301
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,480
Oh no.

1302
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,480
Oh no.

1303
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,480
I know.

1304
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,460
I know, because I'm always like arguing against those people, but I think they have it right.

1305
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:16,520
Only 5.5% of all vulnerabilities are ever exploited in the wild.

1306
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,320
According to, well, at least ZDNet.

1307
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,080
Most vulnerabilities that are exploited in the wild also have a CVSS severity of 9 or

1308
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,080
10.

1309
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,400
New research published this week has shed some much needed light onto the world of vulnerability

1310
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,600
exploitation, revealing how many of the total number of security flaws discovered in the

1311
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:39,240
past 10 years were actually ever exploited in the wild.

1312
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,760
Turns out not much.

1313
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,720
Not much.

1314
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,440
Only 4,183 security flaws from the total of 76,000 vulnerabilities discovered between

1315
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,560
2009 and 2018 had actually been exploited in the wild.

1316
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,520
I mean, this is interesting, but I feel like this is a statistics problem sort of thing

1317
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,480
in that like, shouldn't we have some weights here and really understanding that, okay,

1318
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,720
the ones that are rated highest are the ones that are probably remotely exploitable or

1319
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,240
on services that are of that nature.

1320
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,800
And then a lot of the ones that don't get exploited, yeah, they're not going to get

1321
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,160
exploited all over the place, but they are bad.

1322
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,640
They might be a secondary link or an island hopping sort of event when they got local

1323
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,200
access and suddenly they have root access.

1324
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:23,400
Also, there is, I mean, they go on and on and on in this article, which we'll have

1325
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,800
linked in the show notes about how great their data is and how they've collected this research

1326
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,400
and from a multitude of different sources, et cetera, et cetera.

1327
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,920
Ain't nobody reporting breaks into their systems unless they have to.

1328
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,920
Like ain't nobody.

1329
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,920
Right?

1330
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,000
So if you have a breach and you can get away without telling anybody about it, you're not

1331
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,720
like, you're not writing a press release, you're not submitted to a database.

1332
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,440
So like, I don't know.

1333
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,440
Auditors have to ask first.

1334
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,440
Right?

1335
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,440
Yeah.

1336
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,040
Like you have to be in an industry that is forced to disclose, which is some industries,

1337
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,760
but not all industries.

1338
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,640
That's why we don't take personal data here at Jupiter Broadcasting.

1339
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,640
That's right.

1340
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,140
We are GDPR compliant.

1341
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,140
That is for sure.

1342
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:07,120
The thing is, not patching your machine is an attitude, bad attitude or the bad routine.

1343
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,200
And someday it will lead into problems.

1344
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,480
So it's never, never a good thing.

1345
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,480
But apparently if you're playing the odds, it might be, you know, you might be all right.

1346
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,480
I don't know.

1347
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,480
I mean, we should do it for science.

1348
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,480
Let's find out.

1349
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,280
Someone said she had that during their security job interview is how do you handle security?

1350
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,280
I just play the odds.

1351
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,280
Yeah.

1352
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,280
I don't bother.

1353
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,280
Hey, that's what Sony did.

1354
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,440
They just put their machine out on the internet and not patch it.

1355
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,040
Actually, somebody has done that before, right?

1356
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,320
I just install all the software no one uses.

1357
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,360
How do you handle your security?

1358
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,400
And they'll just respond, obscurity.

1359
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,400
Problem solved.

1360
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,840
Just add one to every port.

1361
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,560
Well, and I didn't just make a Telegram sticker that says don't patch your shit.

1362
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:53,720
So you know, I think we need to, is there, do we have a brats, brats to the front of

1363
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,720
the line sticker?

1364
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,720
We don't yet, but it's on the list.

1365
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:01,280
You know, I've already got the middle image in my head.

1366
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,680
What about resilience is futile?

1367
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,240
That's kind of cute.

1368
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,880
That's kind of, that's kind of cute.

1369
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,800
Guardians of the matrix.org.

1370
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,960
I was looking at this thing not booting and I said to myself, I said, all right, you're

1371
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,040
either going to take this all the way to the end and not stop until you get it booting

1372
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,600
or you're going to call it right here.

1373
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,080
And I looked at it and I thought to myself, I said, like, you know what, I'm never going

1374
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,520
to switch to this.

1375
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,520
I'm going to call it.

1376
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,880
Like, that's the first time I've ever done it.

1377
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,600
Like, I've never allowed myself to not get it installed.

1378
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,600
Like, I got to talk about it on the show.

1379
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,600
What am I going to do?

1380
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,600
Go on the show and say I didn't get it installed?

1381
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,600
Like, I can't say that.

1382
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,600
That's ridiculous.

1383
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,600
How long can you talk about it?

1384
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,600
Yeah.

1385
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,480
But like, but then like, what's funny is like, none of us really wanted to admit to each

1386
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,920
other that we couldn't get it going.

1387
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,400
So like, it just sort of started becoming obvious that we were all struggling.

1388
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,760
No one had made any serious observations about it.

1389
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,760
Yeah.

1390
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,160
So it was like, oh, okay, but then like, I had to like, then call for the shroud of silence.

1391
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,360
We have to call down the cone of silence because now we can't talk about it.

1392
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,120
Now we've got to share our experiences on air because I think we've all had a bad experience.

1393
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,920
So I genuinely did not know cheese had got it working.

1394
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,840
So out of all of us, the design guy on the team got it right.

1395
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,840
That's what I'm thinking.

1396
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:16,080
Like, you guys have worked in Linux for years and here I am just like, okay, DD it to flash

1397
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,080
drive zip file.

1398
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,080
Okay.

1399
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,080
Whatever.

1400
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,760
This is my homework for the evening.

1401
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,760
Yeah, it looks nice.

1402
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,000
I mean, it's kind of like a nice, like a UEFI GPT set up.

1403
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
It should boot just fine.

1404
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,360
I mean, I was doing like PCI pass through, maybe I, maybe I just over, I over engineered

1405
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,360
my KVM maybe.

1406
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:40,640
It should be said too, that the, uh, easy installer is, is, um, maybe not so friendly.

1407
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:49,400
I mean, it's easy, but so if don't do this on a machine that you might want to sacrifice,

1408
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:56,120
or you might not want to sacrifice because whenever you light up the script, the Python

1409
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,520
script for the installer, it's basically SDA, right done.

1410
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,520
Yeah.

1411
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,800
It only takes two minutes, but it doesn't give you any other options to, um, you know,

1412
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,400
like they have with their USB installer, which would be nice to have that built into the

1413
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,400
GUI installer so that you could just boom, put it over to a flash drive.

1414
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,040
Like I could see that being useful in this scenario.

1415
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,720
But it is also kind of a large image at like almost four gigs.

1416
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,920
I think it's like three and a half gigs or something.

1417
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,920
Yeah.

1418
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,920
Yeah.

1419
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,920
True.

1420
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
So yeah, that's good advice though.

1421
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,720
I had that problem with an early edition of clear Linux where I was installing it on a

1422
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,040
laptop that I hadn't really, I hadn't planned to wipe the whole thing for.

1423
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,040
Right.

1424
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,040
Right.

1425
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,440
That's so great when you're like, when you've been doing this for a decade and you still

1426
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,480
make that mistake is the best.

1427
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,000
I definitely prefer doing it in VMs now.

1428
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Like I don't, I'm trying to go for a, I'm trying to go for the entire.

1429
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,200
Life cycle for door 30 without reloading that laptop.

1430
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,200
So I don't want to repartition.

1431
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,200
I've worked at it.

1432
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,200
It's impressive.

1433
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,200
Yeah.

1434
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,480
That's why I'm trying to get this VM stuff all set up, but today I just couldn't get

1435
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,480
it going.

1436
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,480
Had to call it.

1437
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,480
Congratulations cheese.

1438
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,480
Thank you.

1439
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,480
You win the Linux hat.

1440
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,480
Oh yeah.

1441
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,480
For this one.

1442
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,480
Yeah.

1443
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,480
I don't know if we, do we have it?

1444
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,480
It's also red.

1445
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,480
I'll take it.

1446
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,720
I'm just discovering now that, uh, I guess on my USB drive that I tried to install it

1447
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:20,520
on, um, I've got G party complaining that my backup GPT table is corrupt.

1448
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:26,080
So that's maybe not a good start destructible Linux.

1449
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,880
It just cleared everything.

1450
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,920
And then in the documentation I read, uh, and I sent this to West yesterday that as

1451
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:38,440
a warning, uh, it says the USB installer will deploy the resilient Linux initial ISO image

1452
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,380
onto all the inserted and listed USB devices, thus creating complete resilient Linux operating

1453
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,460
system.

1454
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:50,300
So whenever you got plugged in, it sounds like, um, which sounds kind of dangerous considering

1455
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,000
I had my backup drive installed.

1456
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,960
Well, I immediately thought about clear Linux.

1457
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,480
Whenever you had thrown this distro in my way, I was thinking, you know, this is a,

1458
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,040
this is a super interesting way to handle this sort of thing, you know, just diffing

1459
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,560
everything is a neat way to do it.

1460
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,320
And I think that there's something there, but it's, it's, it's an early release.

1461
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:13,080
It's two guys working in a garage in their bedrooms or whatever, and this is their summer

1462
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,600
passion project or something, you know, they can be a lot closer than we're giving them

1463
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,600
credit for.

1464
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,600
It can be just a few missing pieces.

1465
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,860
I actually, that's kind of what I like about it is like, you never know, you just, with,

1466
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,040
with distros, you just, you never know.

1467
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,840
You don't want to count everybody out like this because every now and then they'll surprise

1468
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,800
you about before people really use that arch Linux thing.

1469
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,560
Or if there's one thing that the resilient guys do that gets taken off to another project

1470
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,160
to benefit us somewhere else.

1471
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,440
Yeah, sure.

1472
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,440
So next week, bedrock

1473
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:46,120
LFS, bro, oh no, we're not getting back into this again.

1474
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,200
Gentoo challenge.

1475
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,200
Take two.

1476
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,200
Gentoo 2019.

1477
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,720
You should do the crux because of the inspiration of arch.

1478
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,720
That's right.

1479
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,720
Yeah.

1480
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,720
Damn right.

1481
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,760
And also Brent's apparently sorted history with it.

1482
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,720
I thought it wasn't in existence anymore.

1483
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,320
Well, that's even more reason than it was last year, but it might not be anymore.

1484
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,320
That's we should.

1485
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,760
We should do is, um, Caldera Linux.
