1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
I just got done trying out Windows 10 for a few days, and I honestly wasn't that impressed

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,000
over say Windows 7. So, Popa, you think it's the best, but what would you say draws you

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,360
to it over, say, if you just needed a simple Windows install to do something, to get something

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,560
done, why not just use Windows 7?

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,320
Well, you could. There was nothing technically wrong with my Windows 7 install. I mean, it

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,480
was basically my Steam machine and anything else that was Windows only that I want to

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,760
try out or I want to play with. But I quite like the cleanness of Windows 10. It just

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,240
feels more polished. It just feels like... You know how Windows 7 was Windows Vista

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,720
done right? Windows 10 feels like Windows 7 with just a little bit of extra polish.

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,480
I mean, Windows 7 was fine on its own.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
Yeah, I don't...

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
10 just feels a little bit nicer.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,240
Yeah, I guess I just... I guess I just disagree with you. Because I don't... I mean, it does

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,680
at the very high level. The way the start menu slides up, the way the desktop, virtual

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,700
desktop slide, the way the windows pop open, you know, it kind of feels like the best of

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,160
comp is. A little bit just sort of turned down a slight touch. And I like those things

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,000
about it. But I find to be... What I find to be just sort of disappointing is sort of

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,840
the settings within settings and just settings and settings, different kinds of UIs for your

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,680
settings. There's a really good blog post, actually, that really summed it up very well.

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,640
And so I bookmarked it because the guy went through and he essentially book... He screenshotted

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,160
basically every spot where Windows 10, he says, is unfinished. And I think it's a pretty

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,920
compelling argument. Like, he goes through here and documents, like, here's two sections

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,440
that are identical in the UI that accomplish the same task. Here's, like, two display settings.

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,920
They look completely different in how they function, but they do the same task. And he

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,720
points this out over and over again. Here's where our right click menu is weird and dark

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,480
and gray. And here's where our right click menu looks like our traditional Windows menu.

27
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,280
And all these different inconsistencies in the icons, even in the toolbars where they

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,000
use different languages in the icons to mean different things throughout the entire UI,

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,280
it's not consistent at all. I think it's much less consistent than Windows 7 because it's

30
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,400
mixed with this modern UI now.

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Exactly. And I've heard Microsoft in their official things, Microsoft has said that Windows

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
10 will never be done.

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:24,120
I could have told you that months ago when I tried the 9900 series technical preview.

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,200
I saw that right away. I was like, wow. And it's still not fixed. To me, Windows 10 is

35
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
a beta.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,440
Well, and I believe it always will be.

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,440
We have gotten feedback about that. Yeah. No, it's not. Have we all really? We've all

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,600
bought into this? We've all bought into this?

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,160
Yeah. Most of the chat room. Am I really at JV on the IRC? Because, like, people talk

40
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:52,000
about Windows 10 like it's the best thing ever. I think what you guys are saying is

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,440
they rushed it to market and they're using vernacular that's hip to justify why it's

42
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,920
an incomplete product.

43
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,120
I think that would be accurate. And also, I think the whole free upgrade thing is like

44
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,840
really like hook, line and sink people into their market.

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,160
I mean, I paid two hundred ninety nine dollars. OK, so I could unlock the features. Oh, my

46
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,320
God. Well, I mean, JB did. I didn't. Wow. I didn't personally pay for it, but even so

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,800
that's a lot of money. Exactly. And I feel like I bought an unfinished product. But to

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:30,920
be you like to be honest with you, to do a fully genuine, honest review of the product.

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,760
I bought it because I don't have like I have I have OEM licenses from the past that I don't

50
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,520
I don't have that hardware anymore. And those are those machines run Linux anyways. So like

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,600
my best option was to install it from the ISO. I downloaded from Microsoft's website

52
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,400
and then I had to activate it to get all the features that cost two hundred ninety nine

53
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,440
dollars. And I figured, well, at least now I'll own one copy of Windows 10 for testing.

54
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,400
But in my opinion, this this this line that I've been getting from the community after

55
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,760
our episode that Microsoft's going to roll out new features in October and this is a

56
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,320
rolling release and Windows 10 is the final version. It's never done. So did you say community?

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,960
Really? Yeah. Well, we've been getting Microsoft community. No, no, no. In the last community,

58
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,720
in the last community, after I reviewed Windows 10 on Sunday and people said, well, it's not

59
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,680
fair. It's not done until October. And I can't believe we bought this line because this is

60
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,920
see, you guys, maybe maybe I have a different perspective because I've literally had Microsoft

61
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,280
family members and friends that I've been been close to my entire life. I've watched

62
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,480
this company. I mean, I live next to Microsoft. I've watched this company forever. This is

63
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,040
what they do every single time. It's the same kind of basic message, just different language

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,800
every single time. And this time we're buying it. We didn't buy it last time because they

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,640
they didn't use the right words. This time we're buying it. And if you just if you just

66
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,520
change what they're saying and look at the look at the ship product that cost two hundred

67
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,080
ninety nine dollars, I think it doesn't hold up. Exactly. And right about it's the same

68
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,520
stuff again, because the the article that points out the consistencies in the Windows

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:14,520
10 UI, that's nothing new. IBM were pointing out inconsistencies in the Windows user interface

70
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:21,080
when they were marketing OS2 against Windows and pointing out that, you know, OS2 was a

71
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,640
consistent object based desktop environment and everything behaved the same way in every

72
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:35,840
spot and Windows didn't do that. And was it Windows NT? Windows NT and the Service Packs,

73
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,120
you know, that was the original Windows rolling release, wasn't it? Every Service Pack delivered

74
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,720
new features and it took an awful long time for us to get off Service Pack 3 to Service

75
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,120
Pack 4A when just a whole ton of stuff arrived, including, you know, new browsers and things.

76
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,020
So this is this is nothing new. It's shinier, but it's new and it came out yesterday whenever

77
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,400
it was. But it's the same. It's the same tactics. I still actually say it's new language. I

78
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,840
think in a lot of ways, Windows 7 is still a better product. I just think that Windows

79
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,160
10 is probably the best you're going to get with modern support. And really, at the end

80
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,100
of the day, because we're talking Windows, for Linux users, one of the things that matters

81
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,520
with Windows 10 is it's going to support the latest version of DirectX. And that's one

82
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,960
of the most likely reasons a Linux user would be running Windows.

83
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:46,200
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 104 for August 4th, 2015.

84
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,080
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that ponders if a Linux-powered

85
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,720
tent is a good idea or a great idea. My name is Chris and yeah, I've got camping on the

86
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,040
brain. We've got a great episode 104. I can't even believe that we crossed over the 100

87
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,520
mark and just kept on chugging because we have so much to cover. A little Ubuntu heavy

88
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,400
at the top of the show, but it's going to be worth it. There's some really interesting

89
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,800
things being clarified by Ubuntu, some big changes that I'm looking forward to and maybe

90
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
some speculation on my part and hopefully we'll set the record straight on a few things. There's

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,200
a new roadmap for the Ubuntu projects. Well, going over the next few years, it gives us

92
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,580
a lot of insights. They're sharing a lot of good information. And then there's also been

93
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,840
some discussion on the development list if maybe it's time for Ubuntu to drop the software

94
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,360
center in favor of GNOME software. And actually the reaction to that's been kind of negative.

95
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,720
We'll talk about that. And then later on in the show, the numbers are in and it looks

96
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,320
bad for Linux gaming. Let's just hypothesize. Is the dream failed? Is Linux gaming just

97
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,960
not materializing? And then also some, some of the latest games, some really great games

98
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,080
that came out and the benchmarks are in and the performance is devastating under Linux

99
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,360
compared to Windows, like 60 to 70% worse under Linux. Why is that? We'll talk about

100
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,880
that and what that means and if it's a bad news for steamOS, but we also have some good

101
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:11,040
news. I found in the archive a lost interview from self 2015 with the guys who made the

102
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:17,880
internet possible itself and it is so information packed about deploying good Wi-Fi, troubleshooting

103
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,420
Wi-Fi, and what it takes to make wireless work. You could apply it to your house or

104
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,840
to a major event. It is a segment in this show that I think people refer back to over

105
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,960
and over again when they are visiting or troubleshooting a Wi-Fi network. I can't wait to play that

106
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,640
for you. That's coming up later on in the show as well. So talk about that and then

107
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:42,000
if there is time, we are going to make a major, major experiment run this Friday on the Linux

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,520
Action Show. We are going to make a huge change to the show, hopefully in an attempt to be

109
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,240
more genuine and honor the show and the fact that it covers Linux and open source but also

110
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,240
to raise the quality and make it even better. And we are going to try something extremely

111
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,380
new and we are going to be doing it live on Friday instead of Sunday. And I want to brace

112
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:08,120
you for it. Maybe just try to bend off some of the immediate reaction that might happen

113
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,620
because it is going to be a big change. And I don't often talk about the show in the show

114
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,240
but I am going to do that at the end of today's episode of Linux Unplugged if we have time.

115
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,980
And I don't know exactly how much I am going to share yet because I am a little nervous.

116
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,040
But you know what, I have a beer here. I will just keep drinking. I am about halfway through.

117
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,040
We will see if by the end of that bottle if I feel like sharing anymore. But first, I

118
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,000
want to bring in Mr. Popey who can help me dig through some of these, well, basically

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,560
clarification that have been posted on Ollie's blog. He calls it Ollie's Random Thoughts

120
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,440
and Impressions. And Popey, can you tell me so that way I don't get it wrong, who is Ollie

121
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,520
and what does he do at Canonical?

122
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,200
He is VP of Engineering so he runs basically the whole show for everything that is user

123
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,360
visible at the moment for the most part.

124
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,280
And he points out, he made this post on August 3rd that there is only 242 days left until

125
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,840
the next long-term release of Ubuntu, Ubuntu 16.04 and so it is probably time to clarify

126
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:15,340
a few things. So remember, we have talked about Snappy on the show. Snappy is an adjective

127
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,920
describing a collection of technologies that allows for transactional atomic updates, rollback

128
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,160
and better security guarantees for apps and users. So remember, it is a transactional

129
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,600
updated system so the applications and the OS can be updated separately and you can roll

130
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,840
back.

131
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,640
And you are going to have Snappy Core which things can be built around. But there is a

132
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,880
new term being kicked around that I wanted to make sure we all understand here on this

133
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,080
show because I think it is going to have the largest impact for our audience. It is Ubuntu

134
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:47,480
Personal. Snappy plus Ubuntu. Ubuntu Personal. Snappy Ubuntu is the logical consequence of

135
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,120
all the things said so far except that it has the most beautiful user interface sitting

136
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,360
on top of it. However, Ubuntu Personal will be snap-based from the start and hence the

137
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,640
distinction Snappy Ubuntu Personal is redundant and we are simply calling it Ubuntu Personal.

138
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,040
Ubuntu Personal will provide all the benefits of Snappy apps to users of devices with built-in

139
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,760
and attached displays. Considering that Snappy systems were born out of our experience with

140
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,640
mobile devices, Ubuntu Personal is the next evolution of phone code based on our path

141
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,080
to reach code convergence.

142
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,280
Now I do not know exactly how to interpret that, Poppy, but it almost sounds like Ubuntu

143
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,000
could be something that somebody who wanted to follow like Unity 8 and Mir and maybe even

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,720
try it on a laptop would maybe be interested in Ubuntu Personal. Or is it just something

145
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,240
for mobile devices? What exactly is it?

146
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Yeah. So like longer term, you could think of buying a device that has Snappy on it and

147
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:48,480
that could be a router or an autonomous device like a flying thing or, you know, it could

148
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:56,600
be a fridge or anything. But Snappy Ubuntu Personal is more about the desktop user experience.

149
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,920
So that's like laptops, desktops, like Chromecast style devices, things that have a graphical

150
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,920
user interface are more likely to be Ubuntu Personal. So they're machines that a normal

151
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,720
user would interact with like directly.

152
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Does that include a laptop?

153
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

154
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,360
So it's everything from a tiny device that might have a UI on it up to a fairly powerful

155
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
personal computer.

156
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,040
So like Invisage, like distantly in the future, everything running Snappy. But the ones that

157
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,400
you sit out and type at and touch and swipe and, you know, use a mouse with, those might

158
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,360
be running Ubuntu Personal. But the ones which don't have a display, which are embedded

159
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,080
IoT things, routers, flying things, would just be Snappy Ubuntu Core. And you interact

160
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,120
with those differently. That's the kind of distinction between the two.

161
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,800
So also Ubuntu Personal kind of replaces Desktop Next, which was sort of the way to currently

162
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,400
try out Mir and Unity 8, right?

163
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,820
Yeah. Desktop Next was a kind of image that you could play with that was never really

164
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,840
designed to be a production desktop. And the goal with Ubuntu Personal is that that will

165
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,200
be the production desktop. It's the next evolution of Desktop Next.

166
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,600
Yeah. And now keeping in mind that the actual Debian-based Ubuntu distribution isn't going

167
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:27,520
away, this still seems like a ginormous, mind-bending, completely game-changing evolution for the

168
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,400
project. Basically, you're going, I mean, your star products are going to be Snap-based.

169
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:38,400
They're not going to be Deb-based. They're not, it is an entirely new creation that you

170
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
guys are...

171
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:45,040
From my perspective, really, when you think of star product, some people will think, well,

172
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,200
from my perspective, a star product is something I can install Debs on and I can go and randomly

173
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
build code on.

174
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Today. Yeah. Yeah. For the next few years.

175
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,840
And to do it in the future. It could well be the case in the future. You still want

176
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,720
to be able to go and get a random Deb off the internet of your favorite app, whatever

177
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,640
it might be, and install it. And away you go. Whereas other people will say, my star

178
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,160
machine is the thing where I open the lid and it works every time when I open the lid

179
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,080
and it updates itself in the background and I don't have to worry about PPAs or Debs

180
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,920
or, you know, Pseudo or all that kind of stuff. It just works, right? So for some people,

181
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,880
that is their star platform.

182
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,600
To me, what it sounds like is it sounds like Ubuntu Debian-based is a transition platform

183
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,640
for those people who have based products around it or have environments around it. And so

184
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,800
because of that, it will be around for many years. But really, I think if transactional-based

185
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,520
systems take off, which I can't imagine they wouldn't on the server, especially with people

186
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,800
trying to deploy applications who are not necessarily the best at understanding how

187
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,280
systems work, I've got to imagine that a transactionally-based, container-based system is going to really

188
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,840
go big and a lot of people will switch. And it also makes a ton of sense on the desktop

189
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:04,720
and it makes delivering desktop applications so much simpler on desktop Linux. I mean,

190
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,960
I see here, so I'm looking at this timeline you guys have posted and you can see where

191
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,560
Desktop Next comes to an end and where Ubuntu Personal kind of becomes a thing, especially

192
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,120
around 16.10 where maybe, like, there's actually something people could try. And really, I

193
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,840
mean, the distro that everyone's going to be wanting to use, even next year, you run

194
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,080
16.10 time and so forth, is going to be the Debian-based version. But you go out a few

195
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,880
more years, if people are really starting to contribute to the Snap Store and a lot

196
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,600
of people are building and delivering applications in Snaps or whatever the hell they're called,

197
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,880
you know, DigitalOcean has a droplet you can fire up based on Ubuntu's Snappy Core. I'm

198
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,040
sure they'll do that. It's going to go big, I would think.

199
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,160
Well, yeah, and there'll be certainly a period of time where both things are running in parallel

200
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:58,040
and Ubuntu Personal may take off and become, like, the Chromebook-style OS that just works

201
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,400
and you don't have to worry about devs and PPAs and all that kind of stuff.

202
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,360
I just love it, like, in a production environment, Poppy, like in a studio, I love the idea of

203
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,160
a transactionally-based system. Because if I go to do a show and it's not working, I

204
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,280
can roll back. That's a lifesaver.

205
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,560
It certainly has, like, use cases that people outside your listenership might be interested

206
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,600
in, like, you know, my mum would not really care about PPAs and devs and release upgrades

207
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,520
every six months and that kind of stuff. She just wants to work and carry on working every

208
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:33,200
day. But there are people out there who are engineers or developers who want the flexibility

209
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,840
to be able to get under the hood and tweak around with it.

210
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:43,360
And while you can do that with Ubuntu Personal, obviously, then if your level of tweaking

211
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,540
means building devs and delivering software as devs and hacking in a way that Personal

212
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,080
maybe isn't appropriate for, then the Debian-based distro is still there and will continue to

213
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,120
be there. And that's one of the key things to take away, actually, is we keep getting

214
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,120
– this blog post was partly to clear up a lot of misconception in the community. People

215
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,760
keep saying, oh, well, they're going to switch to clicks, they're going to switch

216
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,920
to snaps, and the Debian desktop will disappear. Well, no, it's not. The whole point of this

217
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:16,080
is the archive is what everything is built from. So we can't take away that archive

218
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,160
because it's all built from that. And that is our special source, is the archive.

219
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,120
The way Ollie put it, he says, the underlying center of gravity for everything I've described

220
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,000
so far, however, is Ubuntu, which is bigger than any single technology or product or code

221
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,880
base. Ubuntu, the Linux distribution, as we all know and love it, will continue to be

222
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,760
there on the internet, freely available to anyone and everyone.

223
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Exactly.

224
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,200
So, yeah, because Snappy and all that is based on that. And it's interesting, and I'm looking

225
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,500
forward to maybe one day sitting here and having my machine that's displaying visuals

226
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,380
on the stream be powered by Ubuntu Snappy. I think it's going to be, from a show content

227
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:59,120
and review and just digging into stuff and talking about it standpoint, super interesting

228
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,080
and fascinating. Can't wait. Cannot wait. It's going to be a lot of fun. At least, if

229
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,280
nothing else, fascinating to watch it. Who knows where it goes? Who knows? My bet's all

230
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,760
on Plasma Mobile.

231
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:18,380
All right. So, before we get into our last Ubuntu thing, just to kind of wrap up our

232
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,320
conversation and I'm actually, it's great also because it just kind of fits in nicely

233
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,800
with our conversation we had with Wimpy last week. So I want to talk about that in just

234
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:33,120
a moment. But first, I want to tell you about DigitalOcean, the first sponsor of Linux Unplugged.

235
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,200
And if you actually want to support the Linux Unplugged program, I got a secret. Well, it's

236
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,660
a secret, like the kind of secret I'd like you to tell every single person you know.

237
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,960
You have secrets like that? Yeah. Well, I'm not going to go there. We can get dirty quick.

238
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,280
But use the promo code DEOUNPLUGGED and you get a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean and

239
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,400
spread it around like HSV1. Just spread it around and let everybody have some of it.

240
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,420
DEOUNPLUGGED over at digitalocean.com. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't know? You don't know

241
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,300
what DigitalOcean is? Oh, let me tell you about DigitalOcean. DigitalOcean is a simple

242
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,400
cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to

243
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:12,520
get your own rig up in the cloud. Now, they got free BSD machines. Well, I mean, you know,

244
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,580
maybe you want to use free BSD. It's pretty cool. But they have like core OS. You want

245
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,880
to talk about, boy, talk about something, talk about, talk about something snappy trying

246
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,760
to rip off. Oh, I'm just kidding. No, it's cool. Core OS, you know, you have the rolling

247
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,880
base OS on DigitalOcean because their bosses, they work directly upstream with the core

248
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,880
OS team. So you get great core-based OSs and then the applications are containerized, which

249
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,680
is slick. Of course, they've also got Ubuntu LTS and they got several versions of Ubuntu

250
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,480
up there. They got Fedora. They got Debian. They even now have Fedora 22. How about that?

251
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,280
Not bad. Now, this is the best part. You can get started in less than 55 seconds and you

252
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,560
got that promo code DEOUNPLUGGED. You don't even have to worry about the cost. So just

253
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,460
go over there and get started because now your time, what, you don't got 55 seconds.

254
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,520
Give me a break. And check this out, $5 a month. Well, DEOUNPLUGGED is going to give

255
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,120
you a $10 credit. For $10, you're going to be able to run a rig for two months. Now,

256
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,680
check out this $5 rig. You get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSDs. They're all SSDs.

257
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,240
One CPU and a terabyte of transfer. And DigitalOcean is data center locations in New York, San

258
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,880
Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, and a big old bad boy in Germany. But their interface

259
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,960
is what I love about them. I've been in IT for years. Well, I had been until I got into

260
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,880
podcasting because, man, I had to get out of IT. And you know one of the reasons I had

261
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,160
to get out of IT? I'm looking at you, VMware ESX, running your whole entire infrastructure

262
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,200
on Linux and forcing me to use a Windows client. I will never get over that. I will never,

263
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,640
I will never forgive you. And how complicated it is and all of these different, even you,

264
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,840
Proxmox, I'm looking at you. Even you, Proxmox, you're way too complicated. All you guys with

265
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,200
virtualizations, you're making it way too complicated. You need to go over to DigitalOcean.com.

266
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,480
I'm talking to you, Proxmox. Guys, I love you. I love you. But your web UI, you need

267
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,560
to go over to DigitalOcean, okay? VMware, you need to go over to DigitalOcean, all right?

268
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,480
Okay? Everybody, go over to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and learn how

269
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,680
to really build an interface. Man, you can spin up these droplets like a boss. You can

270
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,760
deploy applications with one click. It's really nice. Full DNS management, snapshots, templates,

271
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,360
transfer them to somebody else once you're done with the project. I love it. And remember,

272
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,160
DOUNPLUGGED, you can try it out, two months for free. They have great tutorials and also,

273
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,800
they're often hiring Linux positions and content editors. Check out their We're Hiring page

274
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,360
too. And I bet you if you told them you heard about them from us, you might get moved to

275
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,960
the head of the line. I'm just saying it might work. DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code

276
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,760
DOUNPLUGGED and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

277
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,080
So you know what I love is when mailing lists, when developer mailing lists turn into news.

278
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,520
Oh man, only in the open source community and it creates so much drama. And then we

279
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,360
start to question ourselves and like, oh, we shouldn't behave like this. Commercial

280
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,840
companies have never been, no, commercial companies behave like this too. It's just

281
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,320
they don't have a public mailing list. So what the hell's going on? In the mailing list

282
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,240
on the, over on the Ubuntu developers mailing list, there was a post that suggested dropping

283
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,840
the Ubuntu software center and adopting GNOME software. Now, GNOME software is not bad.

284
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:18,280
I actually kind of do like it in some regards, but it got me thinking. Yesterday show, last

285
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,320
week show episode 103, we talked to Wimpy about a lot of feedback he got around the

286
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,040
software center. And Wimpy, just as a little follow up to that, did you make a final decision

287
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,080
or was your decision final at the time of the recording? I can't recall.

288
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:38,240
Yeah, it was final then and it stands. So I'm going to provide the Ubuntu software center

289
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,680
and upgrade as options in Ubuntu Mate. Welcome.

290
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,800
So what do you think about this idea of maybe like in the, let's just for fun, just say

291
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,080
Ubuntu shipped with, instead of the Ubuntu software center, for giggles, let's say it

292
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,480
ships with GNOME software center and maybe a few, you know, canonical fixes have been

293
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,880
applied. Wimpy, would that be something you'd be willing to look at and maybe consider including

294
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,360
in Ubuntu Mate?

295
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,360
I'm prepared to consider all viable options.

296
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,960
Do you think it's a good idea?

297
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,400
I think it's a lot of work adapting GNOME software to replace Ubuntu software center

298
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,760
because there's a super set of functionality in Ubuntu software center. So given the time

299
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:28,200
required, I think that's a big ask. And fundamentally the way GNOME software works is different

300
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,640
to the Ubuntu software center. So with GNOME software, each application has to ship its

301
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:40,720
own app data XML file, which is the information that gets presented in GNOME software. Whereas

302
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:49,040
Ubuntu software center and app grid use confusingly something else that's called app data, but

303
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:56,120
they're packages that you install and they're effectively databases of metadata for the

304
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,480
packages that are in the official archive and the partner repository. And that's where

305
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,120
all of the, you know, the descriptions and artwork and stuff comes from. So they're fundamentally

306
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:14,080
different and you don't have reviews in GNOME software, for example. So I'm prepared to

307
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,040
keep an open mind on this and I will happily, you know, move to other solutions that present

308
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,920
themselves that are a viable alternative. And I've even said to Popeye I'm prepared

309
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:32,440
to help with the development effort on whatever the viable alternative might be. I don't know

310
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,960
how much time I'm going to have to devote to that, but I'm prepared to pitch in and

311
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,520
help with that, yeah.

312
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:46,040
So I like to, so SB5637 in our last subreddit had a pretty, pretty well voted up response

313
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,560
to this. He says, I personally think it's a bad idea. I've extensively tested and tried

314
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,280
the like GNOME software on Fedora and OpenSUSE, but it was pitifully awful in my opinion.

315
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,000
You can't browse apps while another app is installing and some apps just simply don't

316
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,200
appear in search results even if they're available in category listings. Search results in general

317
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,940
are pretty bad and I don't like how it refuses to show apps that don't have AppStream data.

318
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,160
At the very least it could fall back to package name and a short description like Synaptic

319
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,800
shows if AppStream data isn't available. Instead, they're just ignoring the software

320
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,920
altogether. And the other thing I've noticed is sometimes it fails to load certain screens

321
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:26,200
for me. There are oddities to it. The other thing too is it seems like it would be a little

322
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,880
bit waste of time. I don't know, Poppy, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems

323
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,000
like Energies and Times would be focused on building QT and QML apps, not adding code

324
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,480
to GTK apps that are contributed by other projects. Poppy, is that?

325
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:48,000
I think one of the problems is that none of the App Store apps are perfect. Software Center's

326
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,560
got its issues. There's lack in functionality in – if we're just talking about Apps

327
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:59,640
Store's honorability. App Grid has issues in that it's proprietary and there are missing

328
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,220
features. GNOME software obviously is very tailored for GNOME and might not fit Unity

329
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,040
quite so well. They all have issues, but they're all solvable. It's simply a matter of programming

330
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,720
and it's where you want to devote your attention. My personal feeling is if we rallied a bunch

331
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,600
of people around Ubuntu Software Center, we could probably fix up some of the issues,

332
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:30,120
remove some of the things that are maybe less desirable or less applicable these days, or

333
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,880
convince the App Grid guy to add features and freely license his code. I don't know.

334
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,360
I'm not entirely convinced that adopting GNOME software when we're 80% of the way

335
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,200
there with the other tools is the right way to do it.

336
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,120
Yeah, I'm surprised there hasn't been more of a community rallying around. Couldn't

337
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,400
there be community patches applied to Ubuntu Software Center and just maybe –

338
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,320
Yeah, of course. It's free software. It's free software like anything else. Part of

339
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:03,040
the problem is that it's a canonical project and we haven't devoted enough attention to

340
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,400
it over the last few years. People think it's dead and nobody's maintaining it. That's

341
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,560
a perfectly reasonable perception to make when you look at the code that there haven't

342
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:18,560
been any releases for ages and nobody's done any features and it's idle for a long time.

343
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,040
That doesn't motivate community people to actively work on something when the maintainer

344
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,640
and owner of that project isn't maintaining it themselves, right? That's the same for

345
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,240
any Ubuntu software project.

346
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,400
I think if there was a reboot of Ubuntu Software Center, not a rewrite, but find out what the

347
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,760
features are that shouldn't be there and the features that are missing and the performance

348
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,040
issues. Really, it would need to be updating for Python 3 because we're looking to remove

349
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,400
Python 2 and it's a Python 2 app. It would need to be updated to Python 3. There's a

350
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,560
bunch of things that need to happen to it, but it's whether people are willing to contribute

351
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:02,320
those things. I'm sure we could find someone in Canonical to help and mentor those people

352
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,480
and people in the community like Martin was suggesting to help update it. We need people

353
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,440
to help out. It's all very well throwing broken bottles at us and telling us it's crap, but

354
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,080
someone's got to throw patches attached to those broken bottles.

355
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
Just kidding.

356
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
Thanks, Chris.

357
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,120
Just kidding. All right. Well, good. The thread is linked in the show notes if you guys want

358
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,000
to read it. It's fascinating. I'm glad there's discussion around it. I think it's a conversation

359
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,320
worth having, so I'm glad it is happening.

360
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,400
I want to play a clip that I literally found in the archive. Noah was like, hey, I think

361
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:44,040
you might need to check over here, and I dug through it. It is a fascinating clip by a

362
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:50,000
couple of guys who work at an ISP called Global Vision, Linux-powered ISP, Linux on the infrastructure,

363
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,240
Linux on the backend. They claim they're able to deliver wireless internet more reliable

364
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,700
in some cases even than fiber. That's what they say. They describe it in the interview.

365
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,240
One of the other things they do is they rock the wireless at trade shows, so much so that

366
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,720
we were able to get live Wi-Fi coverage using streaming video over Wi-Fi walking around

367
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,540
the floor itself. They do all of this using Linux laptops and Linux tools. It's not so

368
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:19,960
much about that angle in this clip that I'm about to play, but this is an incredibly fascinating

369
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,760
insight into how to manage a good wireless network. These two gentlemen break it down

370
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,240
in such an easy to understand way that I walked away from this interview feeling like I have

371
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,880
an entirely new understanding of Wi-Fi, and I think so often on our Linux laptops we blame

372
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,640
drivers or the Wi-Fi chipset, which it often is the problem, but sometimes, honestly, it's

373
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,020
the fact that we have messed up Wi-Fi networks, which are extremely tricky. So this clip is

374
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:49,000
very valuable even if you have a small Wi-Fi network or a huge enterprise Wi-Fi network,

375
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,800
and I wanted to play it. It was from the archive of SELF 2015.

376
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:01,080
Welcome. Southeast Linux Text 2015 walking around, came across one of the booths we were

377
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,840
at last year, and now if you're watching the live stream or had been watching the live

378
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,080
stream, you probably heard us talk about Global Vision. These are the guys that brought the

379
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,680
internet to SELF and did an amazing job. I'm here with Zach, and I actually didn't catch

380
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,320
your name. Ethan. Ethan. Good to meet you, Ethan. Thanks for taking the time to be here

381
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,240
with us. So I wanted to talk, first of all, if you could tell me a little bit about Global

382
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,120
Vision itself and what it is you guys do. So Global Vision is a, particularly, it's

383
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,200
a wireless ISP based out of Greenville, South Carolina. We have wireless networks in both

384
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,680
Pickens County and Greenville County and Spartanburg County, and we provide both residential and

385
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:43,280
business internet along with phone service, and we do it via VoIP, voice over IP, and

386
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,960
we also manage the public wireless network for the city of Pickens.

387
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,360
All right. Now, when you say wireless ISP, if somebody's not familiar with that, most

388
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,640
people have, you know, a cable modem in their house, and then they plug it into the router,

389
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,560
and that's how they're getting their internet. Now, you were telling me last year that there's

390
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,920
actually, there are some places in your neck of the woods where getting a cable modem,

391
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,640
that's just not going to happen. So you're actually giving internet or providing internet

392
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,560
to people that ordinarily may not be able to get internet.

393
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,480
Yeah, that is correct. Our product specializes in the rural areas or in new neighborhoods.

394
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,960
When they build new neighborhoods, charter could take two years to come into the neighborhood

395
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,240
where we can roll in there from day one, even when there's just one house, it's still profitable

396
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,520
for us to roll in. And essentially what we do is we put an antenna about this big on

397
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,840
the outside of your house pointing up at our tower, which is on Parris Mountain, and then

398
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,160
we just run an ethernet cable into your house and power the radio via PoE, power of ethernet,

399
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,080
and that will provide internet to the house.

400
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,160
When you talk about these radios, what frequency are they running at?

401
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,760
We run exclusively at five gigahertz for the residential stuff. Now on the business side,

402
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,640
we also get into some different ones like 24 gigahertz, and we also use 11 gigahertz

403
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,680
licensed links.

404
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:07,760
Now at that frequency, how picky are the radios about being exactly, the antennas about being

405
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,480
line of sight to each other?

406
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,280
So the five gigahertz, it is a requirement that they have clear line of sight to get

407
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:23,160
the range that we're talking. Our nearest client to the towers is just over a mile.

408
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:29,600
So when we talk wireless links, we laugh at people that say, oh, I can do so many feet.

409
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,720
I can do so many miles. And so in five gigahertz, it needs clear line of sight. So a tree doesn't

410
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,400
count as clear line of sight.

411
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,560
So there's obviously some challenges then if you work in a place that's densely populated

412
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,360
with trees or has fences. How is it that you're going to get around if somebody has property

413
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,560
that there is no part of their house that has a clear line of sight to your tower?

414
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,640
So what we've done with some customers is we'll get up on the roof, and we can barely

415
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,920
see the mountain through some trees. And we'll tell the customer, all right, that tree, that

416
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,520
tree, that tree, and that tree is in the way. And we actually had one client while we're

417
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,840
still standing on the roof, went to his shed, pulled out a chainsaw, and cut down five trees

418
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,640
before we left so that we could install his antenna and he'd have internet for his kids.

419
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:25,080
Welcome to South Carolina. Tell me a little bit about what it's like to be providing Wi-Fi

420
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:30,400
for self. Typically, conference Wi-Fi is horrendous. Most attendees kind of have come to expect

421
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,360
that. And you guys have done a phenomenal job. My Wi-Fi has dropped out maybe twice

422
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,000
the entire time I've been here. And other than that, I actually, it's been so reliable,

423
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,960
I actually have our production laptop running on Wi-Fi. Even though you've given us a hard

424
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,840
drop, it is that good. So tell me how it is you've been able to achieve that.

425
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,960
So part of it is we use dual frequency. There's 2.4 and 5 gigahertz. We're broadcasting over

426
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:57,020
the entire conference area. And the problem with 2.4 is all these dang hotspots. So people

427
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:03,320
will fire up these hotspots. It will create 2.4 gigahertz interference. And the signal

428
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:09,160
strength and the ping times and latency will go down the toilet. So with the 5 gigahertz

429
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,920
network is really reliable. And there's a lot more channels. So we can do a better channel

430
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:19,480
payment with the 5 gigahertz. So to get to help encourage people to use 5 gigahertz,

431
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:26,920
we renamed the 2.4 network to dash slow to encourage people to connect to the 5 gigahertz

432
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:33,080
because at this day and age, the vast majority of devices are 5 gigahertz capable.

433
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:40,520
We matched that with decent channel planning. We mapped out all the APs on one of the maps

434
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,000
that the event provided us. And we did some good channel planning. We also had to turn

435
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,680
on the minimum RSSI setting, which allows you to roam a little better. Before we had

436
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,880
turned that on, I was all the way in the other ballroom. And I was still connected to this

437
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:01,560
AP with one bar. It wouldn't jump onto the next one. So once we turned that on, you move

438
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,360
more easily from one access point to the next and you just get a better signal overall.

439
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,680
Now is the minimum RSSI, is that something that everyone should be looking at doing if

440
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:18,760
they're planning to put access points in to an infrastructure across the building?

441
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:26,640
So minimum RSSI is necessary in a multi-AP environment because without it, you cannot

442
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,320
roam effectively. Essentially what it does is the AP itself looks at the difference between

443
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,480
the signal and the noise and basically the quality of the link. And if it drops below,

444
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:47,600
in our case, 20 dB separation, the AP will simply kick the client off in an attempt to

445
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:53,480
force the client to reconnect to another access point. And in most environments, you will

446
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,440
only see about a one to two ping packet drop during that kick process.

447
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,520
Now tell me this, if that happens, if there isn't a stronger access point available, like

448
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,040
let's say I'm at the fringe of the network, am I just going to continually get dropped?

449
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,600
Yes. Okay. And for the benefit of the entire network, that is the best thing to happen

450
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,280
because the system can be only as good as its weakest link.

451
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:27,200
Okay. All right. When you guys go to set these access points up, how important is placement

452
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
inside of the rooms?

453
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:36,680
Extremely important. You want to try to stay away from RF bad materials such as brick.

454
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,600
You don't want to put one of these access points right up against a brick wall because

455
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,560
all of the access points that we use now are omnidirectional. So the radio is not compensating

456
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:53,640
the fact that it's up against a brick wall. So it can actually damage the AP if it's running

457
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,800
too high because too much of the RF interference will come back into the AP bouncing off the

458
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,160
wall.

459
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,760
That's incredible. Anything you guys want to add about what Global Vision is doing or

460
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,800
what it is that you guys have done to make self possible or future endeavors that you

461
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,400
guys might get into?

462
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,080
So one of the things that we're starting to get into is more high end dedicated links.

463
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:25,840
We have the capability now of delivering gigabit internet to our business over wireless where

464
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:33,480
you could spend $20,000 and build up costs for AT&T fiber or another fiber provider and

465
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,280
then on top of that pay $2,000 or $3,000 a month for that gig service. We can go in at

466
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,760
a much cheaper price point and deliver it wirelessly and we don't have backhoe fade.

467
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,880
Backhoe fade in the fiber industry is when a backhoe cuts the fiber and that your fiber

468
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,600
circuit is super reliable until the backhoe gets it and then you could be two or three

469
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:58,080
days without service where because our product is wireless we don't have that problem.

470
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,240
One of the things we've been focusing on lately, Zach came up with a solution a couple months

471
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,920
ago for our VoIP service and we were constantly answering phone calls about complaints about

472
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,760
the hostess service that we were using before but what it seems like we've been doing a

473
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:19,800
lot of is coming in and just doing an end to end install from phone to radio including

474
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,300
the cabling, the switches, the routes, everything all the way back to us that we can then manage

475
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:29,240
from our own desks without even having to go to anyone's actual office building and

476
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,760
that's really caused us to, some of the stress is gone as well as some of the things are

477
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,280
just way, way easier to manage. We get a lot less complaints. We've had a company recently

478
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,680
where we did inside and out everything was Global Vision and I have not heard a call

479
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,200
of complaint yet from them. Completely different from coming in with VoIP phones and plugging

480
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,780
into their $19 Netgear router and having SIP ALG issues and things like that and then they

481
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:01,080
just blame Global Vision because they were able to check their emails on it before and

482
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,820
how come they can't get VoIP service now? When we come in and say okay, let's put this

483
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,840
router in here and if it works you can buy it from us. They always buy it from us.

484
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,380
Yeah, I've actually done the same thing. I've got into a place and I say listen, I'm so

485
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,160
confident in the equipment I sell that I'll put it in first. If you don't like it, call

486
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,480
me in a week and I'll come pick it back up and no questions asked but if you do like

487
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,880
it we'll send you an invoice and the reality is once they get it and once they use it and

488
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,440
they see that once they get accustomed to it and it works. Well, thank you so much for

489
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,840
taking the time to talk to us. Thank you so much for your commitment to Linux community

490
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:41,300
to bring all of this stuff here so we all have good Wi-Fi and if I see you walking around

491
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,120
with your Yagi sleeping hunting for people, I might have to come follow you around.

492
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Absolutely.

493
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,460
Those guys are great. So now one of the things that Wimby reminded me about in the chat room

494
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:57,480
is that he's actually talking to us over a four mile wireless link right now so you have

495
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,080
some insights in this particular topic, don't you Wimpy?

496
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:09,800
Yeah I've been using wireless broadband for six years, something like that. So for a few

497
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:19,820
years I used 3G as a means to get internet access and now I use a local ISP who is an

498
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:28,220
ex-Motorola radio engineer and he specializes in wireless broadband services in rural areas

499
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,280
in the UK.

500
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,820
Well your sound is pretty good. How has it been as a service?

501
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:43,360
It's been 100% reliable since it was installed about three years ago so the services 12 meg

502
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:51,840
download, four meg upload and when I do the podcast with Popey and the others and we've

503
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:58,840
been checking network response times, mine are in the same ballpark as everyone else's

504
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
who's using 5G.

505
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,800
Yeah you're looking pretty good here. I'm looking at your mumble stats right now. Less

506
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,240
than a 1%, I mean it's really looking good, like not bad at all. We've had 10 late packets

507
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,200
out of like 198,000.

508
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:20,920
Yeah, yeah. So yeah I've got no complaints. It's certainly far better than the 512k ADSL

509
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:27,360
service that I can get from the major BT provider in this country.

510
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,320
Well now Global Vision is just a local ISP as far as I know in the Charlotte area but

511
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,640
I gotta say we go to a lot of these events and we go to pro events and we go to community

512
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:42,920
events and CELF is a community event and it has some of the best Wi-Fi out of all of them.

513
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,800
Now they're very judicious, they go around with sensors like no it was given a hard time

514
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,300
at the end there and they kick rogue APs off and things like that but you know I gotta

515
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,320
give it to them. Like it's really nice to be able to go there and have good Wi-Fi. When

516
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:58,480
you go to a technical event and the Wi-Fi sucks, it's like, I don't know, it's like

517
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,080
a real weird disconnect between like the interest of the community and all of a sudden they're

518
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:08,920
in like offline mode. It's almost like camping but really hot and sweaty. I thought some

519
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,640
of those tips would be really good and maybe if you've had some wireless issues, maybe

520
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,920
it's not Linux's fault, maybe it's the wireless in your house.

521
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,320
I think what is in common there is I'm with an independent ISP, you've just interviewed

522
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:27,160
an independent ISP. I think there's a lot of value in having a small local company who

523
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:34,080
know what they're doing over being one of millions of customers with a national provider

524
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,760
and you really don't matter to them.

525
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:42,800
And that is kind of the nice thing about wireless, right? Is they can, it actually gives somebody

526
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,720
like an independent market a place to move into. The wired infrastructure is owned, right?

527
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,360
You can't really be an independent ISP on the wired infrastructure but in the wireless

528
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:59,640
spectrum, there's still space for the third party small independent person or company.

529
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,640
And the organization I'm with, they even do mesh networks in the community as well. So

530
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,120
each of the houses mesh together and you can have community mesh networks with them as

531
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,840
well, which is kind of neat.

532
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,760
Well, the other thing that's nice about these guys is being a local ISP is, you know, they're

533
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,280
Linux enthusiasts. So they go to events like this and bring in the internet for the event

534
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,520
and they run Linux back at the office and it's just really neat. It's a pretty cool

535
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,120
thing to still see out there because when I was back when I was in high school, the

536
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:32,680
dial-up ISPs were local, you know, and like they had, they ran fake servers back at their

537
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,640
office and stuff like that. It was a community. And so it's neat to still see that out there

538
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,320
a little bit. It makes me a little nostalgic.

539
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:46,460
All right. Well, I want to talk about the gaming stats that have come out recently.

540
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,720
And maybe part of me, like I like to, I don't like to pretend like the sky is falling but

541
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,040
gee, sometimes I think we just maybe just need to have a dose of reality. So we're going

542
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,840
to talk about some of the things I've been reading and maybe what it means. Maybe it

543
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,960
means nothing. Maybe we'll get through it all and I'll be okay. But first, I want to

544
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,320
tell you about something that makes me feel great. Something that makes me feel like I'm

545
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,160
moving forward, striving. That's Linux Academy. You can get a great discount if you go to

546
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:14,320
linuxacademy.com slash unplug. Get our 33% discount. Now Linux Academy is an institution.

547
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,080
It is a learning institution created by Linux and open source enthusiasts, people who are

548
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,360
really passionate about this stuff, which also has the great benefit of means they really

549
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,840
follow the good stuff closely. Linux Academy has step-by-step video courses for you to

550
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:31,320
go and learn about all kinds of topics. More than 1600 videos, almost 1700 videos, you

551
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,540
get different experience levels on all kinds of topics around Linux and open source. Seven

552
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,800
plus Linux distributions that you get to choose from. You always get to keep track of your

553
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,360
progress. They have all of the great technology stacks like Vagra and OpenStack and Docker

554
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:50,520
and Nginx and Apache and PHP and Perl and MySQL. All of it. Really all of it. It's kind

555
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:56,780
of awe-inspiring when you go there. I will not say though, it's not overwhelming. There's

556
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,160
a few things that help you understand it. First of all, it's all broken down and how

557
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,580
long each section is going to take. There's guides you can download and read offline or

558
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,880
listen to while you take a shower. The only thing that's really cool is the scenario-based

559
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,920
labs help me actually apply what I'm learning to a real scenario, as the name would suggest.

560
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,040
These labs spin up virtual servers for you so you get to actually work with the technology

561
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,120
and those virtual servers match the courseware. There's seven plus Linux distributions that

562
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,040
you get to choose from and then the courseware is set by the distribution and the virtual

563
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,840
servers are set by that. Of course, if you get stuck, there's Instructor Health. That's

564
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,340
no bigs. Now, if you're looking at getting some of the Red Hat certified courses, which

565
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,840
I have done many of interviews when I was a contractor for my clients and also for hiring

566
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:44,200
for the company that did the contracting. I'm a bit of a diva when it comes to a lot

567
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:50,320
of certifications. I think a lot of them are hot air. I actually have mad respect though

568
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,340
for some of these Red Hat certifications. There's a lot of other ones I have respect

569
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:58,740
for too, but the Red Hat ones, really. The thing is, you have to go actually do that

570
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,960
work in the Red Hat course. You have to go actually apply what you've learned and try

571
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,560
it. It's not just answering the questions. You've got to go do it and there's no Google

572
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,440
and they don't give you an internet connection. You have to do it all offline. I mean, that's

573
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,840
tough. I have mad respect for that and they have the best courseware on the Red Hat stuff

574
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,280
and they update it all the time. They really pay attention to that. Also, if you just have

575
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,560
a little bit of time, you can set your availability and they'll generate courseware around that

576
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,920
or you can go check out some of their nuggets. These are just like deep dives into one topic,

577
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,960
six to 10 to 20 to 60 minutes long. Like this one's manipulating logs with SED. That's a

578
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,980
new one. I like that a lot. I like getting your announcements too. If you have a great

579
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,560
new success from Linux Academy, like you got a new cert or you passed a course or you got

580
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,880
a great mark on your review, let me know. Tweet me, at chrislas. I like to cover those

581
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,000
too. Those are really cool. Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and see what I've been talking

582
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,320
about. 33% discount's great and you can try it out. It includes the cost of a virtual

583
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,760
machine when you spin that up with the courseware. It's really cool. Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

584
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,640
and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program. Now, I'm not trying

585
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,800
to be chicken little. I'm not trying to run around with my head cut off, but these latest

586
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,540
numbers are no good. We've got to talk about gaming on Linux just really quick. A couple

587
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,520
of different places, Ferronics has their post up. I have that linked in the show notes.

588
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,720
Boilingsteam.com has their post up. Shadow of Mordor, the latest big, big game to come

589
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,440
to Linux. We covered it in the news segment on the Linux Action Show. It's such a big

590
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,600
game. I don't normally do that anymore. And so, Boiling Point Steam had an i7 rig with

591
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:36,800
an Intel GTX 680, eight gigabytes of RAM on Ubuntu 1504 and Windows 10 Pro, both 64 bit.

592
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,160
And the results are in and they're real bad, you guys. So, on Windows, he was able to get

593
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:50,920
81 frames per second on max. On Ubuntu, 50 frames per second. Average frames was 55 frames

594
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:58,660
per second on Windows, 30 frames per second on Ubuntu. They tried it on another rig, one

595
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:05,760
with the GTX 980 and the i7, four gigahertz. Again, Ubuntu, 1504, 64 bit this time and

596
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:15,080
Windows 8. Windows 8.1, actually. Oh, no. Max frames per second, 152 frames per second

597
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:24,600
on Windows, 114 on Ubuntu. 107 was the average on Windows. It was really 108. And on Ubuntu,

598
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:31,080
it was 73. Man, that's pretty bad. Now, here's the other thing that sucks. This is just like,

599
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:35,600
boy, that hurts when a brand new game comes out and it just plays horrible on Linux. You

600
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,080
just, you know, you hate to see that. Something else that really kind of you hate to see and

601
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,140
I guess it's just unavoidable. It's the nature of the beast. It's a game, it's the number

602
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:48,840
one gaming platform. It's not too surprising. There's already more Windows 10 Steam gamers

603
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,840
than all Linux distros combined on Steam. Kind of depending on how you break it down.

604
00:48:52,840 --> 00:49:01,880
But 44% of Steam users are running Windows 7, 64 bit. 31% are using Windows 8.1, 64 bit.

605
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:13,140
Windows 10, 64 bit now clocks in at 2.21%. And the 32 bit variant is 0.09%. Yosemite,

606
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:16,160
if you take all the different versions of Yosemite and put them together, Mac OS Yosemite

607
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:24,360
is 1.10%. But if you combine them all together, it gets up to 2.4% for the Mac. All Linux

608
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:33,040
OSes combined that Steam actually tracks, 0.55%. So Windows 10 technically was released

609
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,200
on Wednesday, but people had it for a little while. And it's already surpassed by a pretty

610
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:47,000
fair margin, the Linux number of Steam users. Which doesn't matter at all. Well, I think

611
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,200
it's kind of depressing because I think the line is always... No, it's not. Because those

612
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,360
numbers are skewed immediately. Yeah, yeah. Like for example, the Mordor, oh, the one

613
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:02,960
game performs better. Okay. It's not just one game though. In fact, the really depressing

614
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,040
thing is, and I have this Phronix article linked in the show notes, in a lot of cases

615
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:13,400
native Linux games are only performing slightly better than games that are wrapped in the

616
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:19,160
Eon wrapper. They're only slightly outperforming Wine games. On average, most Linux games with

617
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,880
a few exceptions are performing worse than the Linux counterparts across the board. What

618
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,640
about the Valve statistics that show that... Yeah, that is the Valve, that is the outlier

619
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:34,680
actually. Right, but like Counter-Strike Global Offensive was like 30% better on Linux. I

620
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,400
think it's probably not a matter of... I mean, maybe there is some issue with Linux, but

621
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,120
I think it's also just a matter of how hard they're working on it. And I don't... See,

622
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,520
I think the main line that we always get is, well, wait till Steam OS comes along, and

623
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,960
then Steam OS will solve this. But all these games are not console games. I mean, they're

624
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,600
not going to be great console experiences. And this is... Steam OS isn't going to fix

625
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:59,320
this particular problem. I mean, maybe Linux just isn't a good gaming platform. Is that

626
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:05,600
impossible to admit? Yes, because it hasn't got to the point where it's even been tested

627
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:16,960
yet. There's only been, what, three or four AAA games? And one of them was a Batman Arkham

628
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,880
game that came out that was atrocious in every platform. So they screwed up massively on

629
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,440
every platform, so that's not a metric. Shadow of Mordor, do we know if it was native or

630
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,760
if it's wrapped? Do we even know? No, it's native. Okay, well that's good, but that's

631
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,720
one game that messed up. So there's other games that were wrapped that perform really

632
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:47,040
good, like The Witcher 3. So does it really matter? We can't use any of these metrics

633
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,360
yet because it's making a decision to say that this is not good enough and we're not

634
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:57,800
there yet when we're barely even on the starting line. North Ranger, you think it really does

635
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:03,280
come down to gaming profiles that make drivers optimized for certain games? Yeah, definitely.

636
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:11,360
We had the news the last couple of weeks that changing the name of the binary to fake out

637
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:16,920
the driver, thinking you're Half-Life 2, automatically gives you an extra 30% framerate. Yeah, I

638
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,000
do recall that too. That's a good point. Yeah, I guess I'm somewhere in the middle here,

639
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,860
because I just wanted to kind of open this up for discussion. WW, you have a clarification

640
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:30,160
on Arkham Knight, go ahead. Yeah, Arkham Knight is because of the PC release, which was Windows

641
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,440
only, and they're literally fixing it. So by maybe the end of this month, maybe the

642
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:42,360
start of September, we might get an update to that. There's still that, just because

643
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:47,960
of that alone, that's delayed the Linux port until next year. So you can't even count that

644
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:55,240
among the games that are on Linux yet. So, I mean, it's not even worth to mention it,

645
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:01,840
just because we can't even test it yet. I guess, I wonder if, I just feel like perhaps

646
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,620
the issue is that an operating system like Linux just doesn't necessarily make itself

647
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:13,720
a very good platform for games, because games kind of require the opposite of what an ever-evolving

648
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:19,320
operating system fundamentally provides. And that's why Valve is creating SteamOS. I don't,

649
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,200
but, and I think Valve recognizes this issue, and that's why they want to create SteamOS,

650
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,320
which is a safe landing place where game developers can have certain expectations that will always

651
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:35,080
be met. That's because marketing for Linux is terrible. But is it that? Yeah, all these

652
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,880
factors combined are an issue, yes. I'm not saying that one is better than the other as

653
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,680
far as the sense of why they're doing it. I'm just saying that there's multiple factors

654
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,360
that they're making these decisions on, and that there's more likely that the reason why

655
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,600
we don't have a good gaming infrastructure right now is because it's only been a few

656
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:59,120
years. It's been, like, what, two years at the most that it's been even reasonable, whereas,

657
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:05,560
you know, for a while Steam was ignored on Windows, too. And it took them, like, they've

658
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:09,520
been around for ten years, and it took them, well, no, they've been around twelve years,

659
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:16,520
it took them, like, six or seven years to get any relevancy on Windows. Yeah, I actually,

660
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:23,400
you know, when I, the practical, so here's the practical side of this. And Rekai, by

661
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:32,040
the way, agrees that game profiles make a huge difference. But here's what I see. The

662
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:38,660
games I play, and I don't really give a big crap, the games I play play, oh, fine enough

663
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:42,280
for me, like, the framerate's good enough, like, I don't notice the framerate being slow.

664
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:48,440
And I got so many games in Steam now that I can't play 70% of them. And I recently,

665
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,360
like last weekend, there was, like, a super badass sale for Linux, a SteamOS sale, I hope

666
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:56,440
some of you guys got in on that stuff, because it was sweet. And I picked up, like, this

667
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:01,360
new Mordor game, the Shadow of Mordor, and it runs fine for me. I just picked up, I got,

668
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,640
like, three new games that were, like, crazy cheap, and I'm set now. And, like, we are

669
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:12,440
now at the point with Linux gaming that if you are just not super picky, there is a ton

670
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,860
of selection. And I don't think it's, I don't really think it's a huge gap to go from where

671
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:24,400
we're at now to really being a competitive system. But I don't, I am skeptical that desktop

672
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:29,240
Linux will ever be the right candidate. I think, I think people might maybe one day

673
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,520
go from dual booting desktop Linux and maybe even SteamOS or something. I mean, I don't

674
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,360
know exactly. Because it just seems like all these games keep coming out, and the developers

675
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:45,200
are just unwilling. It's not even, like, Linux is incapable of it. It's that these developers

676
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:50,520
are unwilling to put the effort into it because of preconceptions or because of technical

677
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,920
limitations that they don't know what to work around to or whatever. I mean, they could

678
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,440
have a legitimate reason for all I know. But they don't seem to be willing to put the effort

679
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,680
into it. And if SteamOS promises to solve some of these problems, even if it's just

680
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:09,320
through marketing and branding and Valve brand loyalty, maybe we'll start to see the performance

681
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,520
on SteamOS inch up and inch up and inch up. And, you know, I'm sure we'll trickle, I'm

682
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,400
sure that'll trickle down to other Linux distributions. I'm sure there'll be wikis updated on how

683
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,400
to take advantage of those things, so.

684
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,560
Well, couldn't you argue that that was true even, like, years ago before SteamOS existed

685
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,860
and that developers never cared in the first place. And now that SteamOS exists, they are

686
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:32,400
starting to care and it's been proven by all these games actually coming to SteamOS.

687
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,160
Yeah, I mean, I guess. Right, yeah. Okay, yeah. Yes, the existence of the games, it

688
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:44,520
proves they care to some degree. I'm just, I'm major disappointed that the games consistently

689
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,120
are not performing as good as they could. And I don't...

690
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:51,960
Right, I'm just saying that they're, the changing of the developer's opinion is actually happening.

691
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,440
That's my point. I mean, regardless of whether it's working or not, as far as, like, how

692
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,160
good the performance is and stuff, I don't know. Not because I don't game that much,

693
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,160
but...

694
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,880
That's the problem. Don't you think that's the problem is, like, they are, like, testing

695
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,040
it out. Like, they're putting their toe in the water. Yay! At the same time, they're

696
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:13,840
doing such a crappy job that the Linux market share is really just not responding. You know,

697
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,800
it's not increasing. It's not, like, they're just not doing a good enough job to really

698
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,800
move the needle and that could send the wrong signal.

699
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,720
They're not doing a good enough job, but that's only because they're not doing enough. They're

700
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,860
not doing as many games. There's, like, I mean, as far as, like, AAA games, how many

701
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,640
are there on Linux? Five, maybe?

702
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,400
Yeah, I mean, there's, like, three that I think are really great, yeah. But, yeah. Yeah.

703
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,920
Yeah, and there's recently a new SteamOS exclusive, which is quite adorable.

704
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,240
Yeah, I'm just talking about AAA and the AAA on, like, not whether they're good or not,

705
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,440
just the fact that they have, like, marketing behind, like, EA or something.

706
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,700
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, and they were available on other platforms first

707
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,440
in those cases as well.

708
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,760
Yeah. And, like, Borderlands is awesome. And it's one of the AAAs that's available on

709
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,120
Linux and it runs great.

710
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,560
Mm-hmm. I do enjoy Borderlands a lot.

711
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,560
Yeah.

712
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:08,040
There are some examples where it is working and it's fantastic, because I never even heard

713
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,680
of that. I mean, I've heard of the game. I never bothered playing it. And when it came

714
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,600
on Linux, it's, like, awesome. I'm playing it.

715
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:18,240
Well, actually, most of my experiences, like I say, like, I say this with sort of a disclaimer

716
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,120
that for me, the problem is really not that bad. Like, I don't actually, I consider myself

717
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:28,540
to be kind of picky and I don't really notice any problems until I go read these blogs or

718
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:32,680
these reviews. And I'm, like, oh, well, I guess that's an issue. I don't particularly

719
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:37,720
have that issue, I guess. I mean, I suppose. And so then I'm, like, well, I guess it could

720
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:41,960
be a little bit better. But for me, I'm not too picky. Usually, I just kind of, I'm more

721
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,800
casual these days. So it's not as big of a deal for me.

722
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:51,360
I think it's the issue of these blogs are taking the example of Happy Days and Jumping

723
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,360
the Shark.

724
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:58,520
Oh, wow, dude. All right. Okay. Very good. I want to, speaking about Jumping the Shark,

725
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:03,120
the Linux action show is about to jump the shark in a really big way. Oh, my God, I hope

726
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,000
you guys don't freak out. I'm going to tell you about what we have coming up. But first,

727
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,560
I want to tell you about our friends at Ting. Go to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com. Ting

728
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,920
is on a mission to make mobile make sense. Why? Well, actually, because you're going

729
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,000
to love the way Ting rates work. Ting makes it simple.

730
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,040
Ting keeps rates simple. We don't make you pick a plan. Instead, you just use your phone

731
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,760
as you normally would. How much you use determines how much you pay each month. You can have

732
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,320
as many devices as you want on one account. That's good, because when you use more, you

733
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:37,360
pay less per minute, message or megabyte of data. Your usage plus six dollars per active

734
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:42,520
device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill. Simple. That's what we mean

735
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:48,540
when we say mobile. That makes sense. Now, if you go to linux.ting.com, you get a twenty

736
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:53,080
five dollar discount off your first Ting device or twenty five dollars off your service. If

737
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:58,800
you have a Ting compatible device, they have GSM and CDMA too. You probably have a compatible

738
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,560
device. This is a great way to try out Ting. They also have SIM cards available for just

739
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:07,160
nine dollars. If you want GSM or CDMA in a device, like a security device, like my buddy

740
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,840
Chase does, that's a great way to go. If you want, like Noah's got a bat phone. He picked

741
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,960
up a super tiny bat phone off of eBay that he gives the number to me. Hello, isn't that

742
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,320
neat? I got it. And his wife. Isn't that adorable? I think he probably gives it to a couple other

743
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,920
people too. But I know I'm on that list and I don't even know the number anymore. I just

744
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,800
have it written down somewhere. And it's great because he just pays for what he uses. We

745
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,440
have all kinds of devices. A couple, if you want some great budget devices, because Ting

746
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,440
has also an early termination relief program. So you can really start stacking up the savings

747
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,520
when you go to linux.ting.com and you take advantage of their ETF if you're on a duopoly

748
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,120
contract. And then you can go grab something like the Motorola E second gen. It's just

749
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:50,280
a real nice baseline Android phone. No contract. No early termination fee. And it's unlocked.

750
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:55,280
And you can go get it. You can go get an unlocked GSM phone from Ting right now. They have the

751
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:00,160
blue studio, which is a nice phone for $209. The one plus, you know about that. They got

752
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:05,000
the iPhones. They got all the Galaxy devices. They have some really good MiFi devices as

753
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:11,080
well. I really liked that one with the OLED screen. Motorola G though. And the Motorola

754
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,000
G is really nice. And so is the Moto X2. All of those are over on Ting. If you go to linux.ting.com,

755
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,280
they'll take $25 off. You can get an ETF. They'll help you get out of that contract

756
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,800
if you're in one. And then you're all done. You got an unlocked phone. You're no more

757
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,680
contracts. Ting is really nice. And if you got a few devices, you should really check

758
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,480
out the Ting savings calculator. It's kind of nuts. You put your current usage in there

759
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,200
and you'll be pretty surprised. Also, nice thing about Ting, no whole customer service.

760
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:39,880
You can call them at 1855-TING-FTW and a real human being answers the phone. Go to linux.ting.com.

761
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:45,080
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged L program. Yeah, you see

762
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:52,280
that? I'm multilingual now. Not offensive at all. Speaking of offensive, man am I fired

763
01:01:52,280 --> 01:02:00,000
up. I am so effing angry right now. It really burns me more than you might actually think

764
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,720
and I'll tell you why. So you might have noticed this week that the Linux action show was pulled

765
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,520
down from YouTube. Episode 306, Windows 10 versus Linux. Boy, what a great title for

766
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,120
YouTube too. And not many people had had it by the time we posted it. I did a little search

767
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:18,960
before the show went out. So boy, that was going to be a good episode for YouTube. Windows

768
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,920
10 versus Linux. And it got pulled down by Conde Nast because we played a video from

769
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:30,840
Wired in the news segment of the show. Now the Linux action show is going in on its 10th

770
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:38,560
year now. It has done news every single week, well that we've been on the air, for 10 years.

771
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:43,620
And in this particular episode, we were covering a Linux powered rifle and we were covering

772
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:48,320
the fact that A, Wired was covering it and B, the fact that Wired was doing video and

773
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:52,840
C, the production of that video. So not only were we covering the news item itself, but

774
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:59,240
we were actually also covering the video as part of our coverage. That my friends, I consider

775
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:04,280
to be fair use under the US copyright law. But the way YouTube systems work, even though

776
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:09,720
it's content creators that make YouTube possible, that allow them to sell ads that made YouTube

777
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,920
actually exist, even though it was stupid cats playing keyboards and people getting

778
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:18,160
kicked in crotches, it was the content creators that made YouTube possible. And now it's the

779
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:24,240
content creators that are guilty first. And then we get to try to plead for innocence.

780
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:28,600
I filed a dispute Sunday evening. It is now Tuesday at 3 o'clock in the afternoon as I

781
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,740
record this. We have lost all potential to gain any revenue off this show. Of course

782
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:37,880
YouTube revenue sucks anyway, so it would have been $10 at best. But now, we're three

783
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:43,400
days into it after release, we won't make any revenue. Even though in my opinion, it

784
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:52,280
was absolutely legal for us to play that video. And the really burning thing about this is,

785
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:56,680
and this is the thing you don't even know, is for this particular episode of the Linux

786
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:02,200
Action Show, a real shit ton of effort went into making the video presentation possible.

787
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:07,780
In fact, I had to mow down three of my Linux laptops that ran Linux and had to install

788
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:11,360
Windows 10 on those things, trying to get them to hook up to our video presentation

789
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:15,140
system so I could actually demonstrate visually the things I was talking about in the video

790
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:19,500
version of the Linux Action Show. I destroyed three of my Linux laptops to get them hooked

791
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:24,840
up between Windows 10, the drivers, and our capture rig, so I could display Windows 10

792
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:29,800
in the video. And then a couple of hours after that video goes up on YouTube, Google has

793
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:34,920
it pulled down because, well, Conde Nast thinks they should. Even though the show has been

794
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,480
around for almost 10 years, we've been publishing on YouTube for a very long time. We have thousands

795
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:45,240
of videos up there. They don't care. They pull us down. After all that work, I spent

796
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:51,260
two days just to get the video setup working. I spent more time just to do the visual presentation

797
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:55,160
than I actually had to spend on the content of the show itself. Thankfully, Windows 10

798
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,960
kind of writes its own review. But still, the point remains, I spent more time to get

799
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,000
the visual aspect working than I did on the actual content just to get my video pulled

800
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,840
down. Now, thankfully, I don't rely on YouTube as a primary distribution platform, and I

801
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:12,520
never will because of crap like this. But, man, is it a kick in the nuts when we're already

802
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:17,360
dealing with some other problems. One you may have noticed, if you were somehow able

803
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:21,480
to say, oh, I don't know, download the video from our website or watch it in HTML5 from

804
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,920
our website, but you might have noticed how crappy Noah's video looks. In fact, it seems

805
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,200
like Okiwan, Linux fan, did. He says, I love the show, but Noah's camera is really distracting.

806
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,720
I know it's a Linux solution, but the quality of the show, which used to look so good, now

807
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,760
looks unprofessional. Sorry I have to say it, but it's a fact. I tried to get a friend

808
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,660
who was new to Linux to watch the show, and that was his first comment. When I see videos

809
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:47,600
like this on YouTube, I immediately switch to another video. The Linux action show is

810
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:51,800
well produced. Why drag the production quality back 10 years? I think the free software crusade

811
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:57,480
has drifted a little too far into the Stallman dimension. I'd like to hear what other viewers

812
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,760
have to think. One last thing. Why does Crystal look so good? If you're not going full Linux

813
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,840
solution and production, why go halfway the expense of the show? Just bring it up, because

814
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:11,200
I care. Well, obviously I have to look good so that way my hair looks good. I mean, hello.

815
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:16,340
That's obvious. This is something that Noah and I have struggled with a lot. We want the

816
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:20,220
Linux action show to be produced and edited and created and all that stuff as much as

817
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:25,760
possible under Linux as we can. But to do high-resolution video production sometimes

818
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:30,360
requires sort of using proprietary solutions, which we have been fighting with since Noah

819
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:35,620
became a co-host. And so you see the different versions of that in the video. Like sometimes

820
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:39,720
his video looks a little weird. Sometimes it looks like he's from 1980 and it needs

821
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:44,380
anti-aliasing applied. And sometimes it's fine. It's been all over the board and sometimes

822
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:54,520
he's in studio. But as Obi-Wan Linux fan here, or Oki-Wan, Oki and whatever, Oki and Wan,

823
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:00,000
whatever. Let's just call him Obi-Wan Linux fan. That's nice. As he points out, it does

824
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,320
look unprofessional. And that really does burn me. It really gets me upset, because

825
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:10,240
we work really hard on the show. And that's got us thinking. You know, the show is actually

826
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:15,680
coming up on its 10th year in June, in next June, June 10th. So we're coming up on it.

827
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:23,000
And 10 years is a long time for any person to do any one thing. And I don't really tend

828
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,160
to stick with anything, actually. It's kind of funny. Somehow I've managed to stick with

829
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:31,200
these shows. But for the most part, I got to be honest, I can't even stand to drive

830
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:37,100
the same route to work every day. I sometimes stay at the studio to avoid it. Sometimes

831
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:42,720
I drive a different route. Monotony drives me insane. So somehow I've managed to do the

832
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,760
Linux action show for almost 10 years now. I don't know how that's happened. And all

833
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,480
these shows, really. And so it's been, recently we've been discussing how to get the show

834
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:58,360
more genuine to the fact that we cover open source and Linux. And every time we go down

835
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:03,860
this route, we always run up against the wall of video production. It's always the main

836
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:08,060
issue is video production. It's always been the problem. It's why we use Wirecast now.

837
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:14,880
It's why we edit under Final Cut. It's just never up to snuff.

838
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:21,040
So that's really been something we've discussed a lot since before Noah was even a co-host.

839
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,200
And so we've decided this Friday to try something a little different. Now you saw the beginnings

840
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:30,080
of this last week, perhaps. You might have noticed that we did a remastered version of

841
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,760
episode 103 of Linux Unplugged. Multi-track recording, each person, each presenter, and

842
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,680
the Mumble Room gets their own track. And then our editor, HamRadio, goes through and

843
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:42,520
cleans up the individual spots. And then he turns it over and passes it on to our other

844
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:46,800
editor, Rekai. It's double the work, really. And it's a process we don't really have worked

845
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,760
out yet. But the sound is much better. It's much more presentable. It sounds much more

846
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:56,820
professional. And honestly, it's much more doable under Linux using open source technology.

847
01:08:56,820 --> 01:09:02,800
Or hardware, even. And we have a limited budget as well. And the kind of money, you know,

848
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:07,880
like say you have $6,000 in a year to spend on hardware. Well, the kind of distance you

849
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,320
get out of audio hardware is just unbelievably more than you get out of video. I mean, one

850
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:16,920
camera can cost $6,000. So we've kicked this back and forth a little bit. And what we want

851
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,680
to try this Friday, live, is an audio version of the Linux Action Show. Now that doesn't

852
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:25,440
mean the video is going away. It's going to be more like Linux Unplugged for one episode,

853
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,480
maybe two. We're going to try it for a little while and see what we do. And what that means

854
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:33,680
is we're going to build it quality first. We're going to try to get it to sound as good

855
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,040
as possible. We're going to try to focus. When I put together a segment, I'm going to

856
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,480
focus on the information, not on the visual presentation of it. And we're going to try

857
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:47,280
to put it all together and then release it on the regular Sunday release date with basically

858
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:51,880
a version of how Linux Unplugged is done now with the screen showing some visuals. But

859
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,080
the primary focus will be on the content. Now, we're not going to switch the whole show

860
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:00,920
to this. We're trying this out as a concept because it's something that excites us. And

861
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,600
after you've been doing something for 10 years, it's nice to get pretty excited about it again,

862
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,560
to try to have a new idea to make it really, really good. And we even have an idea, and

863
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,680
it's something I will be willing to share as we go along, but we even have an idea to

864
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:18,200
make remote recording, local recording of guests very straightforward. The idea being

865
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,840
eventually, and we won't be able to nail it in the first or even second attempt, but the

866
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:28,640
attempt is to really have the best sounding show possible, really something that sounds

867
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:34,880
unbelievably amazing, local in studio if possible, as much as we can, and really because we have

868
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:42,360
so much we can apply to that. And it is going to only be an experiment, a temporary experiment.

869
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:46,280
We're going to try recording on a Friday to give us extra time for extra editing production.

870
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:51,060
Normally we record on a Sunday, and we have it out a few hours later. That's an amazing

871
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:55,720
turnaround time, I mean not to brag, but really for like an hour and a half HD video podcast

872
01:10:55,720 --> 01:11:01,440
that also releases in several formats, including audio. To get that out in a few hours is pretty

873
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,860
good turnaround. Most podcasts don't even get that with audio only. So what we're going

874
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:10,160
to do is record on a Friday, A, to give us a little time to sort of experiment with things,

875
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:14,720
and B, to give our editors time to put it all together and still release a video version

876
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:19,160
so those of you who consume last in video will still have something to watch. And hopefully

877
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:24,000
it'll sound better, and you'll see while we'll hear, you'll hear why we are trying this.

878
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,120
And we'll take these lessons we learned from this and see how we can incorporate them into

879
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:32,480
the main show or what direction we want to go. It's a big change, and if it's something

880
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,960
we go with permanently, it's something we'll be very upfront about. But it's something

881
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,980
we're at least going to experiment with for a little while. And I'm a little unsure of

882
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:46,280
how people react to it, because I know for some people the video component is a big aspect

883
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:51,320
of the show. It's something that, you know, and it is nice to be able to showcase some

884
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,320
of this stuff, you know. When there's a new version of KDE or GNOME or Windows 10, it's

885
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,360
nice to be able to actually visually capture it. And I'm not saying that's going to go

886
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:02,720
away completely. I still want to have some elements of that. But what we would probably

887
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:09,760
do instead is what we would try to do is have individual video releases when necessary.

888
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:15,480
So if something is inherently video-centric, an interview on location at Red Hat, a demonstration

889
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:20,800
of an open source application or a desktop environment or Windows 10 or something great

890
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:27,600
that happens down at LinuxCon on August 17th, we can still individually publish those as

891
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,360
YouTube videos or as download videos like we did with OSCON. If you go back and look

892
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:36,160
at our OSCON 2015 coverage, we individually published every single video interview we

893
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:40,900
did. So that way the audio audience, which is the majority of the last audience, that's

894
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:47,640
somewhere between 60% and 70%. It depends on the episode. My best guess is a lot of

895
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,440
you just kind of move around. But the majority are audio. And we realized, well, if the majority

896
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:56,160
are audio and we're talking about the Prism laptop or we're talking about Firefox WebVR

897
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:00,000
or we're talking about keyboardio, you guys might want to be able to see that. So for

898
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,040
the audio listeners, in the show notes of OSCON 2015, we individually uploaded and

899
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:11,520
published the interviews. And this is an area I think we want to explore a lot more, is

900
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:17,800
if we have an audio version of last, we could individually publish the video elements still

901
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,680
for viewing. And on top of that, there's an element of this that I haven't told you about

902
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:25,600
yet. And I'm not going to tell you about it a lot yet because it's still in development,

903
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:31,280
but there is a plan somewhere in the September timeframe where I'm going to go on the road

904
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:38,400
and try to do some of these shows while traveling. And if we can nail this down during this time

905
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,960
period, this will make it much more possible for me to be able to do this from the road.

906
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,600
And so there is a bit of an ulterior motive. We're sort of experimenting with some ideas

907
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,840
that we might need to apply later on down the road. And that's something else that we're

908
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,960
going to be experimenting with. So that's why we might do one or two episodes of it

909
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:59,240
because there could be an element of that that we need to cover. So yeah. All right.

910
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:03,560
And then like Konseco points out in the chat room, this is a good time to try out a new

911
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:11,040
Ardora release. Yeah, exactly. And it's a big change, especially since we've been doing

912
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:15,000
video. We've been more and more video focused really since episode around, what, I don't

913
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,640
know, 100, 120-ish. We started transitioning to video. And then 100 episodes after that

914
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:28,280
was pretty serious. And I think a lot of people, I think we have a good balance in our audience

915
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:32,520
of cord cutters and people that watch video primarily and a lot of people who commute.

916
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:37,520
I mean, the download numbers suggest a lot of more people download over audio on a podcast

917
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,040
catcher. But the video is still a pretty significant portion. And we have Roku apps and TiVo apps

918
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:47,220
and all and XBMC apps. So we want to still continue to deliver video as well. And I'm

919
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:51,480
just going to try to experiment with striking a balance there and seeing what works. Because

920
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:57,360
I want, if nothing else, I want you to be able to listen to Linux Action Show and go

921
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,720
like, damn, you can make a show that sounds that good under Linux? I mean, things like

922
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:06,240
that. And I don't want you to watch and go, man, why does that video look like that? It's

923
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:15,320
distracting from the content. And it's not that I'm against using proprietary software

924
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:19,880
and proprietary hardware in the production of a show that talks about open source software.

925
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:24,440
It's just it chews at me every single week. And so for a little while, I want to try doing

926
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,760
it. And we won't make a complete transition because this is going to be a temporary thing.

927
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:33,460
But it's kind of putting a test balloon up and seeing how it goes. And we'll still continue

928
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:37,480
to do video production and continue to test all of that. Now, does anybody have any thoughts

929
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:41,240
or comments before we wrap up today? Because I know I just kind of dropped a big bomb there.

930
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:49,280
But anybody have any immediate reactions? Go ahead. The room's open. No? No? You sure?

931
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:55,960
Because all the software you want is free and available on the Linux platform. Well,

932
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,920
I'm a commuter, so I've never watched the video version. You're kidding me. You've never

933
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:08,400
watched the video version? Never. Yeah, I am slightly terrified by the fact that if

934
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:14,280
we make this transition and we discover that it's not a huge deal, that all of these years

935
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:19,260
focused on video have been wasted. I'm a little worried about that. Because there was a time

936
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:22,720
when it was a really big controversy that we launched video, where people have been

937
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:27,120
around for a long time. That really blew up on our face when we said we're switching to

938
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,880
video. People really were upset. And so now I'm kind of saying we're going to refocus

939
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:36,440
on audio. So this week's episode, our plan for Linux Unplugged is to, and of course I

940
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,760
probably should have said this earlier, but our plan is to delay the MP3 and AUG versions

941
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,440
of the show. We'll release the video versions as fast as we normally can. And we're going

942
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:50,520
to release the AUG and MP3 versions as the multi-track remastered. Sounds really good

943
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,920
because we figure those people are the people in the car, most likely. And those are the

944
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,260
people that need the remastered version the most. So if you're subscribed to the Linux

945
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:03,480
Unplugged MP3 feed or AUG feed this week, it might be a little delayed, but the result

946
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:08,520
is you'll get the higher, better produced version, I guess is a better way to put it,

947
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,440
the better produced version of the Unplugged program, which hopefully is better for headphone

948
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:19,800
users and commuters. And we also have a version, we have a version of it, episode 103, that

949
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,000
you can go find in the subreddit if you didn't get a chance to listen to that. And I'd like

950
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,040
to hear your feedback. We'll always, we have feedback threads over at LinuxActionShow.reddit.com.

951
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:30,280
I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. You kind of now know what's coming up. Not everybody

952
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:35,680
who watches last and listens to last listens to this show by a long shot. And so those

953
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,440
of you who do kind of have a little bit of the inside scoop of what's coming up. And

954
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:44,480
I just want you to know, I just, to recap, the core reasons behind it is we really want

955
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:50,160
to make something that is fun for us to make and gets us excited to produce. First of all,

956
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:56,040
I want to be excited to make it and creating something new is, it honestly gets me excited

957
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,920
in a way I haven't been excited in a long time. And just, you know, experimenting like

958
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:02,680
this. And it's a podcast. Like if you don't get to do this with a podcast, when can't

959
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:06,000
you, you know, it's not a radio show, it's not a television show. Like if you're ever

960
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,400
going to do something crazy, this is a place to do it. So that's, you know, keep that

961
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,640
in mind. And second thing is, is honestly what we really want to do is create something

962
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:19,400
that's really truly genuine to producing content under Linux. And we have ideas to make it

963
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,400
so if we really did this, we could have, it would require some internet connection, ISDN

964
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:27,280
connections or some hardware, something over IP. But really, you know, you flip a few hardware

965
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:32,560
buttons and we could really do this entire thing under Linux eventually. If we got there.

966
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,560
And that really excites me. And that's something else we're going towards. And then last but

967
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:42,640
not least, I really think we can, we can experiment in a new way with the medium. We can do something

968
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,840
we haven't been able to really do is create stories around open source and around projects

969
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,240
that are truly fascinating and genuinely interesting to listen to. And that's something else I've

970
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,840
wanted to do for a long time. And something we might experiment with. I mean, we might

971
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:00,360
not when the feedback might be so hostile and so negative that we chicken out. But currently,

972
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:03,280
that's where our momentum is at. And I hope you understand it. And I wanted to share it

973
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,560
with you guys. I know it's a little cray, but you stick in there and you can join us

974
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:10,760
live on Friday. We'll have it up on the Jupiter Broadcasting calendar, jupitabroadcasting.com

975
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:17,520
slash calendar. And see how it goes at jplive.tv. All right. Wow. Man, I feel good. I feel like

976
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,200
that was a little bit of a counseling session for me. Like I had a big secret that I needed

977
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:25,320
to share with you guys. And now I've gotten it off my chest. That's nice. Thank you for

978
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:29,600
listening. Thank you. Thank you. Now also, I'd like to get your contents, ideas, topics,

979
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,240
suggestions, feedback, linuxactionshow.reddit.com. I say this every week. I kind of feel like

980
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:40,680
a jerk, but really, we get no love for Linux Unplugged. Subreddit just gets no love. Go

981
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:44,400
over there and love on this show, won't you? Jeez. You know Wes? He didn't show up this

982
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,080
week because no love. I'm sorry, Wes. If you're listening, I'm sorry, buddy. They love you.

983
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:52,960
They just didn't say anything. It's sad. It's sad. No, really, it's fine. linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

984
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,240
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact to send us feedback, jplive.tv to watch us

985
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:01,360
live. We do it live Tuesdays at Pacific. You can get it Pacific time. You can go to jupitabroadcasting.com

986
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,440
slash calendar. You get it in your time. Alright, everybody. Thanks so much for tuning this week's

987
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:33,360
episode of Linux Unplugged. See you right back here next week.

988
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:44,120
I love it. I don't know, Wimpy. You are like a master podcaster now. You are good at the

989
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:49,080
tease. So as we're signing off, Wimpy says, the next USC mailing list discussion could

990
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,800
be show content. Wimpy, what do you know? What do you know?

991
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,800
Ask Popey.

992
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,800
Popey left a while ago.

993
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,800
Has he left?

994
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,800
Has he left?

995
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,800
Come on. Come on. Just give me a little tease. Give me a little tease.

996
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,800
I don't know anything. I don't know anything. Just keep an eye on the Ubuntu Devil mailing list.

997
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,800
Okay. Okay. I see. I see how it is. Very good.

998
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,800
Or just subscribe to Softpedia because I'm sure they'll pick up on it.

999
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:13,800
Right. No kidding, right?

1000
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,800
Hey-oh.

1001
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,800
Hey-oh. So all right. JBtitles.com chatroom. Go pick our title. Now the show's over. Am I crazy,

1002
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,800
you guys? What do you think of the test we're going to do for last?

1003
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,800
I don't think you have to see it. You absorb the content. I mean, if you're going to do something,

1004
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,800
like you said, with Linux Unplugged where it's video enhanced, I mean, that's perfectly – I mean,

1005
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,800
that's better than most of the other podcasts I listen to.

1006
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:42,800
Okay. Software Center Woz isn't bad by Creepy Uncle. Yeah. I mean, I suppose that's true.

1007
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,800
Yeah. And, you know, some people think the green screen looks old, too, and I agree.

1008
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,800
We didn't want to really use the green screen very long. In fact, for a little while,

1009
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:55,800
we thought about just trying to use the studio shot. But, yeah. I don't know.

1010
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,800
Software Center Woz, JBtitles.com.

1011
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,800
Go ahead, Debbie.

1012
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,800
I think it's better that you experiment and find something that works overall well for you,

1013
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:13,800
well for the audience, and just doesn't put that stress on you because people can tell, I'm sure.

1014
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:18,800
Yeah. I hate being stressed out. That's the other thing is I hate – what happens so often is I have to

1015
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,800
troubleshoot something video production related for the first 10 or 15 minutes for a show.

1016
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,800
So 10 or 15 minutes before the show starts, I'm not thinking about the show at all.

1017
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,800
I'm thinking about this video issue, and it really gets me frustrated.

1018
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,800
Alex, you wanted to mention something?

1019
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:39,800
Yeah. One of the features of video I liked really much is that I got to see the chat logs.

1020
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:48,800
And I would like if they would be saved and published in text form if you are going to give up video.

1021
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,800
We've thought about it, but we'd probably be showing the chat room more in the video version if we did that.

1022
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:58,800
But the only reason I don't do that is because all it really takes is for somebody to just log a chat client

1023
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,800
into the chat room and set their buffer, and then you have that.

1024
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,800
Yes, but if I'm not online at the time –

1025
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,800
Yeah, that's true. There's probably a great system that does this.

1026
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,800
If anybody out there knows or wants to set us up on it, let me know.

1027
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:19,800
All right. So miles of Wi-Fi is not bad either. I kind of like that www.

1028
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,800
JBtitles.com, JBtitles.com, everybody.

1029
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:29,800
Speaking for myself, Chris, if you're going to get rid of the video feed as far as being able to see you and Noah,

1030
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,800
I think it'd be nice to at least have the video feed of the chat room.

1031
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,800
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1032
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,800
And if we did interviews and stuff in that episode, some of them would be audio only,

1033
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,800
but if they're on location, they might still be video.

1034
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:45,800
And like in Unplugged, I just played that video clip of Noah.

1035
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:49,800
The only thing is I don't totally want to commit to that because I've –

1036
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,800
at least just in my real initial sort of last run,

1037
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:57,800
I've noticed I seem to get better, more genuine conversations with people when I do audio interviews

1038
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,800
because they don't have a camera in their face.

1039
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,800
And so I don't want to commit to doing a bunch of video interviews because if I can get a better interview

1040
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:08,800
when I use a little portable Zoom recorder, that's what I'm going to do.

1041
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,800
I mean, the interviews I got at OSCON with our audio, the people are much more relaxed,

1042
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,800
the conversations are more jovial and joking and funner to listen to

1043
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,800
because they're not all freaked out by a camera.

1044
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,800
And I just can't ignore that.

1045
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:25,800
And that was the other thing that sort of led me down this path was we went to OSCON

1046
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,800
and the interviews we did on audio, man, we banged those things out so fast

1047
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:34,800
and they went so smooth and so natural and I had such a good range to pick from

1048
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,800
and I had so much room to clean up mistakes and cut out things that were just dumb or superfluous.

1049
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:46,800
And I was able to get through all four, five, or six, or seven clips we played in like an hour.

1050
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:53,800
It was just like for my availability, I was able to do more and the people sounded better

1051
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:57,800
and I was able to put the Zoom recorder in my pocket when I was done.

1052
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,800
It was really nice.

1053
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,800
Yeah, I know, the hair, right, wimpy the hair. Yeah, that's true.

1054
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,800
Well, see, the thing is...

1055
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,800
I don't know what they're talking about.

1056
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:11,800
The thing is wimpy, some people like the hair.

1057
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,800
You know, they like to check in and check in on the hair.

1058
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,800
But I can just every now and then I'll just flash the webcam and prove that yes, the hair is...

1059
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,800
I'm not going off camera because the hair is looking bad.

1060
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,800
The hair is actually looking better than ever. Look at that.

1061
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,800
And it's great looking hair.

1062
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:33,800
I think one day Kogi should sit down wimpy and film wimpy watching an entire episode of Last One.

1063
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,800
Oh yeah, he's never watched it.

1064
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,800
That'd be great.

1065
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,800
I haven't got time for that.

1066
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,800
I have about two and a half hours of commuting a day.

1067
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:46,800
So I've got, as I'm driving in that time, so I've got lots of time for listening to podcasts.

1068
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:51,800
I'm currently subscribed to about 18 or 19 Linux and Floss podcasts at the moment.

1069
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,800
I think that's super common. I think that's the majority.

1070
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:54,800
And you know what?

1071
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,800
You know, even somebody who makes video content, I over time...

1072
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,800
I was watching, you know, four or five video podcasts a week.

1073
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,800
I've whittled it all down. It's all audio now.

1074
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,800
Not intentionally. I just reflected on this a couple of days ago

1075
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,800
and realized that all of the podcasts I listen to now, which...

1076
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,800
Let's see how many... Let's see here.

1077
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,800
Man, there are so many great podcast apps right now.

1078
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,800
If you guys... Pocketcast is really good, by the way.

1079
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,800
Yeah, I use that.

1080
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,800
Yeah, Pocketcast.

1081
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,800
Pocketcast is awesome.

1082
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,800
Yeah, yeah.

1083
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,800
So here's a couple I'm listening to right now.

1084
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:30,800
99% Invisible, Daily Tech News Show, Mission Log, No Agenda, Radio Lab, Surreal,

1085
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,800
This American Life, This Week in Trek, the Accidental Tech podcast.

1086
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,800
Actually, I just actually recently unsubscribed from that.

1087
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,800
Common Sense with Dan Carlin, Everything Sounds.

1088
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:41,800
Oh, that's a good show.

1089
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,800
The History of Rome.

1090
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,800
All of these shows, Random Trek, all of these shows now are all audio.

1091
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:52,800
Like, I've just accidentally, just over time, because I'm using...

1092
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,800
These podcasts are like... These are my time.

1093
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,800
Like, when I'm not hanging out with family or friends

1094
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,800
and I'm driving or I'm working or I'm laying down, like,

1095
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,800
podcasts are for me. They're my time.

1096
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,800
And so I like them in audio.

1097
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:11,800
And our downloads kind of seem to bear that out.

1098
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,800
It's really tough to tell because what I've basically gathered

1099
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,800
by looking at the stats over the years is

1100
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,800
people might find us on YouTube, then they move to the site,

1101
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,800
and they watch us, and then they decide, well, there's no reason to watch.

1102
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:23,800
I could just listen.

1103
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,800
And then every now and then, an interesting episode comes along

1104
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,800
or they have the day off or it's something extra in their routine

1105
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
or they decide they want to watch on the Roku today

1106
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,800
instead of listen while they drive.

1107
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,800
And that time, they decide to go video.

1108
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,800
And so an audio listener maybe once a month goes to video

1109
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
or once every couple of months goes video.

1110
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,800
And so it's not just a clear break.

1111
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,800
I can't just say, well, I'll only lose 10% of the audience

1112
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:51,800
because that's not really true because the other percent

1113
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,800
also watches video from time to time.

1114
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,800
So it's not a clear-cut decision to make.

1115
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,800
And the other thing is it's nice to be able to showcase this stuff

1116
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,800
because if I show you what GNOME looks like today,

1117
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,800
well, when you watch the show in five years,

1118
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,800
it's pretty quaint to look at that.

1119
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,800
Like if you go back and look at the old shows of LAS

1120
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:11,800
and we're showing off old versions of SUSE's KDE desktop,

1121
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,800
it's adorable.

1122
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,800
It's adorable that it looks like that.

1123
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:18,800
And because we had video, we are able to document that in a sense

1124
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:19,800
and capture it.

1125
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:20,800
And it's like a time capsule.

1126
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,800
So I'm cognizant of the fact that LAS does provide that aspect

1127
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,800
of Linux coverage, and it's kind of unique in that respect.

1128
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,800
There's not pretty much any other Linux podcast that does that.

1129
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,800
And so if we stop doing it, nobody's doing it.

1130
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,800
So I don't intend to stop doing that altogether,

1131
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,800
but I just, you know, to be honest with you,

1132
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,800
to be completely frank, what happened was we got into video

1133
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:43,800
because we could.

1134
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,800
Because live streaming became possible,

1135
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:48,800
webcams and cameras became cheap enough,

1136
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,800
and it was approachable.

1137
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,800
And so we did it.

1138
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,800
And we didn't really ask ourselves, does it make a better show?

1139
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,800
It just was, well, technology has enabled us to do the next thing,

1140
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,800
and because we like to follow technology, we do it.

1141
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,800
And we went into it, and we didn't really think about how it's actually

1142
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,800
sort of it sticks you right in the middle of you can't really make

1143
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,800
a fantastic audio show and you can't really make a fantastic video show.

1144
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,800
Like you go back to Noah demonstrating Yubikey or something like that,

1145
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:19,800
and he has to sit there and he has to dictate out the commands to type,

1146
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,800
and the video audience just has to sit there and watch him

1147
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,800
while he wastes time because we don't know if you're listening

1148
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,800
to this tutorial or watching this tutorial.

1149
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,800
And so when you put a tutorial together and you have to consider

1150
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:35,800
the audio audience and the video audience, it's basically, it's a wash.

1151
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,800
It's like trying to write for multi-platform.

1152
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,800
It's like you kind of just get the worst.

1153
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,800
And so we, I feel like, have done a very, not to pat ourselves on the back,

1154
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,800
but I feel like we've done a very good job of trying to walk the line,

1155
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:50,800
of making the show approachable to audio listeners and video listeners.

1156
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,800
But if I'm being honest with you, I could do a hell of a better job

1157
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,800
of making an audio show than I'm doing currently,

1158
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,800
and if I know I'm shooting a video segment that I'm going to release independently

1159
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,800
and embed in the show notes, I can do a hell of a better of a job

1160
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,800
making a video-specific thing too.

1161
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,800
And that's just the reality, is right now we kind of walk the middle line,

1162
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,800
and because we do a fairly good job of it, I think personally,

1163
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,800
people don't really give us a hard time, but I think if you really know content

1164
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,800
and you really know how it works, you can see it.

1165
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:23,800
What about doing both video and audio, but doing less, not on-camera video,

1166
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:26,800
but doing the just like, like the tutorial stuff would be separated

1167
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,800
and embedded in the show notes, but then it would be like other stuff

1168
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,800
where the chat room and then like websites displaying,

1169
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,800
and playing another person's video or something like that

1170
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,800
would still be involved in the main thing.

1171
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,800
Yeah, I think that's probably what we'll kind of get to.

1172
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,800
I don't know, yeah.

1173
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,800
I think it's kind of...

1174
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,800
Yeah, essentially I'm thinking plus more.

1175
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,800
Yeah, yeah, with more...

1176
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,800
And I think the YouTube channel will have more individual releases,

1177
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,800
which actually could be very good for people looking for content

1178
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,800
because shorter content does better on YouTube.

1179
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:00,800
So if we had a 10-minute video explaining how to set up YubaKey,

1180
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,800
people are way more likely to watch that.

1181
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,800
Like I'll give you an example.

1182
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:09,800
We did a digital photo workflow on Linux like a month ago,

1183
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:14,800
and a big part of that segment was how to back up your photos on Linux

1184
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,800
to SpiderOak.

1185
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,800
And then two weeks later we got a question in the subreddit,

1186
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,800
can anybody recommend how I back up my digital photos?

1187
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:28,800
Now the problem is if you're looking to solve that one particular issue,

1188
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,800
how do I back up my photos on Linux,

1189
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,800
you're not very inclined to watch a two-hour video

1190
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,800
on digital Linux photo workflow.

1191
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,800
And so that's what we run into is people don't even know

1192
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,800
that we've answered their question

1193
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,800
because they're not willing to watch an hour, 32-hour video.

1194
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,800
So if we could take those individual pieces

1195
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,800
and still include them in the show but also release them as separate videos,

1196
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,800
we might find that the need for a show like How To Linux pretty much goes away

1197
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,800
and that solves that specific need and issue

1198
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,800
of people trying to solve these problems on Linux.

1199
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,800
It burns me that even in our own community,

1200
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,800
people are constantly asking about apps that we have recommended and suggested,

1201
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,800
how-tos we have done and solved and shown,

1202
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:17,800
and it's not their fault, it's because discovery in a podcast is basically nonexistent.

1203
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:20,800
And if you don't listen to the whole thing every single week,

1204
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,800
you don't get all the information.

1205
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,800
And so my idea is we really focus in on content,

1206
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,800
we focus on making a great audio show that sounds amazing,

1207
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,800
that's great to listen to,

1208
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,800
that you are proud to have somebody who's checking out Linux listen to,

1209
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,800
and when it calls for it, and not every episode,

1210
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:39,800
but when it calls for it, there is separate releases of video

1211
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,800
that either showcase something or walk something through,

1212
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,800
and then we would also just play those as clips in the show as a video in the show itself,

1213
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,800
so you don't have to go out and watch them separately if you don't want to,

1214
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,800
but they are available if you are just out there searching for them.

1215
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,800
We are considering transcribing the audio too,

1216
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,800
where we have been doing that for Women's Tech Radio

1217
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,800
and it's something we are considering doing for Linux Action Show as well.

1218
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,800
Transcribing is good for SEO too,

1219
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:10,800
but the part where it may not have video and it may have video,

1220
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,800
wouldn't that pretty much guarantee that people are,

1221
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:19,800
unless you specifically say in the show that there is a video component in this particular episode,

1222
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,800
no one is going to know about it, no one is going to click it.

1223
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,800
Yeah, and that's no big deal.

1224
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,800
I don't think it's no big deal.

1225
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,800
I think that's going to pull a lot of people out of it,

1226
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,800
because if there are people who just watch video,

1227
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,800
because they want to see the demos and stuff like that,

1228
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:40,800
but then there may or may not be there, then they might not even care.

1229
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,800
So it's two different audiences.

1230
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,800
So here is how that works from a practical standpoint.

1231
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:48,800
In the show we cover it and we say if you would like to see the visual version,

1232
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,800
it's embedded in the show notes.

1233
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,800
And that's all you have to say in the show, that solves that problem.

1234
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,800
Now for people that are just watching the video version,

1235
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,800
they just want the small episodes, the snippets.

1236
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,800
Now when we post the video separate,

1237
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,800
it starts with a splash that says this is a segment from the Linux Action Show,

1238
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,800
like a two-second long splash, boom, goes into the segment,

1239
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:05,800
then it wraps with a wrap screen that says,

1240
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:10,800
you can listen and find the entire episode over at bit.ly slash last 357 or whatever.

1241
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,800
And then they have more information if they want to watch the entire episode.

1242
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,800
But the reality is somebody who wants to watch a four-minute how-to

1243
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,800
is not at all the same person who wants to listen to an hour,

1244
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,800
hour and a half, two-hour podcast.

1245
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:22,800
Certainly.

1246
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:28,800
I actually found last for looking for an how-to,

1247
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:34,800
and it just happened to be in the video, the title of the episode.

1248
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,800
Yeah, right now we basically, we rely on titling.

1249
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,800
That's the truth.

1250
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,800
If it wasn't in the title, I probably wouldn't have found it.

1251
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,800
Yeah, that's why we go through the trouble of being anal about the titles.

1252
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,800
You either have to know it in the title

1253
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,800
or know exactly what to search for in the show notes sometimes

1254
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,800
because I've run into that a few times.

1255
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,800
Yeah, and so by breaking these things out,

1256
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,800
we kind of want to try to solve that problem a bit.

1257
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,800
And then we're hoping that when people see those,

1258
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,800
they're like, oh, there is a podcast behind this.

1259
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,800
And then you listen to it and you're like, oh, this is the real show.

1260
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:09,800
And the idea is you kind of do give away a little bit of the farm,

1261
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:13,800
but the truth is we put the content out there for free anyways.

1262
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,800
So it's not really like it's that big of a deal.

1263
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,800
And people can already time code link on YouTube, and people do.

1264
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,800
Whenever we do get posted to Reddit, which very rarely happens

1265
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,800
because people don't want to watch a two-hour video on Reddit either,

1266
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,800
but when we do, people usually link to the time code,

1267
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,800
which I'm actually totally fine with.

1268
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:33,800
I have no problem with that. I think it's a nice feature.

1269
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,800
Anyways, so yeah, many people do think the show notes are the video description.

1270
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,800
That's true.

1271
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,800
All right, so there you go.

1272
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,800
And so tune in Friday. Let us know what you think, you guys.

1273
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,800
And hopefully all goes well.

1274
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,800
And it turns out to be, you know, it's not going to be perfect on our first attempt,

1275
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:55,800
but hopefully you'll at least get the essence of what we're trying to accomplish.
