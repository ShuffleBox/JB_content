WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
So, it doesn't really fit in with the show, but does anybody have a way they've been impacted

00:06.240 --> 00:10.020
by this Amazon AWS outage that's going on right now?

00:10.020 --> 00:16.000
As we record, AWS and its related services are down for many people.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.120
Chadron's been talking about it for the whole show, pre-show.

00:20.120 --> 00:24.120
I have my customers.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.120
Who had customers?

00:25.120 --> 00:26.120
What happened?

00:26.120 --> 00:34.800
I have a bunch of customers that use AWS to host their PBXs, or dialers, or CRMs in.

00:34.800 --> 00:37.280
Yeah, I think that happened to Ting.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.280
Ting was knocked off.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.760
Their call center was knocked offline for a bit.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.120
They're still able to do web chat and email support.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.240
Yeah, it's interesting.

00:46.240 --> 00:51.640
You can actually see 5,000 calls dropped down to about 3,000 calls, and you're just like,

00:51.640 --> 00:52.640
what just happened?

00:52.640 --> 01:04.160
Yeah, every time this happens, I really am just sort of shocked at the massive dependence

01:04.160 --> 01:05.160
on Amazon.

01:05.160 --> 01:09.880
It is the underlying infrastructure for a lot of the services I use.

01:09.880 --> 01:14.840
Just before the show started, I was trying to get a screenshot for the show notes, and

01:14.840 --> 01:21.460
I tried two different imaging sites that were offline because of AWS being down.

01:21.460 --> 01:26.040
We get asked all the time why we don't host our switch because our switch is all cloud-based

01:26.040 --> 01:27.080
and Amazon.

01:27.080 --> 01:30.840
This is why we actually have our own data centers and our own cloud infrastructure

01:30.840 --> 01:31.840
around ourselves.

01:31.840 --> 01:32.840
Really?

01:32.840 --> 01:36.280
Even though this only happens like once every year, a couple of years, you still feel like

01:36.280 --> 01:37.560
it's worth it, huh?

01:37.560 --> 01:42.600
If your telecom went down once or twice a year because of this, or had problems routing

01:42.600 --> 01:43.600
to the customer...

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
Yeah, telecom.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.160
Boy, that's a tough choice.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.440
Yeah, you're right.

01:48.440 --> 01:55.920
Telecom and medical, just the cost differential there is, I got to imagine, I mean, thousands

01:55.920 --> 01:58.720
and thousands of dollars a month just for a data center.

01:58.720 --> 01:59.720
Not really.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.720
I mean...

02:00.720 --> 02:01.720
Shut your face.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
I'm serious.

02:02.720 --> 02:07.080
When you map it out for the amount of bandwidth, I mean, we're connecting to 10Git connections,

02:07.080 --> 02:08.400
you just can't compare...

02:08.400 --> 02:14.060
AWS, if I went to them and said, I want 30 or right now, it takes about 30 to 40 images

02:14.060 --> 02:15.060
to run each site.

02:15.060 --> 02:18.080
I want 30 images and I want a 10Git connection.

02:18.080 --> 02:23.520
It doesn't, you know, even buying hard $40,000 worth of hardware every year isn't going to...

02:23.520 --> 02:25.600
Yeah, you know, that does add up.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.600
I agree.

02:26.600 --> 02:27.600
That does make sense.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.600
Hmm.

02:28.600 --> 02:32.660
I wonder, I wonder every time this happens, I think to myself, is this the time that people

02:32.660 --> 02:35.560
are going to start looking at other options?

02:35.560 --> 02:40.120
You know, you have to think too, like, even just differentiating a bit.

02:40.120 --> 02:44.560
So not going all crazy and just saying like, no more Amazon, I'm done with Amazon forever,

02:44.560 --> 02:48.640
but just saying, well, I'm going to put some backup resources on DigitalOcean or I'm going

02:48.640 --> 02:51.520
to put some additional storage on ScaleEngine.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.080
It seems like, it just seems like this is...

02:54.080 --> 02:58.200
Every time this happens, I have this conversation and everybody goes, yep, yep, that's the way

02:58.200 --> 02:59.200
to do it.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.200
Yep, yep, yep.

03:00.200 --> 03:04.920
And then another AWS outage happens and here we are, nobody's done it.

03:04.920 --> 03:21.400
This is Linux Unplugged episode 186 for February 28, 2017.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that has so much breaking news this

03:25.760 --> 03:29.040
week, you might as well just call me Shep Smith.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.280
My name is actually Chris.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.640
Hey, Shep.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.640
This is Wes.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.640
Thanks, Wes.

03:33.640 --> 03:34.640
Thanks for going with it.

03:34.640 --> 03:35.640
What's your new name now?

03:35.640 --> 03:38.920
I kind of lost steam and then I realized, if I go as Shep, do I have to try to do an

03:38.920 --> 03:39.920
accent?

03:39.920 --> 03:40.920
Oh, yeah.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.920
Okay, maybe I'll spare everybody that then.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.800
We do have a really great episode.

03:45.800 --> 03:50.120
So much stuff has happened literally as we're recording today and I'm not even talking about

03:50.120 --> 03:55.800
the big AWS outage, no, no, no, we have big news stories on items and gadgets and projects

03:55.800 --> 03:56.800
that we love.

03:56.800 --> 03:57.800
Oh my.

03:57.800 --> 03:58.800
Yeah, really.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.480
And all of them are like things that everybody's been buzzing about this week.

04:02.480 --> 04:07.120
So we'll jump into that, get those all banged out for you guys right away so you'll get

04:07.120 --> 04:08.800
your veggies right up front.

04:08.800 --> 04:09.800
Ooh, tasty.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.440
Then we're going to reignite the debate.

04:12.440 --> 04:16.080
Is swap on modern systems actually necessary?

04:16.080 --> 04:21.040
I kind of felt like we had this settled and then Red Hat released this big old document.

04:21.040 --> 04:24.640
Red Hat weighs in with their official documentation and advisories.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.640
Those guys.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.640
Oh my goodness.

04:26.640 --> 04:33.080
And then later on in the show, Telegram, some perhaps shenanigans afoot.

04:33.080 --> 04:38.640
It looks like what was once promised to be open source may actually be closed up.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.640
Now they haven't said anything officially, but the tea leaves look bad.

04:42.640 --> 04:46.200
We'll cover that if you're a Telegram user, it's going to be relevant to your interest.

04:46.200 --> 04:51.120
And then Noah warned us all, but an internet connected teddy bear has leaked millions of

04:51.120 --> 04:53.000
voice messages and passwords.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.920
We'll tell you what went wrong, what the fundamental issue is with this particular type of approach,

04:58.920 --> 05:05.640
and the details, and also the horribly awkward video that walks users through setting up

05:05.640 --> 05:07.200
the worst security ever.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.040
Oh, I'm excited.

05:09.040 --> 05:13.080
And then Wes, I think this might all just be for me.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.920
So I hope the audience enjoys this, but at the end of the show, we're going to have some

05:15.920 --> 05:16.920
fun with G-Streamer.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.680
I recently just went on a big G-Streamer purge on my main Archbox.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.680
Get it out of here.

05:21.680 --> 05:25.440
I'll talk about the problems it's causing, I'll talk about how you can fix it if you're

05:25.440 --> 05:29.080
having your G-Streamer woes on Arch right now.

05:29.080 --> 05:34.080
And then Wes has been playing around with some really cool stuff powered by G-Streamer,

05:34.080 --> 05:40.120
which maybe, maybe will make me kick that dirty old FFM peg to the curb.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.120
I'm kidding.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.120
I love FFM pegs.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.120
Everyone does.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.120
All right.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.800
Before we get into all of our breaking news, let's bring in that mumble room.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.800
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.800
Hello.

05:48.800 --> 05:49.800
Hello.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.800
Wow.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.800
Yeah.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.400
That's how you do it.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.400
I like that.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.400
Nice one.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
That was really good.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.400
All right, guys.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.960
Let's start off with our breaking news.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.040
This is the one that people have been talking about maybe almost number two in the chat

06:05.040 --> 06:06.040
room today.

06:06.040 --> 06:13.960
It is the Raspberry Pi Zero W. A $10 computer with with it and Bluetooth built right in.

06:13.960 --> 06:18.400
Raspberry Pi Zero W. The W signifies exactly what is new.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.400
Wireless connectivity.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.960
I thought it was for Wes.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.520
I'm sorry, buddy.

06:22.520 --> 06:27.880
One gigahertz single core Broadcom like the old one, 512 megabytes of RAM, a 40 pin header,

06:27.880 --> 06:28.880
just like its predecessor.

06:28.880 --> 06:35.040
But it adds an 802.11n and Bluetooth 4.0 to the existing Zero design.

06:35.040 --> 06:40.960
Now that's pretty nice because the original Zero will stay cheap at $5.

06:40.960 --> 06:45.900
And then the W with its fancy Wifi and Bluetooth, $10.

06:45.900 --> 06:50.400
The Raspberry Pi Foundation is also offering a new injection molded case.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.840
And I got a picture of it here.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.680
It does look really slick, actually.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.680
Yeah, look at that.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.680
Yeah.

06:55.680 --> 06:59.040
So just to recap, the new features are one gigahertz single core CPU, 512 megabytes of

06:59.040 --> 07:05.560
RAM, a mini HDMI port, a micro USB on the go port, micro USB power, HAT compatible 40

07:05.560 --> 07:06.560
pin header.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.560
Is that hat?

07:07.560 --> 07:08.560
Do you actually say it hat?

07:08.560 --> 07:09.560
Is it pronounced hat?

07:09.560 --> 07:10.560
I don't know.

07:10.560 --> 07:15.480
Yeah, composite video and reset headers and a CSI camera connector as well as now 802.11n

07:15.480 --> 07:19.480
wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.0.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.640
And then of course the official case to accompany it.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.320
That is really great.

07:23.320 --> 07:28.120
This is for me, I've been recently discussing with Mr. Michael Dominic on the Coderadio

07:28.120 --> 07:32.960
program about different use cases for embedded devices like this and I've come up with a

07:32.960 --> 07:38.000
few that just require something really simple that could connect to a couple of sensors,

07:38.000 --> 07:43.160
have a web server and this could be perfect for what I have in mind.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.440
I'm really tempted to order one even though I don't actually have the use case yet.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.440
Yeah, totally.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.440
I'm wondering if I just find it.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.080
For $10, what's the harm?

07:50.080 --> 07:53.920
And then you have it when you have a spare Saturday or something, not that that ever

07:53.920 --> 07:56.400
happens, but if you do, you can actually work on it.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.120
True, and Mr. Gogo in the chat room points out that this is great for digital signage.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.120
Oh yeah.

08:01.120 --> 08:05.840
I can think of a lot of things where it's less work, you put it on Wi-Fi, put it somewhere

08:05.840 --> 08:07.360
and just be done.

08:07.360 --> 08:11.400
They rolled out new distributors too, so it sounds like there's actual availability for

08:11.400 --> 08:12.400
this, which is nice.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.720
Remember how it used to be different?

08:13.720 --> 08:16.280
They've really gotten their act together when it comes to availability.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.280
You can get this stuff.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.600
You don't have to go to weird providers that you're uncomfortable giving them their credit

08:20.600 --> 08:24.920
card number and you're like, is this ever going to show up in my house?

08:24.920 --> 08:26.320
This is really great.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.080
Anybody in the mobile room have any thoughts on this story before we move on?

08:29.080 --> 08:33.040
Elf into the room, the Pi 3 is getting Wi-Fi.

08:33.040 --> 08:36.800
So is the Pi 3 getting Wi-Fi finally?

08:36.800 --> 08:40.380
If this was getting Wi-Fi, why does the Pi 3 not have Wi-Fi?

08:40.380 --> 08:42.480
Maybe the update's coming soon.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.600
Maybe the... ooh, Rotten Corpse's Red Book prediction right there.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.600
Good job.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.600
Write it down.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.600
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.600
So everybody mark it in your minds.

08:49.600 --> 08:54.440
Episode 186, producer Michael says that the Raspberry Pi 3 update is imminent with Wi-Fi.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.960
Bold prediction, sir.

08:55.960 --> 08:58.800
All right, so XMetal says that he agrees.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.660
For $10, it's an order now, find use later device.

09:01.660 --> 09:02.660
Not bad.

09:02.660 --> 09:03.660
Not bad.

09:03.660 --> 09:06.200
Pi 3 has Wi-Fi with arch arm Chris Lass.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.200
All right.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.200
There you go.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.200
Thanks.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.200
Boom.

09:10.200 --> 09:14.000
And this is the story that sort of had me sort of sat back in my chair and go, what

09:14.000 --> 09:16.800
is going on here?

09:16.800 --> 09:18.960
Is this a bad sign?

09:18.960 --> 09:20.280
Is this a good sign?

09:20.280 --> 09:26.620
Mozilla has made its first strategic acquisition, and it's acquired Pocket.

09:26.620 --> 09:29.640
Now Pocket is the read it later service that they bundled into Firefox.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.640
It's some controversy.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.120
Yes, definitely.

09:32.120 --> 09:37.320
And when I first... my cynical take on this story when I first saw it was, well, this

09:37.320 --> 09:40.520
is Mozilla trying to save face.

09:40.520 --> 09:46.620
They didn't want to back down, they didn't want to pull it, they probably had a contract

09:46.620 --> 09:47.620
in place.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.920
Yeah, probably.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.880
So this was their way of saving face.

09:50.880 --> 09:57.920
But then I sort of rethought it a little bit, and I actually think this could be a pretty

09:57.920 --> 10:03.240
clever purchase for them, because Pocket has supposedly 10 million monthly active users.

10:03.240 --> 10:04.240
Ten million is not a...

10:04.240 --> 10:05.240
That's a good number.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.000
That's our peanuts.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.440
That includes advertising deals, existing deals, premium subscriptions with credit cards

10:11.440 --> 10:14.800
attached, analytics for publishers.

10:14.800 --> 10:21.240
It seems to me like that could be a good business for Mozilla to have for revenue generation.

10:21.240 --> 10:26.160
And I'm certainly more comfortable with it as something under them as compared with this

10:26.160 --> 10:29.440
other party that may or may not share their values that they're working with.

10:29.440 --> 10:33.120
Yeah, and Mozilla says they're going to open source the bits and pieces.

10:33.120 --> 10:38.160
They say that it's going to run as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Corporation,

10:38.160 --> 10:41.200
and they'll continue at least for the next year to run things sort of as they have been,

10:41.200 --> 10:44.000
as they are.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.880
I used to use Pocket for a while, and it was a fine service.

10:48.880 --> 10:50.760
The read it later functionality is good to have.

10:50.760 --> 10:54.160
And I enjoy their... They do pretty good little translations for easy reading, mobile

10:54.160 --> 10:56.400
view or whatever.

10:56.400 --> 11:01.560
I wonder, W.W., you have any thoughts on this before I get into the Verge coverage specifically?

11:01.560 --> 11:07.780
I'm hoping that this is a way to mitigate any kind of Yahoo buyout that could possibly

11:07.780 --> 11:09.580
be taking place.

11:09.580 --> 11:17.040
So we'll see, because I know Firefox has a clause to get out if they don't agree.

11:17.040 --> 11:23.360
So this may be a way to diversify and have more cash flow if they need to.

11:23.360 --> 11:27.800
What do you mean, buyout from Yahoo?

11:27.800 --> 11:35.400
Yahoo has been long in talks of being bought out, and since Firefox is primarily dependent

11:35.400 --> 11:39.120
upon them for cash flow, and yeah, they need-

11:39.120 --> 11:41.640
Verizon be buying Yahoo.

11:41.640 --> 11:42.640
Right.

11:42.640 --> 11:46.840
It sounded like you were saying Yahoo was buying Firefox or Mozilla, and I was-

11:46.840 --> 11:47.840
No, no, no.

11:47.840 --> 11:52.840
Now here's what I want to just really... Because this is a trend that I've been noticing from

11:52.840 --> 11:54.200
the Verge recently.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.680
We covered it a couple of weeks ago too.

11:56.680 --> 12:02.600
There are routine jabs at open source anything in the Verge coverage.

12:02.600 --> 12:07.840
So this is from Casey Newton, at Casey Newton on Twitter, posted at the Verge, and here's

12:07.840 --> 12:11.600
a couple of things that I highlighted in the article that felt like they didn't need to

12:11.600 --> 12:16.600
be there and just simply are there to attack and disparage Mozilla.

12:16.600 --> 12:20.000
I'm trying to think of the motivation behind that, because even if you're a devout Chrome

12:20.000 --> 12:27.040
user or Microsoft Edge user or Safari user, it benefits the web, and it's pretty easy

12:27.040 --> 12:31.360
to understand how an open source browser that's always pushing for web standards is beneficial

12:31.360 --> 12:33.480
to the entire web.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.040
Even if it's not the browser for you.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.040
Right.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.040
Yeah.

12:37.040 --> 12:41.920
And so either this is a super shallow technologist who doesn't properly understand the technology

12:41.920 --> 12:48.940
they're writing about, or there's some sort of fanboy that is biased against open source,

12:48.940 --> 12:50.080
and I see this a lot at the Verge.

12:50.080 --> 12:54.880
So here's a piece that I'm just, here's like a little paragraph.

12:54.880 --> 12:59.500
Best known, speaking about Mozilla, for its Firefox web browser, Mozilla has faltered

12:59.500 --> 13:05.520
in the mobile era, spending years on its failed Firefox phone project and waiting until 2016

13:05.520 --> 13:08.040
to release Firefox and iOS globally.

13:08.040 --> 13:13.800
Meanwhile, the slow decline of desktop web, which is just stated as a fact, has made Mozilla's

13:13.800 --> 13:18.340
broader future uncertain.

13:18.340 --> 13:23.200
They have millions of active users.

13:23.200 --> 13:27.280
That is an unfounded statement that is just speculation on the part of the author.

13:27.280 --> 13:32.800
The author later writes, after talking about the purchase of Pocket, and unlike Mozilla's

13:32.800 --> 13:36.960
existing mobile products, people seem to actually enjoy using Pocket.

13:36.960 --> 13:40.480
The implication being that the people don't enjoy using any of Mozilla's products.

13:40.480 --> 13:46.040
And that's why they had to buy Pocket, because you see nobody likes to use Mozilla's stuff,

13:46.040 --> 13:48.560
according to this author.

13:48.560 --> 13:53.160
And then he takes in a quote that kind of implies that, by a Mozilla person.

13:53.160 --> 13:56.920
It's, it's, what was it, do you remember like a week or two ago we covered something else

13:56.920 --> 14:00.080
from the Verge that was taking just unnecessary pot shots at open source?

14:00.080 --> 14:01.080
What was it?

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
It's escaping me.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.080
We'll have to check.

14:03.080 --> 14:06.760
If anybody in the chat remembers, maybe mention it, but I don't understand why this coverage

14:06.760 --> 14:07.760
has to be like this.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.920
I mean, there's parts of the article that are fine.

14:09.920 --> 14:13.160
You just don't need to, you know, just report on it as a neutral reporting agency.

14:13.160 --> 14:18.520
Maybe the stinger like, unlike Mozilla's existing mobile products, people seem to enjoy using

14:18.520 --> 14:19.520
it.

14:19.520 --> 14:23.560
First of all, you're projecting people's enjoyment of Pocket versus Firefox, and the two are

14:23.560 --> 14:26.480
so incomparable it is not even funny.

14:26.480 --> 14:30.320
Because Firefox is competing, especially on iOS, which is what this author is referring

14:30.320 --> 14:35.160
to, Firefox is competing against the incumbent Safari, which will always be the default web

14:35.160 --> 14:36.160
browser.

14:36.160 --> 14:41.440
No other app can launch Firefox unless the developer has specifically programmed their

14:41.440 --> 14:46.480
application to send URL links to Firefox, which is not ever going to be in the default

14:46.480 --> 14:47.640
iOS system.

14:47.640 --> 14:51.640
It's never going to be in any of Apple's apps, and it's never going to be in any of the trendy

14:51.640 --> 14:54.120
apps either that are all in with Apple.

14:54.120 --> 15:00.480
So it is such an unfair comparison to compare the usage of mobile Firefox and iOS to Pocket,

15:00.480 --> 15:04.840
which is a completely different category of application, and it only competes with Safari's

15:04.840 --> 15:09.400
Read It Later service, which has only been around for one iOS version and is lightly

15:09.400 --> 15:10.400
used.

15:10.400 --> 15:15.960
It is such an incomprehensible comparison, but yet this author takes the time to draw

15:15.960 --> 15:22.640
the comparison after taking a shot at Firefox for failing in the mobile era, which the mobile

15:22.640 --> 15:28.480
era would seem to imply the last eight years, perhaps nine years.

15:28.480 --> 15:34.080
So Firefox has been in a state of failure for nine years, according to this author,

15:34.080 --> 15:41.080
and they waited, they quote-unquote waited until 2016 to release Firefox on iOS, which

15:41.080 --> 15:44.920
is, guess what, shocker everybody, not using the gecko rendering engine.

15:44.920 --> 15:45.920
It's not a real product.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.640
That's why they waited, because they didn't want to water down their brand, didn't want

15:49.640 --> 15:54.520
to water down their product, but eventually they bowed to the user base on iOS and released

15:54.520 --> 15:57.080
something that sits around the WebKit engine.

15:57.080 --> 16:00.040
Surprise, surprise.

16:00.040 --> 16:03.640
Apple didn't even allow you to make a separate browser other than Safari for like five years

16:03.640 --> 16:04.640
anyway.

16:04.640 --> 16:09.880
I actually think Chrome, for example, on iOS is pretty great, it's pretty great.

16:09.880 --> 16:14.320
So I can understand that you could say it's not a success on iOS, but to compete against

16:14.320 --> 16:20.440
Safari and Chrome, it's a ridiculous comparison to make it to the read it later service.

16:20.440 --> 16:25.140
And I don't get why The Verge is like doing this more and more.

16:25.140 --> 16:28.440
It seems odd to me because it's the two things that I find odd about, and then we're gonna

16:28.440 --> 16:31.200
wrap up on this topic.

16:31.200 --> 16:36.640
It's odd to me that they're taking unnecessary pot shots, perhaps just to fill out the article.

16:36.640 --> 16:40.340
But then at the same time, why are the authors choosing to cover these subject materials

16:40.340 --> 16:43.160
that they appear to loathe in the first place?

16:43.160 --> 16:49.360
They're choosing to cover open source related stories, but yet they apparently loathe that

16:49.360 --> 16:50.580
at the same time.

16:50.580 --> 16:55.960
So they understand perhaps that there is some sort of demand and they can get a certain

16:55.960 --> 17:00.360
click through threshold by covering these news stories, but yet they almost resent having

17:00.360 --> 17:01.360
to do it.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.360
I hate this.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.000
All right, there you go.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.080
That's hopefully the only rant for this show, we'll see, but geez, it just gets me fired

17:07.080 --> 17:09.520
up, The Verge these days, gets me fired up.

17:09.520 --> 17:10.840
You're on The Verge, Verge.

17:10.840 --> 17:12.360
You're on The Verge.

17:12.360 --> 17:18.120
So this has me excited, AMD's Ryzen really looks great.

17:18.120 --> 17:23.800
I can't wait to see some people posting like Linux builds based around this.

17:23.800 --> 17:29.440
And there is something that I think is interesting to note, if you're looking at pre-ordering,

17:29.440 --> 17:33.240
getting ready to do a new build, you're gonna wanna run a distribution that'll have a newer

17:33.240 --> 17:36.920
version of Linux, version 4.10 specifically.

17:36.920 --> 17:44.800
Now this is posted by Michael Larrell over at Foronix, and he sets it up like this.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.460
Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but he says, I haven't received any communication

17:48.460 --> 17:52.920
from AMD about any review samples or the like.

17:52.920 --> 17:56.900
Okay, I don't need to know that as the reader.

17:56.900 --> 17:59.280
You don't need to communicate, guess what?

17:59.280 --> 18:03.000
Jupyter Broadcasting has not been in communication with AMD about review samples.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.240
Haven't offered to send us things.

18:04.240 --> 18:07.360
Should I disclose that for every company that I haven't been in communication about?

18:07.360 --> 18:10.880
That implies to me that he's been trying and not getting the recognition that he thinks

18:10.880 --> 18:12.280
he deserves.

18:12.280 --> 18:17.240
So then he goes on to say, after a comma, so I'm not under any NDA for the upcoming

18:17.240 --> 18:24.520
AMD Ryzen launch on 2nd March, and thankfully received some information from a reliable

18:24.520 --> 18:27.320
source this weekend regarding Ryzen support Linux requirements.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.360
Jeez, is he drunk when he wrote this?

18:29.360 --> 18:30.360
Sorry Michael, but jeez.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.480
I mean, good on you if you were actually.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.240
So he says, here they are.

18:34.240 --> 18:37.960
Like because they are not working with me and giving me a review unit, because they

18:37.960 --> 18:41.320
haven't given me a review unit, I haven't had to sign an NDA, and because I don't have

18:41.320 --> 18:44.180
an NDA, I'm gonna spill the beans on what I know.

18:44.180 --> 18:48.400
But if you had given me a review unit and I had signed the NDA, I wouldn't be posting

18:48.400 --> 18:51.000
this right now, is essentially what he's saying.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.400
So is he saying that his news coverage can be bought simply with free product reviews?

18:55.400 --> 18:58.360
Because Michael, that's not really the message you want to send, man, as somebody who does

18:58.360 --> 19:00.460
product reviews.

19:00.460 --> 19:01.460
So he goes on to say.

19:01.460 --> 19:02.460
So it kind of sounds like extortion.

19:02.460 --> 19:03.800
Yeah, it does, right?

19:03.800 --> 19:05.400
It's like public shaming a little bit.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.400
Come on, dude.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.660
So he says, but here's the good juicy bits.

19:09.660 --> 19:15.220
You need Linux 4.10 because according to this trusted confidant, a good point for AMD testing

19:15.220 --> 19:22.960
and usage was 4.10, so the Linux 4.11 cycle's gonna have some updates, but 4.10 I guess

19:22.960 --> 19:24.080
has some code that AMD.

19:24.080 --> 19:28.640
I can't really decipher the hint, but essentially he says if you're using Ubuntu 16.10, if you

19:28.640 --> 19:34.320
want to go by this marker, or 16.04.2, so you're on the LTS, but you have the new hardware

19:34.320 --> 19:38.480
enablement and all that jazz, you'll have a good base state for AMD Ryzen.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.880
So either if you're going by the Ubuntu releases, that's what you need to be in, or you just

19:41.880 --> 19:46.160
need to be on a distro running kernel 4.10.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.160
Easy peasy, right?

19:47.160 --> 19:48.160
Easy peasy.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.720
By the time the hardware ships, that'll be easier said than done.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.840
I mean, wait, is that, it'll be, that'll actually, hmm.

19:52.840 --> 19:53.840
Right.

19:53.840 --> 20:00.920
So if you've got 16.10, 16.04.2, and you're on Fedora, I think 5.26 is gonna have kernel

20:00.920 --> 20:03.480
4.10 soon by the time the product's shipping.

20:03.480 --> 20:09.320
So a lot of the major distros are gonna be close to 4.10 or on 4.10 if you're on a current

20:09.320 --> 20:10.320
distro.

20:10.320 --> 20:11.320
Yep.

20:11.320 --> 20:14.160
And hey, if you're chomping at the bit to buy the processor on release day, then just

20:14.160 --> 20:15.400
compile a new kernel, you'll be fine.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.400
I kinda am.

20:16.400 --> 20:21.240
I'm not going to, but I am actually fairly impressed with what AMD has to offer here.

20:21.240 --> 20:24.560
I think they've actually got a pretty good product that's gonna be really competitive

20:24.560 --> 20:29.160
in a way that AMD, in my personal opinion, has not been competitive to the i7 and i5s.

20:29.160 --> 20:33.360
I feel like we're at an inflection point where things are kinda questionable for Intel, they've

20:33.360 --> 20:34.760
had some slowness, or...

20:34.760 --> 20:37.720
This is Intel's Firefox moment, and this is AMD's Chrome moment.

20:37.720 --> 20:38.720
Yeah.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.960
It may not go that way at all, but it's interesting.

20:40.960 --> 20:46.560
I kinda want it to, because competition in this space is critical for really competitive

20:46.560 --> 20:51.400
laptops and desktop PCs that can be high performance, and Intel has...

20:51.400 --> 20:54.560
They're really pushing the die size and all of that.

20:54.560 --> 20:57.720
They've really done a lot of work there, but at the same time, they just announced the

20:57.720 --> 21:01.200
next couple of releases, there's not gonna be a die size change, if I'm correct, I'm

21:01.200 --> 21:02.200
not sure.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.800
But it hasn't gone the way they expected.

21:04.800 --> 21:09.200
And maybe a little kick in the arse might lube up the machinery there at Intel.

21:09.200 --> 21:12.240
Anybody in the moment room have thoughts on Ryzen before we move on?

21:12.240 --> 21:16.440
Because I've seen a lot of people talking about it on the subreddit and the chatroom,

21:16.440 --> 21:19.920
so I gotta figure somebody in here has a thought on it.

21:19.920 --> 21:26.200
I'm still waiting for actual benchmarks from PCpern and other tech places that don't just

21:26.200 --> 21:31.000
do pure synthetic benchmarks before I decide.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.400
I'm really excited for...

21:33.400 --> 21:40.600
I'm hesitantly excited about the stuff I hear that I want real proof before I decide.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
You know what's...

21:41.600 --> 21:42.600
Oh, go ahead.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.320
Unfortunately, I can't provide any information because I received a review unit, and I'm

21:46.320 --> 21:48.960
under NDA.

21:48.960 --> 21:49.960
Such a tease.

21:49.960 --> 21:54.760
Also, A and B, hey, you know, I could use some Ryzen parts, please.

21:54.760 --> 21:55.760
There is...

21:55.760 --> 21:56.760
You're right.

21:56.760 --> 21:57.760
I totally agree with you, WW.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.920
I haven't seen a lot of the non-synthetic stuff yet.

21:59.920 --> 22:05.920
But what does give me sort of like a positive indicator is they're being really responsive

22:05.920 --> 22:09.720
to other reviewers besides Michael.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.440
They are letting them get in and dig into the systems.

22:12.440 --> 22:15.760
They're not doing the whole, we can't talk about that yet, we can't show you that yet.

22:15.760 --> 22:16.760
They're...

22:16.760 --> 22:20.640
And they're honestly like letting people get hands-on with the hardware in certain cases

22:20.640 --> 22:22.880
in a way that in the past, they haven't.

22:22.880 --> 22:26.940
They've been a little more hands-off, a little more distant.

22:26.940 --> 22:28.640
And I think that's a good indicator.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.040
Hopefully, they've really got something exciting to show.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.040
I hope so, Wes.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.040
I hope so.

22:34.040 --> 22:38.260

It's your mind.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.480
Oh, I have one of those.

22:50.480 --> 22:51.480
Yeah, you know what?

22:51.480 --> 22:53.320
I was just sitting here thinking about this too, Wes.

22:53.320 --> 22:58.620
What if you go out into space one day and you're out there for years and years and years?

22:58.620 --> 23:00.000
Your body would shrivel away.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Sure.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
But you'd be like a jellyfish.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.040
You'd still have your mind, right?

23:04.040 --> 23:05.040
Yup.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.960
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

23:06.960 --> 23:10.860
You go there, you sign up for a free seven-day trial, you enrich your mind.

23:10.860 --> 23:13.840
You know what jellyfish Wes is excited to learn about?

23:13.840 --> 23:14.840
What's that?

23:14.840 --> 23:15.840
Oh, yeah.

23:15.840 --> 23:16.840
Very important in space.

23:16.840 --> 23:19.520
And you know, I'll tell you, especially when you've got a lot of systems to keep running

23:19.520 --> 23:24.200
and they have been like life support, they've been partnering directly with chefs or for

23:24.200 --> 23:28.040
a great new set of courses and you have instructor mentoring when you need it.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.160
They've got labs to give you hands-on training.

23:30.160 --> 23:33.680
They have a great community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting whether you're an experienced

23:33.680 --> 23:39.820
sys admin or new to the world of Linux, Azure and AWS, OpenStack and DevOps, a sharp skill

23:39.820 --> 23:42.960
set is an absolute necessity to succeed.

23:42.960 --> 23:48.800
Meet Linux Academy, an online Linux and cloud training platform that uses self-paced video

23:48.800 --> 23:54.920
courses and hands-on labs to give you real-world experience for a wide range of skills.

Train for your certification, learn the latest DevOps tools and grow your skill set to do

23:59.500 --> 24:00.640
better work.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.480

24:03.480 --> 24:08.360
Our scenario-based server labs and quiz system allow you to learn hands-on.

24:08.360 --> 24:13.800
We also have full-time human instructors who answer questions and help you earn that certification

24:13.800 --> 24:15.440
or promotion at work.

24:15.440 --> 24:20.080
We add new training every week so you'll always be up to date on the latest tech.

24:20.080 --> 24:25.160
Sys admins of every experience level use Linux Academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the

24:25.160 --> 24:26.720
Linux ecosystem.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.720
You should too.

24:27.720 --> 24:28.960
Yeah, that's legit right there.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.560
That bleeding edge part is legit.

24:30.560 --> 24:34.520
Even when I'm not out in the quote-unquote industry, I'm still hoping for that day that

24:34.520 --> 24:39.040
Elon comes on, knocks on my door and says, I'd like to take you to Mars, and I need your

24:39.040 --> 24:40.040
mind.

24:40.040 --> 24:44.760
And I'm going to go invest in my mind at linuxacademy.com slash unplug, sign up for a free seven-day

24:44.760 --> 24:46.240
trial, dig around in there.

24:46.240 --> 24:49.760
Even if you're busy, they have course schedulers that will work with your time frame.

24:49.760 --> 24:53.520
They'll customize some work, customize some lessons, and I think one of the other things

24:53.520 --> 24:59.560
you could probably dig into, even if you're like me, I run my own business and I got three

24:59.560 --> 25:00.560
kids.

25:00.560 --> 25:04.280
I understand that you can be busy, but you know what's great is these nuggets, just little

25:04.280 --> 25:05.280
tiny bits of wisdom.

25:05.280 --> 25:09.120
You jump in, it's one topic, you do a deep dive, and you're done.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.600
In the time you could have watched a few silly videos on YouTube, you could learn something

25:12.600 --> 25:17.880
completely new about Linux, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and a big thank you to Linux

25:17.880 --> 25:22.080
Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.220
The debate rages on like dis-defragging.

25:24.220 --> 25:28.320
Do we really need a swap partition on modern systems?

25:28.320 --> 25:31.520
And I thought we'd kind of, here was my advice.

25:31.520 --> 25:35.020
If you're on a desktop with lots of RAM, you probably don't.

25:35.020 --> 25:38.160
If you're on a laptop and you want to hibernate, you probably do.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.160
That was sort of my...

25:39.160 --> 25:43.200
Those are the obvious kind of corner edge cases on the spectrum.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.960
Yeah, yeah, and then these guys, maybe you've heard of them over at this company called

25:46.960 --> 25:47.960
Red Hat.

25:47.960 --> 25:48.960
I don't know if you're familiar with this.

25:48.960 --> 25:53.320
This Red Hat company comes along, noobs I think, I think they compete with Canonical,

25:53.320 --> 25:57.620
and they came in here and they said, well, ha ha ha, well here's a couple of caveats.

25:57.620 --> 26:00.300
They actually wrote this whole article telling you about how you should and why you should

26:00.300 --> 26:05.400
use swap, and then it says at the bottom, but can I run without swap, Red Hat?

26:05.400 --> 26:06.400
Can I do it?

26:06.400 --> 26:08.040
Is further tuning possible?

26:08.040 --> 26:14.560
And Red Hat's official stance, systems without swap can make sense and are supported by Red

26:14.560 --> 26:16.400
Hat.

26:16.400 --> 26:20.540
Just be sure the behavior of such a system under memory pressure is what you want in

26:20.540 --> 26:23.320
most environments.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.640
A little bit of swap does make sense.

26:25.640 --> 26:27.480
Yeah, I can see that.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.480
Yeah, that's where I've kind of come at too.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.600
How are you running swap on that system you're on right now?

26:31.600 --> 26:33.800
I don't actually know.

26:33.800 --> 26:34.800
That's a good question.

26:34.800 --> 26:40.080
Let's, yes, so there you go, there you go.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.080
And I can do swap off.

26:41.080 --> 26:47.800
I could do swap off right now and I think I'd be fine because I've still got 3.6 gigabytes

26:47.800 --> 26:48.800
of RAM.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.800
Nice.

26:49.800 --> 26:50.800
Yeah.

26:50.800 --> 26:54.740
But the reason why I actually wanted to link to this in the show notes for those of you

26:54.740 --> 27:00.120
at home is they've essentially done one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine

27:00.120 --> 27:05.480
or so, eight bullet points, really eight, that tell you the parameters and where swap

27:05.480 --> 27:07.320
might or might not work for you.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.960
And this one I thought was interesting.

27:09.960 --> 27:15.060
If you design your applications to regularly use swap, make sure to use faster devices

27:15.060 --> 27:19.840
like SSDs starting with Red Hat Enterprise 7.1.

27:19.840 --> 27:25.000
You can do swap on, dash, dash, discard, which can be used to send trimmed SSD devices to

27:25.000 --> 27:27.600
discard the device contents on swap on.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.160
So it's some good tips there too.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.160
So I don't know.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.000
You thought, what do you think, Wes, when you're building a system swap?

27:33.000 --> 27:38.320
Yeah, I usually do, but I could see doing it on a desktop, but it would probably depend

27:38.320 --> 27:41.680
on, you know, maybe do some tests if you feel adventurous.

27:41.680 --> 27:45.480
I could see it like, I wouldn't care here, you know, if like, all right, well, the out

27:45.480 --> 27:48.840
of memory killer comes by and kills my Chrome session, which is probably one of the things,

27:48.840 --> 27:50.280
but I'm generally not doing anything.

27:50.280 --> 27:53.880
I habitually, you know, colon W and Vim all the time.

27:53.880 --> 27:57.840
So I'm not that worried about programs being killed and things dying.

27:57.840 --> 28:02.480
But say if you're like, you know, you're the beard and you're working on editing the show,

28:02.480 --> 28:05.960
it might be worth just a couple of gigs of swap to make sure that that situation doesn't

28:05.960 --> 28:06.960
really happen.

28:06.960 --> 28:11.320
One of the things I think about too is how fast certain types of storage have gotten

28:11.320 --> 28:17.280
now where you can get nearly a gigabyte or 900 megabytes or even 300 megabytes of throughput.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.400
Swap is a little less expensive than it used to be.

28:19.400 --> 28:22.920
Somebody in the moment wanted to jump in with their thoughts on the swap.

28:22.920 --> 28:23.920
Swap on.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.480
You know, one of the things you could do too, is you, go ahead.

28:26.480 --> 28:35.680
I've never, okay, so ever since like elementary 12.04 and other, like going to KDE Plasma,

28:35.680 --> 28:44.120
I've never seen swap used on like the swap partition or swap file used at all.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.120
Zero.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.440
And I have never tweaked it.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.560
And I'm like, maybe you just don't have enough to do.

28:49.560 --> 28:50.560
You're not working hard enough.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.560
Yeah.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.560
You're just not swapping right.

28:54.560 --> 28:57.600
That's what she said.

28:57.600 --> 29:02.720
The thing is, it's like I'm going to be redoing my system really soon and I'm going to be

29:02.720 --> 29:09.720
putting an SSD in and I want that to last me as long as I can for several different

29:09.720 --> 29:10.880
reasons.

29:10.880 --> 29:17.560
So I don't want to use swap on that drive if it's going to be wearing it out, causing

29:17.560 --> 29:21.120
problems or, or should I just be moving it?

29:21.120 --> 29:28.280
And I can never find an answer to any good swap like questions like, okay, is the double

29:28.280 --> 29:30.160
thing still valid?

29:30.160 --> 29:33.480
Like double your RAM size, you know, there needs to be a hard drive.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.480
No, no.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.480
I don't think so.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.480
It depends on the RAM.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.480
It depends on what your RAM is.

29:37.480 --> 29:40.280
If you have like four gigs of RAM, maybe, but you can even get away with that.

29:40.280 --> 29:44.280
I would say like a hundred percent what your RAM is until you get to like 16 or more than

29:44.280 --> 29:46.280
you can just do half of that and just stay at eight.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.280
Yeah.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.520
I actually just do like two gigs these days, really.

29:49.520 --> 29:53.700
And I'll tell you, the only time I would do more is if I wanted to be able to hold the

29:53.700 --> 29:58.000
contents of RAM during hibernation or something like that.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.480
I tell you really, I have it mostly out of legacy.

30:02.480 --> 30:09.840
I have it so that way for me, it feels like it's my, my bumper in the bowling lane that

30:09.840 --> 30:15.360
I, if I go a little crazy, which I sometimes do, I'm not going to, the gnome desktop, and

30:15.360 --> 30:18.560
I haven't hit it with plasma yet, but boy is it crap when you run out of memory and

30:18.560 --> 30:19.620
you don't have swap.

30:19.620 --> 30:25.080
It is, it is, it is not, and it, especially if you're using Chrome, oh, it just is the

30:25.080 --> 30:26.080
most frustrating.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.800
You're right in the middle of work.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.560
Everything starts locking up.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.780
Clicks are taking forever to get registered.

30:31.780 --> 30:34.320
It becomes practically, everything starts timing out.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.640
This tab's died, this tab's died, this tab's died, this application is not responding.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.400
It is a train wreck.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.240
It's a dumpster fire.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.720
So should we get an option where, you know, you hit that memory seal and instead of like

30:44.720 --> 30:47.560
add a memory killer, it just reboot?

30:47.560 --> 30:51.920
You know what, you know, and, and, and I, yeah, really, you know what I think is faster,

30:51.920 --> 30:52.920
you know, with an SSD.

30:52.920 --> 30:53.920
We have an option.

30:53.920 --> 30:58.100
It's called swap.

30:58.100 --> 31:02.560
Is it, isn't Ubuntu switching to swap files instead of a swap partition?

31:02.560 --> 31:07.280
This is another thing you can do is instead of dedicating like a whole partition to it,

31:07.280 --> 31:12.800
you could switch to a swap file, which more and more distros are doing and might make

31:12.800 --> 31:15.080
sense because then you have sort of the best of both worlds.

31:15.080 --> 31:18.680
You don't, you don't necessarily lose a lot of hard drive space and you give, you make

31:18.680 --> 31:19.680
a swap file.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.240
I'm not sure if you have to preallocate the space with a swap file or not.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.240
I don't know exactly how.

31:23.240 --> 31:24.240
You don't.

31:24.240 --> 31:25.240
Okay.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.240
Well, that definitely seems like that could be the way to go.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.240
Yeah, that's what I use.

31:27.240 --> 31:29.440
I don't know about hibernation on a swap file.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.440
Good question.

31:30.440 --> 31:31.440
No.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.920
Popeye in the chat room says no.

31:33.920 --> 31:34.920
So that's sort of a bummer.

31:34.920 --> 31:35.920
But on the desktop,

31:35.920 --> 31:38.080
Well, he says no and yes.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.080
Oh.

31:39.080 --> 31:43.080
If only there was some sort of communication method we could use in which we could speak

31:43.080 --> 31:44.880
more clearly and rapidly.

31:44.880 --> 31:45.880
I don't know.

31:45.880 --> 31:46.880
I don't think that's a thing.

31:46.880 --> 31:47.880
Oh, okay.

31:47.880 --> 31:48.880
Wait, have you tried IRC?

31:48.880 --> 31:49.880
Hmm.

31:49.880 --> 31:51.680
All right.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.960
So I, that's something we'll have to leave a bit of.

31:53.960 --> 31:57.580
I was hoping we could just finally stop talking about this, but like with the disty fragging

31:57.580 --> 32:00.440
topic too, it just keeps coming back.

32:00.440 --> 32:05.200
There's a good chat, I mean a good thread in the subreddit though, if you kind of want

32:05.200 --> 32:06.200
some guidelines to follow.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.200
You have any other thoughts on it?

32:07.200 --> 32:08.200
No.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.200
I think that's it.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.200
All right.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.200
All right.

32:11.200 --> 32:15.400
Well, then I suppose without other people inputting, it is time to move on, wink, wink.

32:15.400 --> 32:19.360
I think isn't Popeye like at Mobile World Congress or something right now?

32:19.360 --> 32:20.360
What's going on right now?

32:20.360 --> 32:22.960
The canonical folks are over there doing all, there's an interview with Mark Schultz.

32:22.960 --> 32:25.440
I hear that you're in the mobile space sometimes.

32:25.440 --> 32:26.440
From time to time.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.440
Yeah, from time to time.

32:28.440 --> 32:35.040
Now, we have a story coming up that, I don't know, I don't want us to get all riled up

32:35.040 --> 32:37.200
because we got a lot of fans of Telegram in the audience.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.840
So I know this is a big deal.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.640
I know this can get people upset.

32:40.640 --> 32:46.120
So before we jump into the Telegram story, I want to talk about this 11-year-old flaw

32:46.120 --> 32:51.040
that has been patched, but I just want to put it out there so people know what's up.

32:51.040 --> 32:56.400
A security researcher at Google found a use after free hole within Linux, speaking of

32:56.400 --> 32:57.600
memory usage.

32:57.600 --> 33:01.420
This particular flaw is of interest because it appears to be situational.

33:01.420 --> 33:06.240
It only showed up in kernels built with a certain configuration option, which was config

33:06.240 --> 33:08.200
IP DCCP enabled.

33:08.200 --> 33:12.200
Unfortunately, many people, or I'm sorry, popular Linux distributions have enabled this

33:12.200 --> 33:13.880
option by default.

33:13.880 --> 33:20.080
A new Linux update has since patched the vulnerability, although the exploit is present in Linux kernels

33:20.080 --> 33:24.160
since 2005.

33:24.160 --> 33:29.680
It uses heap spraying methods to execute arbitrary code inside the kernel, which allows the attacker

33:29.680 --> 33:31.540
to escalate permissions.

33:31.540 --> 33:32.640
So you can think of it like this.

33:32.640 --> 33:38.120
An attacker could hijack a low permissions account, maybe a remote services listening

33:38.120 --> 33:43.400
that has limited privileges, like a database service or a web server, your NGINX user,

33:43.400 --> 33:44.400
something like that.

33:44.400 --> 33:48.680
If there's a flaw in NGINX, it just takes one other piece of software that's perhaps

33:48.680 --> 33:52.120
on your system running in the background under a less privileged user.

33:52.120 --> 33:57.120
Or even your own user account on your desktop that is a standard user, and maybe something

33:57.120 --> 34:02.160
happens like inside the web browser, the attacker can use your basic privileges of that account

34:02.160 --> 34:04.980
and then escalate from there.

34:04.980 --> 34:07.740
That's by very definition a local escalation bug.

34:07.740 --> 34:13.020
When you combine it with other types of attacks, it's sort of the island hopping approach that

34:13.020 --> 34:16.600
you guys and we used to talk about in TechSnap.

34:16.600 --> 34:22.940
And it is definitely worth patching, but you don't really have to worry because some distributions

34:22.940 --> 34:25.060
don't really need to be patched.

34:25.060 --> 34:29.760
Most distributions that do, Debian 7, Debian 8, for example, have been fixed.

34:29.760 --> 34:32.360
Stretch and SID have yet to be patched.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.880
Only one version of SUSE is affected.

34:34.880 --> 34:41.520
And if you have SE Linux, well, you can mitigate this problem pretty much all together.

34:41.520 --> 34:45.820
So it's not like it's a huge problem, but it's been around for 11 years, so it probably

34:45.820 --> 34:48.000
does by just the very nature impact a lot of people.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.380
So I just wanted to give a little breaking news PSA update before we got into this whole

34:51.380 --> 34:52.380
Telegram thing.

34:52.380 --> 34:54.960
Because the Telegram thing is not exactly breaking news.

34:54.960 --> 34:58.000
That kind of ends our breaking news section of the show.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.240
And thanks, Shep, for stopping by.

35:01.240 --> 35:08.160
I've enjoyed Telegram for, I don't know, since it was an early, early beta stage.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.960
It's a great chat application for collaborating with groups or individuals.

35:11.960 --> 35:17.840
One of the things that I really appreciate is a very serviceable desktop Linux client.

35:17.840 --> 35:22.400
They have great mobile clients, good bot support, lots of fun features like stupid stickers

35:22.400 --> 35:23.840
and whatnot.

35:23.840 --> 35:27.840
And a big part of using Telegram is using it on mobile.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.480
In fact, you have to have a freaking mobile number to even use it.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.120
I hate that.

35:32.120 --> 35:37.920
And this is where we run into a problem.

35:37.920 --> 35:43.040
Essentially it looks like Telegram for Android is essentially a closed sourced application

35:43.040 --> 35:45.440
now.

35:45.440 --> 35:49.200
According to the repository in the Telegram website, the Android client is covered by

35:49.200 --> 35:51.120
the GPL license.

35:51.120 --> 35:57.080
However, since early October 2016, there has been many releases but no updates of the source

35:57.080 --> 35:58.240
code.

35:58.240 --> 36:02.000
Everyone involved so far is pretty much not responding.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.120
The original author hasn't responded, the Telegram chat support doesn't respond, the

36:06.120 --> 36:11.960
Twitter account doesn't respond to the questions, other individuals like the face of Telegram,

36:11.960 --> 36:15.660
the spokesperson of Telegram doesn't respond, and there's really no other contact method

36:15.660 --> 36:20.780
for Telegram other than a physical mailing address.

36:20.780 --> 36:22.880
Is it time to really start seriously considering wire?

36:22.880 --> 36:28.580
Does this concern you or is this wire or signal, I guess?

36:28.580 --> 36:30.720
You concerned about this at all?

36:30.720 --> 36:32.680
I mean it's very disheartening.

36:32.680 --> 36:34.800
I have not investigated it very much.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.840
I know like Telegram has never been like the perfect messenger, at least in my eyes.

36:38.840 --> 36:39.840
I agree.

36:39.840 --> 36:43.840
We've talked about the problems before, but it has been that mix of like, it's not stagnant

36:43.840 --> 36:46.600
like Hangouts and wrapped up in this, you know, other...

36:46.600 --> 36:48.960
It does feel like stagnation is beginning to set in.

36:48.960 --> 36:52.280
Because when I first picked it up, it was like changing all the time and it's always

36:52.280 --> 36:56.480
been very snappy, fast, supports file uploads very well, all those kinds of things, plus

36:56.480 --> 36:57.800
all the stickers and the font and all that.

36:57.800 --> 37:01.800
Part of me is grateful that they haven't gone down the rabbit hole of video and audio and

37:01.800 --> 37:03.200
trying to be like all in all...

37:03.200 --> 37:04.760
They're not another Snapchat clone.

37:04.760 --> 37:07.400
Yeah, because it, you know, focus on text chatting.

37:07.400 --> 37:11.440
There's other applications that can do video and audio, but when I say stagnation at the

37:11.440 --> 37:14.680
same time, like there are still things about it that kind of bug me that I'm surprised

37:14.680 --> 37:15.680
they haven't fixed.

37:15.680 --> 37:19.720
Like, my big one is freaking global status.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.360
Allow me to set my status to DND for goodness sakes.

37:22.360 --> 37:25.720
And the more things I have coming in Telegram, I have, you know, a bot that sends me something

37:25.720 --> 37:26.720
in Telegram.

37:26.720 --> 37:29.520
I check it, but now all of a sudden I'm shown online and I get 15 telegrams.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.520
Literally, that's what happens to me.

37:31.520 --> 37:35.480
And if I could just go in there and say DND for a little while and let me read through

37:35.480 --> 37:41.480
my telegrams and just catch up, it would just be very useful for somebody like myself.

37:41.480 --> 37:42.760
Those kinds of things are...

37:42.760 --> 37:46.120
There are companies out there like Slack who've really nailed DND.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.120
Yes.

37:47.120 --> 37:50.000
I mean, it's like the best implementation I have found and Telegram could just wholesale

37:50.000 --> 37:54.120
rip that off and they just don't.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.520
Mr. Tonell, you were going to say something.

37:55.520 --> 38:00.720
Yes, I was going to say that Wire is already a good alternative now and it's even gotten

38:00.720 --> 38:01.720
better from a recent announcement.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.200
What do you mean by good?

38:03.200 --> 38:05.760
Like, well, it's a good option because...

38:05.760 --> 38:09.480
Like, how's the desktop app for Linux?

38:09.480 --> 38:10.480
It's fine.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.480
I mean...

38:11.480 --> 38:12.480
Is it better than Telegram?

38:12.480 --> 38:16.000
At first, does it do the audio and video stuff on the desktop?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Yes, it does.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Yeah, okay.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.800
It has the audio and video stuff and the video stuff is actually surprisingly well-made.

38:22.800 --> 38:29.520
I expect it to kind of underperform because of the WebRTC approach, but it's almost flawless.

38:29.520 --> 38:30.520
It's got an app image.

38:30.520 --> 38:31.520
I'm installing it right now.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.520
Are you?

38:32.520 --> 38:33.520
Downloading it.

38:33.520 --> 38:37.160
I got an app image and they also got like a regular tar.

38:37.160 --> 38:39.680
My hesitation here is...

38:39.680 --> 38:43.320
So like, for example, Linux Fest Northwest, just around the corner, when everybody is

38:43.320 --> 38:46.080
working, everybody we're working with has Telegram.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.100
And it's not even just like our team.

38:48.100 --> 38:53.880
It's people that we meet up with or other people that are coming to Linux Fest and all

38:53.880 --> 38:55.560
of a sudden we want to start coordinating with.

38:55.560 --> 38:56.560
Everybody has Telegram.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.840
And for a while, it was in that spot, right?

38:57.840 --> 39:01.800
It was like, hey, open source, yeah, not perfect, they have their own crypto, there's problems,

39:01.800 --> 39:06.360
but it was that beautiful combination of like functional, we have people who use it and

39:06.360 --> 39:07.360
open source.

39:07.360 --> 39:10.680
The network, I think, like interacting with the network, you can still build your own

39:10.680 --> 39:11.680
client.

39:11.680 --> 39:12.680
Right.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.760
There's QtGram on the desktop and others.

39:14.760 --> 39:21.720
The protocols, the APIs are open for the client side, but the server has never been open.

39:21.720 --> 39:26.160
So I'm not really surprised that this is happening.

39:26.160 --> 39:30.560
I'm more surprised that people are being bothered by it rather than questioning, oh, this is

39:30.560 --> 39:31.560
happening.

39:31.560 --> 39:33.880
Well, their server has also been proprietary the entire time.

39:33.880 --> 39:34.880
True.

39:34.880 --> 39:35.880
And their encryption is weird and homebrew.

39:35.880 --> 39:36.880
Right.

39:36.880 --> 39:37.880
Exactly.

39:37.880 --> 39:42.800
And no one's audited it because they've not allowed it to be audited.

39:42.800 --> 39:50.600
The Wire, though, like Wire uses already audited encryption algorithms.

39:50.600 --> 39:54.720
They're actually announced recently that they're going to be open sourcing their server.

39:54.720 --> 39:57.520
So they're going to be completely open source.

39:57.520 --> 40:02.600
And they haven't set a license yet, but everything other than that, everything that you can check

40:02.600 --> 40:03.920
the license on is GPLed.

40:03.920 --> 40:04.920
Yeah.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.440
Here's my problem.

40:06.440 --> 40:10.920
This is me becoming more salty in my old age.

40:10.920 --> 40:15.520
I've been around long enough to know that you can have the best technology and still

40:15.520 --> 40:17.360
not succeed at all.

40:17.360 --> 40:20.760
I mean, look at Linux versus Windows for so many years.

40:20.760 --> 40:24.560
Really what I feel like the issue is, is user base.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.240
It is user adoption and user base.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.960
And it is simpler for people not to care, and it is simpler for companies to slowly

40:29.960 --> 40:32.880
add the features that their competitors have.

40:32.880 --> 40:37.520
System is so entrenched that we really need almost to reboot this whole problem.

40:37.520 --> 40:42.320
And I think Google is working on something called RCS messaging.

40:42.320 --> 40:43.760
Are you familiar with RCS messaging?

40:43.760 --> 40:44.760
No, I'm not.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.440
Yeah, I'm not either.

40:46.440 --> 40:52.720
But it's a messaging system that's designed to move beyond SMS to take advantage of more

40:52.720 --> 40:54.920
modern cellular networks.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.420
It's more of a standard.

40:56.420 --> 40:57.680
Google is a big part behind it.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.360
You can go to jibe.google.com.

40:59.360 --> 41:03.360
RCS stands for Rich Communication Services.

41:03.360 --> 41:08.420
And the idea is to standardize a way to have messaging across phones and across carriers

41:08.420 --> 41:13.440
that allow you to do things like high-resolution photos, videos, large files, group chat.

41:13.440 --> 41:16.840
Knowing messages have been read, you can make video calls.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.700
And it's not like a Hangouts app.

41:19.700 --> 41:23.320
It would be literally built into the text messaging application of all of the phones.

41:23.320 --> 41:28.960
So it would be a new standard that carriers and other type telcos could have.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.920
And Google is, while not – like it's weird.

41:31.920 --> 41:36.680
Google is like all-in in some cases because they've got their management layer talking

41:36.680 --> 41:40.680
to the other management layers of carriers, like they've managed to convince Sprint

41:40.680 --> 41:44.120
and some other carriers outside the US to take on RCS.

41:44.120 --> 41:49.080
At the same time, they're not really pushing it very hard on a software front.

41:49.080 --> 41:51.640
Now they're going to be – eventually I suppose.

41:51.640 --> 41:55.080
And they're going to update the Android Messages client to be the RCS client for Android.

41:55.080 --> 41:58.440
But I don't really understand how that plays into their greater messaging strategy with

41:58.440 --> 42:02.120
Allo and Hangouts and – it's just very confusing.

42:02.120 --> 42:06.880
But if the industry can sort this out and Apple and Google and everybody and Microsoft

42:06.880 --> 42:13.560
and Android and everybody can – Samsung and get along with RCS, we may have something

42:13.560 --> 42:15.320
that's more sophisticated.

42:15.320 --> 42:17.560
But you know it's not going to be encrypted like the way we need.

42:17.560 --> 42:20.160
It's not going to be end-to-end, definitely.

42:20.160 --> 42:23.280
It might be encrypted but the carriers are going to have the keys, guaranteed.

42:23.280 --> 42:24.840
We know how much we love those carriers.

42:24.840 --> 42:30.880
So it could help the average user but for us like users that want something beyond that,

42:30.880 --> 42:40.520
Wire has got a – I think we as a technical community are exceedingly bad at estimating

42:40.520 --> 42:45.720
how much of an uphill climb a company like Wire has because we look at it from – we

42:45.720 --> 42:50.600
weigh the technical merits heavier than we should.

42:50.600 --> 42:54.320
Because the average user doesn't even consider the technical merits.

42:54.320 --> 42:57.480
We literally are not even a consideration in their decision process.

42:57.480 --> 43:00.280
They are absolutely irrelevant to them.

43:00.280 --> 43:05.860
But we can't get beyond it because we understand technically this is a superior thing and so

43:05.860 --> 43:10.240
we should be using this thing and yet the market continues to use things like Skype

43:10.240 --> 43:14.960
and Telegram and all the other messaging platforms.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.240
I would really love to see people switch over to Wire.

43:17.240 --> 43:21.880
I could see maybe a revolution taking over here at JB but you know I look at somebody

43:21.880 --> 43:27.920
like Noah and he puts his entire life in Telegram.

43:27.920 --> 43:30.360
I cannot describe to you.

43:30.360 --> 43:36.480
You just have to be around Noah and witness how Telegram is integrated with his task list,

43:36.480 --> 43:41.280
his to-do items, all of his family, all of his friends, all of his work, everything goes

43:41.280 --> 43:42.440
through Telegram.

43:42.440 --> 43:47.080
When Noah has to take notes for a show, he sends it to himself in a Telegram message.

43:47.080 --> 43:50.440
When Noah has to remember to do something for a client, he sends it to himself in a

43:50.440 --> 43:51.560
Telegram message.

43:51.560 --> 43:55.360
When somebody needs tech support from Noah, he gets them to install Telegram first so

43:55.360 --> 43:56.360
they can chat.

43:56.360 --> 43:58.360
I mean so there are people out there.

43:58.360 --> 43:59.360
That is quite the adoption.

43:59.360 --> 44:00.360
Yeah.

44:00.360 --> 44:02.040
Yeah and then he's in like a dozen group chats.

44:02.040 --> 44:04.680
I don't know how he managed that.

44:04.680 --> 44:05.680
I think he's insane.

44:05.680 --> 44:06.680
Yeah.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.680
Well that's, we know that to be true.

44:08.680 --> 44:09.680
All right.

44:09.680 --> 44:10.680
Mumble room.

44:10.680 --> 44:14.080
Any final thoughts before we move on from messaging?

44:14.080 --> 44:18.400
Yeah I don't think Google is going to get the carrier, the cellular carriers to switch

44:18.400 --> 44:23.920
over to a new standard in lieu of SMS in the back end because it would require such a massive

44:23.920 --> 44:24.920
hardware update.

44:24.920 --> 44:26.400
They're going to have to do it over the IP side.

44:26.400 --> 44:27.400
Yeah.

44:27.400 --> 44:29.600
Well I think that is exactly what the intent is.

44:29.600 --> 44:36.280
SMS messaging, the way it is distributed and routed between carriers is very much a hack.

44:36.280 --> 44:40.200
I don't know enough anymore but it was explained to me by a friend of mine that works for a

44:40.200 --> 44:45.000
carrier, how crazy they have to set this up to get messaging to work between the different

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
carriers.

44:46.000 --> 44:50.720
And it's out of bound messaging gateways and it's so limited.

44:50.720 --> 44:51.720
Oh yeah.

44:51.720 --> 44:53.080
Monkey, you would probably actually be kind of familiar with it.

44:53.080 --> 44:54.080
Yeah.

44:54.080 --> 44:55.080
I mean do you want to expand on that at all?

44:55.080 --> 44:56.080
Yeah.

44:56.080 --> 45:01.920
I mean the whole SMS craze, I mean even iPhone isn't using SMS anymore and we get subpoenas

45:01.920 --> 45:05.200
all the time for messaging in the back end.

45:05.200 --> 45:10.560
It doesn't exist because they were on an iPhone using the iMessenger which doesn't use SMS.

45:10.560 --> 45:14.020
It uses iMessenger which is an IP based solution.

45:14.020 --> 45:19.320
And so when you start having conversations with people, yeah I'm using SMS, no you're

45:19.320 --> 45:20.320
not.

45:20.320 --> 45:23.280
You're using a third party application which is going over the IP.

45:23.280 --> 45:26.920
And that's maybe coming up with new standard from Google's perspective is a good idea.

45:26.920 --> 45:30.800
I just think it's a waste of time.

45:30.800 --> 45:31.920
That kind of bums me out.

45:31.920 --> 45:37.480
But maybe long term something like Wire can be something that at least a larger percentage

45:37.480 --> 45:38.840
of users adopt.

45:38.840 --> 45:43.200
If you're thinking about ditching Telegram and trying out something like Signal or Wire

45:43.200 --> 45:48.400
or something else, Facebook Messenger obviously, this is a project that may be of interest

45:48.400 --> 45:49.400
to you.

45:49.400 --> 45:50.400
It's the Telegram history dump.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.000
It backs up your Telegram chat logs.

45:52.000 --> 45:57.400
It just kind of requires a few things to be installed like the Telegram CLI client which

45:57.400 --> 45:58.400
is actually kind of cool.

45:58.400 --> 45:59.400
Have you ever used that?

45:59.400 --> 46:00.400
Yeah it is cool.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.200
One of the things that's creepy about it is it constantly logs who's in and out so you

46:03.200 --> 46:07.560
can constantly see who's coming on and offline if people turn that status on.

46:07.560 --> 46:11.240
It supports incremental backups which sounds pretty nice.

46:11.240 --> 46:17.560
And it has a separate YAML formatted configuration file so Pope could geek out on that all the

46:17.560 --> 46:18.560
time.

46:18.560 --> 46:19.680
You don't just need to get a snap of this.

46:19.680 --> 46:23.520
Just need to snap it up.

46:23.520 --> 46:30.760
So it's on GitHub so I'll just link to it in the show notes or it's telegram-history-dump

46:30.760 --> 46:31.760
on the GitHub.

46:31.760 --> 46:35.160
So how's it going over there?

46:35.160 --> 46:36.160
Pretty well.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.160
Yeah?

46:37.160 --> 46:38.160
Did you get your app image of Wire?

46:38.160 --> 46:39.160
Yeah.

46:39.160 --> 46:40.160
I'm running.

46:40.160 --> 46:41.160
Can I see what the UI looks like?

46:41.160 --> 46:43.000
Do you mind sharing with the class?

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
I haven't...

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
Wow, that's quite the background over there on the side.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.520
So it's... is it an Electron app?

46:50.520 --> 46:51.520
Why is your webcam on?

46:51.520 --> 46:52.520
Oh, I was testing.

46:52.520 --> 46:53.520
Oh, OK.

46:53.520 --> 46:54.520
Thanks for later.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.520
Oh, look at you, really?

46:55.520 --> 46:58.040
Oh yeah, that's going to be a fun demo.

46:58.040 --> 46:59.040
We got to get moving, huh?

46:59.040 --> 47:00.040
All right.

47:00.040 --> 47:01.040
Well, I'll play with that after.

47:01.040 --> 47:02.040
So you're playing with a bot right now in the Wire?

47:02.040 --> 47:03.040
Yeah.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.040
That was the first thing.

47:04.040 --> 47:05.040
Auto the bot.

47:05.040 --> 47:07.360
Hey, I'm Auto, a robot sent by Wire to talk to you through the app.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.360
That's OK.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.360
Hi, Auto.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.360
You know what?

47:10.360 --> 47:11.360
I'm getting kind of excited about Wire.

47:11.360 --> 47:12.880
I'm getting kind of excited.

47:12.880 --> 47:17.160
If you're thinking about switching up the whole thing, maybe you're ready to try messaging

47:17.160 --> 47:20.680
on a mobile device and you're going to be using data, you're not going to be using text

47:20.680 --> 47:21.680
messages.

47:21.680 --> 47:23.440
You're going to use something like Wire or Telegram.

47:23.440 --> 47:26.800
Ting is such a great carrier for you because if you don't use text messages, you just don't

47:26.800 --> 47:27.800
pay for them.

47:27.800 --> 47:29.080
It's so awesome.

47:29.080 --> 47:33.680
It's pay for what you use wireless, six dollars for a line.

47:33.680 --> 47:37.920
And then your minutes, your messages and your megabytes, add that up and that's pretty much

47:37.920 --> 47:38.920
just what you pay.

47:38.920 --> 47:44.080
They go in there, they have, go to, do me a favor actually, go to linux.ting.com.

47:44.080 --> 47:48.920
Not only does that save you 25 bucks, either in service credits or off a device, but it

47:48.920 --> 47:51.800
lets them know you heard about it here, which kind of keeps us on the air.

47:51.800 --> 47:55.900
Anyways, you go to linux.ting.com, click on what would you save and you can dig around

47:55.900 --> 47:58.880
on this chart and get a really good idea of what your Ting cost is going to be.

47:58.880 --> 48:00.400
Your Ting cost.

48:00.400 --> 48:07.360
Right now, I think even with the beard traveling, even with the beard traveling, like our, because

48:07.360 --> 48:11.960
he has a JB phone with him that's on Ting, we have three lines and his is one of them.

48:11.960 --> 48:16.320
I mean, we have, gosh, maybe we actually have more than that now, now that I think about

48:16.320 --> 48:17.320
it.

48:17.320 --> 48:18.320
Wow.

48:18.320 --> 48:21.240
You know, it really doesn't up our nominal cost because I think our cost this month was

48:21.240 --> 48:23.600
like 45 bucks or something.

48:23.600 --> 48:27.800
And that's with, I think now we have four lines active all the time and we turn some

48:27.800 --> 48:30.600
lines on and off too, so that's another nice thing about Ting.

48:30.600 --> 48:34.440
You would have a hard time finding a plan for one person for that much on another carrier.

48:34.440 --> 48:35.440
I know.

48:35.440 --> 48:36.440
I know.

48:36.440 --> 48:39.920
And it's so nice too, especially like in a company where we're all kind of technical,

48:39.920 --> 48:42.600
we're always on Wi-Fi all the time.

48:42.600 --> 48:46.720
I also thought it was kind of nice that Ting did a blog post that kind of resonated with

48:46.720 --> 48:48.160
me.

48:48.160 --> 48:52.480
Why buying last year's flagship phone is the smarter choice?

48:52.480 --> 48:56.040
And I've been thinking too about people that have been emailing into the show about their

48:56.040 --> 48:59.520
phones, which we don't really talk about much on the show anymore, but I've been thinking

48:59.520 --> 49:04.000
that more and more like the 5X is that price point gets to where the 5X is at.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.800
You get something like the 5X directly from Google Play, you get Android updates, in fact

49:07.800 --> 49:14.320
you get, unbelievably, you get more functionality with the 5X than you do with the 6P right

49:14.320 --> 49:15.320
now.

49:15.320 --> 49:18.520
I don't know if you know about this, but the latest, if you're in the beta channel, the

49:18.520 --> 49:23.800
latest Android updates coming down to the 5X give you the gesture swipes that you can

49:23.800 --> 49:26.860
do on the fingerprint reader to like check notifications and stuff.

49:26.860 --> 49:31.280
So you can, yeah, there's like different finger gestures on the fingerprint reader that will

49:31.280 --> 49:34.240
interact with your display, which is really nice when you're holding the phone in your

49:34.240 --> 49:35.800
hand and the fingerprint reader's on the back.

49:35.800 --> 49:36.800
You can just whoop.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.280
It's very nice.

49:38.280 --> 49:40.280
6P doesn't get it.

49:40.280 --> 49:41.280
No fair.

49:41.280 --> 49:43.320
The 5X gets it.

49:43.320 --> 49:45.220
There's something to be said for that 5X.

49:45.220 --> 49:47.240
It's a sturdy phone, it's not metal.

49:47.240 --> 49:50.360
That also means that when you drop it, it doesn't dent.

49:50.360 --> 49:51.360
That's kind of nice.

49:51.360 --> 49:52.360
It's a great price.

49:52.360 --> 49:53.600
The back comes off, you can replace the battery.

49:53.600 --> 49:57.140
I don't know if you're supposed to do that, but I've done it.

49:57.140 --> 49:58.140
It happened.

49:58.140 --> 49:59.140
Don't question it.

49:59.140 --> 50:01.320
I used to do it on my 5.

50:01.320 --> 50:04.240
It's just kind of a nice sweet spot because then you also get the updates directly from

50:04.240 --> 50:05.240
the Googs.

50:05.240 --> 50:08.160
Then you go over to Ting, you bring a device like that, you get it from the Play Store,

50:08.160 --> 50:12.000
you can put it on GSM or CDMA, so you get to take advantage of either one of Ting's

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
networks.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.520
And if you bring a device, you just get $25 in service credit.

50:15.520 --> 50:20.140
And if you don't use a lot of text messages or mobile minutes or data if you're on Wi-Fi,

50:20.140 --> 50:24.720
that $25 service credit would potentially get you for a couple of months.

50:24.720 --> 50:25.720
It's ridiculous.

50:25.720 --> 50:26.720
It's such a nice setup.

50:26.720 --> 50:27.720
So check them out.

50:27.720 --> 50:30.840
Go to linux.ting.com.

50:30.840 --> 50:34.040
That lets them know you heard about it here and saves you some monies.

50:34.040 --> 50:35.040
Linux.ting.com.

50:35.040 --> 50:38.240
How's that pixel working out?

50:38.240 --> 50:39.240
Still pretty happy?

50:39.240 --> 50:40.240
Yeah, actually I'm very happy with it.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.240
Hmm.

50:41.240 --> 50:42.240
Hmm.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.240
Hmm.

50:43.240 --> 50:44.240
Pretty nice.

50:44.240 --> 50:45.240
Hmm.

50:45.240 --> 50:46.240
It's not quite like as it is now.

50:46.240 --> 50:47.240
It's last year's.

50:47.240 --> 50:48.240
The only thing that kind of makes me...

50:48.240 --> 50:49.240
I don't know.

50:49.240 --> 50:50.240
What is it?

50:50.240 --> 50:51.240
I don't know, man.

50:51.240 --> 50:52.240
I just, you know...

50:52.240 --> 50:53.240
Basically, I've been on the iPhone.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.240
Right.

50:54.240 --> 50:55.240
It's fine.

50:55.240 --> 50:58.840
But every mobile operating system starts to get on my nerves after a while.

50:58.840 --> 50:59.840
Yeah.

50:59.840 --> 51:00.840
That is...

51:00.840 --> 51:02.640
This time around, I just haven't invested that much.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.440
Like I haven't super customized it.

51:04.440 --> 51:05.440
Yeah.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.440
Just use it for like core things.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.440
Yeah.

51:07.440 --> 51:10.240
Because I get that same point where I'm like, this is just not the platform for me.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.240
Yeah.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.920
And it's interesting because I'm going further and I'm deeper in.

51:12.920 --> 51:23.320
Like now it's like there is maybe a handful of applications in the past I'd have to re-log

51:23.320 --> 51:24.320
into.

51:24.320 --> 51:29.040
But now, it's probably a good solid 15 applications.

51:29.040 --> 51:37.120
Like just an example, all my TP-Link power adapters, the DJI Phantom, the Amazon Echo,

51:37.120 --> 51:43.840
the Harmony Logitech remote that I have, the Wemo power adapters, all of those, all of

51:43.840 --> 51:47.440
the information, all of the configuration for all of those stupid things is on this

51:47.440 --> 51:48.440
stupid phone.

51:48.440 --> 51:51.160
And it makes switching harder and harder and harder.

51:51.160 --> 51:52.160
You're bought in.

51:52.160 --> 51:57.200
It almost makes me want to get out just because now they've tried to get me in.

51:57.200 --> 51:58.200
Yeah.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.680
Like I almost, a visceral response, I want to get out of here.

51:59.680 --> 52:01.280
I want to get out of here.

52:01.280 --> 52:03.480
But I should focus on more dramatic things.

52:03.480 --> 52:06.640
These Internet of Things devices, they're not just part of a lock-in system.

52:06.640 --> 52:10.140
They're not just making me more dependent on apps.

52:10.140 --> 52:13.060
They're also making us more vulnerable.

52:13.060 --> 52:18.960
And there's one that's sort of like the worst case scenario because it affects the children.

52:18.960 --> 52:23.720
And to set up this product for you, I'm going to play their commercial.

52:23.720 --> 52:26.000
It's called Cloud Pets.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.080
Saying goodbye can be hard.

52:28.080 --> 52:30.840
The ones you love seem so far.

52:30.840 --> 52:35.520
Now staying in touch is easy and fun with Cloud Pets.

52:35.520 --> 52:36.520
Just record a message.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.000
I hope you had a good day at school.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
I miss you.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.480
And send to the cloud.

52:40.480 --> 52:43.080
You know, let's stop right here.

52:43.080 --> 52:45.640
Before we go any further, yes, this company was hacked.

52:45.640 --> 52:51.280
All of their users' information was exposed online, including their actual conversations

52:51.280 --> 52:53.240
when they use this product.

52:53.240 --> 53:00.960
Full-fledged, not by one attacker, not by two, not by three, but by at least four separate

53:00.960 --> 53:03.400
attackers that can be identified potentially more.

53:03.400 --> 53:08.400
The company was notified not once, not twice, not three times, four times the company was

53:08.400 --> 53:10.800
notified and they did nothing.

53:10.800 --> 53:13.520
No password on their database.

53:13.520 --> 53:18.360
Their Amazon Web Services was left wide open with public URLs for all of the files.

53:18.360 --> 53:19.360
No.

53:19.360 --> 53:20.360
Yeah.

53:20.360 --> 53:22.240
So as we watch this, bear that in mind.

53:22.240 --> 53:23.800
With Cloud Pets.

53:23.800 --> 53:24.800
Just record a message.

53:24.800 --> 53:26.280
I hope you had a good day at school.

53:26.280 --> 53:27.280
I miss you.

53:27.280 --> 53:28.280
Let's stop right there.

53:28.280 --> 53:30.400
You know what drives me crazy about this type of advertising?

53:30.400 --> 53:36.080
The only time daddy is away from his little girl is when he is out at a hotel bringing

53:36.080 --> 53:39.500
home the bacon and mommy and the little girl are at home.

53:39.500 --> 53:43.040
This type of advertising is so basic.

53:43.040 --> 53:47.520
It's so insulting and this already, this company's got me upset.

53:47.520 --> 53:49.160
I hope you had a good day at school.

53:49.160 --> 53:50.160
I miss you.

53:50.160 --> 53:51.160
And send to the cloud.

53:51.160 --> 53:56.560
In just seconds, it floats down to the app on your smart device, allowing you to send

53:56.560 --> 53:58.120
the message to the Cloud Pet.

53:58.120 --> 53:59.800
I hope you had a good day at school.

53:59.800 --> 54:00.800
I miss you.

54:00.800 --> 54:02.400
It's a message you can hug.

54:02.400 --> 54:07.000
If you didn't catch that, that message you can hug doesn't even get sent directly to

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
the bear.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.360
They couldn't put a Raspberry Pi Zero in this thing.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.920
You have to separately like...

54:12.920 --> 54:16.240
So the mom in the background, of course, she's at home with the little girl because dad's

54:16.240 --> 54:17.240
out at home.

54:17.240 --> 54:18.980
She's the caring parent.

54:18.980 --> 54:24.280
She has to download it on her iPad and then upload it to this stupid bear.

54:24.280 --> 54:25.780
It's not even...

54:25.780 --> 54:26.780
It's amazing.

54:26.780 --> 54:29.600
And then the little girl hugs the message out of the bear.

54:29.600 --> 54:32.600
Now squeeze puppy's paw to send one back.

54:32.600 --> 54:35.600
Night daddy, I love you.

54:35.600 --> 54:38.920
Cloud Pets makes you feel like the ones you love are always near.

54:38.920 --> 54:39.920
Hi, this is grandma.

54:39.920 --> 54:41.320
See you real soon.

54:41.320 --> 54:45.360
The Cloud Pets app uses Bluetooth technology to send your messages.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.000
Hi, this is grandma.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.800
See you real soon.

54:48.800 --> 54:54.480
In other words, some parent or caretaker has to be near the damn bear and constantly uploading

54:54.480 --> 54:59.120
these files when they could just play the message on the iPad.

54:59.120 --> 55:00.120
Hi, grandma.

55:00.120 --> 55:01.120
Hi, grandma.

55:01.120 --> 55:07.200
Whether you're all the way on the other side of the world...

55:07.200 --> 55:08.200
I miss you guys.

55:08.200 --> 55:09.200
I'll be home soon.

55:09.200 --> 55:13.560
And this is the most insulting because it's a service member and he's all earnest and

55:13.560 --> 55:15.800
he's all sad and I'll be home soon.

55:15.800 --> 55:22.000
And of course, it's stereotypical white family, moms in the middle, two kids next to what

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
looks like the fakest fireplace.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.320
It's faker than my green screen fireplace.

55:26.320 --> 55:32.260
And it's the perfect family, which is an impossible standard, which then service members look

55:32.260 --> 55:36.760
at these types of advertising and they look at this impossible standard and they judge

55:36.760 --> 55:39.480
themselves by this and go, oh geez, we really don't have our shit together.

55:39.480 --> 55:44.400
Again, this kind of basic advertising is so insulting to have then expose everybody's

55:44.400 --> 55:45.400
information is just...

55:45.400 --> 55:46.400
I miss you guys.

55:46.400 --> 55:48.240
I'll be home soon.

55:48.240 --> 55:49.240
Or very close by.

55:49.240 --> 55:50.240
Good morning, sunshine.

55:50.240 --> 55:51.240
Make sure you eat your breakfast.

55:51.240 --> 55:52.240
Good morning, sunshine.

55:52.240 --> 55:53.240
Make sure you eat your breakfast.

55:53.240 --> 55:57.560
That's the last thing I want, a lecture toy.

55:57.560 --> 55:58.560
I know.

55:58.560 --> 55:59.560
I know.

55:59.560 --> 56:04.000
So this is the really dirty details about this.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.360
It is definitely the worst case scenario cloud device ever.

56:09.360 --> 56:14.120
This is more than two million voice recordings exposed of children and their parents, along

56:14.120 --> 56:20.960
with email addresses and passwords of over 820,000 user accounts.

56:20.960 --> 56:24.240
Clouds not only that, but cloud pets data was also held for ransom.

56:24.240 --> 56:29.880
The customer data was left unprotected from December 25th, 2016 to January 8th in a publicly

56:29.880 --> 56:36.640
available database that wasn't protected by any password or firewall.

56:36.640 --> 56:42.540
The creator of I've Been Pwned said that its exposed data was accessed multiple times by

56:42.540 --> 56:47.800
many third parties, including hackers, who used and stole customer emails and hash passwords

56:47.800 --> 56:50.040
from cloud pets database.

56:50.040 --> 56:53.780
In early January, cyber criminals were actively scanning the internet for badly configured

56:53.780 --> 56:56.840
Mongo databases and guess what?

56:56.840 --> 56:57.840
Cloud pets was one of them.

56:57.840 --> 57:00.480
Their database was actually overwritten twice.

57:00.480 --> 57:01.860
They didn't fix it then.

57:01.860 --> 57:06.400
The toy maker was allegedly notified four times that its customer data was online and

57:06.400 --> 57:10.620
available for anyone to have their hands on, yet the data remained up for almost a week,

57:10.620 --> 57:14.520
with evidence suggesting the data was stolen on multiple occasions.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.880
Cloud pets blog has not been updated to reflect this.

57:16.880 --> 57:19.380
In fact, it hasn't even been updated since 2015.

57:19.380 --> 57:22.800
So if you're a cloud pets customer, you essentially have, unless you're listening to the show

57:22.800 --> 57:26.340
or reading these blogs, have no idea this has happened.

57:26.340 --> 57:31.320
Look, we hacked them again, but get all the bears to spit out a security warning.

57:31.320 --> 57:33.520
So it's kind of funny because AWS is out today, right?

57:33.520 --> 57:36.080
And that's part of AWS is part of the story.

57:36.080 --> 57:39.360
So you had the MongoDB database.

57:39.360 --> 57:43.820
And that's where you got like the URLs and session IDs and user information.

57:43.820 --> 57:48.580
But spiral toys, the parent company used Amazon hosted services that required no authorization

57:48.580 --> 57:54.040
to store any of the recordings or profile pictures or the children's names and the relations

57:54.040 --> 57:59.160
to the parents and friends and family and pets and all of that is like a worst case

57:59.160 --> 58:01.460
scenario Internet of Things hack.

58:01.460 --> 58:03.100
And it's such a stupid product.

58:03.100 --> 58:08.340
And the other problem is not only is the company unresponsive, but check out their tutorial

58:08.340 --> 58:11.240
video on getting started.

58:11.240 --> 58:16.360
Sybil looks like Sybil looks like she is she is deeply she and I don't I'm just saying

58:16.360 --> 58:18.040
she looks like she's a deeply tortured woman.

58:18.040 --> 58:19.400
I don't know what's going on.

58:19.400 --> 58:30.840
But watch how Sybil tells us to set up a password email ready and choose a password and watch

58:30.840 --> 58:40.920
this Q W E and good Q W E confirmed and good in their official tutorial video with Sybil

58:40.920 --> 58:43.580
the tutorial host.

58:43.580 --> 58:50.780
They recommend a three character password Q W E and in fact tested by some security

58:50.780 --> 58:51.780
researchers.

58:51.780 --> 58:54.680
Their application allows a single digit password.

58:54.680 --> 58:55.680
If you so choose.

58:55.680 --> 59:02.120
Well I mean the children got to think of the children all this makes me sick and it's funny

59:02.120 --> 59:06.800
because we're recording this in the middle of an AWS outage and as part of this outage

59:06.800 --> 59:10.840
people on Twitter are really going on and on about how their Internet of Things devices

59:10.840 --> 59:13.880
are not responding right now which is just my bear is broken.

59:13.880 --> 59:19.800
Yeah because if this than that it depends on AWS and if it's just it's incredible.

59:19.800 --> 59:26.360
It is incredible that it is 2017 and a company like this exists where they just throw this

59:26.360 --> 59:28.280
crap online and don't bother securing it.

59:28.280 --> 59:33.200
But what's to stop them if they can get manufacturing that's crazy cheap if they can take advantage

59:33.200 --> 59:36.840
of people's smart devices that have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth they just have to throw together

59:36.840 --> 59:37.840
some Web services.

59:37.840 --> 59:41.440
It's a lot cheaper if you don't bother to secure your things properly.

59:41.440 --> 59:44.200
You don't have to even hire a sysadmin if you don't right.

59:44.200 --> 59:51.880
You know what you put a Docker image up online that's a big deal.

59:51.880 --> 59:52.880
Pretty bad.

59:52.880 --> 59:53.880
Pretty bad.

59:53.880 --> 59:54.880
Pretty bad.

59:54.880 --> 59:59.520
So you think there's like a market niche after this for like super secure cloud bear because

59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.520
maybe we should go into business.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:07.100
I don't I don't like being a like a naysayer of all cloud things because you're looking

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:11.880
at a man who is pretty pretty satisfied with the echo product.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:15.440
I just today set up another smart thing.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.440
You're a cloud child.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:21.560
I've been using the harmony right remote with it with the echo to turn my television and

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:24.320
soundbar on and off since our last episode.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.320
It's actually pretty great.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.240
I don't have any idea where some of those remotes are right now.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.940
I think I just put them away in a drawer.

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:29.940
It's the best thing ever.

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.400
It is literally the best thing ever when you when you sit down on your couch and you bark

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.600
at the echo to just turn on your television and it turns on the television the soundbar

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.840
and the Nvidia shield.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840
Mind blowing.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840
Great.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.840
That's been fun.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.840
You know what.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.840
And today I put a heater on it.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.200
I put a heater in the RV on this so now I can just tell the echo and turn the heater

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.200
on or off.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.200
I'm cold.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.880
I can actually tell I can actually tell this echo to turn it off at the RV at home.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.920
So before I leave I can have the heater turn on.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.920
Which saves power.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.920
I don't have to leave it running all day.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.620
But it's toasty warm when you get home.

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:01.440
So I don't want to be like this all cloud all innovative things.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.080
I'm not all Noah on this.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.200
I'm not all Alan Jude on this.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.000
I have a middle ground where I think there's a room there's room for products that are

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.300
well maintained.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:15.680
There's room for a product like like the transactional update products from Canonical there's room

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:16.680
for that kind of stuff.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:20.260
But you see this and it's just so disheartening that we're in the majority I feel like we're

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.260
never going to get it right.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.260
Yeah right.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:24.600
And that's the thing is like the more things we have like this than the less faith we have

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.920
in the entire marketplace.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:31.040
And there's unfortunately not enough pressure to make companies behave good.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.040
And they can just disappear.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.040
They sell a product.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:34.640
You got to do it right.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.640
You got to do it right.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.200
Go to DigitalOcean.com and do it right.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:40.680
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED after you create an account and you get a ten dollar credit

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:47.640
DigitalOcean.com sign up then use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED simple cloud hosting provider

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:53.240
and they have if you are totally a noob they have a fantastic beautiful easy to use interface

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.600
and they have one click deployments of systems that are updated.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:58.480
They partner with upstream providers.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.560
They make sure it's configured right and then they back it up with really clear really really

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.920
well done documentation.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:09.720
So you can deploy a system that is configured properly that does get updated or you can

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.720
build it from scratch.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.520
Go to DigitalOcean.com and try it.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.400
One of the things I love about their web UI is the HTML5 console.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.600
Not only is that just a handy feature to have but the way DigitalOcean has implemented it

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:27.080
there is some quote unquote power user features that you can take advantage of that really

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.960
up the flexibility of a DigitalOcean droplet.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:30.960
Try it out.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.960
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.280
They got data centers all over the world.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:37.240
They got an API that will make you fall in love with the concept of APIs.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:42.280
You're like Chris you always talk about APIs and I say where the hell have you been.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.640
Seriously what where have you been.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.920
But if you want to see an API done well you go over to DigitalOcean.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.600
They have an intuitive API.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.200
They have utilities where you can just get right to work with it.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.200
They have libraries and frameworks and they got everything up the wazoo.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.480
I mean they got a wazoo even for it.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.480
It's incredible.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.240
I actually I don't know for sure but I suspect that their own tools like the interface to

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.440
their website and all of that shenanigans must use the API.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.640
It's so well done.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.940
We use it every single day here at Jupiter Broadcasting for our DigitalOcean droplets.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:18.040
We turn on the things and we turn off the things all day long using the API.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.560
Even though their website is great I don't even have to log in.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.600
I do with a bot in our IRC chat room.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.960
You can deploy a new machine in seconds.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:30.520
All of their systems use SSDs from the five dollar a month rig all the way up to the ones

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.960
with gigabytes of RAM.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.520
They have 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisor.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.000
You can have team accounts.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.200
They have highly available block storage and the pricing is ridiculous for three cents

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.200
an hour.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.600
And remember we'll give you a ten dollar credit when you use the promo code D1Plugged for

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.280
three cents an hour.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.800
Two gigs of RAM a two core processor 40 gigabyte SSD and three terabytes of transfer.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.960
They've also just launched their new load balancer service which is online and working

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:55.960
right now.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.720
And it makes you look like a boss.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:03.160
Load balancers by DigitalOcean integrated in with their control panel 20 bucks a month.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.160
Boo yeah.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.160
Ridiculous.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.280
DigitalOcean.com use our promo code D1Plugged after you sign up and a big thank you to DigitalOcean

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.760
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.840
Now I like the idea of you know those like coin machines you throw your coins in they

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:17.000
sort them and give you money back.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.920
What about those but you just get like an AWS credit card you know.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.560
You're like hey I took my change and now I got servers.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.560
I love it.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:28.040
You know I've been I've been grousing off the air for the last couple of weeks that

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:34.920
the fine folks that package up G streamer for Arch Linux move the old buggy unsupported

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:40.600
G streamer 0.10 into the A U R. And that means every time I do an update I'm sitting there

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:46.000
trying to build G streamer it makes my A U R updates take way longer on most my systems

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.840
not all but most my system it fails to build anyways depending on your A U R client sometimes

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.120
that stops the entire update process.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.140
It's a bad experience and if you've been running into this and I've seen people grousing about

01:04:56.140 --> 01:05:02.640
it in our chat room check to see if anything actually depends on G streamer 0.10 because

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.560
it's old it's buggy it's unmaintained.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.000
You might just want to install all of it.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.480
I have the uninstall command just to take it all out in the show notes if you do and

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:16.980
you have your or substitute your own package manager and after I did this purge things

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:21.520
were running much better in my updates much smoother and it made me think about G streamer

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:28.320
a little bit as something that I've been following now for almost a decade I think.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.960
It has sort of a reputation as well that's how I watch videos on GNOME.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:37.960
Why do I need G streamer building in the A U R it's that thing I use to watch my video

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:43.920
but it actually has some pretty pretty as they say dope functionality Wes and I'm kind

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.960
of curious about some of the playing you've done recently because it sounds like you've

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:52.840
been kicking things around using G streamer and winning victories impressing the ladies

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.960
and showing friends how it's done.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960
Tell me all about it.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:00.280
I just I was just kind of rekindle I would have been playing with it maybe six months

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.640
ago eight months ago and I've been playing with it more recently work just because it

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.880
can do it has first class support for RTP and other things so you can use it to receive

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:14.200
like media from say a SIP call but it also does RTMP which is something we do a lot here.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.360
Yeah we do.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:24.000
That's how we send our video stream up to DigitalOcean from DigitalOcean to ScaleEngine

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.240
and YouTube and it just it just impresses me like there are some issues we've seen some

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.640
security things where you know like hey G streamer runs and it supports these weird things

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.520
and then that can cause you know it's not well tested or you have a bunch of like the

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:42.360
bad set of plugins that aren't good quality but and I'm also a big fan of FM pick but

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.800
I love that it has this like.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.800
Server side component to it.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:49.080
Well it has a server side component and it has like this notion of pipelines which is

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.080
very powerful and composable.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:54.820
So like FM pick works great there's a lot of options but it's not quite as composable

01:06:54.820 --> 01:07:02.680
or as clear, concise, well it's more concise but it's less like G streamer really has this

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:06.500
much like a Unix command line model where you can just take different pieces stick them

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:11.200
together build complex pipelines hey maybe you want to do like a video wall with four

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.240
pictures up on a screen and a timestamp yeah G streamer does it all.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:19.760
I have a graphic up on the screen that kind of attempts to illustrate this a little bit

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.200
because you can have like one of the pipes could be to a media player the other pipe

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.160
could be to a streaming server the other pipe could be to a real-time video editor which

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.840
is kind of a cool concept.

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:34.880
The other thing with the latest G streamer I think it's like 1.10 or something like that

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.800
they support Microsoft smooth streaming are you familiar with smooth streaming?

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.800
No I'm not.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:44.880
So this is interesting to anybody who's on sort of a crappy connection smooth streaming

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:51.600
is adaptive bitrate in real time so as your connection goes up it can stream a higher

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.680
bitrate and it's not just bitrate it can also adapt resolution so it can change to from

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:01.120
to an HD picture down you know way down to whatever you have support for and G streamer

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.360
has added support for that and that kind of got my attention because that's something

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.480
I know that the live stream they've been looking for that scale engines working on that YouTube

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:12.880
offers that somehow but I think you have to manually choose it kind of.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:18.920
So this is interesting G streamer is is so much more it's kind of like and boy this

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:26.640
is a risky comparison to make but it has elements of QuickTime.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:31.080
People really commonly think of QuickTime is just that really shitty video player especially

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.080
on Windows.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:38.960
I never really fought with it on Windows but I've heard horror stories and this it's just

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:42.920
that's like that's the tip of the iceberg that's like the totem or the movie player

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.920
on Gnome.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:51.600
The QuickTime plumbing and and and pipe system is what makes video editing on OS X better

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:57.080
than pretty much all of the other platforms QuickTime and core animation and and the accelerated

01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:02.800
graphics capabilities that plug into the QuickTime pipeline system are are really the secret

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:09.180
sauce of video editing and and motion compositing and work like that on OS X that if you don't

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:13.080
use G streamer on Linux you have to cobble together with different libraries yourself

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:18.760
and each editor in each or you know maybe Splendor whatever has to either find another

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:26.400
stack create their stack out of a collection of libraries or use G streamer.

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.360
What kind of stuff were you streaming around with?

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:31.040
I was doing the screencast or what?

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.520
Yeah doing that I've seen some projects and I played with a little bit like doing like

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.320
a video wall where you decompose a video into different segments and then send those each

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.520
to a different computer attached like a pie attached to different TVs.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.560
So are you streaming right now from this machine because I saw your webcam was on earlier was

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.760
earlier but I can be what is going on over there so what are you using what what software

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.880
do you use on the desktop there to start the stream?

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.880
G streamer.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.320
Okay so it's just a command command line yeah and you just say G streamer grab my webcam

01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:01.120
yeah and then send my webcam to yeah I have a URL if you want oh really where do I find

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:06.880
this URL all right go to we'll open up maybe MPV because it'll be an RTMP stream all right

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.680
oh oh all right all right let's do this right now here I'm gonna should I put is it okay

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:15.200
to put up on the you okay with the URL being public yeah it's just westpain.com oh look

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.320
at you I just needed I was just a droplet that I had a DNS name for.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:29.120
RTMP first RTMP oh right of course RTMP wes dot anything or westpain.com slash live slash

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:35.360
test slash live slash test okay let's see if it works all right video stream discovered

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.400
after having already parsed oh I like that I don't know what that means but I like it

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:46.080
survey says oh some red some red oh oh we got it oh there it is hey that's me there's

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:51.800
Wes's face there it is yeah we are but like at the same time if I want I could switch

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:56.260
it to sending my desktop we could be sending this so does the desktop show up as a virtual

01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:01.240
camera or how does that so I'm gonna try lighting you whoa boom there we go now I'm so now you're

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.320
lit let's see if that looks better on the stream here see what the delay it looks like

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:10.800
about it's probably and then I hit cancel because I was gonna switch oh okay let's do

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.280
this all right this is fast oh boom and it's down so it's about about a seven second eight

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.000
second delay there yeah and probably some of that is this I'm doing like a ton of things

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.040
and this is doing h264 conversion yeah yeah I believe you can get it to do like the quick

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.760
sync or other types of hardware offloading but I do you have the IRC on this yeah I'd

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.960
be curious to see what the if you paste it with the command you don't have to put the

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.360
whole URL for your server in there but I'd be curious to see what the command looks like

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.560
just so I can get an idea of how complicated that is because that's pretty nice Wes just

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:40.560
to have that built into gstreamer right there yeah seems like something I mean you can do

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.760
the same thing with ffmpeg there's a lot of overlap there so if that's your preferred

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:48.040
tool that's usually what I use but it's neat and it exposes some options that you might

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.080
not otherwise have and it makes it really neat to see like you saw some of those diagrams

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.200
there like if you want to do like a whole bunch of multiplexing into one thing and then

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.920
mix it and send it gstreamer it's a nice tool I was just thinking about how I would have

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.840
maybe used this back when I was working in IT and I could totally see setting up a like

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.440
a link on an intranet and I would say at this time let's go here and it would be a stream

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.400
of my desktop and we could do like a tutorial or a walkthrough yeah totally could you also

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.120
is it pretty straightforward to set up audio capture yes I don't have that working right

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:21.000
now sure yes so that seems like another like a headset it'd be a really nice way to do

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.680
like tutorials internally or something it really well that's a great idea mm-hmm way

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:29.760
of the future way of the future I'm gonna look more into it because I'm curious about

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:34.320
smooth stream I mean I know it's a Microsoft technology but if it's something if it works

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.200
well yeah I mean I really like the idea of it why not why can't why can't the player

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.520
in the server talk and say okay this is looks like a first rate support for what people

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.600
do with like dash or HLS yes so without it just having to like actually switch I don't

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:52.760
know exactly I don't know if exactly like with HLS it's kind of a hack because we essentially

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.300
do is have all of these different bitrate streams and you encapsulate them in a playlist

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:59.520
and then you throw them at somebody as fast as possible and it's possible to jump from

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:04.480
one one playlist stream to the other but most clients don't get that right and it all depends

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.520
on how good the client is if this is like you get one stream and this is my understanding

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.080
because I was looking at how flow soft has implemented and the way they do it is it's

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:18.640
one stream and you you connect to this stream and it adjusts the resolution and bitrate

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.500
in a range that they have set up for that stream so they predefined a range of what

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:27.280
the smooth stream can can fluctuate between and then you just connect to that one URL

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:32.240
interesting like a nice client experience yes yes could be a game you have to play with

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:36.760
some more game changer as they say Wes well interesting so where did you learn where did

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.320
you learn all these shenanigans about G streamer you can find like they have a G streamer cheat

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.960
sheet there's a lot of bloggers one thing I will say is the documentation could be improved

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:50.160
there's a lot of stuff there's a lot of documentation for that old zero dot one zero release so

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.960
some things have changed there's different command line options different parameters

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:58.520
to the plugins watch out for that but the 1.0 1.10 version can pretty much do all the

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:02.600
same stuff so you just have to tweak it a little bit very nice very nice thanks Wes

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:08.080
also Mr. Gogo in the chat room points out that the blog post about that teddy bear breach

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.960
yes is really good including more details about the company's response and I have that

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:16.040
linked in the show notes if you want to read more and they have other videos that are also

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:20.240
just as horrible all of that's linked up in the show notes you can go check that out go

a great place for stories to find more of Wes on the tech snap program find more of

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:59.220
me youtube.com slash Chris Fisher I'm going to have a behind the scenes edition of this

01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:26.080
here show there see you next week.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:47.120
So you know what's a real son of a bitch last week as I said Australia instead of Austria

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.680
that's a real son of a bitch and I think the problem is is that I think the same thing

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:56.040
so it's fine it's fine I think in part the problem is is that I'm probably dyslexic but

01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:04.400
I think the other thing is is that I'm not when I'm on the air my primary focus isn't

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:09.720
reading it's talking yeah right it's a different thing and it's talking about what I'm reading

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.600
and it it gets me more often than I'd like and then the other thing that compounds is

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.400
we don't edit very heavily so it's not like I go back and edit for content right like

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.400
if it was user air I would probably affix that because that's I did do that you would

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:27.160
have caught it but in this show I'm like no it's it's live to tape oh man it gets me

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:30.800
you know the thing is is then you also have to multiply it by volume because I do so many

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.920
shows and I've been doing them for so long like this just there's so many out there where

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:39.440
I've done this you can't win I cannot win nope I cannot so even track so as long as

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:44.440
everybody sets their expectations remembers that I am a simple man who can only do so

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:48.080
many things the things you say they'll probably start with the right letters so and you know

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:53.760
what else you know what else it's theater of the mind it's mad libs podcasting everybody

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.160
and you know it might be fun for the viewer we'll just try to make more mistakes and just

01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:18.480
see if you guys can catch them watch out
