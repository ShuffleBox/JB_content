00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 14 for November 12, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.040
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, the weekly Linux podcast still licking our

00:40.040 --> 00:44.940
wounds from a technical meltdown and basking in the glow of ideals. My name is Chris.

00:44.940 --> 00:45.940
My name is Matt.

00:45.940 --> 00:51.940
Hey there Matt. So we made it, we're on the air. Despite what the technical snafus might

00:51.940 --> 00:56.720
have tried, we've made it. It took a little behind the scenes magic. So last week for

00:56.720 --> 01:01.320
the Linux action show, we had a great interview with Joss from OpenSUSE and we were just marred

01:01.320 --> 01:04.560
in technical issues. We got like a two hour late start while the guest is waiting, he's

01:04.560 --> 01:09.080
got to go catch a flight so total pressure is on. And there we were like literally swapping

01:09.080 --> 01:13.320
hardware, streams going up, streams going down, recording starting and crashing. It

01:13.320 --> 01:18.600
was touch and go. And it's funny because it all comes at a time after where I as a Linux

01:18.600 --> 01:25.200
user and an open source advocate, free software believer had to struggle with going with the

01:25.200 --> 01:30.240
practical solution, right? The solution that the business owner has to go with to do media

01:30.240 --> 01:34.840
content and specifically video production. And I really had to fight this. And I ended

01:34.840 --> 01:39.000
up going with the practical route and then as it all collapsed down around me, I thought

01:39.000 --> 01:42.920
this is what I get. This is what I get. So I'm going to talk about that today because

01:42.920 --> 01:47.240
I think this is in some form or another an issue that a lot of Linux users struggle with.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.840
Oh, I struggle with it every day.

01:48.840 --> 01:54.000
Yeah, I do too actually. And sometimes you walk that line and you win some and you lose

01:54.000 --> 01:57.760
some. But first, at the top of the show, we usually like to do some follow up and I had

01:57.760 --> 02:00.800
a whole bunch of really good follow ups and then I somehow had a copy paste failure and

02:00.800 --> 02:07.620
lost a lot of them. But Ben comes to the rescue. So you might have heard of this little thing

02:07.620 --> 02:10.900
called Linux Format Magazine. Now you might be missing Linux Format. I don't know. I know

02:10.900 --> 02:15.100
I certainly have. But perhaps today you saw a new bat signal up in the sky called Linux

02:15.100 --> 02:19.720
Voice. Well, Linux Voice is an Indiegogo campaign that's just been launched by I believe some

02:19.720 --> 02:24.640
of the guys behind the Linux Format Magazine. And one of those guys, his name is Ben Everett.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.000
Everett, I believe he said it right. And he's joining us right now. Ben, welcome to Linux

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Unplugged.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.720
Hi, I'm glad to be here.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.760
Hey, man. Well, thank you, first of all, for joining us literally at the last minute.

02:34.760 --> 02:38.960
Yeah, we just launched the campaign yesterday. It's a really exciting time for us.

02:38.960 --> 02:43.040
Yeah, no kidding. That's why I wanted to get you on. So what are you guys doing here? I

02:43.040 --> 02:49.560
know Linux Format and I know that it was honestly Linux Format was my favorite Linux Magazine

02:49.560 --> 02:52.800
of all of them. I know you guys are trying to raise some funds. What are you trying to

02:52.800 --> 02:53.800
accomplish?

02:53.800 --> 02:59.720
Basically, we want to do more or less what we did with Linux Format, but we'll be free

02:59.720 --> 03:05.120
from the oversight of future so we can do it exactly the way we wanted to do it, which

03:05.120 --> 03:10.120
means a lot more giving back to the community, a lot more community involvement. So if you've

03:10.120 --> 03:15.080
seen the campaign, you'll know we'll be giving 50% of our profits back to the community.

03:15.080 --> 03:19.400
And we'll also be making our content free online after nine months. And it's things

03:19.400 --> 03:21.400
like that that we want to do differently.

03:21.400 --> 03:26.800
Oh, wow. Now, so is this going to be, this is going to be essentially what people are

03:26.800 --> 03:31.600
familiar with from the Linux Format Magazine, sort of rebooted and refined? Is that sort

03:31.600 --> 03:35.160
of what, if I'm envisioning that? Or is this, is this something a little bit different from

03:35.160 --> 03:36.160
Linux Format?

03:36.160 --> 03:43.040
Fundamentally, it'll be the same idea as Linux Format, the same rough layout, the same basic

03:43.040 --> 03:48.320
mix of tutorials, the same, aimed at the same sort of people, but hopefully done better.

03:48.320 --> 03:52.040
Interesting. Now, can you tell me about the podcast aspect of it?

03:52.040 --> 04:01.120
Bellamy there. Hello. Don't forget to push the talk. So now there's going to be a podcast

04:01.120 --> 04:02.600
component of it too, right?

04:02.600 --> 04:07.360
Yeah. I mean, we've been podcasting for a while as Tuck's Radar, then as Linux Lifestyle.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.000
So yeah, we'll just be shifting that over to Linux Voice.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.640
Awesome. So it's a magazine, but it's also something people can put in their ear holes

04:13.640 --> 04:16.000
if they're commuting, something like that.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Exactly.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.400
And you guys have got, as some of the perks, you actually get like a print subscription

04:21.400 --> 04:23.600
too. So there is going to be a print version.

04:23.600 --> 04:28.040
Absolutely. There's this sort of vague rumor that print is dead, but we don't believe that

04:28.040 --> 04:32.520
at all. I mean, print magazines are still selling really well. Linux Format increased

04:32.520 --> 04:37.680
its circulation last year. I mean, digital is obviously great, but print still has got

04:37.680 --> 04:39.240
a lot of life left in it.

04:39.240 --> 04:44.200
Yeah. I think that's awesome. I'm looking at the different tiers here and I'm thinking,

04:44.200 --> 04:47.720
if I'm going to throw down a thing, I'm going to throw it down for a print version. I guess

04:47.720 --> 04:52.240
I'm one of the minority, but for this particular type of content, I think I really like the

04:52.240 --> 04:54.400
idea of being able to thumb through it a little bit. Of course, that's why it's great. It's

04:54.400 --> 04:59.440
also a format in like audio or digital. So if I wanted to throw it on a device, I could.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.880
Well, very good. Very good, Ben. Well, I wish you guys a whole bunch of luck. And of course,

05:04.880 --> 05:10.240
we'll keep tabs on it. And is there anything else you wanted to mention before we go on?

05:10.240 --> 05:16.120
No. Just really encourage everyone to go and check out the campaign on Indiegogo and linuxvoice.com.

05:16.120 --> 05:20.000
Awesome. And we will have a link to it in the show notes. So folks, go over to episode

05:20.000 --> 05:25.280
14 of Linux Unplugged on Jupiter Broadcasting. We'll have a link to the Linux Voice Indiegogo

05:25.280 --> 05:29.600
project. Well, Ben, we're going to go into one bit of feedback that I did grab this week.

05:29.600 --> 05:35.680
You, however, are totally welcome to hang out with us. Part of Linux Unplugged is with

05:35.680 --> 05:38.840
sort of like an online lug aspect to it. We let people hang out and chat with us as we

05:38.840 --> 05:42.620
do the show. So you, sir, are more than welcome to hang out on air if you'd like. Or you can

05:42.620 --> 05:45.960
take off if you need to to get on with your day, because I know you did have to join us

05:45.960 --> 05:49.360
at the last minute. But interesting stuff, guys. So I'll put a link to this in the chat

05:49.360 --> 05:53.600
room right now if folks watching live want to go throw in a little bit. And of course,

05:53.600 --> 05:57.160
we will have it in the show notes. I don't know about you, Matt, but I love the idea

05:57.160 --> 05:59.720
of just having a Linux magazine in print.

05:59.720 --> 06:04.200
I think it's really telling that people are still under the impression that print is dead,

06:04.200 --> 06:08.000
because it's not. I, for one, prefer Linux magazines in print. That's just kind of how

06:08.000 --> 06:11.520
I like to absorb that. And I really love the idea of the model they're running with. I

06:11.520 --> 06:16.880
think it's fantastic. I think it's really cool to see the writers running the show.

06:16.880 --> 06:21.840
I think that's awesome. I think their mission statement of actually giving back to the community

06:21.840 --> 06:23.600
is awesome. I think the whole thing is great.

06:23.600 --> 06:28.320
It is great. It is great. So anyways, you guys can go check that out if you would like.

06:28.320 --> 06:34.720
All right. Well, I did save one email. I don't know how I lost all the other ones, but it

06:34.720 --> 06:39.960
was probably a pretty good one to keep, because it was on our topic of last week. So last

06:39.960 --> 06:44.960
week we talked about the Dark Mail Initiative, and I was pretty bullish on it at first. Now

06:44.960 --> 06:50.840
as I've had some time to reflect on it, I don't know if... I mean, honestly, nobody's

06:50.840 --> 06:54.600
unseated email yet, and that might have been to Adrian's point. He writes, in my main

06:54.600 --> 06:57.840
purpose for this email, after, by the way, he had a bunch of very nice things to say

06:57.840 --> 07:02.040
about the show, but I cut it down to, he said, my main purpose for this email was about the

07:02.040 --> 07:06.440
potential of dark mail. Thank you very much for an informative unplug session on the proposed

07:06.440 --> 07:10.520
new protocol considered for replacing email. I would like to ask if this may also benefit

07:10.520 --> 07:15.520
the world, then it may significantly reduce the amount of spam and fraudulent emails,

07:15.520 --> 07:18.960
if I'm correct, mail could be encrypted with something like private and public keys. Number

07:18.960 --> 07:23.560
one, if the email requires encryption, which takes longer to process before sending, and

07:23.560 --> 07:27.480
will cost more in the spammer's resources, so then would the spammers be less likely to

07:27.480 --> 07:31.960
bomb domains? I don't know if that's necessarily true now, because the type of encryption we're

07:31.960 --> 07:37.660
talking about, not very expensive. Now bit message type stuff is, there's a lot more...

07:37.660 --> 07:42.760
So bit message actually has something called proof of work that you have to complete, a

07:42.760 --> 07:46.720
math question that you have to answer before you're allowed to send, and that, if you've

07:46.720 --> 07:50.080
tried bit message, you've noticed it can sometimes be CPU intensive when you send a message,

07:50.080 --> 07:55.760
that's exactly why. And that becomes just not scalable for spammers, but something like

07:55.760 --> 08:00.360
signing an email with your GPG key, that's not going to slow them down.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.160
No, not even close.

08:02.160 --> 08:05.640
Number two, if the recipient has to decrypt the message, then only a public key of the

08:05.640 --> 08:08.520
sender will successfully reveal the message. This suggests that the spammer pretends to

08:08.520 --> 08:12.080
be eBay, then unless they have eBay's private key message, you'll not be able to decrypt

08:12.080 --> 08:16.680
quickly. That is true. That is a nice thing, is if you have a good key structure set up,

08:16.680 --> 08:19.160
then you can, at least it cuts down on phishing.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.800
Number three, he says, I do not know how public keys will be stored, but I can guess if a

08:22.800 --> 08:26.240
company is requesting tens of thousands of public keys, they're either on a mega legitimate

08:26.240 --> 08:30.360
company or a spammer, and they would get noticed. And that's interesting if you need somebody's

08:30.360 --> 08:31.880
key to send it to them.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.920
Yeah, that's an actually really interesting point.

08:33.920 --> 08:38.360
He says, I'm sure you may think of more ways, but the hope is not only to improve confidentiality

08:38.360 --> 08:42.680
with Dark Mail, but also to reduce spam. We'll see. And he's in Stonehenge, England.

08:42.680 --> 08:43.680
Good stuff.

08:43.680 --> 08:50.320
Yeah, it's some interesting thoughts. I guess after we did the episode, ours ran a piece

08:50.320 --> 08:56.080
about how Lavabit was never all that great security wise. And they tried to kind of,

08:56.080 --> 08:59.160
I thought the timing was a bit of a takedown because they're doing the Dark Mail initiative

08:59.160 --> 09:03.120
and they're not using the same technologies for the Dark Mail initiative that ours was

09:03.120 --> 09:04.120
writing a takedown on.

09:04.120 --> 09:08.000
Yeah, but fax never stops ours before. I mean, they nitpick whatever they want and kind of

09:08.000 --> 09:18.280
laugh it out there. Bam, so I went there. I'm just saying their whole approach is, I

09:18.280 --> 09:21.800
mean, here's the thing about Dark Mail. For it to succeed, it's really, really, really

09:21.800 --> 09:28.160
simple. The services we're already using, if they adopt Dark Mail, it succeeds. If those

09:28.160 --> 09:33.960
services we're already using do not adopt Dark Mail, it'll still succeed, but on a much,

09:33.960 --> 09:37.000
much smaller scale. It'll be much more bulletin board like.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.600
It'll be more Dark Mail. It'll be like TOR a little bit more.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.360
Yeah, exactly. It's going to be like some weird mesh network or something. It's just,

09:42.360 --> 09:43.360
it's going to be very limited.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.840
I think that's it. I think if Yahoo says, hey, Yahoo Mail is going to stand out and

09:46.840 --> 09:52.000
we'll adopt the Dark Mail protocol, or if Google says, you know what? We genuinely are

09:52.000 --> 09:55.880
so pissed off that the NSA broke into our data centers that we'll adopt the Dark Mail

09:55.880 --> 09:59.360
protocol. If those things happen, then I think we got it.

09:59.360 --> 10:03.240
Well, I think it's a great opportunity for Yahoo because they need a way to differentiate

10:03.240 --> 10:06.680
themselves. They're not really a search engine anymore. I mean, they're basically just Bing's

10:06.680 --> 10:09.920
little brother using their stuff.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.800
So they have a real great opportunity here to say, you know what? We're going to cut

10:12.800 --> 10:17.680
the cord. We're going to basically innovate and really shake things up and take some risks.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.800
Being a publicly traded corporation, that's always a little tricky, but I think it's worth

10:20.800 --> 10:21.800
a try.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.620
Or you could be Zimbra and you could be like, you know what? We're going to integrate this.

10:24.620 --> 10:27.440
This is another reason why you want to switch to Zimbra from Exchange.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.920
That would be very helpful. And that would be a really great testing area that if it

10:30.920 --> 10:33.240
succeeds there, then they can expand out.

10:33.240 --> 10:39.120
Yeah. Well, you never know. You just never know, Matt. Well, so look, I got to bear my

10:39.120 --> 10:48.860
soul on a few issues. I went through a self-struggling and evaluation process behind the scenes recently.

10:48.860 --> 10:51.080
Brought me to my core, Matt. Brought me down to my core. I questioned everything.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.320
It was just after you had a little cloud experience with your lost links?

10:54.320 --> 10:58.600
No, no. This was a couple of months ago. It was a couple of months ago and it was right

10:58.600 --> 11:04.600
before I spent a whole bunch of money on a big closed down, locked down system with this

11:04.600 --> 11:10.360
proprietary software that costs way too much money. And I really had to do this deep soul

11:10.360 --> 11:15.280
searching. Do I really, really, really want to do this? Do I really want to spend this

11:15.280 --> 11:21.440
money or, and I was just being practical, or do I want to reduce the scope of the Jupiter

11:21.440 --> 11:26.480
Broadcasting Network and just switch to audio only and just say, you know what? 30, 40%

11:26.480 --> 11:30.160
of our audience, I'm sorry, we love you, but I just can't do video anymore. That would

11:30.160 --> 11:34.720
be gone to YouTube, it would be by YouTube, it would be by video embeds, right? All gone.

11:34.720 --> 11:38.640
We only do audio. And that would be a massive reduction for the network. But I was at this

11:38.640 --> 11:44.420
point where it's like I could spend five grand on a Mac Pro and another grand on Wirecast

11:44.420 --> 11:48.180
and I could build a proprietary, I could build the next version of the proprietary system

11:48.180 --> 11:53.120
that I used to run the network now for recording and streaming. Or I could just say, I'm not

11:53.120 --> 11:57.880
going to do it anymore. I could let my ideal stand through and say, you know what? I can't

11:57.880 --> 12:02.840
do it. I'm just going to do what my ideals allow me to do. Because I'm also the type

12:02.840 --> 12:07.720
of person where if I can't do it well enough, like even maybe initially I can't do it well

12:07.720 --> 12:11.560
enough, but I feel like eventually I'll be good at it, I'll start. But if I feel like

12:11.560 --> 12:15.360
there's not a lot of chance that I'm ever going to have it at the quality level I want,

12:15.360 --> 12:16.840
I'd rather just not do it, right?

12:16.840 --> 12:17.840
Yeah, exactly.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.240
So video production on Linux, I'd rather just not do it.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.240
Well, and I think the one thing we keep running into with people is they say, but you can

12:24.240 --> 12:28.840
do video production under Linux and they point to other popular video podcasts out there,

12:28.840 --> 12:32.480
one specifically to gaming, for example, and they say, well, you can do it that way. And

12:32.480 --> 12:36.240
I think that perhaps this is an opportunity for you to explain why that may not be a good

12:36.240 --> 12:37.240
fit for us.

12:37.240 --> 12:40.920
And you know, so I'm going to talk about that. But I also, I want to talk about how just

12:40.920 --> 12:44.520
in general too, as Linux users, there's always these things that come up that we're like,

12:44.520 --> 12:49.080
oh, my ideals are one thing, but the pragmatism in me is going a different direction. And

12:49.080 --> 12:54.760
sometimes in the long run, you know, you pull an RMS a little bit and it turns out that

12:54.760 --> 12:55.760
maybe-

12:55.760 --> 12:58.280
And the value of this is negative.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.800
Maybe you should have gone with the ideals. But before we talk about that, because that's

13:01.800 --> 13:05.280
sort of the premise, and you know what, maybe I'll also give the background since you were

13:05.280 --> 13:06.280
there.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.280
Oh, yes.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.240
You got to see what people watching live didn't get to see while we were down. You were there.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.560
So I'll also talk about what the hell happened this weekend. A lot of people have been asking

13:13.560 --> 13:18.360
about that. But before we do that, I want to thank our sponsor this week, DigitalOcean.

13:18.360 --> 13:22.320
Now you guys might not be familiar with DigitalOcean now since they were here last week. They're

13:22.320 --> 13:26.800
here again this week, and I'm very, very excited. Now if you're not familiar with DigitalOcean,

13:26.800 --> 13:30.080
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting. They have dedicated offerings with the most intuitive

13:30.080 --> 13:35.200
and easy to spin up systems ever. Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds and pricing

13:35.200 --> 13:40.880
plans start at $5 per month. They get you 512 megs of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD drive,

13:40.880 --> 13:45.040
and a CPU, and also a terabyte of transfer. DigitalOcean has data center locations in

13:45.040 --> 13:49.000
New York, San Francisco, and Amsterdam. The interface is simple, intuitive, the control

13:49.000 --> 13:53.480
panel is brilliant, and power users have a bunch of great features too, like Docker support,

13:53.480 --> 13:54.960
replicating backup images.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.840
Oh, nice. I like the Docker support, right?

13:57.840 --> 14:04.680
Oh, dude. Matt, the Docker thing is... We've talked about Docker. It allows me as a sys

14:04.680 --> 14:09.540
admin or it would allow somebody as a developer to create a completely isolated environment

14:09.540 --> 14:13.400
locally on their laptop, on their desktop, test it, get everything working just the way

14:13.400 --> 14:17.360
they want, spend all their time locally working on it, make that Docker snapshot, move it

14:17.360 --> 14:23.000
up to DigitalOcean, and spin it up and have it running on one of their SSD powered VPSs.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.800
Now I'm looking at the Create Droplet screen right now. This gives you an example of how

14:26.800 --> 14:30.360
intuitive their interface is. You give it a host name, so like I could say unplugged

14:30.360 --> 14:34.640
for the host name, and I could choose which one I want. Now I'm going to choose 512 megs

14:34.640 --> 14:39.380
of RAM, 20 gig SSD with a terabyte of transfer. That's $5 a month, and what's awesome right

14:39.380 --> 14:44.640
now, if you use the code LINUX13, lucky number 13, LINUX13, they're going to give you a $10

14:44.640 --> 14:50.400
credit, so you can try out one of these VPSs for free for two months, and the one I spun

14:50.400 --> 14:53.960
up I put up in New York, and I went with an Archbox, but they've also got Ubuntu, CentOS,

14:53.960 --> 14:57.560
Debian, and Fedora. You could also just say it by application. You know, hey, I want a

14:57.560 --> 15:04.920
LAMP server, or give me a Git server, right? This is a good one. I've already got my Docker

15:04.920 --> 15:10.040
created. Create me an Ubuntu 1304 machine with Docker already installed, so I can just

15:10.040 --> 15:14.440
drop it on there, and I am ready to go, or hey, you know what? I need a WordPress blog.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.620
You can click right here. They'll spin one up. It is so cool, and then once you get it

15:17.620 --> 15:22.240
just set up the way you want, you can create that image, so then from that point forward,

15:22.240 --> 15:25.720
you can just spin up additional machines as you need based on that, so like for me, I

15:25.720 --> 15:29.360
started with an Arch machine, got it really nice and minimal, just what I needed, got

15:29.360 --> 15:32.580
a few things set up. I could take an image of that, and then from then on, whenever I

15:32.580 --> 15:37.040
want an Arch machine, I just use that image if I want. It's so awesome. They call them

15:37.040 --> 15:41.240
Droplets. It's really cool. It's based on KVM, which is great, some great Linux technology

15:41.240 --> 15:44.840
using Docker as well. I love all of it, and really, when you're using the code LINUX13,

15:44.840 --> 15:48.080
you can try it out for free. I've been using it recently to do backup recordings of our

15:48.080 --> 15:52.960
live stream, to do BitTorrent sync distributions of the Unfilter Supporter Show, so that way

15:52.960 --> 15:57.120
people get better speeds when they're pulling that down. DigitalOcean also has something

15:57.120 --> 16:01.020
really cool for their community. They have a collection of tutorials on their community

16:01.020 --> 16:05.400
site, and users can submit an article, and if it gets published, that user will get paid

16:05.400 --> 16:07.280
50 bucks, which is pretty neat.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.880
Can't beat that with a stick. It's great all the way around, and I love the fact that you

16:10.880 --> 16:15.240
can do a remote Arch install, and then do BitTorrent sync or something like that. That's

16:15.240 --> 16:16.240
so awesome.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.240
It is really awesome.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.120
The geekiness, it just makes you salivate.

16:19.120 --> 16:23.320
The LINUX13 is where you get started. You can go check it out, and these things, the

16:23.320 --> 16:27.080
fast connection combined with the SSD really does make a difference, and the other thing

16:27.080 --> 16:32.080
I love about it is I've tried other systems in the past, specifically from Rackspace and

16:32.080 --> 16:37.560
Amazon, and both of them have gotchas. Like, oh, here's your DING for your CPU usage. By

16:37.560 --> 16:39.680
the way, you use this much bandwidth, here's the DING.

16:39.680 --> 16:44.380
The great thing about DigitalOcean is I know exactly what my cost is. It's $5 a month,

16:44.380 --> 16:50.440
and if I use 900 megabytes of transfer, if I use a terabyte of transfer, it is $5 a month.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.720
There's not, at the end of the month, this, oh my goodness!

16:52.720 --> 16:53.720
Yeah, surprise!

16:53.720 --> 16:58.640
Yeah, it's a fixed cost. It's exactly what I expect, and because it's there, I keep coming

16:58.640 --> 17:03.520
up with new uses for it all the time. Trust me, you want your own Linux server on demand

17:03.520 --> 17:06.880
up in the cloud, and you can have it in Amsterdam, you can have it in New York, and you can have

17:06.880 --> 17:12.160
it on the West Coast, so go to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code LINUX13 when you check

17:12.160 --> 17:16.380
out. That lets them know that you appreciate them sponsoring Linux Unplugged, and it also

17:16.380 --> 17:20.840
gets you two months for free if you get that $5 unit, or you could get the big boy for

17:20.840 --> 17:24.120
10 bones a month, and just have it free for that month and just try it out. I'm not going

17:24.120 --> 17:28.560
to judge. You do what you want. You do what you want, and thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

17:28.560 --> 17:29.560
Linux Unplugged.

17:29.560 --> 17:33.240
Big thank you. That's just awesome stuff, and boy, I'll tell you, I've got a couple

17:33.240 --> 17:35.880
of items I might be rolling out onto this here pretty quick.

17:35.880 --> 17:40.280
Boy, howdy, Matt. Boy, howdy. Once you've got it, once you've got a system, there's

17:40.280 --> 17:45.160
like, oh, you know what? I've been kind of wanting to do this. I could do that up there,

17:45.160 --> 17:48.800
and then something else. You know what? I've been wanting to do this. I'll toss that up

17:48.800 --> 17:50.100
there. It's been really cool.

17:50.100 --> 17:53.460
It's like someone just dumped out a big box of Legos with every piece I've ever wanted

17:53.460 --> 17:56.200
directly in front of me that I can build anything I want. It's awesome.

17:56.200 --> 18:03.800
Yeah, it is pretty cool. So this week, I've got to just take a deep breath. We had a rough

18:03.800 --> 18:08.360
Sunday. We had a really rough Sunday. So Friday, we canceled the fo' show, so that way I could

18:08.360 --> 18:12.800
take the studio offline. Okay, I've got to back up even further. I've got to back up

18:12.800 --> 18:18.000
even further. Years ago, when we decided to switch from audio to video, that's when we

18:18.000 --> 18:22.640
made the switch from producing the Linux action show and related shows. At that time, it was

18:22.640 --> 18:27.320
pretty much just Linux action show on Linux. We made the switch from Linux to a Hackintosh.

18:27.320 --> 18:33.960
I thought I could cheat. I thought I would get by, and I wouldn't get a Mac. I wouldn't

18:33.960 --> 18:39.880
be legit. I'd do a Hackintosh, and that sort of made it okay. It meant I wasn't investing

18:39.880 --> 18:41.600
a bunch of money in Apple hardware.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.480
You weren't investing in the hardware, and you still got to get some geek cred.

18:44.480 --> 18:51.720
And I could dual boot Windows and Linux on them. So I used this time, and I was a contractor

18:51.720 --> 18:55.680
back then, and I just made plenty of money, because I was just working crazy hours as

18:55.680 --> 19:00.880
a contractor. I even had a bonus structure set up, so when I went over 40 hours, I made

19:00.880 --> 19:05.520
like a good percentage rev share of the revenue from that client for the month. So I was making

19:05.520 --> 19:11.320
good money, and so within a three or four month period, I spent about $10,000 trying

19:11.320 --> 19:16.560
out different hardware and software configurations under the Macintosh, Linux, and Windows, trying

19:16.560 --> 19:22.400
to come up with a solution to provide real quick, fast production video and live streaming

19:22.400 --> 19:25.160
that I could then turn into these shows.

19:25.160 --> 19:31.320
And I landed after all of that testing on the Mac, and that's when I went with Hackintosh.

19:31.320 --> 19:34.940
And this has been fine, and this is a system that I've evolved and continued to sort of

19:34.940 --> 19:40.120
improve upon throughout the years, till where we're at this summer. Then the summer comes

19:40.120 --> 19:44.200
along and the Hackintosh starts to die. It's just gotten old, and what we need from it

19:44.200 --> 19:48.120
is beyond what the hardware is capable of. And there's no upgrade path for the operating

19:48.120 --> 19:51.760
system, because it probably won't boot if I upgrade it. And now the software we use

19:51.760 --> 19:56.040
is starting to require new versions of the OS, and all of these problems that you run

19:56.040 --> 19:59.640
into. So I'm like, okay, all right. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to

19:59.640 --> 20:03.440
buy a Mac Pro. I'm going to put the OS on there, and I'm going to load the software

20:03.440 --> 20:07.360
on there, and I'm just going to be a big boy, and I'm just going to swallow the medicine,

20:07.360 --> 20:08.360
right?

20:08.360 --> 20:12.600
I remember this, and I remember right before the purchase, you really weighed out all your

20:12.600 --> 20:16.000
pros and cons and decided you're going to bite the bullet. You're just going to do what

20:16.000 --> 20:18.560
needs to be done. And clearly, this is going to solve all your problems, right?

20:18.560 --> 20:26.680
I looked at the numbers and I said, I really honestly considered for a couple of days dropping

20:26.680 --> 20:29.920
video, because then I wouldn't need to buy the Mac. I wouldn't need to buy the commercial

20:29.920 --> 20:35.640
software. I could go back to doing all the production under Linux, and now that Linux

20:35.640 --> 20:38.880
has gotten even further, it's even better than it was back then, right? So it's like

20:38.880 --> 20:41.280
there's more incentive to do that now than there used to be.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.280
Oh, absolutely.

20:42.280 --> 20:46.600
So I'm thinking, God, I would love to do this. And so for a couple of days, I gave real serious

20:46.600 --> 20:49.880
thought. And everybody listening, think about this. All video production on Jupiter Broadcasting

20:49.880 --> 20:54.880
almost went away, right? Because I really wanted to switch.

20:54.880 --> 21:01.280
And so at the end, after really thinking about it, I knew that that would be just too much

21:01.280 --> 21:04.040
of a loss. People do not like it when you take away things.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.040
No.

21:05.040 --> 21:08.840
Because going from video to audio is a big, totally different animal than going from audio

21:08.840 --> 21:09.840
to video.

21:09.840 --> 21:10.840
From audio to video.

21:10.840 --> 21:11.840
Yeah.

21:11.840 --> 21:12.840
Which is actually an addition versus a subtraction.

21:12.840 --> 21:18.360
Right, right. And so I thought, okay, all right, I got to do it. So I bought the Mac Pro,

21:18.360 --> 21:21.320
which has been marred with certain hardware failures, which I've had all repaired under

21:21.320 --> 21:26.160
warranty, which is now fine. Then I kind of strategically waited to deploy it, because

21:26.160 --> 21:30.720
a new version of the software that Jupiter Broadcasting uses, Wirecast, Wirecast from

21:30.720 --> 21:37.280
Telestream came out. Version 5 came out on September 5, 2013, Matt. And I thought, I'm

21:37.280 --> 21:41.640
going to give this time to cook. Now, I happen to know people who work with it. They worked

21:41.640 --> 21:42.640
with it in beta.

21:42.640 --> 21:43.640
Yeah.

21:43.640 --> 21:44.640
And they gave it the thumbs up.

21:44.640 --> 21:45.640
It's great. Try it.

21:45.640 --> 21:49.800
So I thought, okay, if I'm going to deploy this, I don't want to deploy something that

21:49.800 --> 21:53.300
I'm just going to have to update in a few weeks anyways. So I'm going to go straight

21:53.300 --> 22:00.680
to the new version. It's been out since September. Give this a go. Oh, boy. So there was, there's

22:00.680 --> 22:04.360
a lot of bugs. So this is a case not to go with rolling, right? Because here I am, Mr.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.360
Rolling saying, I went with the new stuff and boy, did I get hit.

22:07.360 --> 22:11.520
Exactly. Yeah, you kind of made someone else's point there. But still, still.

22:11.520 --> 22:16.440
So it had a few features though that would sort of justify it. Like it has X264 support,

22:16.440 --> 22:21.040
much superior video codec, right? And that plays through in like the remote network.

22:21.040 --> 22:26.740
Like right now it is, Wirecast is capturing the screen from a computer that is an entirely

22:26.740 --> 22:30.240
different room in my house than the Wirecast machine is, right? Because it is over the

22:30.240 --> 22:34.240
network, over the gigabit network, and they improved it now so that the network capture

22:34.240 --> 22:39.200
can do 60 frames per second over the network. That's great for games and stuff.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.200
Sure.

22:40.200 --> 22:43.440
So I was like, okay, I kind of want that. And then the last feature they added that

22:43.440 --> 22:49.520
I just thought I just had to have is the ability to take an RTMP stream and pull it in as a

22:49.520 --> 22:53.940
camera source. So when Alan does BSD now up in Canada, I could pull it in and retransmit

22:53.940 --> 23:00.040
it out to all of our endpoints like Roku's, XBMC's, the audio stream. So it gives a more

23:00.040 --> 23:02.920
complete. So I'm like, all right, these are enough compelling features. I know people

23:02.920 --> 23:06.280
have had it in production. I'm going to go ahead and deploy it.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.280
Seems like a great idea.

23:08.280 --> 23:14.900
Yeah. Then I've had nothing but issues. So Friday, or Sunday, I'm sorry. I mean, how

23:14.900 --> 23:17.000
would you describe what was happening, man? I was just...

23:17.000 --> 23:20.900
So let me give you the spectator support. Have you ever seen one of those really angry

23:20.900 --> 23:24.080
monkeys that were in the diapers that swing around from the trees and fling things? That

23:24.080 --> 23:28.440
didn't actually happen. What did happen is Chris worked really hard at trying to find

23:28.440 --> 23:34.240
out what was going on. It was just basically one issue after another with it. Basically,

23:34.240 --> 23:37.680
he would start up the stream, he'd turn around, and then it would drop.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.680
Yeah.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.880
Then he would start it up again. He'd stare at it for a little bit.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.040
He wouldn't touch anything, right? Just look at it.

23:43.040 --> 23:47.840
Never touch it. As soon as the eyes have rolled off of the monitor and he's heading back to

23:47.840 --> 23:55.040
the seat, it's down every time. And after a while, it becomes like a perverse bad joke.

23:55.040 --> 24:00.120
It's like seriously, it's like there's someone out there with a clapper trying to clap, turning

24:00.120 --> 24:04.200
stuff off. It was the weirdest thing. And so yeah, it was very frustrating.

24:04.200 --> 24:11.680
So we actually... I'm an old enterprise IT guy, right? So I'm about what's your disaster

24:11.680 --> 24:18.480
recovery plan during a core IT upgrade. So I spent extra money, doubled up on some hardware

24:18.480 --> 24:22.360
that way it wasn't like... Initially, I was going to be cheap about it. And I was going

24:22.360 --> 24:26.880
to take parts from the Hackintosh, like all the HDMI capture cards and some of the drives,

24:26.880 --> 24:29.860
and I was going to put them in the new Mac Pro so that way I could spend as little as

24:29.860 --> 24:31.400
possible on a Mac Pro.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.400
Yeah.

24:32.400 --> 24:38.360
And then as I thought about my thought, if this doesn't work, I've got mixed new and

24:38.360 --> 24:43.480
old hardware in here and I can't just immediately revert back to the Hackintosh. So I spent

24:43.480 --> 24:47.440
the extra money and got new stuff all for it. And so that way I could swap the two.

24:47.440 --> 24:52.000
So there we were Sunday morning, already an hour late, our guest, Joss, had a flight he

24:52.000 --> 24:56.040
needed to catch. He's in Germany. It's 10 a.m. Pacific time. God only knows what time

24:56.040 --> 24:59.960
it was in Germany at that time. He's waiting on us. We can't even be in the stream to tell

24:59.960 --> 25:00.960
him what's up.

25:00.960 --> 25:01.960
Right.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.880
And I'm too busy fixing to really even tell him what's up. So I think probably at least

25:05.880 --> 25:08.840
five or six times thought, we don't have an episode this week.

25:08.840 --> 25:15.520
Yeah. Chris looked at me dead eyed and said, I honestly, I don't have a solution to this.

25:15.520 --> 25:19.520
What do we do? And of course, I'm thinking, whatever you need to do is cool, but we're

25:19.520 --> 25:23.640
both just kind of shrugging, going, ah, you know, what do we do? What do we do? Yeah.

25:23.640 --> 25:27.560
And so I was like, all right, I'm going to swap back. So I swapped back to the Hackintosh.

25:27.560 --> 25:31.960
I plug the Hackintosh all back up, which never goes as smooth as it's supposed to. Right.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.960
There was little wiggly things that I had to get right. The HDMI capture cards didn't

25:34.960 --> 25:38.920
work. So we had to shut everything off. Everything, all the computers had to be turned off, all

25:38.920 --> 25:42.640
the camera, everything had to go down and turn it all back on. Didn't work. We had to

25:42.640 --> 25:46.120
shut everything down again, turn it all back on. Then it worked the second time.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.080
When watching this, it looked like you were playing Twister.

25:48.080 --> 25:54.320
The Hackintosh has some sort of like GPU problem and it was totally not working. So then after

25:54.320 --> 25:58.360
switching to the Hackintosh, we knew we had to go back. We had to switch back to the new

25:58.360 --> 26:03.320
Mac Pro and try to get that solution, which we just bailed from working. And at this point,

26:03.320 --> 26:08.120
I'm thinking, my God, if we just get it up and a single camera shot on Joss or on the

26:08.120 --> 26:13.000
chat room, we'll just hit record and we'll just print what we get. Right. Exactly. And

26:13.000 --> 26:17.520
so I put the new machine back in, hook everything back up. And of course, there's like random

26:17.520 --> 26:22.160
bugs and wirecasts where all the HDMI interfaces get reassigned every time it restarts. So

26:22.160 --> 26:25.240
that way, what was once the camera is now the Skype machine, which was once the Skype

26:25.240 --> 26:29.760
machine is now the camera, which was once my Bonobo is now the USB webcam.

26:29.760 --> 26:32.440
This just adds, of course, to the already growing workload.

26:32.440 --> 26:36.200
Right. Because then every shot has to be edited that refers to those cameras to now refer

26:36.200 --> 26:40.240
to the new mapping every time. All of this is happening while we're trying to communicate

26:40.240 --> 26:43.880
with the live stream, what's going on, trying to communicate with our guests, get back up

26:43.880 --> 26:49.580
and running, realize it's like one teensy-tinsy little config issue that was a default on

26:49.580 --> 26:53.880
how the audio got encoded, which I didn't even want. It was a change default, I think.

26:53.880 --> 26:57.840
I think it was actually changed without your knowledge. It was applying AAC compression

26:57.840 --> 27:01.120
to the audio, which I didn't want that. I want uncompressed audio. That's how I roll.

27:01.120 --> 27:06.600
Right. And then so changing that resolved the immediate crashing. What I later discovered

27:06.600 --> 27:10.680
through correspondence, I sent them a few of the crash reports from the software. Later

27:10.680 --> 27:15.080
correspondence with the support, I realized, I don't know why this was never a problem

27:15.080 --> 27:19.600
with the previous version, but Wirecast 5 is only a 32-bit application.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.920
Oh, for pizza. Seriously?

27:21.920 --> 27:23.320
I got a machine.

27:23.320 --> 27:24.880
How adorable. 32.

27:24.880 --> 27:29.280
I got a machine with 32 gigs of RAM and then a 32-bit core application.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.760
It's kind of like, wait, what now?

27:31.760 --> 27:38.680
And so it turns out X264, because it can utilize your system more, combined with the Morph

27:38.680 --> 27:44.360
processor threads and memory usage, the two things were just... And I was sending an X264

27:44.360 --> 27:48.080
stream off to Scale Engine for the streaming, because then the live stream would look better.

27:48.080 --> 27:52.480
And again, it was their default setting. So I went with that. And so what I've discovered

27:52.480 --> 27:57.600
now is I fixed that audio compression setting. So it's just doing uncompressed audio. And

27:57.600 --> 28:03.800
I turned off using X264 for the live stream. So now we're using regular H264, the slightly

28:03.800 --> 28:09.280
inferior version of H264. And so far, the machine is now running, according to Wirecast,

28:09.280 --> 28:14.960
at 98% memory usage. That's how close we are. In fact, I'll go check it right now, because

28:14.960 --> 28:16.280
sometimes we even go over a little bit.

28:16.280 --> 28:22.960
So help me to understand that. In almost 2014, they released a new version of an application

28:22.960 --> 28:27.600
designed for pro use that's designed for 32-bit systems. Am I understanding that correctly?

28:27.600 --> 28:29.600
Yeah. Okay. So right now it's using 90...

28:29.600 --> 28:30.600
That's disgusting.

28:30.600 --> 28:37.160
It's using 93% of the memory now. And so there's just an S ton of free RAM sitting on the box

28:37.160 --> 28:38.160
not being used.

28:38.160 --> 28:44.080
Yeah. It's completely not being used, because you can't. I mean, oh my God. I can't fathom

28:44.080 --> 28:48.560
how they would release a new version of an application that's running with standards

28:48.560 --> 28:50.040
from five, 10 years ago.

28:50.040 --> 28:56.560
I think it's... So this is part of the problem is video production software has this massive...

28:56.560 --> 29:00.960
It's like building a car. It has this huge pipeline of production, and they start working

29:00.960 --> 29:06.400
on it back in the day. And then by the time they get it to a point where it's good, they

29:06.400 --> 29:11.880
have all this legacy baggage. And this is why Apple aborted Final Cut 7 and upset everybody.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.920
Well, apparently that's what Wirecast might've needed to do as well, because now they have

29:15.920 --> 29:21.800
all this technical debt that they're stuck with that is really plaguing it. And I looked

29:21.800 --> 29:25.760
back on this and thought, if I had that time, made the decision to just drop video for now

29:25.760 --> 29:32.280
and maybe in a couple of years... Here's the thing though. I honestly don't think video

29:32.280 --> 29:36.800
production will ever come to Linux at the level it is available to the Mac.

29:36.800 --> 29:39.920
Not unless there's a vested interest with high money. No.

29:39.920 --> 29:42.840
A company like Valve, but even then...

29:42.840 --> 29:47.480
It would require a studio that has a falling out with somebody that gets mad enough. But

29:47.480 --> 29:48.480
even then...

29:48.480 --> 29:52.360
One of the reasons why it works for the Mac is because there's this huge ecosystem of

29:52.360 --> 29:59.840
software vendors, like Telestream making Wirecast, like Blackmagic making the Intensity, all

29:59.840 --> 30:04.040
of the capture technology, all the Thunderbolt peripherals, all the USB stuff that all are

30:04.040 --> 30:10.760
designed to work with the Mac. And that takes five, 10, 15 years in the marketplace to develop

30:10.760 --> 30:15.400
businesses around it. There's entire businesses that sell products around that.

30:15.400 --> 30:19.160
I don't think it's ever going to come to Linux. And I think what will happen is we'll just

30:19.160 --> 30:25.200
do it differently. And that will be doable on Linux. I think what we have with Hangouts...

30:25.200 --> 30:29.680
Google now with Hangouts, you can do real time lower thirds. You can do green screening.

30:29.680 --> 30:35.120
You can add all kinds of effects with the cheesy apps. And you can do it all from Linux.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.120
And it's not free. It's not open.

30:37.120 --> 30:41.040
And you're locked into a YouTube experience if you want to pop it out to something. That's

30:41.040 --> 30:42.040
the problem.

30:42.040 --> 30:47.520
But it shows you it can be done. And so maybe down the road, something... It sounds crazy

30:47.520 --> 30:50.200
today, but I think if you would have told people that they do photo management in the

30:50.200 --> 30:54.880
cloud 10 years ago, they'd say you're crazy. I think video editing will become an online

30:54.880 --> 31:01.480
app in a lot of cases. And the more powerful these web browsers get with WebGL and OpenAL

31:01.480 --> 31:05.200
and all these things, I think eventually it's just going to move to something else completely.

31:05.200 --> 31:08.360
And then Linux will just be included at that point.

31:08.360 --> 31:14.880
There are some NOE editors out there that are... They're very, very early days, very

31:14.880 --> 31:18.720
close movie maker level. But I think it shows that, as you point out, it can be done. We

31:18.720 --> 31:23.160
need to basically give it time. I need to win the Powerball and actually drop some coin

31:23.160 --> 31:25.160
into developing a solution of that sort.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.160
I don't think though...

31:26.160 --> 31:27.160
That'd be cool.

31:27.160 --> 31:32.200
I think if you took Final Cut or if you took Adobe Premiere, which might be the more realistic

31:32.200 --> 31:33.200
one, Adobe Premiere.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.200
Right.

31:34.200 --> 31:37.320
If you took that and dropped it on Linux today, I don't actually think it would make much

31:37.320 --> 31:38.320
of a difference.

31:38.320 --> 31:44.080
No, no, no, no. I think that the key is to stop trying to emulate what they're doing

31:44.080 --> 31:48.800
on other operating systems and basically build on what already works for us. Like as you

31:48.800 --> 31:54.040
pointed out, Google Hangouts is a good example. Come up with a cloud-based solution that is

31:54.040 --> 31:57.640
not trying so hard to be something else, but basically utilizes some of the tools we already

31:57.640 --> 32:03.400
have, HTML5, various other stuff on the backend, all these little goodies put together and

32:03.400 --> 32:07.400
find ways of making the technologies that already exist work better and let it grow

32:07.400 --> 32:08.400
organically.

32:08.400 --> 32:09.400
That'd be interesting to see what happens.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.400
So I guess that...

32:10.400 --> 32:11.400
Can I chime in on this?

32:11.400 --> 32:12.400
Yeah.

32:12.400 --> 32:16.440
So I was just thinking, if you're going to move video editing to the cloud, that's going

32:16.440 --> 32:20.000
to need a lot more bandwidth than most people are currently capable of.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.680
Right. But look at the way they do with Hangouts where you connect in, they do the switching

32:23.680 --> 32:26.400
remotely and you stream to them and they record the central location.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.400
That's right.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.400
Yep.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.400
And that's the key. That's the key.

32:29.400 --> 32:30.400
What's LightWorks like nowadays?

32:30.400 --> 32:37.040
Again, it's okay, but the problem is the editor is... I think the editor is a problem that

32:37.040 --> 32:43.680
somebody is going to solve, but it's the hardware ecosystem, it's the codecs, it's all of it.

32:43.680 --> 32:44.680
It's all missing.

32:44.680 --> 32:49.960
It's the ability to put something on a live stream and have all that available on the

32:49.960 --> 32:50.960
go.

32:50.960 --> 32:56.800
Yeah, last time my chat, last time my chat, LightWorks was only 64-bit, but it was pretty

32:56.800 --> 32:58.100
usable.

32:58.100 --> 33:03.760
It was. And I think all video editors on Linux at this point are really good at making clips

33:03.760 --> 33:07.180
and adding transitions and throwing in some goofy effects here and there. They're pretty

33:07.180 --> 33:10.080
good with that, but they don't really solve problems yet.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.080
That's a problem.

33:11.080 --> 33:15.480
Yeah, but LightWorks is a professional program. It's used for like movies, studios, and outside.

33:15.480 --> 33:20.980
The problem we're facing here is we have all the post-production software in the world

33:20.980 --> 33:27.920
on Linux that we could get, but we need software like Wirecast that we can use during a production

33:27.920 --> 33:30.080
like Chris does during his shows.

33:30.080 --> 33:33.720
Yeah. And that's becoming more and more common. You're seeing a lot of people do live production.

33:33.720 --> 33:38.120
And it's just from an economic standpoint, it makes so much more sense if you can produce

33:38.120 --> 33:42.360
things live in real time. And with chat rooms and mumble, you want to be live. You want

33:42.360 --> 33:43.360
to be streaming.

33:43.360 --> 33:47.600
Yeah. And you said about streaming, but you've got YouTube streaming. You've got G+. There's

33:47.600 --> 33:51.040
quite a few other options you could use if you was on about the cloud streaming-wise.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.040
Yeah.

33:52.040 --> 33:53.040
I mean, it's not just much about-

33:53.040 --> 33:54.040
What about the lock-in there though? But yeah.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.040
It's not about-

33:55.040 --> 33:56.040
If you want to go really old school, you've got like Justin.tv.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.040
Right. Yeah.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.040
And you stream.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.040
And you stream, sure.

33:59.040 --> 34:04.840
It's not as much about the service you're using. It's about the effects you can use

34:04.840 --> 34:09.280
and the stuff you can overlay the video and how you can transition stuff and maybe streaming

34:09.280 --> 34:10.280
from another box.

34:10.280 --> 34:11.280
Yeah.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.880
Are you eliminating an intern that needs to go and do all this stuff for you because you

34:13.880 --> 34:17.720
have a dynamic situation that you can do easily and quickly like Chris is able to do at this

34:17.720 --> 34:18.720
point?

34:18.720 --> 34:19.720
Yeah.

34:19.720 --> 34:21.880
Wirecast is really good at like green screening, taking multiple different camera sources,

34:21.880 --> 34:27.920
combining them together, and then doing all of that on consumer purchasable hardware.

34:27.920 --> 34:28.920
That's the big thing.

34:28.920 --> 34:34.400
For me personally, I would use Lightworks with YouTube, with the YouTube streaming feature.

34:34.400 --> 34:41.480
There's an alternative to Wirecast called VidBlaster, but it's much cheaper.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.480
Yeah.

34:42.480 --> 34:43.480
Well, it's cheaper for a reason though.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.480
Yeah.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.480
Yeah.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.480
So VidBlaster was one.

34:46.480 --> 34:51.200
In fact, I've even considered using VidBlaster for some things in studio, like for bringing

34:51.200 --> 34:55.520
a bunch of Skype colors in and doing like a multi-box and then sending that to Wirecast

34:55.520 --> 35:01.040
as a camera source, but VidBlaster is not really a full competitor to Wirecast.

35:01.040 --> 35:05.360
And when I was playing with Lightworks specifically, I was actually one of the early beta testers.

35:05.360 --> 35:10.160
It's good software and it absolutely, yes, it was absolutely used in a number of well

35:10.160 --> 35:16.000
known recognized films for production, actually creating a film.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.920
But it wasn't, to my knowledge, I don't know how it would be used effectively to work with

35:20.920 --> 35:22.720
a live program.

35:22.720 --> 35:26.640
Via YouTube, eh, maybe, kind of, not really.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.640
I don't know.

35:27.640 --> 35:30.560
I mean, I'm not really sure how that provides the kind of functionality we're dealing with

35:30.560 --> 35:31.560
now.

35:31.560 --> 35:32.560
I don't see it.

35:32.560 --> 35:38.240
You know, Lightworks just looks to me like your standard NLE where it's not even made

35:38.240 --> 35:39.240
to do live production.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.240
Right.

35:40.240 --> 35:42.240
It wasn't designed for it, no.

35:42.240 --> 35:46.720
The most I've even seen regarding live production on Linux is, Matt, what was that software

35:46.720 --> 35:48.720
that you've always promoted back when you were a student?

35:48.720 --> 35:50.200
Oh, I was involved with it.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.200
Webcam Studio.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.200
Yeah.

35:52.200 --> 35:55.840
Webcam Studio was, it was kind of like, it's kind of like a Babylon 5 where it was meant

35:55.840 --> 35:59.000
to do one thing and ended up going a completely different direction.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.520
Someone else took over the project and it's kind of just hopping along at a real snail

36:02.520 --> 36:03.520
space.

36:03.520 --> 36:07.280
The problem is just the back end technologies just weren't effective enough.

36:07.280 --> 36:10.640
And no matter what language you wrapped it in, the problem was is that the underlying

36:10.640 --> 36:12.800
tools just weren't quite there.

36:12.800 --> 36:17.120
That being said, that could change over time, but it's just not quite there yet.

36:17.120 --> 36:20.920
The problem I had with it is I would use it one time and it would have one user interface

36:20.920 --> 36:24.600
and the next time you use it, the user interface did a 180.

36:24.600 --> 36:27.280
That was Patrick and we certainly talked about that.

36:27.280 --> 36:32.600
He felt like he wanted to continuously, in his eyes, improve it in a way he felt was

36:32.600 --> 36:33.600
good.

36:33.600 --> 36:37.260
I would have preferred it just stuck to something that was, I don't know, maybe voted on or

36:37.260 --> 36:42.120
just something a little more tame, but he had a vision for it and I think he was just

36:42.120 --> 36:45.500
trying to find what worked for him in his eyes and I can't speak to it specifically,

36:45.500 --> 36:48.920
but I would agree that I really wish it would have stuck to one thing or another because

36:48.920 --> 36:52.040
it was – I had to relearn it too and I was part of the project, so every time he'd

36:52.040 --> 36:56.880
do a new one, I'd be like, oh, I have – the SVN would come out and be like, okay, wait,

36:56.880 --> 36:57.880
what the hell is this?

36:57.880 --> 36:58.880
How is this working?

36:58.880 --> 36:59.880
Where do I find it?

36:59.880 --> 37:00.880
Yeah, it's totally – I totally get where you're coming from there.

37:00.880 --> 37:04.880
Yeah, I think that was part of its failure is it kept changing every other week from

37:04.880 --> 37:05.880
what I saw.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.880
That was part of the failure, yeah.

37:07.880 --> 37:13.360
The other part of the failure that I experienced from most people was that the technology wasn't

37:13.360 --> 37:17.040
universal from like say Fedora to Debian, from Debian to Arch, from this to that to

37:17.040 --> 37:18.280
the other thing.

37:18.280 --> 37:21.040
They had a completely different experience and performance.

37:21.040 --> 37:25.480
It was wrapped in Java, which of course added a whole other layer of challenges and there

37:25.480 --> 37:27.200
are just a lot of – there are a lot of factors.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.200
Yeah.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.200
Yeah, for sure.

37:29.200 --> 37:33.080
Also, going back to LightWorks, you're forgetting too that LightWorks is not an easy program

37:33.080 --> 37:34.080
to learn.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.080
No, it's not though.

37:35.080 --> 37:40.280
The interface is very old school and analog style, so it takes some getting used to, that's

37:40.280 --> 37:41.280
for sure.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.280
Yeah, it is.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.280
Completely agree.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.280
It is very different.

37:44.280 --> 37:49.240
I'm going to stop here for a sec and sort of like rotate the conversation a bit to – this

37:49.240 --> 37:53.780
really came down to probably for me one of my biggest ever like as a Linux user like

37:53.780 --> 37:57.200
moments where I was like, what am I going to do?

37:57.200 --> 38:02.680
This is coming down to like my core beliefs, but also the practical business sense in me

38:02.680 --> 38:07.280
who says, well, I know as a businessman, I'll be cutting my arm off if I drop all video

38:07.280 --> 38:08.280
support.

38:08.280 --> 38:10.320
Well, come down to would you like to eat next month?

38:10.320 --> 38:11.320
I mean, really?

38:11.320 --> 38:12.320
Yeah.

38:12.320 --> 38:13.320
I mean, that's really the meat and potatoes.

38:13.320 --> 38:17.400
You know, so this was – so I want to talk a little bit about like some of the things

38:17.400 --> 38:21.160
we struggle with there and maybe we'll get the Mumbles room take on some of the things

38:21.160 --> 38:25.200
they've run into and maybe if in the end, we aren't all happy if we do stick with the

38:25.200 --> 38:26.200
ideals.

38:26.200 --> 38:30.080
But first, I want to talk about Ting because Ting is a perfect sponsor for the Linux unplugged

38:30.080 --> 38:31.080
crowd.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.080
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

38:32.080 --> 38:35.480
My mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider, you can get started by going

38:35.480 --> 38:37.320
over to linux.ting.com.

38:37.320 --> 38:40.300
Now Ting does things really different than most carriers.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.520
First of all, no contracts, no early termination fees.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.320
I know you guys like that quite a bit.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.600
The other part is you're in control.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.320
You own it and you only pay for what you use.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.840
They take your minutes, your messages and your megabytes.

38:50.840 --> 38:54.440
They add them all up at the end of the month and whatever bucket you fall into, well, my

38:54.440 --> 38:55.920
friend, that's what you pay.

38:55.920 --> 38:58.080
Yeah, actually, it is true.

38:58.080 --> 38:59.080
It is true.

38:59.080 --> 39:01.440
You don't have to know somebody in the biz to get a secret deal.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.760
Ting's got your good deal.

39:02.760 --> 39:06.400
You just pay for what you use at Ting and you can get started by going to linux.ting.com.

39:06.400 --> 39:10.880
They got a lot of great devices, some really good devices and testing if you know what

39:10.880 --> 39:11.880
I'm talking about.

39:11.880 --> 39:12.880
This is fun.

39:12.880 --> 39:13.880
Oh, man.

39:13.880 --> 39:14.880
iPhone.

39:14.880 --> 39:15.880
iPhone.

39:15.880 --> 39:16.880
Oh, I had a little...

39:16.880 --> 39:17.880
That too.

39:17.880 --> 39:18.880
Yep.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.440
Boy, we both had a little tickles in our throat.

39:20.440 --> 39:21.440
Oh, my goodness.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.440
Weird.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.440
Yeah.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.440
Weird craziness.

39:24.440 --> 39:27.000
Yeah, and you can always stay up to date on what Ting's up to by going to blog.ting.com.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.200
And I want to say, go over there because you're going to be pretty impressed.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.440
Average Ting bill is $21 a month per line.

39:31.440 --> 39:34.000
Now, did you know that Ting is a shared pool of minutes?

39:34.000 --> 39:37.440
So if you have several phones on a line, you guys all just pay for what you use.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.200
You just pay $6 for the line.

39:39.200 --> 39:44.000
So in my case, if I have myself and my mom on a plan or myself and my wife on a plan,

39:44.000 --> 39:47.040
each of us will just end up paying for whatever we use, but we can share from a pooled set

39:47.040 --> 39:48.040
of minutes.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.040
We can also...

39:49.040 --> 39:53.640
And all these plans include hotspot, tethering, voicemail, picture messaging, caller ID, all

39:53.640 --> 39:55.080
the stuff you'd want.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.080
And they have a...

39:56.080 --> 40:00.160
There's an excellent Ting app and an excellent Ting dashboard on their website to let you

40:00.160 --> 40:04.960
stay on top of all the stuff, add devices, rename devices, remove devices, order new

40:04.960 --> 40:06.120
devices online.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.260
It's really great.

40:07.260 --> 40:11.140
Their online control panel and the Android app together give you so much visibility on

40:11.140 --> 40:12.840
what's going on with your Ting account.

40:12.840 --> 40:17.280
And I'm a year in now, really, almost, 11 months, I think, into my Ting service.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.440
Yeah, about 11 months, I think.

40:19.440 --> 40:23.620
I keep coming back to one of my favorite things about Ting, now that I'm a long-term customer,

40:23.620 --> 40:24.660
is that dashboard.

40:24.660 --> 40:25.800
It's just so well done.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.280
It really sets the bar.

40:27.280 --> 40:29.080
And that's what I'd say about all things Ting.

40:29.080 --> 40:30.420
They set the bar on everything.

40:30.420 --> 40:31.800
They set the bar on customer service.

40:31.800 --> 40:34.160
When you call them, a real person answers the phone.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.000
They set the bar on how they sell to you.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.740
They sell direct, they sell off contract, you own the device.

40:39.740 --> 40:43.360
They set the bar on the way they bill, and they set the bar on their transparency.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.720
People love Ting, and I love Ting.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.160
I think you guys will love it, too.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.200
So go over to linux.ting.com.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.740
That's going to take $25 off your first device.

40:50.740 --> 40:53.900
If you've got a device that's compatible with the Sprint network, go check out the list

40:53.900 --> 40:58.000
of Ting's compatible devices, because they're going to give you $25 on your first month

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
of service.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.520
And if you're like most Ting switchers, that means your first month's going to be absolutely

41:02.520 --> 41:03.520
free.

41:03.520 --> 41:07.720
So keep that in mind once you discover what a cell service should really actually be like.

41:07.720 --> 41:08.800
You'll never go back.

41:08.800 --> 41:12.340
Even though there's no contracts and no early termination, you're not going to switch.

41:12.340 --> 41:14.700
Because then you are going to be in a position of power.

41:14.700 --> 41:19.340
And as a pro user, I think all of you guys know, it's like getting a Linux box without

41:19.340 --> 41:20.580
root access.

41:20.580 --> 41:21.580
It's just ridiculous.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.800
It's like root access to your carrier.

41:23.800 --> 41:24.800
That's really what it is.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.160
It feels like you have root access to your carrier.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.240
I call these folks.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.040
I have a question or problem.

41:29.040 --> 41:32.200
They are not going to put me on hold and get someone else or deal with whatever.

41:32.200 --> 41:34.520
They're going to solve my issue because they're empowered to do so.

41:34.520 --> 41:35.520
You're the boss.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.520
You're the boss.

41:36.520 --> 41:37.520
Yes.

41:37.520 --> 41:39.280
So a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.800
And thanks to you guys for supporting our sponsors, letting them know that you appreciate

41:41.800 --> 41:45.240
them keeping the Ting show, the unplugged show on the air.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.400
And go get started by going to linux.ting.com.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.960
Oh yeah.

41:48.960 --> 41:49.960
Okay.

41:49.960 --> 41:53.280
So I bring this open to the mumble room.

41:53.280 --> 41:54.320
Anybody can chime in any time.

41:54.320 --> 42:00.120
But I honestly, I probably have never struggled like this, like I had a few months ago.

42:00.120 --> 42:04.040
When I tried to do it kind of, because I felt like it was a business thing, I didn't need

42:04.040 --> 42:05.720
to make a big deal about it on there.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.040
I didn't need to say much about it.

42:07.040 --> 42:10.680
I just felt like, I think I bitched to Matt like before we went live, like, oh man, I've

42:10.680 --> 42:12.440
been in a bad mood for about two days.

42:12.440 --> 42:13.440
Oh, I feel you.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.280
And I totally, I totally understand.

42:15.280 --> 42:16.280
I really do.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.280
Yeah.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.280
It's just like, it's a lot of money.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.280
It goes against my ideals.

42:19.280 --> 42:23.120
And that was really part of it was like, I don't, I don't like vote.

42:23.120 --> 42:26.480
I'm a big, I'm a big proponent of voting with your wallet.

42:26.480 --> 42:30.640
Like I really think out of all of the, out of all the things that go on in this world,

42:30.640 --> 42:34.600
one of the few things we have control over is how we spend our money.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.700
That's one of the reasons I recommend Ting.

42:36.700 --> 42:41.000
That's why I recommend System76, because we can vote with our wallets and we can actually

42:41.000 --> 42:42.720
make a difference by how we spend our money.

42:42.720 --> 42:48.800
And I believe that by me spending $5,000 or whatever it was on a Mac Pro was not me voting

42:48.800 --> 42:49.800
appropriately.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.560
That was a bad vote in my opinion.

42:51.560 --> 42:53.440
Not going with an open source system was a bad vote.

42:53.440 --> 42:59.280
And in this case, if Wirecast had been open source, I could have looked at that and could

42:59.280 --> 43:02.560
have determined, holy shit, this is not a 64 bit application.

43:02.560 --> 43:04.400
I'm not going to spend $400 on this.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.400
Oh, no kidding.

43:05.400 --> 43:08.280
Mind you, I still would have bought it even though it was, you know, $400 by the way,

43:08.280 --> 43:10.240
it was the discount cause it was an upgrade.

43:10.240 --> 43:14.080
I originally spent a thousand dollars on it multiple times over.

43:14.080 --> 43:17.640
So I've probably spent $2,000 on this wire, $3,000 on this Wirecast.

43:17.640 --> 43:20.360
And not even, yeah, I was going to say not even counting all the support hardware and

43:20.360 --> 43:21.880
other support factors that go tie into it.

43:21.880 --> 43:26.040
I still would have paid for it if it was open, but I at least could have gone and figured

43:26.040 --> 43:28.920
out on my own if it was 64 bit.

43:28.920 --> 43:33.920
And it was a total black box until I bought it and I took it home and I unwrapped it.

43:33.920 --> 43:34.920
Boom.

43:34.920 --> 43:36.880
There's a 32 bit stinker in the box for me.

43:36.880 --> 43:43.320
Here's what I want to say is with Apple having this push towards everything 64 bit, why did

43:43.320 --> 43:46.160
Wirecast stick with 32 bit?

43:46.160 --> 43:47.360
I think that's just legacy, man.

43:47.360 --> 43:51.760
I think it's because it's so much of what it would be such a fundamental amount of effort

43:51.760 --> 43:53.680
to rewrite it to 64 bit.

43:53.680 --> 43:57.200
They're probably, they said they're working on it, but it's probably a multi-year process

43:57.200 --> 43:58.200
for them or something.

43:58.200 --> 44:00.400
Well, and I think part of the two is they get something that works and then of course

44:00.400 --> 44:03.120
they have to, they have to slowly migrate that out.

44:03.120 --> 44:06.800
So 64 bit could be and have been in the works for a long time now and it's still just not

44:06.800 --> 44:07.800
ready.

44:07.800 --> 44:08.800
So.

44:08.800 --> 44:12.520
If you have to go through the trouble of updating all the libraries and everything that goes

44:12.520 --> 44:13.520
with it.

44:13.520 --> 44:14.520
Yeah.

44:14.520 --> 44:19.840
It's kind of like if you pay $1,000 for an application that you need to step up and do

44:19.840 --> 44:20.840
that.

44:20.840 --> 44:21.840
It is 2014.

44:21.840 --> 44:26.080
Well, and to their credit, you know, like one of their develop, I've actually now been

44:26.080 --> 44:30.760
connected to a developer I believe based because I submitted some bug reports and you know,

44:30.760 --> 44:31.760
so it's kind of funny.

44:31.760 --> 44:35.080
Like in some sense it was a little bit like an open source relationship where I found

44:35.080 --> 44:39.480
a bug, I submitted the bug, the guy who's now taking ownership of the bug is now contacting

44:39.480 --> 44:41.200
me directly and I'm giving him details.

44:41.200 --> 44:45.960
But that's only because I gave him a good bug and because I'm technically literate,

44:45.960 --> 44:47.740
I can troubleshoot with him.

44:47.740 --> 44:48.840
It's because of their convenience.

44:48.840 --> 44:49.840
They're doing it.

44:49.840 --> 44:53.480
I've also had experiences where I've been completely left out unanswered, right?

44:53.480 --> 45:01.240
So I guess I feel like there's more control taken away and when it's a core business function,

45:01.240 --> 45:06.520
that's where it needs to be under your control in the absolute every sense of the word, right?

45:06.520 --> 45:08.880
You really need to be able to guarantee it.

45:08.880 --> 45:13.360
And if it was open source, I feel like that is much easier for myself to guarantee.

45:13.360 --> 45:17.920
Well, I think so because if it's not being done, you have the freedom to go and find

45:17.920 --> 45:21.680
a shop or a person or a developer that will get it done for you.

45:21.680 --> 45:25.880
You can say, look, they're not, you know, this person's not developing it with, what

45:25.880 --> 45:29.200
can we do to basically work around it or to come up with an offshooter?

45:29.200 --> 45:30.800
You know, you have some, you have some tools to work with.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.640
You're not in some weird vendor lock-in situation.

45:32.640 --> 45:33.640
All right, Mumble Room.

45:33.640 --> 45:34.640
So what do you think?

45:34.640 --> 45:40.400
Have maybe tried going audio only for a little while, stuck to my ideal guns and say, no,

45:40.400 --> 45:41.400
this far, no farther?

45:41.400 --> 45:42.400
No, no, no.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.400
Absolutely no.

45:43.400 --> 45:44.400
Absolutely no.

45:44.400 --> 45:45.400
No, no.

45:45.400 --> 45:47.920
I don't think the fans of the Poe Show would have forgiven you.

45:47.920 --> 45:48.920
That's true.

45:48.920 --> 45:49.920
Yes.

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
Yes, you say?

45:50.920 --> 45:51.920
No, I'm just kidding.

45:51.920 --> 45:53.920
We're not biased at all in any way, shape or form.

45:53.920 --> 45:54.920
Okay.

45:54.920 --> 45:57.200
No, let's put it, let's look at this like a logical sort of way.

45:57.200 --> 45:58.200
Okay.

45:58.200 --> 46:00.280
You are, you're a YouTube sponsor.

46:00.280 --> 46:04.560
So you put your videos out and you put them out onto YouTube.

46:04.560 --> 46:08.680
Well, yes, you could put the audio out on YouTube, but the thing is people probably

46:08.680 --> 46:10.240
wouldn't watch them, to be honest.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.040
Oh, this show is mostly audio only.

46:12.040 --> 46:13.040
Yeah.

46:13.040 --> 46:18.000
But how popular is this show compared to the Linguist Action Show?

46:18.000 --> 46:23.280
I mean, if you look at views on YouTube compared to this, to this show, the Linguist Action

46:23.280 --> 46:24.920
Show is much more popular.

46:24.920 --> 46:31.040
Well, for me personally, I start watching on YouTube and then I found the website and

46:31.040 --> 46:35.160
watched all the back episodes, but if I hadn't saw it on YouTube, I wouldn't have known about

46:35.160 --> 46:36.160
it.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.160
That's really the big thing about YouTube.

46:37.160 --> 46:39.920
YouTube is big about the discovery.

46:39.920 --> 46:42.400
And so YouTube we find brings, people find us on YouTube.

46:42.400 --> 46:45.200
They watch there for a little while and then they transition to the site usually because

46:45.200 --> 46:46.280
they want it on demand.

46:46.280 --> 46:50.280
They want it in their RSS feed or they just want to watch the HTML5 version on the website.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.280
Right.

46:51.280 --> 46:55.520
For a nice callback, I actually found last because of the webcam studio review.

46:55.520 --> 46:56.520
Did you really?

46:56.520 --> 46:57.520
Oh my gosh.

46:57.520 --> 46:58.520
Nice.

46:58.520 --> 47:10.240
I personally found about this on YouTube, but if it was not a video, I wouldn't watch

47:10.240 --> 47:11.240
it.

47:11.240 --> 47:12.240
Right.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.240
Yeah.

47:13.240 --> 47:15.040
I mean, there's a, there's a, and anything I've noticed over the years too, which this

47:15.040 --> 47:19.460
is a little bit of a pro tip for anybody who wants to start a podcast, I suppose, is nobody

47:19.460 --> 47:21.700
shares links to audio shows.

47:21.700 --> 47:22.700
Nobody does.

47:22.700 --> 47:25.560
But if you say something in a YouTube video, people will share a link to that, right?

47:25.560 --> 47:29.080
And the other thing is you can like even link to the time code, which is really nice.

47:29.080 --> 47:34.280
And so like just for people or, or like when, for example, when we did a review of Cinnamon

47:34.280 --> 47:35.280
2, right?

47:35.280 --> 47:40.120
Clem did a post on the, on the Cinnamon blog about it and he doesn't embed the MP3 file.

47:40.120 --> 47:41.720
No, he embeds the YouTube video.

47:41.720 --> 47:42.720
Right.

47:42.720 --> 47:43.720
Exactly.

47:43.720 --> 47:48.240
So I'd say unless you're doing something like a distribution review, the only show I'm really

47:48.240 --> 47:51.680
engaged in visually watching would probably be the Fo' Show.

47:51.680 --> 47:54.680
You talking about my Weiss boobs?

47:54.680 --> 47:55.680
Awkward.

47:55.680 --> 47:56.680
Technically, you just implied it.

47:56.680 --> 47:57.680
No, it's the lower third.

47:57.680 --> 48:03.840
Hey, Chris, I got a quick question for you.

48:03.840 --> 48:09.160
If you had gone audio only, would that have affected the sponsorship at all?

48:09.160 --> 48:10.160
Maybe.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.160
Yeah.

48:11.160 --> 48:13.200
That was, that was a part of the consideration because there'd be less numbers, right?

48:13.200 --> 48:14.200
Yeah.

48:14.200 --> 48:15.200
YouTube isn't so important.

48:15.200 --> 48:16.200
I mean, we love you guys on YouTube.

48:16.200 --> 48:17.200
Don't get me wrong impression.

48:17.200 --> 48:20.120
But I mean like if you came to me and said, sorry, you can no longer publish to YouTube,

48:20.120 --> 48:23.080
I'd be like upset about it, but it would not affect the business.

48:23.080 --> 48:26.440
But you know, if you cut off all videos, like all the downloads, all of the embeds on our

48:26.440 --> 48:28.800
website views, that would impact the numbers.

48:28.800 --> 48:32.560
And so, you know, at least it would affect the rate we probably charge, but it would,

48:32.560 --> 48:39.600
I think, you know, part of it is, is there's just an extra level of cache to being in video,

48:39.600 --> 48:40.600
I suppose.

48:40.600 --> 48:45.360
And I think with the sponsorships, you know, you display the product of like System76,

48:45.360 --> 48:49.800
you display the beautiful machines or you show the phones off for Ting or their website

48:49.800 --> 48:52.400
or how you set up a plan.

48:52.400 --> 48:53.400
Yeah.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.400
Yeah.

48:54.400 --> 48:59.200
What about doing audio for some parts, like during the interviews and stuff and then just

48:59.200 --> 49:01.400
do editing the rest later?

49:01.400 --> 49:03.760
Well, so if you're going to do video, might as well do video.

49:03.760 --> 49:07.320
There's no point doing part of it or doing part of it video.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.320
Yeah.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.600
Go big or go home.

49:09.600 --> 49:13.000
I guess it's funny because here we are, a bunch of Linux users, obviously very passionate

49:13.000 --> 49:16.960
about Linux, but there is a practical element to it, right?

49:16.960 --> 49:21.360
I guess our inner RMS only goes so far.

49:21.360 --> 49:22.360
That's true.

49:22.360 --> 49:27.440
I think it's the side of us that see, you know, the whole open source versus, you know,

49:27.440 --> 49:28.440
free software argument.

49:28.440 --> 49:32.320
It's kind of that point to where the open source folks are a little more in tune with

49:32.320 --> 49:36.660
just wanting to use it because it works or it's providing no vendor lock and it's providing

49:36.660 --> 49:41.480
various benefits where the other crowd might be more about, you know, to hell with convenience.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.480
It's all about ideals.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.480
I guess so.

49:43.480 --> 49:44.480
Yeah.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.480
That's just my view.

49:45.480 --> 49:47.200
Freedom is negative in the practical dimension.

49:47.200 --> 49:48.200
Wow.

49:48.200 --> 49:49.200
That's pretty good actually.

49:49.200 --> 49:50.200
I like that.

49:50.200 --> 49:52.720
It's just negative in the freedom dimension.

49:52.720 --> 49:54.200
All right.

49:54.200 --> 49:55.200
Okay.

49:55.200 --> 50:01.360
So I continue to, it was an interesting technical battle because it also involves, every show

50:01.360 --> 50:02.360
has a profile.

50:02.360 --> 50:03.360
Yeah.

50:03.360 --> 50:06.320
Like, you know, which camera shots, which lower thirds.

50:06.320 --> 50:10.220
This show has a profile for the chat room shot or my screen or whatever, there's a few

50:10.220 --> 50:14.120
other in there, prerecorded or reruns.

50:14.120 --> 50:17.540
And every show has to have a new profile built for it for Wirecast 5.

50:17.540 --> 50:18.840
And that is a ton of work.

50:18.840 --> 50:23.680
So this week has been marred in like the technical problems, you know, hitting just bugs.

50:23.680 --> 50:26.320
And it's funny because there's still bugs that were there from four and they're in five

50:26.320 --> 50:27.320
now too.

50:27.320 --> 50:30.320
You know, so it's like some of the same bugs that used to cause it to crash now new bugs

50:30.320 --> 50:31.320
too.

50:31.320 --> 50:36.340
But on top of that, then it's creating a new profile for every single show before it airs.

50:36.340 --> 50:39.640
Like there was nothing for unplugged until about an hour before the show went on the

50:39.640 --> 50:41.840
air where I recreated everything from scratch.

50:41.840 --> 50:42.840
Yeah.

50:42.840 --> 50:43.840
And those are serious bugs, right?

50:43.840 --> 50:44.840
I mean.

50:44.840 --> 50:45.840
It's wild.

50:45.840 --> 50:46.840
I mean, it has been a process, Matt.

50:46.840 --> 50:47.840
It has been a process.

50:47.840 --> 50:51.960
And so, you know, I go back to, I've been a big advocate of rolling software.

50:51.960 --> 50:56.360
There's obviously when you come into production, there's, there's something to be said about

50:56.360 --> 50:57.360
stop working.

50:57.360 --> 50:58.360
Yeah.

50:58.360 --> 51:01.520
My wife, you know what, when I told my wife, when I told her, I was like, well, I considered

51:01.520 --> 51:05.320
deploying with Wirecast 4, but then I'd probably would have had to do an upgrade.

51:05.320 --> 51:07.960
I probably would have had to upgrade like a month or two down the road or even a few

51:07.960 --> 51:08.960
weeks.

51:08.960 --> 51:10.960
She just looks at me and goes, you could have gone with Wirecast 4?

51:10.960 --> 51:11.960
Noob.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.760
Probably going to call the noob on my wife.

51:14.760 --> 51:18.760
Well, yeah, because she's looking at it through practical eyes being like, why did you make

51:18.760 --> 51:20.400
this more complicated than it needed to be?

51:20.400 --> 51:22.320
I think, you know, I think that's probably how she sees it.

51:22.320 --> 51:25.840
I was like, well, if I got to go, I might as well go to the latest version.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.400
It's been out for weeks.

51:27.400 --> 51:31.080
Oh, and we trusted that, you know, you had a recommendation that it was going to work

51:31.080 --> 51:33.520
and the fact that, you know, it had been out for a few weeks.

51:33.520 --> 51:36.240
We would assume based on its price tag that it would function.

51:36.240 --> 51:37.240
But alas.

51:37.240 --> 51:38.240
Surprise.

51:38.240 --> 51:39.240
I mean, I don't want to know.

51:39.240 --> 51:47.440
So it's funny because even in its sort of current state, it is still more functional

51:47.440 --> 51:49.520
than pretty much anything else.

51:49.520 --> 51:54.480
And it's interesting because I've been using Wirecast really since we went video, right?

51:54.480 --> 51:58.320
Back when I was recording the Linux action show here in this office with webcams and

51:58.320 --> 52:00.440
weird angles and stuff.

52:00.440 --> 52:04.320
And you know, it got very little recognition by the pro industry.

52:04.320 --> 52:05.320
It's a toy.

52:05.320 --> 52:10.160
But now a lot of stuff that is going on live is using Wirecast.

52:10.160 --> 52:13.220
It's totally worked its way into pro level production.

52:13.220 --> 52:18.920
So I think that's good for hopefully the quality of it, but it doesn't seem to have directly

52:18.920 --> 52:20.400
impacted the quality just yet.

52:20.400 --> 52:25.560
So is Wirecast the subscription service or did it pay you once?

52:25.560 --> 52:26.560
No, they're pretty good.

52:26.560 --> 52:27.560
They're pretty good.

52:27.560 --> 52:32.060
You buy the major version and then like, you know, for I had a couple of year run at least.

52:32.060 --> 52:33.240
And so I got every update.

52:33.240 --> 52:34.960
You drop cash once and then you own it.

52:34.960 --> 52:36.520
You don't have to pay a monthly thing.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

52:38.560 --> 52:42.880
And so and then I also got I got I got grandfathered in on the price instead of having to pay a

52:42.880 --> 52:43.880
thousand dollars.

52:43.880 --> 52:46.080
I paid like three ninety or something like that to get the upgrade.

52:46.080 --> 52:50.680
Well, you know, and that includes everything, the virtual sets, the green screen capability,

52:50.680 --> 52:51.680
all of it.

52:51.680 --> 52:53.340
So it's it's pretty functional.

52:53.340 --> 52:58.280
There's an anecdote I just found somebody was asking if there's ever going to be a Linux

52:58.280 --> 53:05.920
version and then reply from the from the one of the community managers or moderators said

53:05.920 --> 53:07.680
you could use a Mac.

53:07.680 --> 53:08.680
Yeah.

53:08.680 --> 53:09.680
Yeah.

53:09.680 --> 53:10.680
Wow.

53:10.680 --> 53:11.680
That's the response.

53:11.680 --> 53:15.000
You know, ironically, if they came up with a Linux version, even if I even if I would

53:15.000 --> 53:18.240
prefer just even if I even if it was still closed source, I'd still prefer to have it

53:18.240 --> 53:19.240
on Linux.

53:19.240 --> 53:22.400
Well, and they would probably be especially as temperamental as it is.

53:22.400 --> 53:27.240
They'd have to bake it in to one release and then every time it's updated, it would have

53:27.240 --> 53:31.600
to be baked in to that release that is then cooperative with it.

53:31.600 --> 53:37.000
It could not work in like, you know, the fact that they still have to work on a 64 bit Mac

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
version.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
Exactly.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Yeah.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
So we're so far off.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
It doesn't matter.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
Right.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
I mean, yeah, totally.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
Yeah.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
You know, so there you go.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
There you have it.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.280
I also thought about, you know, going audio only would mean like it'd be way easier to

53:49.280 --> 53:50.580
do shows on location.

53:50.580 --> 53:55.240
Doing audio on location is is diametrically simpler than doing like it's just unbelievably

53:55.240 --> 53:56.240
simpler than doing video.

53:56.240 --> 53:57.240
Yeah.

53:57.240 --> 53:58.240
I mean, I wouldn't have to.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.240
I wouldn't have to drive.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.240
I do what I do now.

54:00.240 --> 54:01.240
You know, pants would be optional.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.240
Right.

54:02.240 --> 54:06.720
You know, if we want to get away with that anyway, your legs are underneath the table.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.120
You could be just in your boxes with like a nice shirt on.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.120
That's true.

54:10.120 --> 54:11.120
That's true.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.600
Well, you know, I mean, Chris has always been great about wearing pants, you know, most

54:13.600 --> 54:14.600
of the time.

54:14.600 --> 54:15.600
Most of the time.

54:15.600 --> 54:16.600
You know, it's you know, unless it's like no pants Friday.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.080
I don't think I've ever done a show with shoes on.

54:18.080 --> 54:19.080
But at least I'm wearing.

54:19.080 --> 54:22.000
Oh, well, you got your comfy slippers.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Yeah.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Sometimes slippers.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Yeah.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
Just depends on how cold it gets out there.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
Yeah.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
I might have missed this one.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.440
Has anybody, have y'all ever looked at open broadcaster software?

54:32.440 --> 54:33.440
Yeah.

54:33.440 --> 54:34.440
Oh, yeah.

54:34.440 --> 54:35.440
Yeah.

54:35.440 --> 54:38.400
Have you ever considered like for doing remote stuff like TriCaster?

54:38.400 --> 54:39.400
Yeah.

54:39.400 --> 54:42.560
TriCaster is another way to go where it's sort of like a dedicated piece of hardware.

54:42.560 --> 54:47.680
But you know, to get into a TriCaster to do what we need, it's starting at ten thousand

54:47.680 --> 54:48.680
dollars.

54:48.680 --> 54:49.680
Yeah.

54:49.680 --> 54:50.680
I was going to say that.

54:50.680 --> 54:51.680
Yeah.

54:51.680 --> 54:52.680
And then it's a Windows 7 box that I have to have in my house.

54:52.680 --> 54:53.680
Which.

54:53.680 --> 54:58.160
But last time we went to the, what was it, the convention that Perlo was putting on,

54:58.160 --> 55:01.040
we actually found, I think a TriCaster alternative we were looking at.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.040
That product.

55:02.040 --> 55:03.760
And again, it was like a Windows 7 type box.

55:03.760 --> 55:05.400
That product was built on Wirecast.

55:05.400 --> 55:08.800
So Wirecast works on Windows or the Mac.

55:08.800 --> 55:11.400
And I think one of the reasons why it's gotten shittier on the Mac is because they've been

55:11.400 --> 55:12.960
working on their Windows version.

55:12.960 --> 55:13.960
Right.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.680
But that is sort of like a combination of things.

55:15.680 --> 55:19.220
Like here's a hardware appliance, we've streamlined it down.

55:19.220 --> 55:20.220
Here's a switcher for it.

55:20.220 --> 55:23.760
Like there's a lot of little more pro level solutions being built up around it.

55:23.760 --> 55:24.760
Yeah.

55:24.760 --> 55:29.280
They just need like an Indiegogo or something for Jupiter Broadcasting to get one.

55:29.280 --> 55:35.960
I'm surprised, I'm surprised I'm asking this, but would Wirecast work on Wine by any chance?

55:35.960 --> 55:40.320
I don't, you know, I couldn't imagine with all the video piping it has, hooks to QuickTime

55:40.320 --> 55:43.440
and whatnot, I would imagine that would be a pretty.

55:43.440 --> 55:45.960
That would be probably harder than bringing Netflix to Wine.

55:45.960 --> 55:49.320
I mean, which was doable and did, but even then it was, the breakage was constant.

55:49.320 --> 55:54.240
Pipelike, we have actually got Netflix working in the Firefox browser.

55:54.240 --> 55:57.720
Just took them, it took so long, they almost have HTML5 now, but yes.

55:57.720 --> 55:59.200
Yeah, I think it was Pipeline.

55:59.200 --> 56:03.120
I also think in some instances, at least some people in Firefox actually had to use a user

56:03.120 --> 56:05.560
agent switcher just because of the old.

56:05.560 --> 56:06.560
Yeah, you do have to switch.

56:06.560 --> 56:07.560
Yeah.

56:07.560 --> 56:08.560
But it works.

56:08.560 --> 56:09.560
Yeah.

56:09.560 --> 56:10.560
I just use a Roku, that runs Linux, I don't know.

56:10.560 --> 56:14.960
I mean, the video production stuff is about as complicated as it gets because it's constantly

56:14.960 --> 56:19.080
pushing the GPU, it's taking in multiple video signals from different sources, it's writing

56:19.080 --> 56:22.600
to disk, it's encoding video and streaming it over the network.

56:22.600 --> 56:29.040
I mean, it is, there's basically, there's no more demanding software out there.

56:29.040 --> 56:34.080
Right now, I've got a pretty high-end Mac Pro out there that's running at almost max

56:34.080 --> 56:36.560
capacity because it all just pushes it.

56:36.560 --> 56:40.000
And of course, it all got crappy when it went to HD.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.360
That's where things really got difficult.

56:41.360 --> 56:42.360
Oh, definitely.

56:42.360 --> 56:46.280
Well, and going back to the whole crowdsourcing campaign, a good example of what that would

56:46.280 --> 56:51.120
actually look like is, let's roll back to the OpenShot campaign and look at where they're

56:51.120 --> 56:52.120
at currently.

56:52.120 --> 56:53.120
Yeah.

56:53.120 --> 56:56.680
It was successful, but they're still trying to build this out in a way that's going to

56:56.680 --> 56:57.680
be practical.

56:57.680 --> 56:58.680
So even if we, you know, that's how big of a project it is.

56:58.680 --> 57:02.120
And like I said earlier, I think, you know, that's only a very small part of the overall

57:02.120 --> 57:03.120
plan.

57:03.120 --> 57:04.120
Yeah, exactly.

57:04.120 --> 57:06.560
But listen, I think we should probably wrap it up because who knows how much longer this

57:06.560 --> 57:07.560
thing's going to run.

57:07.560 --> 57:11.120
But I did have an email I want, I know, no, seriously, we go too long, this thing might

57:11.120 --> 57:12.720
just run out of memory.

57:12.720 --> 57:17.760
See what I say earlier was at 95% and right now it is at, no, it's still sitting at 95%

57:17.760 --> 57:18.760
good.

57:18.760 --> 57:19.760
Oh, it was at 93 earlier, now it's at 95.

57:19.760 --> 57:20.760
All right.

57:20.760 --> 57:23.800
Well, we do have a final email I wanted to touch on before we run.

57:23.800 --> 57:25.240
So this one came in from Jonathan.

57:25.240 --> 57:26.920
He says, thanks for the great show and all the work.

57:26.920 --> 57:31.820
I was hoping you could announce the release of Sonar GNU slash Linux 13.10.

57:31.820 --> 57:35.160
Thanks to the Sonar campaign, we were able to get better sounding voices for the Orca

57:35.160 --> 57:36.160
screen reader.

57:36.160 --> 57:37.160
Wow.

57:37.160 --> 57:42.040
Yeah, this is a distro that is targeted to folks with disabilities.

57:42.040 --> 57:45.840
He says, we're working on some LibreOffice buffs, but not sure when Sonar will release

57:45.840 --> 57:46.840
those.

57:46.840 --> 57:50.520
Sonar has an assistive technology for blind users like the Orca screen reader, screen

57:50.520 --> 57:55.480
magnification for low vision users, a font included for people with dyslexia, an on-screen

57:55.480 --> 57:58.920
keyboard with customizing the mouse for people with low motor skills.

57:58.920 --> 58:03.320
He says, there's also software included for paraplegics to move the cursor of the mouse

58:03.320 --> 58:05.400
just by moving their heads or eyes.

58:05.400 --> 58:10.480
And you can find it at sonargnulinux.com, sonargnulinux.com, we'll have a link to that

58:10.480 --> 58:11.960
in the show notes.

58:11.960 --> 58:12.960
How awesome is that?

58:12.960 --> 58:13.960
That is so cool.

58:13.960 --> 58:16.200
He wanted to help spread the word because they just shipped version 13.10.

58:16.200 --> 58:17.200
That is awesome.

58:17.200 --> 58:21.760
I mean, because I've looked at other projects, I think it was the Adrian set up in the Canopix

58:21.760 --> 58:22.760
and things like that.

58:22.760 --> 58:23.760
Oh, yeah.

58:23.760 --> 58:25.700
You know, I've looked at other stuff like this, but I love the fact that they have better

58:25.700 --> 58:27.920
voices in Orca because that's a big one.

58:27.920 --> 58:30.600
And the fact that they're addressing dyslexia is mind boggling.

58:30.600 --> 58:33.880
I mean, I don't have dyslexia, but I have a laundry list of learning disabilities.

58:33.880 --> 58:37.840
And so for someone like me, that would be awesome, you know, that'd be great.

58:37.840 --> 58:39.280
Yeah, that is really cool.

58:39.280 --> 58:44.040
And so Jonathan sent that in and I might try to remember to give it a mention on last too

58:44.040 --> 58:49.240
just to help extra spread the word because I feel like there's so much opportunity there

58:49.240 --> 58:54.360
and we need to start working on it now because the Microsoft gravy train is drying up and

58:54.360 --> 58:57.800
people aren't going to be sure to Microsoft and we need to have people don't want to or

58:57.800 --> 59:00.560
people are not going to want to use a tablet interface on their desktops and the desktops

59:00.560 --> 59:01.560
aren't going away.

59:01.560 --> 59:02.560
And so people start switching to Linux.

59:02.560 --> 59:05.760
We need to have solutions available for people that have these disabilities.

59:05.760 --> 59:10.040
So sonar gnu slash Linux at sonar gnu linux dot com and we'll have a link to that in the

59:10.040 --> 59:15.200
show notes and you know, congratulations to them for for working on something that really,

59:15.200 --> 59:17.920
you know, probably doesn't get enough acknowledgment, probably doesn't get enough attention.

59:17.920 --> 59:21.600
Well, I love the fact that rather than doing what a lot of other similar projects have

59:21.600 --> 59:24.440
done to where basically they just keep redoing what's already out there.

59:24.440 --> 59:27.960
These guys are not only trying to make it better, but they're actually addressing specific

59:27.960 --> 59:32.000
needs such as better voices and other factors that weren't being addressed previously.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
So I love that.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
Yeah, absolutely.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Good stuff.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
All right, Matt.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.160
Well, that brings us towards the end of this week's unplugged.

59:38.160 --> 59:42.720
Now, don't forget on Sunday we're doing our open Sousa 13 one review.

59:42.720 --> 59:44.440
I think that's going to be good.

59:44.440 --> 59:45.440
Looking forward to that.

59:45.440 --> 59:48.560
And that'll be two weeks of open Sousa love on the big show.

59:48.560 --> 59:51.120
And you guys can join us for that on a Sunday morning.

59:51.120 --> 59:54.080
Don't forget you can join us live for this show, too, for Linux Unplugged.

59:54.080 --> 59:57.680
On Tuesday afternoons, we start at two p.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv.

59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.040
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar has it in your local neck of the woods time

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.040
zone.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.040
Don't know what that is.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040
That's time math.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.040
We have time.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.040
Yeah.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040
Even with time zone changes.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.040
We have time.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.120
Oh, we can also get a hold of us.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.920
Go to Jupiter broadcasting dot com and pop that contact link and send us an email or

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.720
visit Linux action show dot reddit dot com.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.720
Matt, I'll talk to you on Sunday.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.720
All right.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.720
Sounds good.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.720
See you then.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:19.720
All right, everyone.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.720
See you right back here next Tuesday.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:35.520
We'll see you then.
