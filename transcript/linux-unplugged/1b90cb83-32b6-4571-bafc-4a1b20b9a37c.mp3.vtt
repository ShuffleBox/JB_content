00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
40, 50 years ago amateur radio operators and just general electronic enthusiasts, in fact

00:06.320 --> 00:12.000
the Linux users of like the 1920s, 30s and 40s were into a hobby called ham radio.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.280
If you haven't heard of it, basically it's you take, you build your own radios or you

00:17.280 --> 00:20.560
buy pre-made radios and then you play with them and you learn about them and the federal

00:20.560 --> 00:25.140
government literally takes millions of dollars of frequency spectrum and gives it to amateur

00:25.140 --> 00:27.120
radio operators to play with.

00:27.120 --> 00:29.880
The only real requirement is you have to pass a very basic test proving you're not going

00:29.880 --> 00:32.040
to kill yourself or anyone else.

00:32.040 --> 00:38.080
And as we have entered 2012, 13, 14, 15, 16, technology has evolved and now instead of

00:38.080 --> 00:43.360
buying these physical radios, you still buy physical radio but the radio doesn't have

00:43.360 --> 00:44.360
an interface.

00:44.360 --> 00:50.360
There's no dial, there's no ability to interface to the radio, just a box with a USB plug and

00:50.360 --> 00:55.920
you plug that box into your computer and you can control the radio from software, thus

00:55.920 --> 00:57.620
the name software defined radio.

00:57.620 --> 01:03.400
So what Wes is talking about is this Lua radio and I'm over here at luaradio.io and it says

01:03.400 --> 01:09.040
Lua radio is a lightweight embedded low flow graph signal processing frameworks for software

01:09.040 --> 01:10.040
defined radio.

01:10.040 --> 01:15.140
It provides a sweet source sync of processing blocks with a simple API for defining flow

01:15.140 --> 01:18.880
graphs, running flow graphs, creating blocks and creating data types.

01:18.880 --> 01:23.040
So I'm assuming if I'm reading this right and if I'm understanding it from the 45 seconds

01:23.040 --> 01:27.680
I've been looking at this, basically you're able to go through and piece together different

01:27.680 --> 01:30.640
components of the radio inside of the software.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.640
Am I understanding that right?

01:31.640 --> 01:33.280
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.680
Have you used GNU radio at all?

01:34.680 --> 01:35.680
I have.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.840
Yeah, it's a real challenge if I'm being perfectly honest with you.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.360
Yeah, and so that's what I was reading this.

01:42.360 --> 01:45.080
I haven't used software defined radio very much but I'm definitely interested in it.

01:45.080 --> 01:50.000
I have a physics background so any kind of like playing with the spectrum is definitely

01:50.000 --> 01:52.240
interesting even though I haven't done much of it myself.

01:52.240 --> 01:55.720
And so a lot of people are saying like this has similar capabilities but is easier to

01:55.720 --> 01:59.080
use, more lightweight and if you're familiar with Lua at all, it's easier to interface

01:59.080 --> 02:00.080
with.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.080
Yeah, man.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.760
Have you ever used XMonet?

02:02.760 --> 02:03.760
You know I have not.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.180
I've looked at it but I have not actually tried it.

02:05.180 --> 02:06.920
So I've been playing with XMonet.

02:06.920 --> 02:12.000
I was on a – I was for better or for worse I was stuck on a very low powered machine

02:12.000 --> 02:19.720
and the way to drag the most horsepower out of that machine was to use a tiling desktop

02:19.720 --> 02:22.280
manager and I chose XMonet and I was super happy with it.

02:22.280 --> 02:26.960
In fact, so much so that I'm considering it making my primary desktop interface but

02:26.960 --> 02:27.960
–

02:27.960 --> 02:28.960
Wow.

02:28.960 --> 02:29.960
Yeah.

02:29.960 --> 02:30.960
I know.

02:30.960 --> 02:31.960
I know.

02:31.960 --> 02:32.960
It sounds crazy but here's the thing.

02:32.960 --> 02:37.160
Anyone that – I used to think that I used Nome because I had too much to get done and

02:37.160 --> 02:44.580
I didn't have enough time to worry about memorizing weird commands and stuff but after

02:44.580 --> 02:51.640
using XMonet for a while, I've honed in on this is a more efficient way to work and

02:51.640 --> 02:56.040
to that end, you can configure it up the wazoo with Lua.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.640
I believe it's Lua if I'm not mistaken.

02:57.640 --> 02:58.640
No, buddy.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.640
It's Haskell.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.640
It's Haskell.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.640
XMonet is Haskell.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.640
Okay.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.640
Which one?

03:03.640 --> 03:04.640
Is it awesome then?

03:04.640 --> 03:05.640
It was awesome.

03:05.640 --> 03:06.640
Awesome.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.640
Okay.

03:07.640 --> 03:08.640
Okay.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.640
Okay.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.640
Well, so I guess my point doesn't really stand except for the fact that what I found

03:10.640 --> 03:13.640
was the things that I was going to tweak were already tweaked for me in XMonet.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.000
So the things I wanted to set up were already set up the way I would have wanted them to.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.160
I thought that was – Lua, apparently I confused the two.

03:19.160 --> 03:24.280
I've gone through a couple of different ones but the point – all that to say that

03:24.280 --> 03:28.800
those kind of configuration setups where you just have this big configuration file

03:28.800 --> 03:33.840
in something like Lua is super easy for anyone to just – even if you don't understand

03:33.840 --> 03:37.080
programming, it's a little daunting at first but once you learn what the little things

03:37.080 --> 03:42.080
that you need to change are, super easy to get set up and use.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.280
So I guess what I'm saying is I feel like it would be the same thing in the software

03:45.280 --> 03:46.560
defined radio, right?

03:46.560 --> 03:47.560
Yeah, definitely.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.560
It definitely seems like that.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.520
People are excited that it should be portable, maybe they can use it on all kinds of different

03:52.520 --> 03:54.560
interfaces and devices.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.280
So it'll be interesting to see what this comes from.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.360
It's exciting to see it launch anyway.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.360
Right.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.360
Right.

04:00.360 --> 04:17.320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, episode 152 for July 5th, 2016.

04:17.320 --> 04:21.480
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's taken your beloved host,

04:21.480 --> 04:27.040
shoved him into the back of an RV and sent him trailing across the country to enjoy himself.

04:27.040 --> 04:31.280
Stepping in for the one, the only, the great, the Linux podcaster, hair master, Chris Fisher,

04:31.280 --> 04:35.520
it's me, Noah Chaliya, and – Hey guys, it's Wes.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.520
It's Mr. Wes.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.000
How are you doing today, Wes?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.840
Oh, I'm doing wonderful and it's great to be with you, Noah.

04:40.840 --> 04:41.840
How about yourself?

04:41.840 --> 04:45.880
You and I totally rocked Linux Action Show on Sunday, now we're going to rock Linux

04:45.880 --> 04:46.880
Unplugged today.

04:46.880 --> 04:47.880
That's right.

04:47.880 --> 04:51.240
And we have an exciting, exciting show.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.400
I told you on Sunday the show was going to be so big that we couldn't put a word to

04:54.400 --> 04:55.400
it.

04:55.400 --> 05:00.360
Is there a word to describe this show that we're about to do right now?

05:00.360 --> 05:02.880
Maybe two words, exciting and confusing.

05:02.880 --> 05:03.880
Really?

05:03.880 --> 05:06.560
Well, that got me intrigued.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.560
I think we'll find out.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.560
All right.

05:08.560 --> 05:13.880
Well, let's head on down into our mumble room and welcome our virtual live.

05:13.880 --> 05:20.000
This is a group that meets over at mumble.jupitercolony.com and you can join for free.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.920
Just download the mumble client and participate with us 2 p.m. Pacific time.

05:25.920 --> 05:26.920
Hello mumble room.

05:26.920 --> 05:27.920
Time appropriate.

05:27.920 --> 05:28.920
Greetings.

05:28.920 --> 05:29.920
Hello.

05:29.920 --> 05:30.920
Hello.

05:30.920 --> 05:31.920
Hello.

05:31.920 --> 05:32.920
Everyone says.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.920
Oh, those voices.

05:33.920 --> 05:34.920
I love them.

05:34.920 --> 05:35.920
I know.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.640
It's like it's like we have our own little fan club and they and they join us via the

05:38.640 --> 05:41.120
Internet and everyone is welcome.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.720
So if you're if you're listening to Linux Unplugged, you could join Linux Unplugged

05:44.720 --> 05:49.400
next week by downloading mumble and get with the program.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.400
Please do.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.400
It's so much fun.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.400
All right, Wes.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.200
Tell me about our first story.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.200
Our first story.

05:56.200 --> 06:00.080
OK, so containers, all the rage, everyone's talking about them and maybe people are actually

06:00.080 --> 06:01.080
using them.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.080
Right.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.720
Like you were just talking with Michael on Coder about how he's deploying a lot of Docker

06:04.720 --> 06:06.880
containers up on DigitalOcean.

06:06.880 --> 06:10.120
So now if you're if you're one of the people using Docker containers and I know at least

06:10.120 --> 06:15.360
me, I use them on DO, but I also find uses, you know, deploying apps on my local computer.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.360
Maybe I need something.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.360
I don't want to mess up.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.640
We talk a lot about we've been talking about snap packages and Flatpak, etc.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.960
But really, Docker can do a lot of the same things.

06:22.960 --> 06:23.960
There are other considerations.

06:23.960 --> 06:24.960
Right.

06:24.960 --> 06:25.960
Like it's more complicated.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.960
There's it's not quite in the same boat, but it really in the end, you can use it to deploy

06:28.960 --> 06:30.360
applications in the same way.

06:30.360 --> 06:36.120
So now NVIDIA is releasing a plugin that allows you to have GPU accelerated containers.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.780
Awesome, awesome.

06:38.780 --> 06:44.480
You know, that is that takes things to a whole new level on some degree, because if if you

06:44.480 --> 06:49.040
if we could start to containerize games, that that seems like that would be a major game

06:49.040 --> 06:52.360
changer because no longer are you packaging and developing first and you're not targeting

06:52.360 --> 06:54.040
a specific platform anymore.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.920
Now you're targeting a container and if you can if you could take that container and make

06:57.920 --> 07:03.560
it interoperable among all three of the big operating systems, Linux, Mac and Windows.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.360
Now we've really changed the landscape.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.360
Oh, that'd be interesting.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.760
Yeah, it looks like it's first right now.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.720
They're really targeting like machine learning applications, places where you might want to

07:10.720 --> 07:11.720
be deploying these apps.

07:11.720 --> 07:15.240
But you know, inside the container, they're too restricted to get access to the GPU.

07:15.240 --> 07:19.440
So in video, they're working on they're basically exporting, they're adding some hooks into

07:19.440 --> 07:23.700
the user land part and having these user land accessible parts exported into the Docker

07:23.700 --> 07:24.700
containers.

07:24.700 --> 07:28.320
And then you can do like CUDA type stuff right from inside Docker.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.380
Awesome.

07:29.380 --> 07:34.300
So what have you see is this is I this is early days, I assume this is not something

07:34.300 --> 07:37.760
that has that has taken off or have any real teeth to it yet, right?

07:37.760 --> 07:39.280
Yeah, it is early days.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.320
They do have some code up on GitHub.

07:42.320 --> 07:45.920
You know, the info world here does note that like one of the biggest drawbacks is that

07:45.920 --> 07:50.560
CUDA is a proprietary standard, even though but but it also just happens to be the NVIDIA

07:50.560 --> 07:53.560
really is the chip maker that does a lot of the machine learning stuff.

07:53.560 --> 07:57.120
You know, these big clusters, people doing the serious work that usually do not on NVIDIA.

07:57.120 --> 08:01.840
AMD has been opening up, which is really interesting, but really doesn't have the same kind of market

08:01.840 --> 08:04.240
uptake that NVIDIA does, especially in machine learning.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.240
Sure.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.240
DERP learning.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.240
DERP learning.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.240
That's right.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.240
We have a term for this guys.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.240
DERP.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.240
DERP.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.240
DERP learning.

08:12.240 --> 08:17.880
I'm interested outside of so you're saying, are you telling me that at this point in time,

08:17.880 --> 08:20.800
what they're really targeting is really kind of only the whole machine learning thing?

08:20.800 --> 08:23.440
Or is it going to expand beyond that?

08:23.440 --> 08:27.120
You know, the article doesn't mention anything that's kind of focused on the machine learning

08:27.120 --> 08:28.120
stuff.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.320
I'm sure that's kind of what's hot and what's motivating this.

08:29.320 --> 08:33.920
But once you have access to the GPU, it'll be interesting to see what else can be run

08:33.920 --> 08:34.920
there.

08:34.920 --> 08:35.920
Yeah.

08:35.920 --> 08:36.920
Yeah, it really would.

08:36.920 --> 08:44.920
You know, it's interesting because I watched, we went to LinuxCon last year and the way

08:44.920 --> 08:50.520
that LinuxCon works is they always have a sub-focus, Linux is obviously the general

08:50.520 --> 08:54.760
focus and then they have this like deep down focus that they kind of run in on and this

08:54.760 --> 08:56.320
year it was all about containers.

08:56.320 --> 09:02.480
And in fact, they were joking, not joking, the little subtitle was ContainerCon, right?

09:02.480 --> 09:09.760
And I have watched everything in Linux over the last year focus or shift focus to be centered

09:09.760 --> 09:11.560
on or around containers.

09:11.560 --> 09:15.120
And you know, first we saw it happen on the server side and then very shortly after that

09:15.120 --> 09:19.320
we saw that entering on the desktop side and it makes me wonder if the future of computing

09:19.320 --> 09:21.920
in general is not just going to be containers.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.080
Yeah, I know, right?

09:24.080 --> 09:27.780
And it's interesting, you know, having gotten, you've been using LXD in the past, I do kind

09:27.780 --> 09:29.280
of get this, I'll build up a host, right?

09:29.280 --> 09:32.320
And I'll have this main host and then I'll install a bunch of containers on it and I

09:32.320 --> 09:35.560
just love, it's really nice having that main host just kept so clean.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.200
Anything you really want to do, you input in a container, if you're done with that you

09:38.200 --> 09:39.200
just delete it.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.240
There's really, it's very easy to manage, I can see why people are fond of it.

09:42.240 --> 09:45.040
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

09:45.040 --> 09:52.520
You know, I wonder, have you played with, have you played with Flatpak and Snap Packages

09:52.520 --> 09:53.520
and all those?

09:53.520 --> 09:56.840
Yeah, I've been getting my feet wet, I mean, I haven't done anything, any real work in

09:56.840 --> 09:58.720
them yet but I played with them a little.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.640
So I'll tell you, the telegram conversation I was having literally as I was getting on

10:01.640 --> 10:07.720
the area is one of our prized and beloved community members is actually working on packaging

10:07.720 --> 10:14.360
me a OS ticket app inside of Electron because one of the things, so one of the things I

10:14.360 --> 10:21.280
hate is not being able to have a dedicated application when I'm working and I can't alt

10:21.280 --> 10:23.120
tap between things.

10:23.120 --> 10:25.720
It really messes up the window management kind of workflow, yeah.

10:25.720 --> 10:30.240
It does and especially because, you know, things like, so for example, our ticketing

10:30.240 --> 10:34.400
system, I'm basically constantly referencing back and forth.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.880
You know, there's never a time when, you know, no matter what I'm doing, something is either

10:37.880 --> 10:44.360
going in or out of the ticket system and to not have that, it's own dedicated window is

10:44.360 --> 10:51.520
a huge crutch for me and so Sean was working, Sean, Adram was working on packaging this

10:51.520 --> 10:55.440
just because he's a nice guy and sends me a telegram, he's like, here, I got this done

10:55.440 --> 10:56.440
for you.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.440
I'm like, really dude?

10:57.440 --> 10:59.240
And he's like, yeah, it actually didn't really take me on that.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.240
I know.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.240
Yeah, I know.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.480
So I'm playing with that and then, you know, the first story we get on the air, we start

11:04.480 --> 11:05.480
talking about containers.

11:05.480 --> 11:11.200
It's like, it seems like every time I turn around, something else is now possible.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.800
Something else is now happening because of containers.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.360
Yeah, exactly.

11:15.360 --> 11:20.280
Well, I mean, the Electron thing is just because it's web app but you don't even need an Electron

11:20.280 --> 11:21.920
framework to do that.

11:21.920 --> 11:29.200
There's like browsers like Surf which is from the Sucklass project and they have a browser

11:29.200 --> 11:34.400
that's pretty much bare bones, nothing, it doesn't have Chrome, like any user Chrome

11:34.400 --> 11:35.400
anywhere.

11:35.400 --> 11:40.480
And for people who are not aware, that means like the GUI of the browser, not actually

11:40.480 --> 11:41.480
Chrome.

11:41.480 --> 11:47.400
But anyway, so it has the same kind of thing, you have custom cookies for each individual

11:47.400 --> 11:48.400
website.

11:48.400 --> 11:53.600
So you can just load up any web app into Surf as its own independent window and not have

11:53.600 --> 11:56.040
to worry about putting any kind of framework in it.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.040
Really?

11:57.040 --> 11:58.040
Now, have you...

11:58.040 --> 11:59.040
Oh, that does sound very useful.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.000
Have you had any experience deploying this stuff?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.560
Yeah, I actually have like three of them running right now.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.560
Really?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.760
And how have you found it to be?

12:08.760 --> 12:09.760
It works great.

12:09.760 --> 12:14.920
The only problem is that I'm running an older version of Ubuntu base that has an older version

12:14.920 --> 12:21.120
of Sucklass, which the problem with that is only because packages don't update very much.

12:21.120 --> 12:25.760
So once that's no longer an issue, then it wouldn't matter because the latest version

12:25.760 --> 12:31.800
of Surf has the latest WebKit engine, so it doesn't have any kind of weird issues.

12:31.800 --> 12:35.920
For example, I have Gmail in one of them that every once in a while Gmail will say, you're

12:35.920 --> 12:37.920
using an old version of WebKit.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.320
Other than that, it works flawlessly.

12:39.320 --> 12:42.560
It just constantly tells me that I'm using an old version.

12:42.560 --> 12:47.520
But as far as functionally, it works fantastic and all you need to do is create a text file

12:47.520 --> 12:50.120
that stores the cookies and you're done.

12:50.120 --> 12:55.720
It runs just like a web app in a full desktop thing, but web app style.

12:55.720 --> 13:00.160
Now excuse my ignorance, but isn't the entire idea of the whole container thing that it

13:00.160 --> 13:03.840
shouldn't matter what version of Ubuntu you're on and what version of Ubuntu your users are

13:03.840 --> 13:04.840
on?

13:04.840 --> 13:05.840
Right.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.400
But Sucklass is not based on the container stuff.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.400
This is just an old traditional deb thing.

13:11.400 --> 13:16.080
I'm saying like this is a browser that doesn't need any kind of framework to run around it

13:16.080 --> 13:20.760
to be what you want or it's a separate window and everything like that and it has a separate

13:20.760 --> 13:27.120
session so you can have two or a hundred different Gmail clients running at the same time and

13:27.120 --> 13:30.160
they would all be separate windows and it would all be tracked differently and all have

13:30.160 --> 13:31.160
a different session.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.160
Wow.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.840
I could definitely use that at work and a few other places.

13:34.840 --> 13:35.840
Yeah.

13:35.840 --> 13:38.280
I have one for each slack that I use.

13:38.280 --> 13:43.320
I have one for multiple gmails and so on and so on.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.320
Yeah.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.320
That's…

13:45.320 --> 13:47.480
Sucklass Surf is a really good app for that.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.480
Yeah.

13:48.480 --> 13:53.200
It's funny too because for a long time I told myself, I was like, what I'm asking

13:53.200 --> 13:58.520
for, what I need, what I want is so simple and plain and straightforward that I can't

13:58.520 --> 14:02.040
believe something doesn't exist and then I kind of got the idea that the only real

14:02.040 --> 14:07.320
way to do that was with something like Electron and then I'm like, well, I guess that works

14:07.320 --> 14:10.400
but I just I feel like there should be a simpler, more straightforward solution.

14:10.400 --> 14:15.000
I'm finding out as usual it's just a matter of my ignorance, not a matter of the lack

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
of Linux.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.840
It's also they don't really tell people about, they don't really advertise that

14:18.840 --> 14:22.240
they have this feature that I did just say it's a bare bones browser.

14:22.240 --> 14:26.760
They don't mention that they have individual sessions system.

14:26.760 --> 14:32.760
But it's interesting because all you need to do is run whatever thing you want, whatever

14:32.760 --> 14:37.720
website you want to go to, you just type in surf, put in the cookie file location and

14:37.720 --> 14:42.440
then the website and that's it and it runs how you expect it to.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.440
Nice.

14:43.440 --> 14:44.440
Well, thank you.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.440
I appreciate that, Rotten.

14:45.440 --> 14:49.720
And you know, the next thing I want to talk about or I guess rather Wes wants to talk

14:49.720 --> 14:54.400
about is making his computer more artificially intelligent.

14:54.400 --> 14:59.680
And I'll tell you what, I'll give you two secret surprises.

14:59.680 --> 15:00.680
Secret surprises.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.200
It's not really secret, I'm about to tell you, but it's still a surprise kind of sort

15:03.200 --> 15:06.280
of keep it secret for the surprise.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.280
There are two things.

15:07.280 --> 15:13.640
One is I am desperately trying to get more patrons for Chris so when he gets home.

15:13.640 --> 15:14.640
We have to do it.

15:14.640 --> 15:18.680
You know, so he'll get home and he'll be like, Oh my gosh, Noah and West did not burn the

15:18.680 --> 15:21.060
network down and dad still has a house.

15:21.060 --> 15:22.060
This is absolutely great.

15:22.060 --> 15:26.040
So we are at 650 right now so we've had we have two patrons.

15:26.040 --> 15:29.200
My goal is to get us to 660 now.

15:29.200 --> 15:34.400
I can't tell you quite yet because I'm finalized the details of what it is, but I have something

15:34.400 --> 15:38.820
in the works and I also have a backup plan if that first plan falls through of something

15:38.820 --> 15:43.840
super special and cool that we're going to be giving away to one of the 12 people.

15:43.840 --> 15:44.840
Two spots are taken.

15:44.840 --> 15:45.840
We've got 10 left.

15:45.840 --> 15:46.840
So if one.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.840
Yeah, I know.

15:47.840 --> 15:48.840
I know.

15:48.840 --> 15:53.560
And and so if you have been considering signing up for patron now is the time to do a patreon.com

15:53.560 --> 15:59.640
slash today and if you sign up before Chris gets back so that's going to be it will have

15:59.640 --> 16:02.520
to do it on the Linux action show this coming Sunday.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.960
So has to be before then if you sign up before then you'll be entered into the dry.

16:05.960 --> 16:06.960
I don't know we're going to do.

16:06.960 --> 16:11.840
We're gonna do some kind of drawing and and and pull out names and you'll win something

16:11.840 --> 16:12.920
really cool.

16:12.920 --> 16:17.720
I think it's cool anyway, and it might be even cooler if if if Noah's plan number one

16:17.720 --> 16:21.880
goes through and if not a backup plan number two, okay, that's super secret special thing

16:21.880 --> 16:27.540
number one super secret special thing number two next week's Linux action show if you don't

16:27.540 --> 16:34.000
usually tune in obviously with Chris being gone it gives us we have to fill for his absence

16:34.000 --> 16:38.700
and those are some pretty big shoes to to fill however we think we might have a pretty

16:38.700 --> 16:42.320
good idea of how to do it and I'm not going to tell you exactly what it is but suffice

16:42.320 --> 16:48.200
to say that it is going to be amazing and it may or may not relate to this next story

16:48.200 --> 16:54.340
that we're going to talk about which by the way is that the mycroft AI personal assistant

16:54.340 --> 16:59.880
is now available on KDE plasma 5 what do you think about that was well you know I mean

16:59.880 --> 17:03.480
Chris has just been making everyone so jealous he's using that gnome extension he's loving

17:03.480 --> 17:10.280
it you've got the personal AI Popey's voice right there all the time but he's right exactly

17:10.280 --> 17:13.920
oh how I wish I had that Chris why did you leave and not give me that would you like

17:13.920 --> 17:19.040
so now would you like it I can send it to you because I have yep let's set that up later

17:19.040 --> 17:30.880
I think so so if you are a KDE plasma 5 user rotten corpse you can now have access to the

17:30.880 --> 17:35.600
mycroft AI application which let me tell you know that the thing is I am still in kind

17:35.600 --> 17:39.140
of disbelief that he's managed to get this project as far as he has in the short amount

17:39.140 --> 17:43.640
of time that he has oh it's incredible without compromising on basically any of his core

17:43.640 --> 17:52.060
values you know so we really have a hugely industry competitive project in fact arguably

17:52.060 --> 17:55.160
the only one of its kind right because you have things like the Amazon echo but that's

17:55.160 --> 18:00.040
a very specifically tailored device that you can do very specifically tailored things it's

18:00.040 --> 18:09.040
not a drop it's not an open extensible world right but even so even if you even if we abstract

18:09.040 --> 18:15.440
away from the open source argument even if we get above that there's still no drop in

18:15.440 --> 18:20.800
solution that I'm aware of that you can just take an AI you know software stack and just

18:20.800 --> 18:25.680
drop it in and say okay this is my device that does you know my widget that does XYZ

18:25.680 --> 18:30.160
and I wanted to have AI so here we go I don't know of any other software system that will

18:30.160 --> 18:37.800
lie to do that and so you know he's really he has struck a nerve and I think that in

18:37.800 --> 18:43.720
the long run that's going to work out very very well because it inevitably mycroft is

18:43.720 --> 18:50.160
going to be a more versatile and useful platform than anything that remotely competes with

18:50.160 --> 18:55.120
it right right exactly and I think we've seen like because it's so you know if you become

18:55.120 --> 18:58.960
a business that wants to have the same thing like it's it's open to you sure you have to

18:58.960 --> 19:02.240
contribute back upstream of course but you know it allows the community and people who

19:02.240 --> 19:06.400
really have needs to build the tool that will do you work for them do you have to contribute

19:06.400 --> 19:11.560
back upstream well depending on license so yeah if you make changes yeah yeah but I'm

19:11.560 --> 19:16.240
saying as if you are a project and all you want to do is just is is use that mycroft

19:16.240 --> 19:20.280
AI in its in its form you're not making changes to it you're just you're just using it you

19:20.280 --> 19:25.920
just take it and use it right and totally so I you know that's exciting I think so I

19:25.920 --> 19:30.320
think so and the fact that you we already I'm starting to see you know it I remember

19:30.320 --> 19:36.080
we were at system 76 in November and we were they were still in the launching phase of

19:36.080 --> 19:41.160
this so to watch to go from November to July and have this not be a thing just on gnome

19:41.160 --> 19:46.560
but now they've extended out to KTE you know where's this going to be one year from now

19:46.560 --> 19:51.040
is this going to be on every device I own I hope so I know and I also feel like when

19:51.040 --> 19:55.520
you know like when Cortana came to the desktop and series coming to you just before before

19:55.520 --> 19:59.400
mycroft really had picked up as much momentum as it had now it really felt like it was what

19:59.400 --> 20:02.040
was Linux going to have to compete what was the open source world going to have to compete

20:02.040 --> 20:05.280
we were so far behind we didn't have anything we're not that great at desktop integration

20:05.280 --> 20:08.760
anyway so it really didn't seem like there's possible so really like have to throw a hat

20:08.760 --> 20:13.000
tip out here to Aditya Mehra who seems to be the author of both this Qt application

20:13.000 --> 20:16.880
as well as the gnome shell extension so it's really helping desktop users out a lot okay

20:16.880 --> 20:23.040
so here's here's the here's the here's the I guess here's the thing well I won't say

20:23.040 --> 20:27.440
that I won't say yeah we'll leave it at that we'll leave it on show Noah yeah no yeah right

20:27.440 --> 20:31.400
no that's my thing it's my trademark I take it everywhere but suffice to say that I think

20:31.400 --> 20:35.200
that mycroft is is going to be absolutely awesome and I don't think I think that at

20:35.200 --> 20:40.320
this point from what I've seen what mycroft can do and that's a that's a that's a small

20:40.320 --> 20:44.440
scope right I think it's much larger than that I think that from the very little that

20:44.440 --> 20:52.520
I've seen it blows away Cortana to me is the new clippy of 2016 that's all I feel about

20:52.520 --> 20:55.900
you know you mean I played with it for a little bit it feels like clippy it feels like that

20:55.900 --> 21:00.080
stupid irritating paperclip that bounces around gives you nothing useful and just annoys the

21:00.080 --> 21:04.280
heck out of you except now it's like it's almost like clippy combined with annoying

21:04.280 --> 21:10.000
flash infomercial embedded in the page with super loud sounds yeah exactly and it's like

21:10.000 --> 21:13.920
under your fingertips all the time all right so I see you're wanting to run a podcast would

21:13.920 --> 21:19.440
you like exactly exactly dude that's exactly how I feel about it I think it's the dumbest

21:19.440 --> 21:27.800
thing ever all right well looks like arch has finally caught up to a bunt to zygoon.pl

21:27.800 --> 21:35.160
headline snappy in arch move to community repo and says hey there snappers I'd like

21:35.160 --> 21:39.720
to announce something that you may have noticed during the last update of snapd to version

21:39.720 --> 21:43.960
2.0.10 the AUR package is no longer there instead you can now get an update snappy in

21:43.960 --> 21:49.200
the arch simply by running this one-liner and then he gives pacman attack s space snap

21:49.200 --> 21:56.520
d s n a p d you know it's interesting was I was just talking again I was talking to

21:56.520 --> 22:00.640
adrium right before the show and he was he was in the process of packaging this electron

22:00.640 --> 22:03.800
thing to me and he says well I know that you have a bunch on your laptop now so I'll just

22:03.800 --> 22:09.340
package it as a snap and I said doesn't it really not matter anymore what operating system

22:09.340 --> 22:14.040
I have now if it's just a snap I just you know just start on any of us right or any

22:14.040 --> 22:19.680
distro and he said no actually so turns out it's it's still very much a community thing

22:19.680 --> 22:24.000
so the community distro and arch has it and you know it's it's available in a bun too

22:24.000 --> 22:30.160
and it's available in copper but it's not like widely spread right so fairly wide it

22:30.160 --> 22:34.120
is fairly I mean it's for the fact that it's only been around for two months it's pretty

22:34.120 --> 22:40.200
wide now well I guess my question is twofold the first question is or the first part of

22:40.200 --> 22:45.880
the question is doesn't it kind of eliminate a universal installer if it's not truly universal

22:45.880 --> 22:53.040
throughout all distros and then my second question good yes but it's it's that's that's

22:53.040 --> 22:56.440
only a temporary thing because it's it has to be people have to adopt it to make universal

22:56.440 --> 23:01.760
yeah so what you're saying is eventually we'll get there more than likely I mean the fact

23:01.760 --> 23:05.360
that it's been two months and when it first started two months ago it was in one distro

23:05.360 --> 23:10.560
and then now then it became in every flavor and then it became in like six other distros

23:10.560 --> 23:17.000
now like sent to s has it fedora has it gen 2 has it linux mint has it now like the fact

23:17.000 --> 23:21.920
that it's only been two months and there's already that much support the more and more

23:21.920 --> 23:25.840
distros that adopted and longer and you know the more time we have the more it becomes

23:25.840 --> 23:31.440
universal I think it just hasn't had enough time to get there okay well I guess that makes

23:31.440 --> 23:35.520
sense so it is good point you can't have universality just on the on the get-go or that'd be pretty

23:35.520 --> 23:39.820
hard to do and we will see if we get the critical mass like if you can tip the tip the ship

23:39.820 --> 23:43.160
here with enough distros then it will will you know you'll feel like an outsider if you

23:43.160 --> 23:46.560
don't have it and your user will probably come to expect it yeah I just I every time

23:46.560 --> 23:50.800
this discussion comes up I have to reference the whole xkcd thing problem we have 13 competing

23:50.800 --> 23:57.120
standards let's create one standard to standardize them all problem we have 14 competing standards

23:57.120 --> 24:02.360
I mean that's it's true but that's also kind of like we didn't really have a standard for

24:02.360 --> 24:08.760
universal apps yet so they're all competing to become the standard yeah so it will eventually

24:08.760 --> 24:12.520
we will have a standard because there's there's so many people who are who are behind the

24:12.520 --> 24:16.720
idea of having a standard that it is very likely that will be the one of them will get

24:16.720 --> 24:22.200
it I don't know which one but one of them will and I think the best example right now

24:22.200 --> 24:29.720
is if someone wants to install like next cloud they can just you know install Ubuntu or whatever

24:29.720 --> 24:35.520
that supports snap and then just snap install next cloud and you're done yeah like it's

24:35.520 --> 24:42.600
that simple now like that is that is such a huge change from what it used to be that

24:42.600 --> 24:46.880
I see that this is big this is definitely going to be like revolutionary type of thing

24:46.880 --> 24:52.240
yeah go ahead dar I will claim that it doesn't even matter if it doesn't become universal

24:52.240 --> 24:59.200
as long as the core distribution is implemented what I mean is the distribution concept is

24:59.200 --> 25:03.440
a concept of try different things and see if you succeed at doing and if it becomes

25:03.440 --> 25:10.360
good people adopted the toolkits GTK cute all that kind of jazz essentially for me if

25:10.360 --> 25:14.600
it is good is going to get adopted by the major distributions usually people run mostly

25:14.600 --> 25:18.240
on the major distributions those that are running different things it's probably because

25:18.240 --> 25:22.280
they're looking for different things anyways it doesn't matter if it's not universal as

25:22.280 --> 25:27.560
long as it's in the core ones if you're developing software and you want to ship it heck if you

25:27.560 --> 25:31.640
can have a single binary that it runs that's what matters for your user as long as he can

25:31.640 --> 25:35.760
execute your program and in the end of the day it doesn't matter yeah that's fair that's

25:35.760 --> 25:41.520
fair I guess I guess I you know I started out I mostly took the opposite side of this

25:41.520 --> 25:45.800
argument simply to you know to provide context and because I've been speaking with some developers

25:45.800 --> 25:51.320
and they had some concerns but I think overall if I had any concerns even if they haven't

25:51.320 --> 25:57.540
been those concerns haven't been directly addressed or or squashed I guess they're outweighed

25:57.540 --> 26:03.320
by the by the huge benefits of of what this brings to the table and I guess the only thing

26:03.320 --> 26:10.400
is is it is interesting to me that that something that of this magnitude is still you know is

26:10.400 --> 26:13.960
is in the community repo it's not in the main arch repo although I suppose on the other

26:13.960 --> 26:20.840
hand it is the main arch repo though is it yeah well there's a distinction in terms yeah

26:20.840 --> 26:25.160
it's a community is just a branch it's not officially maintained by arch but the fact

26:25.160 --> 26:30.920
that they're allowing a trusted user to maintain it in the official arch repos it is kind of

26:30.920 --> 26:35.880
like they are kind of acknowledging that it's more than just an AR it is being maintained

26:35.880 --> 26:41.100
by someone in that community gotcha okay well yeah that's an important good that's good

26:41.100 --> 26:48.760
clarification because I was not aware of that so anyway anyway yeah I think it's I think

26:48.760 --> 26:52.240
this is gonna be interesting it'll be exciting this will be my first snap package that I

26:52.240 --> 26:57.180
will rely on you know I've installed telegram but I have you know I've always had the option

26:57.180 --> 27:01.440
of doing it from a PPA I installed you know I've installed other applications but they

27:01.440 --> 27:06.920
they are just it was specifically for the purpose to try out snap this OS ticket desktop

27:06.920 --> 27:12.720
application will be the first one that I've ever that I'll have ever used that is only

27:12.720 --> 27:17.740
available to me in a snap package and because snap package I guess I'll be able to use it

27:17.740 --> 27:22.520
on anything right yeah I'll be really curious to see you know how that goes for you should

27:22.520 --> 27:24.840
definitely when you once you've got a hold of it you should definitely see how how far

27:24.840 --> 27:29.040
you can spread it just see which servers and how easy it is yeah I totally will I tell

27:29.040 --> 27:33.880
you what the funny thing about the snaps is that the most of the things that as like on

27:33.880 --> 27:37.120
the developer side there are certain things that I say that it could be problem but there's

27:37.120 --> 27:41.800
also certain things that I think that are fantastic and but the funny thing about it

27:41.800 --> 27:46.800
is that so far it's since there's only been a couple months the amount of progress that

27:46.800 --> 27:53.280
has been made on the snap side is like kind of amazing just because when the very beginning

27:53.280 --> 27:58.360
there was like two or three problems that were addressed as like being catastrophic

27:58.360 --> 28:04.460
and there's no way it's going to be adopted and then they happened and snap release features

28:04.460 --> 28:09.520
for that and then now there was like the immediate jump was then the shared library issue and

28:09.520 --> 28:13.720
then now snap is basically going to have in like a couple weeks shared libraries are going

28:13.720 --> 28:18.580
to be released so they're like pretty much anytime there's an issue that's not like that

28:18.580 --> 28:23.000
seems like snap is not going to be something that people would want they're going well

28:23.000 --> 28:28.200
okay now if you brought our attention we'll make it huh well that's a good time yeah it

28:28.200 --> 28:34.240
is that's very promising very promising outlook so West you have the chat room up right now

28:34.240 --> 28:39.020
yes I do so I'll tell you something I had I was I had the chat room up on my laptop

28:39.020 --> 28:43.880
and then as it turns out one of the problems so here behind the scenes ready behind the

28:43.880 --> 28:48.960
scenes one of the problems with doing shows from Grand Forks is I'm not usually doing

28:48.960 --> 28:53.480
them from Grand Forks and so when I every show I think I kind of have everything down

28:53.480 --> 28:59.140
and to be fair Kota radio was so much less overhead than last that I literally walked

28:59.140 --> 29:03.480
into the studio I set up in about 15 minutes and then I was like well now what I guess

29:03.480 --> 29:06.620
I guess I'll go have lunch and come back in an hour and a half and do the show and worked

29:06.620 --> 29:10.760
out beautifully well thought I was all set up to do unplugged but the one thing that

29:10.760 --> 29:16.520
I missed was I there's where I didn't do the intro music for Kota because there were some

29:16.520 --> 29:19.840
editing concerns love I've done the intro music before and I was like wow it should

29:19.840 --> 29:23.720
be no problem to knock it out but I realized I didn't have a third computer to play the

29:23.720 --> 29:26.560
intro music on so right before the show starts I'm like well I'll use my laptop so I bring

29:26.560 --> 29:30.200
it over I set it in the middle of the studio plug this audio cable in and run the music

29:30.200 --> 29:33.680
well then I get back here and I realize I don't have access to the chat room that's

29:33.680 --> 29:39.760
a problem right well the great thing about Quasl is it syncs on all of the devices turns

29:39.760 --> 29:44.040
out today is the day that our techs decide they're gonna upgrade all of the access points

29:44.040 --> 29:51.120
so we're going to AC right I have no Wi-Fi in here I have no Wi-Fi what are you gonna

29:51.120 --> 29:59.360
do I tell you what what I did was I have my Samsung Galaxy S6 on Ting and the cool thing

29:59.360 --> 30:06.120
about Ting especially if you use the code Linux or you visit the website linux.ting.com

30:06.120 --> 30:10.520
is they are going to give you $25 off your first device or your first month of service

30:10.520 --> 30:19.280
now my total bill my total bill is $24 that's what I pay every month and that is for a phone

30:19.280 --> 30:25.120
for myself and my wife that's crazy yeah we have two phones and it costs us 24 bucks a

30:25.120 --> 30:29.760
month now the great thing how that's even possible is you only pay for what you use

30:29.760 --> 30:34.440
so I don't use minutes I in fact I hate phone calls if you call me you're likely to get

30:34.440 --> 30:37.880
rejected I only answer phone calls from like three people and other than that the little

30:37.880 --> 30:43.560
ringer thing if by default is set to silent and then there's certain people that I have

30:43.560 --> 30:47.720
set a ringtone for like my wife if she needs something urgently for the most part I just

30:47.720 --> 30:51.640
don't do phone calls so my minutes are zero my messages I hate texting because I'm on

30:51.640 --> 30:57.560
so many different devices that I can't text from one device you just send me a text message

30:57.560 --> 31:01.160
in fact I have those alerts disabled so I check them like once a month for those people

31:01.160 --> 31:06.360
that refuse to join 2016 but I use yeah exactly I use telegram for going over you know data

31:06.360 --> 31:09.920
for everything now we're an IT company so what does that mean that means that we install

31:09.920 --> 31:15.080
IT infrastructure I never have to worry about not having Wi-Fi because if I'm at my office

31:15.080 --> 31:19.000
except for today I have Wi-Fi if I'm at my home I have Wi-Fi and if I'm at any client

31:19.000 --> 31:24.080
location we have a super secret special network that all of our all of our tech devices can

31:24.080 --> 31:27.300
I do that give us admin access to the network and unrestricted speeds and all that good

31:27.300 --> 31:31.720
stuff I just throw my phone on there so I have network access literally everywhere I

31:31.720 --> 31:39.280
go so much so that when I got my s6 I didn't have a GSM SIM card at the time for it because

31:39.280 --> 31:42.960
I still have my other phone activated I want to number two it's a long story but I didn't

31:42.960 --> 31:47.080
have a SIM card I actually used my phone for three days while I waited for my Amazon Prime

31:47.080 --> 31:51.160
SIM card by the way you can get them off of Amazon Prime the ting ones I used it for three

31:51.160 --> 31:57.480
days voice calls through Zoiper SIP texting through telegram and of course all of my email

31:57.480 --> 32:01.200
stuff and I never even really missed a beat I didn't have data while I was in the car

32:01.200 --> 32:04.040
that wasn't really the end of the world so it's kind of like gap coverage and it was

32:04.040 --> 32:08.280
just kind of funny today because it was one of the first times where I was like hey I

32:08.280 --> 32:12.960
actually don't have I don't have Wi-Fi for the first time and that doesn't usually happen

32:12.960 --> 32:18.040
so all that to say linux.ting.com go over there for 25 bucks you should easily be able

32:18.040 --> 32:21.480
to get your first month of service if not if you're single person you might even be

32:21.480 --> 32:26.800
able to milk two months out of that just six bucks per line and you can do a hotspot so

32:26.800 --> 32:32.200
I actually in addition to my my two phones I've also got a hotspot that I use when I

32:32.200 --> 32:35.160
go when we go out to the lake and stuff like that just so the laptops can't get connected

32:35.160 --> 32:41.560
the kids can be there and and whatnot linux.ting.com and a huge thanks to Ting for sponsoring

32:41.560 --> 32:45.640
the Linux unplugged program.

32:45.640 --> 32:58.120
So the next story on the docket is I believe it's this BPKG am I am I pronounced that?

32:58.120 --> 33:01.840
You are dead on what does that sound like to you?

33:01.840 --> 33:07.600
Big B package I mean I know what it is because I got it pulled up here but but is it is it

33:07.600 --> 33:10.840
B package is that how I'm supposed to pronounce it?

33:10.840 --> 33:15.080
Let's go with B package that seems like the most fun so you know you need you pretty we

33:15.080 --> 33:18.960
all love package managers we're just talking about the next round of pseudo package managers

33:18.960 --> 33:22.920
with snap and flat pack and docker and well everyone you know you also have things like

33:22.920 --> 33:28.280
you have your you know your rust has a has cargo you have pip for python now we have

33:28.280 --> 33:34.600
a B package for bash as a developer I hate them all okay tell me why hold on hold on

33:34.600 --> 33:39.680
tell me why okay I will say the following if you're developing python somebody uses

33:39.680 --> 33:44.220
install somebody uses pip yes they eventually fixed and merged both of the package managers

33:44.220 --> 33:48.760
but that means only that now you have software that when you download the repository in the

33:48.760 --> 33:52.600
source code you actually don't get all of the dependencies you need for that program

33:52.600 --> 33:57.240
to to build even though you're just getting source code in tarballs you will get source

33:57.240 --> 34:01.880
code and you will have all git has sub modules but developers seem that they want to use

34:01.880 --> 34:07.920
whatever package manager you have go has the same problem they put the url as an import

34:07.920 --> 34:12.040
inside of the language what that means you download your source code you want to work

34:12.040 --> 34:16.320
offline you can't want to build you can't if the server goes down of one of the dependencies

34:16.320 --> 34:22.940
you're dead essentially it's terrible drunk it's much worse the problem than actually

34:22.940 --> 34:27.560
the problem you end up finding in the distributions repositories because at least you know that

34:27.560 --> 34:31.680
it's your distro they might not support all the packages you're looking for when they

34:31.680 --> 34:38.280
have something they tend to have all the dependencies you need so what would you recommend then

34:38.280 --> 34:41.240
I mean are you are you saying that there shouldn't be that none of these should exist are you

34:41.240 --> 34:46.760
saying that the problem is we got too much of a good thing I think it's because it creates

34:46.760 --> 34:53.040
isolationism and makes it the people using a specific language end up having to recreate

34:53.040 --> 34:57.880
all of these libraries that could be used across and actually have the ability to use

34:57.880 --> 35:03.240
code that already exists outside of their their own isolationist thing I believe if

35:03.240 --> 35:07.200
you want to fix your source code if you're already shipping source code and if you're

35:07.200 --> 35:12.360
already using some sort of version in control it's not difficult to put in your build script

35:12.360 --> 35:18.160
or it whatever your your version of control supports like git has sub modules in and sub

35:18.160 --> 35:23.600
trees use those things please okay so you can avoid so much there's one tool to do the

35:23.600 --> 35:28.360
job okay so you're saying it's unnecessary you're saying it's unnecessary I'm saying

35:28.360 --> 35:32.520
it's unnecessary because let's say I want to I want to use a python program now I have

35:32.520 --> 35:37.520
to have peep is install I have to have a git I have to have the distribution so all of

35:37.520 --> 35:42.520
these packages are spread across not uniformly not all in the same version it's like it's

35:42.520 --> 35:49.280
just a pain as a developer I think it's terrible actually hmm okay Wes do you have a do you

35:49.280 --> 35:53.080
have a contrary opinion well you know I wasn't exactly excited about this I just think it

35:53.080 --> 35:57.920
was interesting to see something like to see these concepts promulgate down even to the

35:57.920 --> 36:02.720
shell level I don't do too much bash I mean I enjoy writing a bash script certainly is

36:02.720 --> 36:06.680
useful but you know there's a get to a certain level where there's enough logic I usually

36:06.680 --> 36:10.920
have migrated to another language that has solved these problems already I did install

36:10.920 --> 36:15.600
it on my laptop here and you know it's working well it was a fast install although they do

36:15.600 --> 36:19.440
recommend the one of the ways install isn't is the curl pipe to bash so there's probably

36:19.440 --> 36:23.560
a theme going on here but you know you can install stuff I've got like an our tail program

36:23.560 --> 36:27.120
for remotely tailing log files so I can see some utility in it and certainly if you were

36:27.120 --> 36:31.000
like a bash developer I'm not sure if that's a thing but if it is a thing maybe you know

36:31.000 --> 36:34.680
it does allow you to have like it will set up local dependencies for you so you can install

36:34.680 --> 36:40.080
things in user land rather than you know needing root permissions just add one small thing

36:40.080 --> 36:44.900
I see nothing wrong with having maybe an index of where you can find the multiple sides the

36:44.900 --> 36:48.600
things that don't get published into a repository if you have some sort of index that allows

36:48.600 --> 36:54.560
you to search code search code website for example you can do that but honestly when

36:54.560 --> 36:59.820
it comes down to the way you distribute your package come on it's source code if you are

36:59.820 --> 37:04.320
building a program that program you're shipping the source code the user expects to be the

37:04.320 --> 37:09.940
user of that source code expects to be able to build and run your program make that work

37:09.940 --> 37:15.360
stop depending on yet another tool to push your code so that all of your collection of

37:15.360 --> 37:20.960
code is available and start dealing with you know last surface a lot of the errors and

37:20.960 --> 37:25.960
issues come exactly from increasing your surface of the area you as a developer can comprehend

37:25.960 --> 37:30.540
all of it perfectly you end up having dependencies and you can see as an example what happened

37:30.540 --> 37:36.480
with node just actually one developer decided to okay since I can't have name I wanted because

37:36.480 --> 37:40.800
of trademarks I'm going to delete it and broke a lot of websites because projects depended

37:40.800 --> 37:46.760
on it was an example that's not a very good example just because node had a very poor

37:46.760 --> 37:52.640
infrastructure it was if no did not allow them to you know remove it any time for any

37:52.640 --> 37:57.260
reason whatsoever that wouldn't have happened but here's the they screwed up not necessarily

37:57.260 --> 38:01.080
like the structure like not the concept of having shared dependencies and stuff like

38:01.080 --> 38:06.800
that it was the the fact that node screwed up or anything specifically actually what

38:06.800 --> 38:11.480
about this and this proves the example that I was speaking about if you are using versioning

38:11.480 --> 38:16.720
control and you fork a repository that you are using as a dependency you can pull exactly

38:16.720 --> 38:21.560
that hash version guess what you can insert into your project as a sub module as a sub

38:21.560 --> 38:29.160
tree and it will be just there okay well well first off I would just point out that you're

38:29.160 --> 38:34.940
talking about an ideal idealistic situation where everything and all source code is open

38:34.940 --> 38:39.880
source but that's not the case and the majority of proprietary software would be a dependency

38:39.880 --> 38:45.560
that you could not do that with so you can't you can't you can have get repositories that

38:45.560 --> 38:51.640
have binaries that are proprietary you can totally do it it's a lame excuse it's doable

38:51.640 --> 38:56.420
we have the tools it's people who don't who are so centric about the code way that they're

38:56.420 --> 39:00.920
used to developing code they don't look at how I actually make my source code something

39:00.920 --> 39:05.320
that just builds and just works they're looking at they complain about the packages issues

39:05.320 --> 39:10.680
but most of the maintainers of the multiple distributions constantly fight okay this package

39:10.680 --> 39:14.920
pulls from pip and this package pulls from easing install and this package puts from

39:14.920 --> 39:19.880
node js which one respects my licenses in the case of devian the maintainer has all

39:19.880 --> 39:23.640
of these efforts to go through if maintainers didn't have this effort to go through they

39:23.640 --> 39:30.360
could just look okay we prefer in our distribution to put binaries in usr bin and so they would

39:30.360 --> 39:34.560
look at where in your package build so in the directory where you build your project

39:34.560 --> 39:39.800
the binaries are generated make it those binaries go to usr bin that actually will simplify

39:39.800 --> 39:46.680
the process for both developers and maintainers but no nobody sees that okay i'm used to

39:46.680 --> 39:50.640
i don't want to be dependent on maintainers to update my applications for the rest of

39:50.640 --> 39:56.480
my life so even if even if your solution is is good in that sense it's still it still

39:56.480 --> 40:00.640
puts it on the maintainers and still means that i can't update it whenever i want so

40:00.640 --> 40:05.060
even if that was a solution i still don't want that for all intensive purposes you can

40:05.060 --> 40:09.720
be the maintainer as much as you want i i don't care i just think that it separates

40:09.720 --> 40:16.240
the concerns between what a developer ships in terms of source code what what a maintainer

40:16.240 --> 40:21.400
ships in in terms of as a maintainer job currently the maintainer job basically is reverse the

40:21.400 --> 40:25.840
process that developer decided to create to build their package understand how he can

40:25.840 --> 40:30.560
incorporate that that into their distro one thing or not that's the process of a maintainer

40:30.560 --> 40:36.640
if i just say that if you as a developer have the care of isolating your source environment

40:36.640 --> 40:42.880
into a location it's actually preferable even if it's you doing the work as a maintainer

40:42.880 --> 40:49.840
it's you shipping a binary or it's someone else coming and picking up on it you know

40:49.840 --> 40:53.960
uh rikai says in the in the in the chat room he made a he made an interesting point i'd

40:53.960 --> 40:57.920
like to get your guys's take on it he says someone point me to a distro that is packaging

40:57.920 --> 41:01.720
a ton of bash scripts as packages because i don't know of any so this argument doesn't

41:01.720 --> 41:06.600
make any sense to me i can see for normal packages but bash scripts and then he goes

41:06.600 --> 41:13.560
on to say sorry i was just gonna say i'm i'm surprised that this is even a thing like this

41:13.560 --> 41:18.640
no not no just that bash has packages i mean i don't even know that like a.sh file that's

41:18.640 --> 41:21.840
the package for bash well i think that i don't even understand i think that's i think that's

41:21.840 --> 41:25.520
what he's saying he's and then somewhere in here i can't find the exact 12 but he says

41:25.520 --> 41:29.920
oh yeah here it is i would love a bash script repository so that makes sense to me but there's

41:29.920 --> 41:36.000
no way to get it elsewhere without just searching get home from code and pulling down from local

41:36.000 --> 41:41.760
does that does that change your perspective at all either rotten corpse or dar devlin

41:41.760 --> 41:47.760
or west if you slightly slightly but very mildly only in the sense that i agree with

41:47.760 --> 41:52.700
the repository i agree that there's not something for it and in that sense maybe distribution

41:52.700 --> 41:57.360
should look into incorporating common bash scripts then you have to make the other question

41:57.360 --> 42:03.920
isn't bash scripts for customization personalization of things and things need to be a system become

42:03.920 --> 42:10.060
their own isolated demon or program if if we look at bash as something to automate things

42:10.060 --> 42:15.400
for our own personal taste and our repository makes sense in the terms of community sharing

42:15.400 --> 42:22.320
not necessarily as distribution actually distributing this it's very personal so i'll

42:22.320 --> 42:27.280
look those things become standardized they become small little programs that end up being

42:27.280 --> 42:31.840
deployed as a package good with my feeling i'll just add in in some ways like it you

42:31.840 --> 42:36.080
know there's also kind of like a weird reverse or perverse incentive where a lot of times

42:36.080 --> 42:39.680
bash scripts i i'll use them where i might not use another tool because you know they're

42:39.680 --> 42:44.320
very portable they're easy to run you don't have to compile them etc so if i'm if i have

42:44.320 --> 42:48.280
to install this secondary tool to then down these obviously you don't you can get them

42:48.280 --> 42:50.960
just through the repo or whatever but you know it makes it like well if i'm gonna already

42:50.960 --> 42:54.000
be using a package manager i might as well use something in python or a higher level

42:54.000 --> 42:57.040
language that i could use rather than bash you know i'm guilty of that and i and i can

42:57.040 --> 43:02.080
tell you firsthand raki is as well i mean fundamentally bash is what is is the quote

43:02.080 --> 43:07.560
unquote programming language that's used to facilitate a lot of things in fact raki actually

43:07.560 --> 43:11.920
shares with me a couple of little out scripts of the way that some of the videos are transcoded

43:11.920 --> 43:16.540
my understanding is that's all wrapped in inside of a bash script i i actually tried

43:16.540 --> 43:22.080
using you know i took a course on linux academy more about them in a little bit but i actually

43:22.080 --> 43:28.240
i tried writing a little bit of code in bash uh and and then i decided i was going to quote

43:28.240 --> 43:32.040
unquote graduate to a higher programming language and so i took a course from linux academy

43:32.040 --> 43:37.760
on python and what ended up happening was i found in python how to write bash like how

43:37.760 --> 43:42.240
i could call bash scripts and so i ended up yeah and so basically ended up wrapping all

43:42.240 --> 43:45.160
of these bash scripts inside of python which made absolutely no sense but you know it's

43:45.160 --> 43:49.520
fun to do but i think part of it is that you once you get you have to be comfortable with

43:49.520 --> 43:53.480
bash to be a linux admin to begin with and so for those of us that are system administrators

43:53.480 --> 44:00.860
and we're not developers being able to get small tasks done or even automated inside

44:00.860 --> 44:06.840
of bash enables us to get the functionality as if we were a developer writing a a program

44:06.840 --> 44:10.000
without the overhead of actually having to learn the development language and quote unquote

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
doing it properly and in that regard i think that there's that that bash has a lot of power

44:15.000 --> 44:19.720
has a lot of power behind it you know to that point how many people do you know in 2016

44:19.720 --> 44:27.760
that are writing hugely complicated scripts in dos or whatever you know it's just i i

44:27.760 --> 44:33.680
i we have we have i mean our shell is so powerful that we're talking about a package manager

44:33.680 --> 44:41.240
for it that in and of itself is cool i'm going to not without disrespecting anybody i will

44:41.240 --> 44:47.600
say that the fact that once those things start needing a package manager i think is actually

44:47.600 --> 44:53.520
an indication that perhaps those things should be moved outside bash it's just a suggestion

44:53.520 --> 44:58.280
because a lot of things don't contemplate the use case scenarios that are beyond the

44:58.280 --> 45:03.440
you know small automation bash was originally at least if i understand correctly it was

45:03.440 --> 45:09.080
originally intended as you invoke mostly other programs to do but when you start doing manipulation

45:09.080 --> 45:14.280
when you start producing it's a show yeah exactly when you start trying to produce output

45:14.280 --> 45:19.080
maybe it's the time that you need to make a stop in your heart and say really i need

45:19.080 --> 45:25.020
to get this done properly because seriously it actually just damages further because we

45:25.020 --> 45:30.600
then need that bash becomes always there becomes having the issues that other programming languages

45:30.600 --> 45:36.320
already have solved and now we're having to deal with an extra package manager i just

45:36.320 --> 45:42.480
don't believe it's a good idea a package manager might not be good for bash but i i agree that

45:42.480 --> 45:47.360
the uh the idea of a repo would be pretty cool so maybe not practical but still pretty

45:47.360 --> 45:50.880
cool yeah well you guys should all just try it out and report back if you actually use

45:50.880 --> 45:55.080
it yeah yeah yeah maybe that's an idea maybe we could have like a community review kind

45:55.080 --> 45:59.620
of a thing you know i think part of the drive is to you know so one part of the drive is

45:59.620 --> 46:03.160
just that we're familiar with it but the i think the reason that a lot of us especially

46:03.160 --> 46:07.200
a system administrators i don't know about us but the reason that i've become so ingrained

46:07.200 --> 46:11.920
in bash is because i can run it from the command line right yeah exactly and so basically what

46:11.920 --> 46:16.080
that enables you to do is if you have a tool that you fundamentally rely on that requires

46:16.080 --> 46:22.760
a web interface it means that you're only able to access that tool when you have i'm

46:22.760 --> 46:26.640
sorry can i say web interface graphical interface you're only able to access that tool when

46:26.640 --> 46:30.580
you have the graphical interface graphical desktop installed and that's not always the

46:30.580 --> 46:34.700
case in fact a lot of times you'll end up using like all of my servers and i can say

46:34.700 --> 46:39.120
this with 100 certainty every single server i own whether it is a virtual server or it's

46:39.120 --> 46:42.840
a physical box does not have a head on it and it's it actually it provides for some

46:42.840 --> 46:46.600
comical interaction because i'll get calls from clients you know all the servers that

46:46.600 --> 46:50.120
we have installed at client locations they're on a rack and there's no display connected

46:50.120 --> 46:54.340
to it because we administrate everything you know over ssh totally and that that enables

46:54.340 --> 46:57.280
us to get it to it remotely but it'll be funny every once in a while you have a client that

46:57.280 --> 47:00.860
their server goes down or something stops working and they don't want to pay us to come

47:00.860 --> 47:03.920
out so they'll they'll go in there and they're like i'll fix this i'll just go and click

47:03.920 --> 47:08.540
the restart button or well it's all right they're locked as a gang login but they they

47:08.540 --> 47:12.080
have this they have the the cable they plug a monitor cable and they set a monitor up

47:12.080 --> 47:16.440
and i've gotten more than one call where they're like well yeah oh this is so and so from so

47:16.440 --> 47:19.500
and so client and uh we uh we want in the server room something's definitely wrong with

47:19.500 --> 47:23.720
our server we plug the monitor in and it it's booted to a dos prompt and uh it's not loading

47:23.720 --> 47:29.720
windows you know they just they have no idea right but the i think that and the the drive

47:29.720 --> 47:34.920
behind that not only is it lower resources but in it fundamentally enables us to take

47:34.920 --> 47:38.980
those servers if we ever need to and it's happened more than once and move them over

47:38.980 --> 47:43.560
to a vps provider so you have a you have a client and they have a server and all of a

47:43.560 --> 47:47.900
sudden it goes down the protocol used to be 10 years ago here's how that conversation

47:47.900 --> 47:51.480
would look hey i'm really sorry that your server went down i understand that you're

47:51.480 --> 47:55.800
not able to get any work done if you'd like i can go ahead and overnight a brand new server

47:55.800 --> 48:00.240
to you and would have it up and running in about 12 hours if it's super super super super

48:00.240 --> 48:07.680
super super important i can call xyz and they'll go ahead and uh put an expedite thing on it

48:07.680 --> 48:11.520
and i can drive to minneapolis four and a half hours and i can have it up at eight hours

48:11.520 --> 48:16.280
and then you'd be back online today that conversation looks like this hey guys i'm really sorry

48:16.280 --> 48:22.520
that your server went down if you pay us fifteen dollars uh we will go ahead and set you up

48:22.520 --> 48:27.720
an account over at digital ocean which is our chosen vps provider and then we bill them

48:27.720 --> 48:31.160
15 bucks and digital ocean charges us five bucks and so we make a nice little spread

48:31.160 --> 48:35.900
in there and it's a recurring cost because if you're in small business you know that

48:35.900 --> 48:41.000
the most valuable revenue stream that you have is the recurring sources it's not the

48:41.000 --> 48:44.560
one-offs the people that call even if it's a big client even if it's a big job and you

48:44.560 --> 48:50.600
bid it out and it's you know 10 15 20 even 30 000 that money will eventually go away

48:50.600 --> 48:54.320
so it's those it's those it is those reoccurring contracts where they sign up and they say

48:54.320 --> 48:59.340
yeah we want because it's only five bucks we want a main server we want a backup server

48:59.340 --> 49:02.920
and then we want a failover server off-site you know this that and the other okay no problem

49:02.920 --> 49:06.480
i log into my digital ocean control panel i create their main server i create their

49:06.480 --> 49:09.920
backup server and those may be on one data center and then i put another one in like

49:09.920 --> 49:13.940
you know frankfurt or wherever that's totally off-site and it's doing off-site replication

49:13.940 --> 49:18.280
so if anything fails at the main data center or something like that we have the backups

49:18.280 --> 49:22.960
and i can do all of this from my laptop or even my freaking cell phone right on site

49:22.960 --> 49:26.200
and i can tell the customer and i have told the customer hey we'll have this up and running

49:26.200 --> 49:30.280
for you in about 20 minutes because it takes me about 30 seconds to get the server spun

49:30.280 --> 49:34.600
up and working and then it takes me you know the the rest of the time i probably spend

49:34.600 --> 49:39.680
half an hour locking the system down and installing all their applications and stuff like that

49:39.680 --> 49:47.400
the thing is um if you use the code do unplugged you're going to get uh you're going to get

49:47.400 --> 49:53.640
ten dollars off your first linux rig now you could apply that towards a big linux rig and

49:53.640 --> 49:58.400
run a really powerful server for a free month or you could do what i do which is spread

49:58.400 --> 50:02.760
that over over two machines and you can actually run two five dollar rigs now just to see how

50:02.760 --> 50:07.960
far i could push digital ocean a couple weeks ago we did a review of uh virtualization and

50:07.960 --> 50:12.160
i actually virtualized a five dollar droplet to see if i could do it you could actually

50:12.160 --> 50:17.380
get mini droplets out of your five dollar droplet if you really had to so if you had

50:17.380 --> 50:21.040
like a good example might be a web server a small web server that has like a company

50:21.040 --> 50:25.980
portal maybe it redirects to a different site or maybe you just have a couple little company

50:25.980 --> 50:29.980
resources something like that you need just something super super tiny maybe you needed

50:29.980 --> 50:33.160
two of those you could probably get those to run on a five dollar rig i'm not necessarily

50:33.160 --> 50:37.080
suggesting you put that into production because for five bucks a month who cares but i can

50:37.080 --> 50:42.840
tell you this i have there isn't a vps provider out there that i haven't tried and hands down

50:42.840 --> 50:50.600
the zero compromise vps solution is digital ocean so go over there use the code do unplugged

50:50.600 --> 50:55.400
and get ten dollars towards your first linux rig and a huge thank you to digital ocean

50:55.400 --> 51:07.200
for sponsoring the linux unplugged program so wes uh i this next piece here is uh confusing

51:07.200 --> 51:16.300
confusing to say the least linux and open source are powering comic uh massive restructure

51:16.300 --> 51:22.160
am i reading that right almost so uh linux and open source are powering comcast massive

51:22.160 --> 51:25.780
infrastructure i didn't see the wrap there you go okay you know and it's hard that's

51:25.780 --> 51:29.560
a hard one to say for us people comcast is not always our friends i know uh here at the

51:29.560 --> 51:34.560
jb one we certainly complain about them i think that's every day but it's you know you

51:34.560 --> 51:37.880
don't always think about like how much of the open source technology they really do

51:37.880 --> 51:45.180
and have to leverage to compete as a huge isp uh-huh we've had our you know you speak

51:45.180 --> 51:51.640
about uh problems but we have had a a plethora of comcast problems recently so much so that

51:51.640 --> 51:57.720
chris is actively looking to try to find alternatives to comcast the problem is in his particular

51:57.720 --> 52:02.000
area neck of the woods they are not terribly available in fact he was i heard him on the

52:02.000 --> 52:05.240
air last week sometime he was even joking he's like maybe i'll just go do shows from

52:05.240 --> 52:10.160
the road because i probably have more reliable internet yeah exactly i mean that says it

52:10.160 --> 52:15.120
right there okay so dive into this a little bit for me tell me how comcast is using linux

52:15.120 --> 52:21.800
well okay so basically i mean to start with obviously comcast ships a crazy amount of

52:21.800 --> 52:27.400
traffic uh let's see so in 2012 they had 1.2 million gigabytes of data traffic in 2013

52:27.400 --> 52:31.240
that grew to almost 7 million gigabytes of traffic and it just keeps getting more right

52:31.240 --> 52:35.560
so like in 2014 now it's at 74.8 million gigs of traffic so people are clearly picking it

52:35.560 --> 52:41.320
up and they need things that can really scale okay and so so and it's just interesting to

52:41.320 --> 52:45.360
hear the people say so here um here's what their representatives saying comcast like

52:45.360 --> 52:50.100
so many others is a very linux heavy operating system country a company generally speaking

52:50.100 --> 52:52.960
we're more on the open source side of those linux distributions than the commercial side

52:52.960 --> 52:57.520
so they mostly are using ubuntu and centos in addition they're huge open stack users

52:57.520 --> 53:01.720
so they they mostly deploy kvm and then they do all their data center orchestration through

53:01.720 --> 53:05.360
open stack they have a let's say they have roughly a petabyte of memory and around a

53:05.360 --> 53:10.160
million virtual cpu cores that they are running under open stack mostly to pile you know to

53:10.160 --> 53:14.840
run all their web interfaces billing management account stuff the x1 interface the on-screen

53:14.840 --> 53:18.240
interface all that stuff so i really never really thought about it before but it's it's

53:18.240 --> 53:21.720
kind of interesting you know i suppose really what you know the thing is like it would be

53:21.720 --> 53:25.720
cool to you almost to use almost it would be cool to use this as something like a runs

53:25.720 --> 53:30.360
linux on the linux action show but the reality is there they are the epitome of everything

53:30.360 --> 53:36.800
i hate about uh these kinds of linux users and it is it is this in a very short order

53:36.800 --> 53:40.760
they don't care about linux or the community they care about profiting off the backs of

53:40.760 --> 53:45.080
the hard-working people and and the excellent infrastructure that linux offers now i'm a

53:45.080 --> 53:49.440
small business owner i'm not against making money i'm not against making a lot of money

53:49.440 --> 53:56.880
right our economy relies on that yeah but i am against abusing a community and having

53:56.880 --> 54:02.120
zero respect for that community and oracle well and then further is pushing the people

54:02.120 --> 54:05.160
that made that community exist in the first place out of the community because they are

54:05.160 --> 54:10.920
not part of your business model and don't benefit you directly and uh comcast and the

54:10.920 --> 54:14.280
few little things that i've had to deal with them seems like they hit every one of those

54:14.280 --> 54:20.240
bullet points square on the head and i hate it um and so you know it's kind of cool but

54:20.240 --> 54:25.220
let's face it all that to say you can't run a company the size of comcast unless you're

54:25.220 --> 54:30.800
running it on linux i mean windows small business server ain't gonna cut it and and comcast

54:30.800 --> 54:35.080
needs like you know best in class engineers and those people are gonna be using unix tools

54:35.080 --> 54:39.160
and and a lot of linux based tools so here's an interesting twist for you are you familiar

54:39.160 --> 54:44.320
with cumulus networks uh only a little bit okay so cumulus networks had a really bright

54:44.320 --> 54:51.020
idea they said right now in business we have a problem we have network engineers network

54:51.020 --> 54:56.000
technicians and we have system administrators and the system administrators are very good

54:56.000 --> 55:00.440
with bash and are very good with linux and are very good with you know computers and

55:00.440 --> 55:04.880
understand the networking side of linux but anytime we want to do something serious

55:04.880 --> 55:08.740
heavy lifting with networking we go to our network engineers and our network technicians

55:08.740 --> 55:13.000
and those are the guys that know cisco and they know juniper and they know hp very different

55:13.000 --> 55:18.240
worlds you know microtech right exactly um and they they are who provide our network

55:18.240 --> 55:22.440
so if you want to have a high functioning company you employ the best of the best of

55:22.440 --> 55:25.840
the system administrators and you employ the best of the best of network engineers and

55:25.840 --> 55:30.600
technicians and if your network crashes your system administrator notices he contacts a

55:30.600 --> 55:35.640
network engineer and they take care of it and if your network engineer or technician

55:35.640 --> 55:39.600
is there and the the server goes down they don't touch it you just wait for the administrator

55:39.600 --> 55:44.780
to come but basically that means your payroll is twice because you have two equally technically

55:44.780 --> 55:50.240
proficient people but they are specializing in different areas even though the guy who

55:50.240 --> 55:54.560
is running your network engineer guy has to have some basic system administration knowledge

55:54.560 --> 56:00.440
because he's copying files off to and from a tftp server most of the time and your network

56:00.440 --> 56:04.260
engineer has to have some basic your your system administrator has to some basic knowledge

56:04.260 --> 56:08.200
of networking because he's got to get a service to talk on the network and so they said why

56:08.200 --> 56:14.780
not do away with this whole dichotomy and say let's use linux as the network operating

56:14.780 --> 56:20.160
system and just route everything through ip tables and through a custom interface that

56:20.160 --> 56:25.000
they wrote on linux and so how interesting yeah it is really cool dude so basically they

56:25.000 --> 56:29.720
sell this switch and router and you know whatever for you know data center you know we're talking

56:29.720 --> 56:33.440
like 40 gig connection i'm going to move they're not small scale right it's really big stuff

56:33.440 --> 56:38.860
but right isp level that kind of thing but it's all being done on linux and you're using

56:38.860 --> 56:43.480
linux so they're they're they're selling point is train your guys to be a system administrator

56:43.480 --> 56:48.400
they can administrate our networking equipment as well as any of your servers because it's

56:48.400 --> 56:54.040
all one operating system and you interface with it like you would any linux distro and

56:54.040 --> 56:58.620
all that to all that arriving to the point that it seems like that would be a really

56:58.620 --> 57:03.240
great route for some place like comcast who probably has an abundance of people that are

57:03.240 --> 57:07.800
working in networking and now they're trying to branch out and well not necessarily branch

57:07.800 --> 57:12.560
out but they're being forced because cable is going by the wayside to focus on these

57:12.560 --> 57:17.720
video type services which require a huge back end infrastructure of administration seems

57:17.720 --> 57:21.600
like you could really cut your costs down if you could get a network infrastructure

57:21.600 --> 57:25.520
in place that utilizes the same talent as your administrators that are administrating

57:25.520 --> 57:28.400
all this video content what do you think yeah it's interesting it's interesting to see

57:28.400 --> 57:32.760
especially with like you know microsoft's working on their switching linux based thing

57:32.760 --> 57:36.320
dell has their new operating system doing the same sort of thing definitely you know

57:36.320 --> 57:41.280
software divine networking and having these things i will also say personally you know

57:41.280 --> 57:44.160
networking is interesting and i have several friends who have you know cisco certificates

57:44.160 --> 57:48.320
or etc or our networking guys and i work with network engineers and you know we all we get

57:48.320 --> 57:51.440
along on the fundamentals and the and the protocols but it's it's just interesting

57:51.440 --> 57:55.240
because a lot of the professional network engineers are applying practices with very

57:55.240 --> 57:59.360
proprietary equipment you know very locked down they're very following specifications

57:59.360 --> 58:04.480
made and implemented by these vendors it's very different in the linux world where it

58:04.480 --> 58:07.020
networking really has that spirit of just like you know maybe you won't get quite the

58:07.020 --> 58:10.200
throughput or you won't be able to do like you know you're not having a giant core router

58:10.200 --> 58:14.640
or anything but the amount of flexibility and things you can do with the linux networking

58:14.640 --> 58:19.140
stack is i'm i'm continually impressed you know it's interesting too because they they've

58:19.140 --> 58:23.000
literally proven and i mean i'm telling you these are not cheap equipment right you're

58:23.000 --> 58:27.720
looking at 20 000 plus you know totally yeah so i mean but they're selling these things

58:27.720 --> 58:32.000
right and left and they're hugely popular and i think the reason is because in the long

58:32.000 --> 58:38.080
scheme if you're looking at large scale really your costs are going down not up and i think

58:38.080 --> 58:43.400
that i think that alone is hugely advantageous now so i don't mean to sidetrack the conversation

58:43.400 --> 58:48.160
with but have you do you have do you have any networking certifications i do not have

58:48.160 --> 58:52.980
any certifications now have you ever gone to any of the training i've had some informal

58:52.980 --> 58:58.240
training from network engineers yeah so i have sat and passed the some of the cisco

58:58.240 --> 59:03.240
exams right and i made an authentic comment on last i've actually made it more than once

59:03.240 --> 59:09.400
that the certifications for networking are kind of a joke and i didn't mean to say that

59:09.400 --> 59:12.720
network engineers are not talented or that it's not difficult to pass the test or anything

59:12.720 --> 59:17.320
like that totally but what i am saying and i stand by this and after i explained it via

59:17.320 --> 59:21.920
an email guy wrote back and he's like oh man you you brought back some bad memories you

59:21.920 --> 59:26.120
know i thought when i went to sit down i actually i was certified in red hat first and then

59:26.120 --> 59:29.320
i went back and did my cisco stuff because at the time i was focusing on system administration

59:29.320 --> 59:33.240
then i went and branched out my own company this and the other when i went to sit for

59:33.240 --> 59:37.720
the cisco test i expected to sit down in front of a cisco router and they would give me a

59:37.720 --> 59:42.440
computer to ssh or telnet or use a serial connection whatever and give me a series of

59:42.440 --> 59:48.080
tasks to configure the switcher router or whatever right turns out what they actually

59:48.080 --> 59:55.300
have is a little java applet that emulates the router but only the commands that they

59:55.300 --> 01:00:00.760
think that you should have so right off the bat you know you get used to doing certain

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.440
things especially if you're a cisco guy one of the first things that you'll do when you

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:12.280
sit down is uh is show space config enter and then it spits out exactly what the router

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:18.440
is you know doing right now you know or or show int uh you know you can you can you can

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:24.280
put in non-ambiguous terms so it the the full command would be something like show interfaces

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:28.520
brief but i i've never actually typed that out in fact i couldn't even tell you i couldn't

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:32.000
even tell you if it's interface or interfaces i don't remember what i do know is i type

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
show space int space br enter and it shows me all of the interfaces that are there well

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.320
a lot of the stuff isn't working in this stupid java thing and it and it is throwing me off

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:45.000
because i i'm i'm i am painfully aware that i'm not actually onto a router i'm on this

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.040
little emulation thing that doesn't feel like a router and nothing feels right to me it's

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.880
not testing your ability on a real router no it's really not aside from the fact that

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.240
it's super delayed and it's not in guake and i can't draw it's just everything is off to

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.920
me and i'm already feeling out of my comfort zone and then i get past the little simulation

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:05.680
things and they go on to these questions where they ask you to calculate subnets now i would

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.920
figure if i was writing the test that if i wrote four subnet questions and the person

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.880
can answer all four of them then they can subnet and if they can't answer four of them

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.880
then they can't subnet and that should be the end of it what turns out they want you

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.640
to do like i don't know some absurd thing like you do like 30 of these questions but

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.840
they give you the only i'm not very good at math and so i have to i have to do all the

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:27.980
addition basically by hand and they give you a like an eight and a half by eleven transparency

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:33.200
thing and an erasable marker oh man yeah but you can't erase it because they don't give

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.160
you they give you like a kleenex but they don't really give you like anything they don't give

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.320
you an eraser so you didn't wear your best clothes they're not kidding dude i'm like

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.000
spitting on the thing because there's no water and i'm like i use up my kleenex in like the

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.200
first 30 seconds and then the rest of it like it's all over my arm and i'm trying to find

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.440
places that it's just a mess right well that was in stark contrast to doing my red hat

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.960
sir which was you sit down at a linux box they give you 25 things to do and you do them

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:59.880
and you restart the computer and if the computer does all of the things then you pass and if

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:03.340
the computer doesn't do all the things and you don't pass it is it's a really straightforward

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:08.640
thing so i am looking at my certifications coming up for renewal and one of the big things

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.880
i was concerned about was red hat 7 because that's we've made this you know this big change

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.520
gone to we've gone from rel6 to rel7 and i have to go sit for this test and so i was

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:24.400
a little concerned because things have changed and i know i'm not i'm i know i'm not necessarily

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:29.640
in in the swing because i'm i'm no longer focusing on you know knowing you know when

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:34.280
i did the six test i was focusing on learning all the things for six now i'm focusing on

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.680
learning all the things i need to do to get my job done well turns out linux academy was

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:46.200
able to help me out there i went over to linux academy and signed up for an account by going

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.640
to linux academy dot com slash unplugged got a huge discount and actually did all of my

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:56.360
rel7 training there so i think that is awesome i feel perfectly confident i have gone i have

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.660
done both ways guys i have done it both ways i have paid the like it's like a three thousand

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:05.320
dollar class fee and then you go for a week and there is there is an advantage to that

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.340
i won't lie there is an advantage to sitting in a classroom and being surrounded by other

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:13.800
people that want to learn linux and spending nine hours a day you know with an hour break

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.080
and right it's like a boot camp no yeah no real coffee you know you have some coffee

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.880
but it's cold and sometimes smells aren't great as smalls are not great because you're

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.440
sitting in front of other it people and it's somebody else's computer and it's their uncomfortable

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.000
chair sometimes and they frown upon you bringing your own laptop which means you have to do

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.540
things at their pace but there is some advantage to that but the bigger advantage is going

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:38.120
to linux academy dot com slash unplugged and signing up for an account it'll cost you

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.640
pennies on the dollar literally like one one hundredth of the cost about that actually

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:48.800
and then on top of that you decide when you want to train so if i work best between the

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.720
hours of like 10 pm and three in the morning that's my like power zone i can get almost

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.680
anything done in those hours partly because my phone isn't constantly interrupting me

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.480
but also because i'm just i'm the most awake and the most focused right about that period

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.240
of time well this academy works great for me with that i curl up in bed i take my laptop

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:10.200
i take a course did red hat seven uh also did um python you can learn just a ton of

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.000
things on these on these you know e-learning sites and the other thing is and i talked

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.400
about this on the linux action show these instructors are not your average these aren't

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.720
the guys these aren't the people that are here for money they're not the people that

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.840
they needed a job and they couldn't actually administrate linux so they decided to teach

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.280
it and you wind up with some of those people sometimes these are people that are genuinely

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:36.600
passionate about linux and teaching other people about linux and i said it on linux

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.560
action shall say it again on on on linux unplugged if you're not making seventy thousand dollars

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:45.840
but you understand what is going on in this show then you need a new job and you need

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.440
to go over to linux academy dot com slash unplugged sign up for an account show your

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.720
support for the linux action show and pick yourself up a new skill get a certification

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.680
the red hat certification to take the test is like two hundred dollars to take the class

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:04.280
is like three thousand that's a crazy difference it is it is and the and so if you can do the

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.420
learning part of it if you can actually pick up the learning over at linux academy for

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:11.560
pennies on the dollar and then go take the test for two hundred bucks you'll wind up

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:15.680
in the same boat that i am in you'd be able to i think if you're if you're one of those

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.640
people that are that are working at like a help desk for thirty thirty five thousand dollars a year you could

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:25.140
double your income in just a couple of months by going to linux academy dot com slash unplugged

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:29.160
they'll hook you up and a couple of people after saying similar things on the linux action

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.960
show have written in and asked me some small business questions and hiring questions by

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:37.720
all means do that go over to jupiter broadcasting dot com click on the contact link and choose

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:42.280
linux unplugged from the drop down menu i'd be more than happy to address any specific

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:47.200
questions of course you can always email me no at jupiter broadcasting dot com i have

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:52.800
some experience in that area and i'm more than happy to share it with you so wes i want

01:05:52.800 --> 01:06:00.880
to talk about uh let's see here local wire uh let's see here which which i'm sorry where's

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:08.560
the next story i got lost set up uh core on a bun too is that right the local wire one

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:17.400
yep okay okay good okay uh local wire dot pl headline set up dot net core on a bun too

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:23.720
and then subtitle microsoft loves linux dot net core 1.0 is here and it's great and it's

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:27.080
a great opportunity to start playing with not only the windows platform not only on

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:32.880
the windows platform but also on linux today i will show you how not only to set up dot

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.960
net core but how to set up the whole development environment for developing dot net since one

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:42.200
of microsoft's goals was for multi-platform to support let's take a look at how to dot

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.880
net core on a bun too why a bun too well it's popular and easy and doesn't work right i

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:53.560
added that uh also microsoft uh used it as a platform for the choice for their bash and

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:58.480
docker support so windows for windows so the decision seemed quite straightforward to me

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.400
we'll be working with a bunch of 1404 lts good choice as it's the most widespread version

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.860
at this time you can also try out other platforms as i did specifically red hat enterprise

01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:13.580
yeah which is totally free at developers dot red hat dot com for developers they also support

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:19.760
dot net on rel and as part of the dot net foundation quite rock solid backed isn't it

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.520
in fact he misses it but i'll inform you that you can actually do the same thing on centos

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.040
in fact that's what i totally that's what i would actually recommend because they're

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.840
not gonna they're not gonna cut you off rel is really if you got money and you want to

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:34.360
pay for it um i know they offer you really need that support yeah if yeah exactly that's

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:42.560
really what you're paying for um i am a big fan of uh i'm a big fan of centos when it's

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:50.160
either for me or for personal or even if it is a even if it is a a professional you know

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:54.960
production environment if it's not a large company that doesn't depend on support i'll

01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:00.720
oftentimes stick them on centos just because i think it offers you know you get basically

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:04.800
the same thing for less money but you know this is super exciting especially because

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:10.360
it seems like there is a lot of disagreement on exactly what dot net core on linux meant

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:17.040
um exactly you know and the big thing was was i have directly been told by people much

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:23.220
smarter than me that you could not develop dot net on uh on on linux it had to be done

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:28.160
on windows and this specifically says otherwise so i think there's a lot of fud going around

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:38.960
no it used to be it used to be true like the dot net core thing is it's pretty much brand

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.560
new but like there are certain things you can do in linux there's certain things you

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:49.240
can't just like you can't use visual basic on linux that kind of thing okay i guess i

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.920
can i can talk a little bit about this as i've looked into actually using it on linux

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.660
because there was a need for a customer that uses windows and i just wanted to make it

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:03.240
on linux deploy it i see essentially when it comes down to this is a lot of the things

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:08.360
that you would rely on to have your dot net application built and shipped on windows that's

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:13.480
kind of the appeal is you wrote it in your linux environment you ship it there it's actually

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:19.060
non-existent so the wpf the windows specific stuff it's not available so you can't even

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:23.680
call it call it with dummy functions that would allow you to then deploy and test so

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:29.600
you can't really do that develop in environments on linux for dot net are really not curated

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:34.360
so that experience also sucks and it's a language that benefits a lot from all of the existing

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.420
code base of the dot net framework but without that it becomes kind of like useless most

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:43.780
of the times you better go with c++ use kit or something like that for making your application

01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:48.440
at that point essentially then there's also these others thing that is actually helping

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:52.720
a little bit of its adoption in the linux platform which is everybody has seen what

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:58.360
oracle has tried to do with google in terms of apis and copyright so even though google

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:03.080
won fair use it was fair use in the google's case doesn't guarantee your case is going

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:08.160
to be fair use and you're a little bit scared of that but let's face it microsoft is also

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:12.720
a proprietary developer company they've had these clothes done for longest time they're

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.220
famously to being able to copyright to patent out software so if you're scared about litigation

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:22.620
you might not use it so in that sense we already have a curated environment around other languages

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:27.440
that provide those features and then you say but at least with dot net i can develop it

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:32.640
for mobile platform well you have to pay about five thousand dollars to have a zamari account

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:37.280
which is the only development environment which is based on mono developed i supposed

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.840
to support the iphone and android so then you look at your options around and you say

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:48.820
just no essentially this is why i think it hasn't been the explosion was intended to

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:54.240
be it's like basically you lack a consistent environment to work on on the platform so

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:59.200
essentially makes it useless for most people i would claim yeah there are definitely a

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.720
lot of usability limitations i'm just kind of curious because i know there's a lot of

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.680
people who like and they they kind of grew up in like c sharp is very popular some people

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:10.680
really like f sharp and i wonder for certain like server side things if there are people

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:14.040
who were kind of bound to windows and were comfortable in those environments and were

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.980
okay with a minimal environment but they still wanted to use the core of those languages

01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:23.400
if they could find a find a use case here essentially they lack the tooling to support

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.600
them in their use case they probably could do but they lack the tooling so they don't

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.640
have visual studio as they are used to they had that they probably could do the switch

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:36.760
but now they still can a mono developer is very good is the best choice you have when

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:44.880
it comes to c sharp in linux but it still mostly sucks honestly sorry point well taken

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:53.240
you know i i guess i'm watching this with interest it is from all angles the world is

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:57.880
getting to be a smaller place now we're developing for containers rather than targeting specific

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:01.760
distros i just talked with michael dominic on monday code radio great show you should

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.320
check it out he was talking about how he pushes clients to develop for html5 because they

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.960
can move from device to device and it becomes platform agnostic and now we're looking at

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.200
you know bash coming to windows and we've got passion windows and dot net is on linux

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.300
and it's like it's very confusing it was i i don't know if confusing is the right word

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:24.340
or if or i guess i shouldn't say the right word wrong word but is not the word i would

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:29.400
choose but the the it just it seems like the walls are falling down and we're all gonna

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.480
find it we're all gonna look up and realize that we're all standing in the same room with

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.440
the same same things regardless of what operating system we're using that couldn't be exemplified

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:43.880
more sorry go ahead so the same thing will be linux i've already did this prediction

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:49.080
in and unplugged before microsoft will use the linux kernel that's why bash and linux

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.880
exist that's why they bottom a lot of android developers android companies basically to

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:58.960
get the the developers and they will move into having a proprietary desktop on top of

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:03.400
linux people won't even notice they will just suddenly swiftly change the underneath and

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.600
since every program is already running on linux linux will be what we've seen as the

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:15.080
tron operating system dude do you want to know what i would use it i would use it exactly

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:20.920
i would use it if if tomorrow i tell you what if tomorrow microsoft came out and said you

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:25.400
know what windows is a terrible you know we have destroyed the windows name we have destroyed

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:29.120
the windows brand and we are sick of windows and windows 10 is a total failure because

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.340
it sucks just a little bit less than a which sucks just a little bit less than vista which

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:38.640
suck just a little bit more next be the the the we if if that happened tomorrow and windows

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.440
says okay we're done with windows we're going to do the next thing called microsoft next

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.720
os which is our next version of windows are into the future and stuff like that and basically

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:52.560
because we have done all of this stuff and we're trying to drag these developers off

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.200
their macs and we're trying to drag them onto windows we have implemented bash and we don't

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.440
want to make there's no point in maintaining the nt kernel anymore because now we could

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.120
just maintain we could just let the linux community which we're already relying on for

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.480
the bash stuff and basically everything at the developer level all that stuff is we're

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.460
pulling that in from the open source community and hey we love linux why not just use the

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:15.560
linux kernel okay that's all right so here's our new windows version and it's kind of like

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.640
windows except it's running a linux kernel and we have the traditional windows desktop

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.880
that you all know and love with the stupid idiotic start menu which by the way we patented

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:29.840
because start is such a unique and signifying word we're going to take that ui and we're

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.920
going to stick it on top of linux and now all you developers don't have a reason to

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:38.240
go anywhere else oh and by the way because we're microsoft and we basically dominate

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:43.120
the pc market space everyone will now develop for linux because we have the linux kernel

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.800
if that happened tomorrow i wouldn't when i buy a new computer i wouldn't bother reinstalling

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:52.800
linux i just use what's on there because frankly even if it's a proprietary desktop am i super

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.760
excited about it no but if it saves me the trouble of having to reinstall the operating

01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:01.240
system if i get support from the oem i can run all of my software because all i have

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:05.040
to do is maybe i install the snap whatever and i can install the snap packages on top

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:08.920
of the existing abuntu base which is probably what they're basing off of it anyway do i

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.600
really care if it's a proprietary desktop now i can live with that i think that would

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:17.880
be amazing and i would take i wouldn't take back but i would significantly reduce all

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:22.160
of the microsoft bashing i've done over the years that would be like that would be like

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:27.040
noah's dream come true because instantaneously america switches to linux basically overnight

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.160
if that happened and i realize i'm pipe dreaming you know no need to send me an email tell me

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:35.800
how crazy am i what it's not gonna happen a half past since my since my prediction two

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:39.880
years and a half happened bash on windows happened a linux distribution on the server

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.240
side happened they bought a lot of android companies to smart my words it's only two

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.280
years and a half since my prediction i did a total prediction of five years i said this

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:53.360
in the show i'm saying it again stick to my word do you know how do you know how happy

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:58.640
i can't i don't know what i will do the show naked i will show up and do the linux action

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.320
show naked if that ever happens i will yes the camera only goes waste up but i'll just

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.120
i don't know i don't know what i would do i'd be so happy you wouldn't i just words

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.960
cannot describe i don't know what i do i do something crazy that's how excited i would

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.080
it'll never i don't believe it's going to happen i hope so who did that whoever did

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:23.760
that amazing whoever did that should be shot no i i don't think i don't think i i don't

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:28.960
think i'm i'm really not uh i'm really not i hope you're right i so hope you're right

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.080
i have a hard time buying into it but our next story kind of exemplifies why you might

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.240
actually be right turns out you can run i3 on windows so it's not exactly what we're

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.400
just talking about because it's still the empty kernel but we're running an open source

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:49.520
desktop on it wes tell me about this yeah you know this uh brian kettleson here you

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:54.000
know he he kind of goes out and kind of talks about why you know he feels mac os is slipping

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.480
he really isn't quite comfortable enough on the linux desktop i know you and i would both

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:02.560
have a lot of things to say there about improvements you know but but for him he really appreciates

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:07.600
that he deploys to the linux environment server side he appreciates you know the the niceties

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.480
of linux desktop but he also has certain things he needs for windows a lot of people embedded

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.480
in you know larger enterprises they they're hooked on outlook or compatibility with other

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:17.720
issues uh and again i'm sure we wouldn't say like hey you know you could probably just

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:23.480
virtualize that but uh he explored running i3 natively well semi-natively i guess but

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.720
natively through windows uh he uses i'd seen people you know i've played a little bit with

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.720
the bash shell i know you've played a little bit but i've not played at all with getting

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:37.740
x11 stuff working uh so he uses moba x term and he he was able to set up the the settings

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:42.080
right uh to have the you know have the x server exported right he configures the ubuntu bash

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:47.920
setup he runs i3 and he gets it running i i don't know i'm i really want to try it out

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:51.520
i don't think it would be the solution for me but i can think of a few devs i know that

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.080
you know they they're more comfortable windows or windows what there's default are they're

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.280
playing games i don't know how i feel about it but it's interesting how far we can go

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.960
to really have like a mini non-virtualized linux world i think we're definitely making

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.640
progress and i think that we're going in a very good direction and the exciting thing

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.120
about some of this stuff is i don't think any of us would organically trust microsoft's

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:18.000
motives but i think where i get super encouraged and super giddy and super happy is microsoft

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:24.760
voluntarily or involuntarily is losing control over a large aspect of this for example they

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:30.940
can choose to implement bash they don't really have a ton of control after that the developers

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:35.720
are going to expect the same environment system inside of bash on windows as they would as

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:41.880
on bash on side of abuntu and as has been exemplified numerous times if that isn't the

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:47.120
case they'll simply log into a vps and do all the work in the vps and it makes it less

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:52.560
valuable go ahead dar but there could be a reversal because what matters is who sets

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:58.280
the expectation and who has the most users that's the trend right microsoft had i'm

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:03.200
not trying to doom the vision i just said that they will transition i'm just trying

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:08.380
to be transparent here microsoft originally was a company that provided software for other

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.960
operating systems they became platform because their apps were the most adopted in those

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.680
systems and they developed an ecosystem that supported development and how do you arrive

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:22.480
at that microsoft started basically from the get-go as an operating system company i mean

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:27.480
that they're they they competed at the fundamental level by they provided an operating system

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:32.080
to ibm who didn't have a way to function their computers and so when you so when they had

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.800
software software that ran and had to run on their operating system and that was like

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:43.560
that from day one yes and no because one of the the biggest department of microsoft that

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:48.200
made money was on the one that was selling to apple they were developing software to

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:54.880
apple but but what developers look at is how they can where are the people that are creating

01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:00.120
things that users want and they can make money that's why people moved gradually to microsoft

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:03.920
it's not it's not because apple stopped being a good platform because they saw that this

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:09.640
company not only was able to develop software had an entire developer friendly ecosystem

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:16.000
something i've criticized uh our our ecosystem a lot for not having which is you go to developers

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:23.240
to uh to mdn on microsoft you go to developers.apple.com we barely have something similar provides

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.440
a tool chain that you can know this is how you develop for ubuntu this is only now we're

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:36.640
looking at it yeah the quickest we have that the better and easier to fix but they become

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:42.220
a company that provides these awesome tools and demonstrates by building tools themselves

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:46.820
acquiring tools themselves now they become attractive the days that standard again the

01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:50.800
day that snap uh we were going to do snap i mentioned to a couple different developers

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:54.580
you might have even been in the room when i had this discussion there was instant throwback

01:20:54.580 --> 01:21:00.000
to or instant pushback and i'm hearing well i don't i don't think this is a good way to

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.400
go about a prescribed tool chain because the great thing about linux is that every distro

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:08.160
has its own way of getting packages in and that that enables us to have much more flexible

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:13.440
and much more distro aware developers and they're going to dumb all of the software

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:16.720
down to not take advantage of the environment of all of the environment variables because

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:21.480
they have to go with the lowest common denominator and i i guess what i'm i guess what i'm getting

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:26.640
at is that yes this is yes universal apps are a great thing yes we don't have some of

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:33.240
the stuff that that is at its core functionality microsoft windows and mac os x but at the

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:37.960
same time there are a lot of people and the primary users of that operating system that

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:43.200
i think really like those differences and it to some degree this whole universal app

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:51.240
thing is a problem is a is a is a answer to a problem that that only really new people

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:55.160
to linux really have an issue with i have not had an issue of having to get software

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.800
for my computer in a very long time chris has not had an issue having being able to

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:03.440
get software in his computer for a very long time now him and i struggle with different

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:08.360
aspects of that he that is true why so he is going to have so it is a there's a two

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:13.160
it's a two-sided coin though on my side of the coin yes i have to go to a ppa and

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:17.600
yes sometimes the software packages are are slightly less up-to-date but there are hoops

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.640
but on his side of the coin he can download the latest version of teamviewer but it might

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:25.720
not run and he can download the latest version of lightworks and it may not run and so the

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:32.240
he's got the he has the software availability but because of the the dynamic nature he can't

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.360
necessarily guarantee that every piece of software works unless of course we're talking

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.400
about you know gnu open source you know all that so if we're the standard yeah right well

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:47.080
okay the standard for somebody who is only using open source apps yes yes true but you

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:51.440
back away from that and you say well the the standard in the it industry for remote controlling

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:54.640
somebody's desktop what piece of software can i be almost guaranteed that they're going

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:58.080
to have on their computer that i could log into well teamviewer is a pretty good chance

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.180
that that's going to happen and we don't use that for work i have a i have a different

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:04.720
program and that if we weren't doing it if we weren't going to use it talk about it on

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:10.240
sunday i would talk about it here but totally yeah but but we use it all the time i use

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:15.120
it all the time for personal things where somebody calls in and says hey you know grandma's

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:18.240
computer doesn't work my mother's computer doesn't work you know those things are excellent

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:25.600
examples of where teamviewer works but you know all the coming full circle i think that

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.200
i think that you know that that uh i don't know i we'll just leave it there we'll leave

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:35.280
it there that i i think that there there are are different advantages of how you can get

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:41.640
that software and how you get that stuff to work on so uh anyway uh wes it doesn't work

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:46.160
on linux at all and then you're screwed right yeah well that's for example someone who wants

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:51.880
to get for like as someone who needs something for their jobs and it doesn't work on linux

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:55.380
at all and they have to go to this workaround of like using a virtual machine or something

01:23:55.380 --> 01:24:03.480
like that so this the solution is more importantly to bringing in things that companies and developers

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:09.800
don't want to mess with this ecosystem that is incredibly convoluted but if someone who's

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:14.480
already in the ecosystem yeah it doesn't feel that convoluted except for when you look find

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.160
an application you're like cool they release it as a deb but i use fedora so i use rpms

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:23.260
i can't use this deb but they don't make anything other than a deb but what about someone who

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:30.080
uses debian and they provide provided a deb for specifically ubuntu like there is so many

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:36.000
reasons why this is our current ecosystem is not a good idea like as far as the core

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.400
the core operating system it's fantastic but the application layer no yeah so right you're

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:47.440
saying we should all standardize on snaps running on gnu slash k windows i don't yeah

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:54.000
maybe i don't care really i i want the standard application layer i don't care what the distro

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.240
decides as the core fundamental format they want to use but i do care that i can have

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:04.560
an application that will actually run on my system and that or as a developer that i can

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:09.760
release an app that i don't have to release four apps for the same distribution based

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:17.200
on the different versions of that distribution or that the fact that i have to release uh

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:23.960
technically 20 packages just to support linux as a whole like that's absurd and if i could

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:29.400
just if i could release a flat pack a snap and an app image and that's it i would be

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:34.560
happy to do that that is at least 10 times better than what it is right now or the more

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:38.920
important thing is when they get the developer they get the packages from a repo that the

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:46.000
maintainer decides i'll update it in a year i'll put out that uh let's just have the crazy

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.080
idea what about you treat each distribution as their own operating system and give them

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:59.400
the goddamn freedom to innovate and be different as they wish yeah honestly honestly if people

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:05.440
didn't do different things we wouldn't have the diversity or the benefits we got some

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:10.840
things got adopted cross-wide they took their time fair enough we'll leave it there guys

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.280
i really appreciate you guys being here thanks so much it's been a lot of fun hanging out

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:18.760

see you right back here next week

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:39.040
so now if you try tiling uh there's no going back episode yeah here's the thing i gotta

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:44.600
talk kristen to it and i have i have like i've like sort of brought it up kind of in

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.900
like a passing sort of way and there's just like i can read people super super well it's

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:54.960
either a gift or curse i haven't decided what uh which yet but it's a gers i think so but

01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.400
the but the thing is like he i i can just tell it just it does not it does not tweak

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:06.720
him the same way it tweaks me right yeah i actually do tiling but not through a tiling

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.400
window miniature i just use i use tiling functionality oh yeah something that's pretty i will say

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.320
i do sometimes get away with like if i'm in cinnamon or something like it can at least

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.280
do the quadrants which will often be enough if not not all the time but sometimes it's

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:37.640
enough
