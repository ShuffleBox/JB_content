WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.760
What do you use for flashing ISOs?

00:02.760 --> 00:04.240
I'm all in on Etcher now.

00:04.240 --> 00:05.000
Yeah, me too.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.040
I'm just using Etcher right now to burn Fedora 31.

00:08.040 --> 00:10.400
And even old Westpane here is all in on Etcher.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.240
Yeah, I usually use Etcher, except for the occasional times

00:12.240 --> 00:14.000
if there's something weird.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
We did have an issue with the 1910 ISO, like one time.

00:17.000 --> 00:17.840
It was pop, I think.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.040
It was the pop ISO.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.560
Pop 1910 ISO.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.120
Etcher was just like, no, no, thanks.

00:22.120 --> 00:22.960
I don't know why.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.180
DD Rescue worked fine, though.

00:24.180 --> 00:25.720
Yeah, I kind of feel betrayed that you guys

00:25.720 --> 00:26.760
don't DD everything, man.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.120
Come on.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.040
I used to.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.080
I used to be the guy that was always like, just use DD.

00:31.080 --> 00:31.800
It's built in.

00:31.800 --> 00:32.400
Yeah.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.640
I like seeing the transfer rate, the progress bar.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.360
And I like just a little bit extra double check

00:38.360 --> 00:41.160
that I'm selecting the right media, because that one time,

00:41.160 --> 00:42.480
I overwrote the wrong thing.

00:42.480 --> 00:42.920
You know what I mean?

00:42.920 --> 00:44.920
Yeah, I mean, you're going to have to choose right.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.040
Otherwise, you might have to go run an LS bulk, right?

00:48.040 --> 00:50.160
Go run, look for what drive you want.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.920
You might as well choose it from a dropdown.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.240
Yeah, exactly.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.160
See, I've just been piping DD through PV, which

00:56.160 --> 00:58.640
gives you the progress bar and stuff, which is quite nice.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.200
Ha, I knew somebody would say it.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.240
Am I the only one who uses gnome disks?

01:03.240 --> 01:04.200
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.880
I actually just got into the habit of using Etcher,

01:06.880 --> 01:10.560
I think, before gnome disks added that, maybe?

01:10.560 --> 01:12.320
I say that, but I'm not so sure.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.200
Gnome disk is really nice, too, because you can also

01:15.200 --> 01:17.720
benchmark your disk right within the app.

01:17.720 --> 01:18.440
Right.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.560
Yeah, that's the other thing we don't talk about very much.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.280
What are you looking at?

01:21.280 --> 01:21.840
You looking at it?

01:21.840 --> 01:23.440
I just don't run up gnome disks.

01:23.440 --> 01:24.840
How does the imaging thing look?

01:24.840 --> 01:25.800
I don't know.

01:25.800 --> 01:26.600
Let's see.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.160
Does it look better than Etcher?

01:28.160 --> 01:30.400
I don't actually know how to do it.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.400
The three dots in the top right of the disk should be.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.920
Yeah, select the drive, go to the three button menu,

01:36.920 --> 01:38.960
and do Restore Disk Image.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.320
Aha, there you go.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.520
It's very macOS.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.840
OK, not bad, not bad.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.160
Choose an image to restore, go browse for it.

01:45.160 --> 01:45.880
It's built in.

01:45.880 --> 01:46.380
Yeah.

01:46.380 --> 01:47.480
So there you go.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.320
If you need something that's going

01:48.320 --> 01:50.400
to show you the layout of the disk anyway, I mean,

01:50.400 --> 01:50.960
there you go.

01:50.960 --> 01:51.760
That's nice.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.840
If that's not a strong Westpain endorsement,

01:53.840 --> 01:56.240
I don't know what is.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.160
Put that on the box.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:58.640 --> 02:10.240
Hello, friends, and welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 325.

02:10.240 --> 02:10.920
My name is Chris.

02:10.920 --> 02:11.600
My name is Wes.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.240
Hello, Wes.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.160
Hello.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.800
We have so much show today that we've

02:14.800 --> 02:17.200
been referring to the show notes as a novel.

02:17.200 --> 02:22.280
It's packed full of news and our first take

02:22.280 --> 02:25.800
on Fedora 31, which lands today as we record.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.560
Don't worry, there are some romantic subplots, though.

02:28.560 --> 02:29.080
That's right.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.640
There are a few twists and turns.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.680
We'll get you binging in no time.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.320
And to help us get through all of this is our crew.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.480
Hello to Alex, Drew, and Cheesy.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.200
Hello, guys.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.520
Hello, internet.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.720
Hello, a panel that's going to help us get through today's

02:43.720 --> 02:47.760
show, and then, of course, our secret sauce, our community,

02:47.760 --> 02:48.840
our virtual lug.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.560
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.060
Hello.

02:51.060 --> 02:51.560
Hello.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.680
Hello.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.240
Look at that.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.200
It's nice to have everyone in there.

02:55.200 --> 02:55.880
Really nice.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.740
So I thought we'd start with something

02:57.740 --> 03:00.240
we don't do too often, but maybe should do a little more of now

03:00.240 --> 03:01.200
that I think about it.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.080
And that's a little bit of follow-up.

03:03.080 --> 03:07.000
Sirzlol on Twitter said, hey, Chris, quick question.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.740
What's the device you've been using for your external GPU

03:09.740 --> 03:10.880
on your laptop?

03:10.880 --> 03:12.240
Is it a breakaway box?

03:12.240 --> 03:14.100
Is it some sort of PCI pass-through?

03:14.100 --> 03:14.940
How does it connect?

03:14.940 --> 03:16.160
What's the deals?

03:16.160 --> 03:18.640
And I realized I hadn't really talked about my eGPU much.

03:18.640 --> 03:22.320
We did an episode on it, I don't know, ages ago.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.200
I'm pretty sure it was 17 years.

03:24.200 --> 03:24.760
Sounds right.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.440
Does that sound right to you?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.000
I think that was 17 years ago.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.680
And I then kind of changed the way I'm using it

03:31.680 --> 03:33.120
and never really followed up.

03:33.120 --> 03:33.640
Yeah, right.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.520
I mean, last time we talked, you were doing the whole pass-through

03:36.520 --> 03:39.800
thing, like a dedicated gaming VM that you would set aside

03:39.800 --> 03:42.720
your fancy chip and then pass it through there.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.520
Yeah.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.820
That's not what you're doing now.

03:44.820 --> 03:45.940
No, that was a lot of work.

03:45.940 --> 03:48.120
I mean, that was amazing, because I could have like.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.660
It sounded like it worked very well.

03:49.660 --> 03:53.920
I had the Ubuntu setup that had all the games installed in one VM.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.840
I would just move it around.

03:55.840 --> 03:59.240
But truth be told, I wanted something

03:59.240 --> 04:00.600
that was a little simpler.

04:00.600 --> 04:01.120
You're lazy.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.000
And a little faster.

04:02.000 --> 04:02.960
And a little easier.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.440
Yeah.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.200
So it turns out it's stupid easy just

04:07.200 --> 04:11.000
to run another application on an external GPU

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
and still have it render on your main screen.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
So you can just have the two GPUs right there

04:15.000 --> 04:15.800
in the host system.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.920
You don't have to virtualize at all.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.540
I didn't really appreciate how simple this would be to pull off.

04:20.540 --> 04:24.440
But what works on my system is I've got my T480.

04:24.440 --> 04:28.840
It has Thunderbolt 3, which is a USB-C style connector.

04:28.840 --> 04:33.120
That goes into what I got is a Mantis Venus.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.200
A Mantis Venus?

04:35.200 --> 04:37.700
I'll put a link in the show notes so you can just get the.

04:37.700 --> 04:40.340
It's a nicer, bigger eGPU box.

04:40.340 --> 04:43.080
But it also has USB.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.800
It has a slot for an SSD.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.080
Like it's a larger box that I use for other things.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.320
But they have different sizes.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.040
Some that have GPUs pre-built in.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.360
Some where you can put your own GPU in and maybe

04:53.360 --> 04:54.560
replace it once a year.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.640
So a well-established market here.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.160
And really, it's compatible with any PCI Express

04:59.160 --> 05:01.160
GPU that fits in the box.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.680
So you could get years of upgrading your GPU out

05:03.680 --> 05:05.880
of this thing and moving it between any system that's

05:05.880 --> 05:07.080
Thunderbolt 3.

05:07.080 --> 05:11.320
So the way it works is when you plug in a second GPU to Linux,

05:11.320 --> 05:14.880
it just registers as another PCI device on the system.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.960
Zero is your default GPU, and one is the second GPU.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.040
And you can pass an environment variable

05:21.040 --> 05:23.680
to an application that just says,

05:23.680 --> 05:27.320
use the second GPU in the system.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.440
And in the case of Steam, if you were

05:29.440 --> 05:33.040
to pass that environment variable and launch Steam,

05:33.040 --> 05:35.760
every sub-process that Steam executes also

05:35.760 --> 05:38.320
executes on that second GPU.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.520
So that's exactly what I do.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.080
So you've just done.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.440
I mean, you launch Steam and then play games.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.000
I launch Steam on that second GPU, and I play my games.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.240
Proton doesn't matter.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.080
Doesn't matter if they're Windows games or native Linux

05:47.080 --> 05:47.860
games.

05:47.860 --> 05:50.520
And they all just render on that GPU.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.720
But thanks to the great development

05:52.720 --> 05:54.400
of all of this lower-level technology,

05:54.400 --> 05:55.840
they still work on my main screen.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.160
I don't have to have a monitor hooked up to that GPU.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.080
That's so cool.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.480
It's so cool.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.400
So I have a nice, portable, high-battery-life laptop

06:03.400 --> 06:06.800
until I sit down and plug in this eGPU, which also provides

06:06.800 --> 06:08.960
my magic enhancement box.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.080
It's like a booster.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.360
It's like an upgrade.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.760
I'm like Bane sucking up the juice.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.600
And the thing is, it's also providing power,

06:15.600 --> 06:17.480
so it's one cable.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.280
One cable.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.480
And I get all of this.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.600
Yeah.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.480
And so I passed all of this over Twitter to Sirzlul

06:24.480 --> 06:26.240
over the last week.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.360
He said he got one, and he's freaking loving it.

06:28.360 --> 06:28.860
Oh, nice.

06:28.860 --> 06:30.240
And what I want to be clear about

06:30.240 --> 06:31.920
is, I went all crazy with the PCI

06:31.920 --> 06:34.920
pass-through and setting up a VM and having a dedicated

06:34.920 --> 06:36.380
keyboard, monitor, and mouse.

06:36.380 --> 06:37.800
I thought that was the way I wanted to go.

06:37.800 --> 06:38.640
This is way better.

06:38.640 --> 06:42.600
It's so much simpler just to say, run on GPU 1,

06:42.600 --> 06:45.200
execute the application, and then just.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.120
Otherwise, I admit it just sits there idle.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.840
Nothing's using that GPU unless I

06:48.840 --> 06:50.200
pass that environment variable.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.960
But that's a trade-off I'm fine with.

06:51.960 --> 06:55.800
Use the Intel GPU for my Wayland session, my Gnome shell,

06:55.800 --> 06:58.480
all of those local applications that I'm using, like my browser.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.840
Use the Intel GPU for that.

06:59.840 --> 07:00.520
It just works.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.160
Yeah.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.720
So if you've been thinking about it,

07:02.720 --> 07:05.960
if you've got a box that's got Thunderbolt 3,

07:05.960 --> 07:07.880
and you've looked at these eGPUs,

07:07.880 --> 07:09.800
I'm here to tell you that Linux is actually

07:09.800 --> 07:11.040
easier to use than you expect.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.040
Because it gets a little trickier

07:13.040 --> 07:15.680
if you've got to load the Nvidia binary driver.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.320
But you should have known that going in.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.800
There's always that caveat.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.340
But if you're just using stuff that's built into the kernel,

07:21.340 --> 07:24.400
like the AMD driver, super easy.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.640
But it is totally doable with the Nvidia, too.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.720
I've done it with the Nvidia graphics card as well.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.600
So whichever your preference, it will work.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.200
And it's much, much simpler.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.320
And also, just a little shout out to Ubuntu Mate,

07:36.320 --> 07:38.280
which makes this even easier because it

07:38.280 --> 07:41.320
wraps graphical commands and menu items around.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.560
Of course.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.760
I'm always thinking of stuff like that.

07:44.760 --> 07:48.040
So I'm just thrilled with the setup, thrilled with it.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.440
So if you have been on the fence and want

07:50.440 --> 07:53.080
to add a little bit of oomph to your Linux box

07:53.080 --> 07:57.760
without having to buy a dedicated gaming machine.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.080
Yeah, that's expensive.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.640
And also, it's such a trade-off.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.960
Because I considered it recently.

08:02.960 --> 08:03.760
It's heavier.

08:03.760 --> 08:04.960
It gets worse battery.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.720
It runs hotter all the time.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.360
It doesn't fit on the airplane tray.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.480
There's all these downsides.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.200
Plus, it takes up more room in my bag.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.800
I'm already fond of the ThinkPad.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.120
And I only want a game, like, I mean, realistically,

08:16.120 --> 08:18.160
twice a month, maybe.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.360
And so that's why this is nice.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.840
Because I can keep buying the cheaper laptops

08:21.840 --> 08:23.840
with the sole requirement they have Thunderbolt

08:23.840 --> 08:25.480
and just move this between them.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.720
So anyway, Serzlul, I'm glad to hear it's working out for you.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.800
And I encourage others out there to give it a go.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.400
I wonder if Lenovo will ever consider doing something

08:33.400 --> 08:34.680
like that with a dock.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.840
Dude, I have one.

08:35.840 --> 08:39.240
I have a Lenovo GPU dock that has an Nvidia graphics card

08:39.240 --> 08:40.680
in it.

08:40.680 --> 08:41.760
I don't like it as much.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.000
It's a little underwhelming.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.080
Oh, OK.

08:44.080 --> 08:44.800
Yeah.

08:44.800 --> 08:48.000
The bigger boxes, as you would expect, cool better.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.920
Right, of course.

08:48.920 --> 08:52.040
The smaller little, like, put it all in one really small

08:52.040 --> 08:53.840
Thunderbolt dock, it's a great idea,

08:53.840 --> 08:56.640
especially if you don't have a lot of gaming use,

08:56.640 --> 08:58.800
but you just want GPU for some reason.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.440
It's great.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.520
But if you start pushing it really hard, it overheats.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.200
And it throttles.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.960
And then it eventually locks up your system.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.640
And then you got a hard reboot.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.480
That's just a bad experience.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.840
Yeah, it's a bad experience.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.940
So I do like the slightly bigger boxes.

09:11.940 --> 09:14.640
I find using AMD graphics to be simpler,

09:14.640 --> 09:16.560
although it's totally doable with Nvidia, too.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.640
I just find it simpler with AMD.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.040
Yeah.

09:20.040 --> 09:20.960
There's your follow up.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.560
Oh, I like it.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.400
We did it, Wes.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.280
OK, you've probably pushed me over the line here,

09:24.280 --> 09:26.920
because I've got a box that I don't use that much,

09:26.920 --> 09:29.040
because it's a separate machine with an older graphics card.

09:29.040 --> 09:29.920
Not too old to knit in.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.640
You've got one sitting in front of you, too.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.480
You could hook it up to that laptop right there.

09:33.480 --> 09:34.320
Perfect.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.800
You know, Steam sales come and go.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.240
You grab a few games.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.640
But you also, there's other things

09:38.640 --> 09:41.080
you do that could benefit from GPU acceleration.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.080
Indeed, that's true.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.760
You madman.

09:43.760 --> 09:47.180
Well, last week, Purism's former CTO

09:47.180 --> 09:51.480
made news in an exclusive interview with Feronix.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.600
Interview seemed pretty damning, but we

09:53.600 --> 09:55.360
chose to not really cover that story,

09:55.360 --> 09:58.080
because there's things like that that

09:58.080 --> 10:01.080
come and go when you're building something like this.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.620
But this week, a story did come up we decided to talk about.

10:03.620 --> 10:06.360
This week, the Librem 5 is making news,

10:06.360 --> 10:08.560
with an update on the Aspen batch.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.400
Listeners, you'll remember that they're shipping the Librem 5

10:11.400 --> 10:15.040
in batches, each batch iteratively getting better.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.960
And the coverage around the initial batch

10:17.960 --> 10:19.600
was super positive.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.600
It's out there.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.820
Ars Technica went to the web and wrote,

10:22.820 --> 10:26.720
the Librem 5 is becoming an actual real product.

10:26.720 --> 10:30.220
Headline, Librem 5 phone starts shipping a fully open GNU

10:30.220 --> 10:32.500
slash Linux phone.

10:32.500 --> 10:36.120
Well, that was not actually the case.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.880
Now that we are past the deadline for the Aspen batch,

10:38.880 --> 10:43.200
it turns out that only a few Purism employees

10:43.200 --> 10:46.000
ever received a phone or their board member.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.400
In fact, maybe only three or four phones exist in total.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.860
So now we're at a point where we need

10:51.860 --> 10:54.780
to sort through what Purism is claiming

10:54.780 --> 10:57.140
and what the community is observing.

10:57.140 --> 10:59.880
And they are getting further and further apart,

10:59.880 --> 11:02.160
so I needed somebody who's followed this closely.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.720
Jay, welcome to the show.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.400
And Jay, you've been a little obsessive about this topic,

11:06.400 --> 11:07.160
haven't you?

11:07.160 --> 11:07.960
I have.

11:07.960 --> 11:13.480
I had pretty high hopes for this device, and I still do, honestly.

11:13.480 --> 11:17.800
It's hard to find the signal through all the noise that's

11:17.800 --> 11:19.080
coming out of Purism.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.920
You and I are both Purism customers.

11:21.920 --> 11:26.720
I was a backer of the Librem 15, and you, until just recently,

11:26.720 --> 11:28.240
were a backer of the Librem 5.

11:28.240 --> 11:28.960
Yeah.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.000
And I also have a Librem M15.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.760
That's very hard to say for some reason,

11:33.760 --> 11:36.480
but I have one of their laptops now.

11:36.480 --> 11:40.720
Yeah, so we're both current Librem laptop users.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.180
And I think both of us are on the same page

11:43.180 --> 11:46.280
when I say we would love to see this be successful.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.860
Even still, the Librem 5 would love to see this be successful.

11:50.860 --> 11:52.320
That doesn't necessarily mean there

11:52.320 --> 11:54.240
aren't things that raise concerns.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.640
Oh, yeah, definitely.

11:55.640 --> 11:58.320
So I've been following this, but not as closely as you have.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.000
So I wanted to bring you on to kind of go

12:00.000 --> 12:01.920
through some of this.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.560
So you walk us through what seems

12:03.560 --> 12:06.680
to be the root cause of the most latest delay of the Librem 5.

12:06.680 --> 12:11.400
Well, I've been gifted with some information

12:11.400 --> 12:13.400
from informed people.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.440
And according to these people I've been talking to,

12:17.440 --> 12:21.720
ex-employees to be clear, they've pretty much told me

12:21.720 --> 12:25.960
that Purism really is having a lot of trouble

12:25.960 --> 12:28.820
wrapping their arms around this whole manufacturing thing

12:28.820 --> 12:31.320
and the designing of the hardware and whatnot.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.600
I mean, Purism, when it came to the laptops,

12:33.600 --> 12:36.200
they outsourced a huge amount of that work.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.960
And they did some really great work

12:37.960 --> 12:40.680
in terms of the software with the Intel management

12:40.680 --> 12:42.840
engine and core boot and all that.

12:42.840 --> 12:46.180
But most of those laptops, I think, I want to say,

12:46.180 --> 12:48.720
I heard somewhere that they're really just an Acer laptop

12:48.720 --> 12:49.280
shell.

12:49.280 --> 12:54.040
And they order it from somebody else in San Francisco.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.720
And those people are doing most of the heavy lifting.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.120
But with the phone, they didn't really have that option.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.840
So they had to kind of go to the mat and get into the nitty

13:01.840 --> 13:05.040
gritty where they weren't used to getting into before.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.880
And I think that they don't have a lot of experience

13:07.880 --> 13:09.360
with this kind of thing, especially

13:09.360 --> 13:12.000
when it comes to phones and cellular transmissions

13:12.000 --> 13:12.560
and things.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.220
And I think that's probably a huge amount of the root

13:15.220 --> 13:17.360
cause of a lot of the issues.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.160
It's getting harder to argue that point.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.640
I have taken a wait and see approach with this thing.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.200
I keep waiting for data points.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.360
But I do have to admit, every time something

13:29.360 --> 13:32.520
is missed that is somewhat kind of obvious to the community,

13:32.520 --> 13:36.160
or a deadline or a commitment is missed,

13:36.160 --> 13:38.760
or something that's said that doesn't seem quite right

13:38.760 --> 13:41.440
comes out, I kind of do ratchet up

13:41.440 --> 13:44.400
the old skepticism another small notch.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.540
And so it's now a few notches in at this point.

13:47.540 --> 13:50.140
And my wait and see approach is still holding.

13:50.140 --> 13:52.740
But the data points are starting to build a narrative that

13:52.740 --> 13:54.520
doesn't look good.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.240
And I'll tell you one that really kind of rattled me

13:57.240 --> 14:00.760
is I was giving them a much, much, much more benefit

14:00.760 --> 14:04.520
of the doubt kind of approach a few months ago.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.120
Oh, it was about a year ago, maybe,

14:06.120 --> 14:08.720
when the quote unquote final board pictures

14:08.720 --> 14:11.320
were starting to surface on Mastodon.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.760
And they were big.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.080
And they were like clearly developer boards.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.560
And so it seemed, to me, it's like,

14:18.560 --> 14:20.400
well, these are really rough at this point.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.360
But I was getting lots of messages from people

14:22.360 --> 14:24.760
on Telegram saying, hey, look at this, look at that.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.220
This is going to be a thermal issue.

14:26.220 --> 14:28.360
This is going to be an interference issue.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.600
And they were identifying stuff just

14:29.600 --> 14:31.900
by looking at these pictures with a board on the table.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.260
And I kind of just set all that aside,

14:34.260 --> 14:35.640
didn't really even bring it up on air,

14:35.640 --> 14:37.240
because benefit of the doubt appears.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.520
And they likely know what they're doing.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.640
They're testing this thing.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.840
They're working the firmware.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.880
They got this thing figured out.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.760
But then the Aspen batch was delayed.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.460
Only a handful of units ever were made.

14:48.460 --> 14:51.120
And they have thermal issues.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.280
Exactly like people said they would,

14:53.280 --> 14:56.200
in exactly the way people said they would.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.000
And purism's solution is even the solution

14:59.000 --> 15:00.880
people said they'd have to come up with, which

15:00.880 --> 15:03.120
is going to be super difficult.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.920
And now we're starting to see that again

15:04.920 --> 15:08.320
with their approach to solving the antenna issues.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.860
Because you have a bunch of individuals

15:10.860 --> 15:12.320
that are in the industry.

15:12.320 --> 15:17.120
And so they're following the Librem 5 as a bit of a hobby.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.960
This thing is fascinating to them, because they

15:18.960 --> 15:20.640
work with these components.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.200
They build the ATM machines and the IoT devices

15:23.200 --> 15:25.360
that use these parts.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.600
And so they're fascinated to see a company try

15:27.600 --> 15:28.680
to make a phone out of it.

15:28.680 --> 15:31.160
And they're very familiar with how all this stuff works.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.400
So people seem to be seeing some of these issues

15:33.400 --> 15:36.600
from thousands of miles away by just looking at the pictures.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.880
Yeah, and don't forget that they've

15:38.880 --> 15:41.640
got a number of other issues that are in play here

15:41.640 --> 15:43.480
from a hardware standpoint.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.640
So if you look at the latest videos

15:46.640 --> 15:48.600
that the Linux gamers put out, he's

15:48.600 --> 15:50.960
got three videos with Todd Weaver where they, you know,

15:50.960 --> 15:53.360
Todd came to his house, presumably in Maine.

15:53.360 --> 15:56.400
And he had two phones with him, and he let him play with it.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.960
And they tore it down, and they put it back together.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.800
Well, as part of that video, he actually

16:00.800 --> 16:03.000
admits to a lot of the hardware deficiencies

16:03.000 --> 16:05.840
that they somewhat admitted to in the Supply and the Demand

16:05.840 --> 16:07.480
blog post that you referenced.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.280
And among those were, you know, the camera

16:09.280 --> 16:10.280
doesn't work right now.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.800
Bluetooth doesn't work.

16:11.800 --> 16:15.400
There's maybe a thermal throttling issue,

16:15.400 --> 16:16.640
but it's not that big a deal.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.520
And we're going to add a heat pipe.

16:18.520 --> 16:23.600
And he did actually mention the antennas there as well.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.200
The next version of the case would have

16:25.200 --> 16:27.240
the antennas built into it.

16:27.240 --> 16:30.160
And yeah, so there's a variety of these issues

16:30.160 --> 16:31.640
that just keep coming up.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.240
And then in addition to that, there's

16:33.240 --> 16:35.720
also in the public issues tracker,

16:35.720 --> 16:39.960
there are current open bugs regarding call audio issues.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.480
So there's an issue with call audio echo.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.040
Like when you speak into the phone,

16:45.040 --> 16:48.000
you can hear your own voice being pumped back to you.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.040
And then there's an issue with lag.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.440
And of course, some of this will be resolved over time.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.120
Oh, yeah.

16:54.120 --> 16:58.000
I think what it all comes down to is two core issues here.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.600
A lack of transparency around what the current hurdles are.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.360
Another example is, let's be really clear,

17:04.360 --> 17:09.040
like a matrix style clear on what blobs are required.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.480
Does the Wi-Fi require firmware?

17:10.480 --> 17:11.120
Does Bluetooth?

17:11.120 --> 17:12.080
Does the modem?

17:12.080 --> 17:13.160
What about booting?

17:13.160 --> 17:15.120
Do those all require binary blobs?

17:15.120 --> 17:17.400
I'd like to see a matrix of what works, what's free,

17:17.400 --> 17:18.240
what's open.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.440
Let's be really clear about those limitations.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.680
Let's be really clear about how well this thing's going

17:22.680 --> 17:24.600
to work as an actual phone.

17:24.600 --> 17:27.560
If I get in a car accident, can I call for help?

17:27.560 --> 17:29.640
I really need to know that.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.160
So there's a lack of transparency

17:31.160 --> 17:32.600
that just causes suspicion.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.760
That's core issue number one.

17:34.760 --> 17:38.560
And the second core issue that I am observing

17:38.560 --> 17:41.400
is that purism refers to some of these challenges

17:41.400 --> 17:44.680
in terms that seem to simplify them.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.440
Imminently solvable challenges is a direct quote

17:47.440 --> 17:49.400
from their recent blog post.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.960
And then electrical engineers and developers

17:51.960 --> 17:54.880
of other mobile platforms, they look at the problem.

17:54.880 --> 17:59.400
They go, that is a very, very unique challenge.

17:59.400 --> 18:03.240
To the antenna specifically, a lot of what I'm hearing

18:03.240 --> 18:06.480
is, well, that needed to be designed into the case

18:06.480 --> 18:07.720
when you designed your case.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.800
Like you had to have that figured out seven steps ago.

18:10.800 --> 18:14.440
Not something that you're just going to imminently solve.

18:14.440 --> 18:17.240
So some of these problems are much more challenging

18:17.240 --> 18:19.160
than they're making them appear on the surface.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.480
And that, again, goes back to the transparency,

18:21.480 --> 18:25.360
but also leads people to doubt their future statements.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.760
And then when these things play out

18:27.760 --> 18:30.000
to be true, like the CPU throttling issue,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.720
like the thermal issue, like the antenna issue,

18:32.720 --> 18:34.400
and it seems to have caught them by surprise

18:34.400 --> 18:36.880
and delayed the batch, you do wonder

18:36.880 --> 18:39.680
if perhaps they don't have a good grasp

18:39.680 --> 18:40.840
on the challenge of this.

18:40.840 --> 18:41.080
Right.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.680
That's kind of what it makes it feel like.

18:42.680 --> 18:43.440
I mean, no, it's OK.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.900
We know that they had to figure a lot of things out, right?

18:45.900 --> 18:48.120
That's part of the challenge here.

18:48.120 --> 18:51.640
But we're hearing about it in these overblown terms that

18:51.640 --> 18:53.080
don't seem to match with reality.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.840
And it's taken a long time to become clear

18:54.840 --> 18:56.720
about what actually is current.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.120
I think we can all accept that there's going to be blobs,

18:59.120 --> 19:00.620
but we need to know what they are so we

19:00.620 --> 19:02.880
can be real about the product.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.160
Well, I think part of the problem here is that,

19:05.160 --> 19:09.480
especially as I've heard from some of the people who

19:09.480 --> 19:11.560
were inside the company that I've been chatting with,

19:11.560 --> 19:13.560
is that there's a difference really

19:13.560 --> 19:18.200
between purism as a whole and then what the CEO does and says.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.160
I mean, if you start paying attention,

19:20.160 --> 19:22.600
you'll notice that the CEO is the one pushing out

19:22.600 --> 19:25.560
a lot of these updates and a lot of these posts.

19:25.560 --> 19:29.280
And as I understand it, there's a culture issue here

19:29.280 --> 19:32.440
in terms of when people come to him and they say, look,

19:32.440 --> 19:34.680
this may not be entirely accurate,

19:34.680 --> 19:37.880
he is not particularly receptive to that kind of feedback.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.600
Well, Jay, I want to share with you

19:39.600 --> 19:43.320
my motivations on why I've dug into this, how I found you,

19:43.320 --> 19:47.160
and all of that, because I think it's important for the audience

19:47.160 --> 19:48.460
to hear this.

19:48.460 --> 19:51.760
I really believe that the free software community

19:51.760 --> 19:55.160
is filled with optimists in a good way.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.160
I mean, why else would we be fighting for the things

19:58.160 --> 19:58.680
that we do?

19:58.680 --> 19:59.920
And we believe in this stuff.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.360
And I think that's really great, and I

20:01.360 --> 20:04.160
think it's really important that it stays that way.

20:04.160 --> 20:07.720
I think it leads to a very common, well,

20:07.720 --> 20:10.640
you've got to give them the benefit of the doubt syndrome.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.880
Yeah, you've got to give them the benefit of the doubt.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.480
What they're trying to do is real hard,

20:15.480 --> 20:17.560
and it's going to slip a little bit,

20:17.560 --> 20:19.300
but their intentions are super good,

20:19.300 --> 20:21.560
so you've got to give them the benefit of the doubt.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.320
No.

20:22.320 --> 20:27.440
Well, that is the very mindset that scammers can trade upon.

20:27.440 --> 20:32.200
You have to be skeptical, because the greater goal,

20:32.200 --> 20:36.440
the quote unquote movement, is more important.

20:36.440 --> 20:40.640
And if they ruin this, it will set humanity back.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.000
Yeah, I agree.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.600
I mean, I think from my perspective,

20:44.600 --> 20:47.840
the entire free and open source software movement,

20:47.840 --> 20:50.040
it's about freedom, transparency,

20:50.040 --> 20:51.840
and empowering users.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.200
And it's hard for me to get to a place

20:54.200 --> 20:57.920
mentally where I can see how a process that doesn't embody

20:57.920 --> 21:00.560
any of those standards and doesn't take on any

21:00.560 --> 21:03.240
of those principles can give us a device that's

21:03.240 --> 21:07.560
supposed to be the ultimate representation

21:07.560 --> 21:08.720
of those principles.

21:08.720 --> 21:09.440
Right.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.040
We don't need NeoApple.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.360
We need transparency.

21:13.360 --> 21:16.720
Well, Jay, you have three really thorough blog posts

21:16.720 --> 21:17.800
about this.

21:17.800 --> 21:22.520
Also, you follow this in other, you are, I should say,

21:22.520 --> 21:26.080
active in other outlets that discuss this,

21:26.080 --> 21:28.440
and you've really done some good observations.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.920
I know you've been speaking with folks at the company,

21:30.920 --> 21:34.040
and I just really appreciate that you've

21:34.040 --> 21:35.080
taken a balance for you.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.080
You're not hating on them.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.500
You and I both would love to see this thing be successful,

21:38.500 --> 21:41.040
because we both appreciate how important it is.

21:41.040 --> 21:45.680
But you're also staying skeptical.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.560
And I think you've done a good job of telling

21:47.560 --> 21:49.080
the more complete story than what

21:49.080 --> 21:51.600
we could touch on in a segment for this show.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.680
So I have a link to your blog, jaylittle.com,

21:54.680 --> 21:55.720
in the show notes.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.400
And just keep an eye on things.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.240
Maybe you and I can chat again in the future

21:59.240 --> 22:00.720
if something significant develops.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.600
Yeah, definitely.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.520
I'd like that.

22:02.520 --> 22:03.320
Thanks, Jay.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.160
Thanks.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.360
I'll try to put links to as many of the things

22:06.360 --> 22:10.160
as we talked about quickly mentioned in that chat

22:10.160 --> 22:12.160
in the show notes.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.160
And going back to the point of transparency,

22:14.160 --> 22:15.840
which I think is the key takeaway on this,

22:15.840 --> 22:17.600
I think it's such an opportunity for them

22:17.600 --> 22:22.080
to set the bar on this, to really lead the way.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.320
Purism, they talk about the Libra and Five

22:25.320 --> 22:30.840
as the beginning of an ethical movement.

22:30.840 --> 22:34.760
Movement is a big term, and I think they might be right.

22:34.760 --> 22:40.320
And so I think because that movement is so important,

22:40.320 --> 22:41.880
it's worth their time, even when they're

22:41.880 --> 22:46.240
busy solving antenna issues and trying to build something new,

22:46.240 --> 22:49.160
it's worth their time to be more transparent.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.080
Set up a nice matrix of what's a blob.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.000
Does the Wi-Fi require a blob?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.600
Does the Bluetooth?

22:56.600 --> 22:59.120
What about the modem?

22:59.120 --> 23:00.520
What's the boot environment like?

23:00.520 --> 23:01.760
I'd like to see a chart of that.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.760
Show it all to me right there in a post.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.320
Really lets me know what the limitations are of this thing.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.720
And that, I mean, at the same time

23:08.720 --> 23:11.720
helps us be able to get behind them,

23:11.720 --> 23:14.040
because we know just what's going on.

23:14.040 --> 23:16.760
And I just, I was speculating with Jay.

23:16.760 --> 23:20.760
I said, I wonder if really, if the right thing here wouldn't

23:20.760 --> 23:25.280
be for Purism to work with the PinePhone folks

23:25.280 --> 23:28.440
and come together on this thing in some way.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.200
I mean, it would mean putting aside

23:30.200 --> 23:33.040
creating the next big free product

23:33.040 --> 23:37.480
and instead focusing on the overall movement.

23:37.480 --> 23:40.280
But if you brought together the different talent sets,

23:40.280 --> 23:43.280
I mean, you'd really have something here.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.880
It's just something, I'd love to see

23:45.880 --> 23:47.640
addressed because I worry that we're slipping

23:47.640 --> 23:48.680
in the wrong direction on this.

23:48.680 --> 23:51.080
I mean, the goal is important, and we're getting caught up

23:51.080 --> 23:53.040
in the specifics right here.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.600
Yeah.

23:54.600 --> 23:58.000
And part of me kind of just wants them to go out and say,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.240
oh, it's way worse than we've been letting you know,

24:00.240 --> 24:02.000
and we need another million dollars.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.040
Will you fund us?

24:03.040 --> 24:05.720
And let the community just decide and say, yes.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.280
We'll step up.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.520
We'll do it, because it's that important.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.280
But we need transparency.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.480
Something has to change.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.920
A lot of people have a lot of hopes on that device.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.160
We'll keep an eye on it.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.520
We tend to really cover it when something major changes,

24:19.520 --> 24:21.240
that the real landmark thing here

24:21.240 --> 24:23.440
was the end of the Aspen batch.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.280
Yeah, I mean, no, you just got to stay tuned,

24:25.280 --> 24:28.800
see how the additional batches go, and time will tell.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.240
Time tells all stories.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.160
That's been my recent thing, Wes.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.800
I've been thinking about that.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.720
A lot of times you get bits and pieces, but if you stick with it

24:36.720 --> 24:38.640
and you're patient enough, eventually time

24:38.640 --> 24:39.680
does tell all the stories.

24:39.680 --> 24:40.180
Indeed.

24:40.180 --> 24:44.520
Well, we got a super quick housekeeping.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.920
It's already clean in here.

24:45.920 --> 24:49.000
We should probably mention that we're

24:49.000 --> 24:50.480
going to be digging into software

24:50.480 --> 24:53.600
and setting up things in Fedora and all that kind of stuff.

24:53.600 --> 24:55.840
You should definitely check out the Choose Linux podcast.

24:55.840 --> 24:56.560
Do it.

24:56.560 --> 24:59.720
Drew, here's one of the three co-hosts of that there show.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.980
And he can probably tell you on some authority

25:01.980 --> 25:04.760
that software, Linux, and installations

25:04.760 --> 25:06.280
will be a topic on a future show.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.320
Huh?

25:07.320 --> 25:07.920
Yeah.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.840
Coming out Thursday, we're going to talk about Chaos Linux, which

25:11.840 --> 25:15.320
is sort of a KDE showcase.

25:15.320 --> 25:18.320
And on top of that, we're going to talk about Flatpaks

25:18.320 --> 25:20.840
and Snaps and all of it.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.720
Flatpaks and Snaps and App Images, oh, my.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.640
And what are the different experiences of them like,

25:25.640 --> 25:28.280
really, especially from different perspectives?

25:28.280 --> 25:32.720
I also want to give a shout out to Ubicon Europe, wrapped up,

25:32.720 --> 25:34.520
and now their YouTube channel is loaded up

25:34.520 --> 25:35.880
with some of their presentations,

25:35.880 --> 25:37.000
I think most of them.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.640
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes,

25:38.640 --> 25:40.960
or you can just go Google search Ubicon Europe.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.000
Yeah, got some good stuff, like applied security

25:43.000 --> 25:45.720
for containers, or public and open source.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.560
There's really a full range there, actually.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.320
Yeah, totally.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.040
It's actually pretty good.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.440
Including stuff like Ubuntu Wellness.

25:50.440 --> 25:51.200
What's that about?

25:51.200 --> 25:51.880
Yeah.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.340
And last but not least, I'll just

25:53.340 --> 25:55.680
mention, if you love our shows, be

25:55.680 --> 25:57.920
sure you check out the new Headlines podcast.

25:57.920 --> 26:01.040
This is, I think, this is us at our best now.

26:01.040 --> 26:02.000
Oh, yeah.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.500
So if you like what we do, I really

26:03.500 --> 26:06.000
encourage you to go check out the new Headlines show.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.840
Every weekday, Linux Headlines in three minutes or less.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.180
Wes did one today.

26:12.180 --> 26:13.320
I did one on Monday.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.280
We do kind of a handoff system.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.960
But what's even cooler about it is, behind the scenes,

26:17.960 --> 26:19.040
we've really staffed it out.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.880
We've got people that are dedicated to research.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.240
We do cross-checking.

26:23.240 --> 26:26.480
We all are very involved in the process.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.000
Not only is it a full team effort,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.520
but it's one that we've taken very seriously.

26:30.520 --> 26:33.560
And we've made it available for your Amazon LadyTube.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.760
That's right.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.520
I got to get it outside the US.

26:36.520 --> 26:37.480
I haven't done that yet.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.320
It's complicated.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.080
Their UI is horrible.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.320
It's just horrible, but it is on there.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.880
LinuxHeadlines.show, though, if you just want to go check it

26:44.880 --> 26:49.080
out, it's, I think, some of our best work.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.280
Three minutes or less.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.220
Fedora 31 lands today.

26:53.220 --> 26:58.760
It features Linux kernel 5.3, mason 9.2, GCC 9.21,

26:58.760 --> 27:05.240
GNOME 3.34, Perl 5.30, and probably most importantly,

27:05.240 --> 27:06.720
it doesn't see any Python 2.

27:06.720 --> 27:07.640
No.

27:07.640 --> 27:08.920
They removed it.

27:08.920 --> 27:09.640
It's gone now.

27:09.640 --> 27:10.400
Don't need it.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.640
Yeah, it actually does change things a little bit.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.140
I was doing some benchmarking that required Python 2 scripts,

27:15.140 --> 27:17.920
and I felt like an old man.

27:17.920 --> 27:21.680
Also, no root log on for you anymore

27:21.680 --> 27:22.960
if you're connecting over SSH.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.760
They've been disabled by default.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.360
And then brace yourself, kiddos, because these next two

27:27.360 --> 27:30.460
are the biggies.

27:30.460 --> 27:33.160
They've switched to cgroups version 2 by default.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.400
We'll come back to that.

27:34.400 --> 27:38.720
And they've removed the i6-86 repositories.

27:38.720 --> 27:42.120
And also, I think they're not even making bootable images.

27:42.120 --> 27:42.960
That's a big change.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.200
But let's talk about that cgroups thing,

27:44.200 --> 27:46.520
because cgroups, Wes, isn't that containers?

27:46.520 --> 27:49.100
And isn't everything using cgroups version 1?

27:49.100 --> 27:50.680
How can you just switch to version 2?

27:50.680 --> 27:52.560
Well, it depends on what container runtime

27:52.560 --> 27:53.880
you're using, of course.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.200
But for you, I know that's Docker.

27:56.200 --> 27:59.080
And the Docker binary you're going to run right now

27:59.080 --> 28:00.740
expects cgroups v1.

28:00.740 --> 28:02.560
So that's probably the biggest, uh-oh,

28:02.560 --> 28:04.060
why isn't this working sort of problem

28:04.060 --> 28:06.160
you're going to run into right off the bat.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.480
You just need to go add a kernel command line flag.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.560
It'll switch that off.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.720
You'll still get cgroups v1.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.080
They can coexist at the same time.

28:13.080 --> 28:13.580
Yeah.

28:13.580 --> 28:14.160
Then it works.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.920
Yeah, it's still possible to run version 1.

28:17.920 --> 28:21.280
Now, sometime this year, maybe next year,

28:21.280 --> 28:22.360
we should see Docker working.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.240
And other runtimes already support it.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.300
So if you're using Podman, away you go.

28:26.300 --> 28:30.920
Including cgroups v2 brings a better rootless container

28:30.920 --> 28:32.920
support, which integrates with the new API.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.600
That's just what I was going to ask you.

28:34.600 --> 28:35.200
So that's why.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.800
That's really the big thing you gain from this.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.760
It's just a cleanup of cgroups.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.240
I mean, cgroups were a new idea in the kernel community

28:42.240 --> 28:44.400
as we were exploring how to group and contain

28:44.400 --> 28:46.400
all these processes.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.680
Turns out you don't always get everything right

28:48.680 --> 28:49.400
the first time.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.640
So got to fix it up.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.440
It will be painful.

28:52.440 --> 28:56.280
But Fedora's doing what Fedora does best,

28:56.280 --> 28:58.200
and putting their toe in the water

28:58.200 --> 29:00.080
and saying, it's going to break some things,

29:00.080 --> 29:01.480
but we're making the switch.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.040
In fact, they almost kind of say exactly.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.440
That's the rationale on the wiki.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.080
Yeah, that's why they're doing it.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.880
Somebody's got to do it.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.040
No one's doing it.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.160
And this was cgroups version 2 was finalized years ago.

29:12.160 --> 29:13.240
So yeah, exactly.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.640
I mean, I think it's been non-experimental since 2015.

29:15.640 --> 29:17.520
And I think that is true to some extent, right?

29:17.520 --> 29:19.920
I mean, it does change when you're a legitimate Linux

29:19.920 --> 29:23.000
desktop user, and you can go file bugs on other projects

29:23.000 --> 29:25.200
saying, your project is broken for me now.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.080
Of course, they have a bunch of ARM support,

29:27.080 --> 29:30.240
but Raspberry Pi 4 I don't think landed officially.

29:30.240 --> 29:30.760
Darn.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.040
Not that I saw.

29:32.040 --> 29:32.880
But that's OK.

29:32.880 --> 29:33.840
That's all right.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.840
That's fine.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.240
We did have some fun, since we had just recently done

29:37.240 --> 29:40.360
some benchmarks on stock Ubuntu 19.10.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.560
We ran some benchmarks on stock Fedora 31.

29:42.560 --> 29:43.360
Just did a little comparing.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.640
I mean, once you've got the Ferronix tests,

29:44.640 --> 29:45.440
we'd install them.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.520
It's crazy.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.640
Nothing really all that interesting to report.

29:49.640 --> 29:53.400
Ubuntu is faster, I'd say, in the overall takeaway.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.960
But there are some areas where Fedora pulled ahead.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.560
Typical benchmark.

29:57.560 --> 29:58.600
If you're interested at all, though, we'll

29:58.600 --> 30:00.740
have a link in the show notes.

30:00.740 --> 30:03.840
Not all the benchmarks were fully ran on Fedora either,

30:03.840 --> 30:05.680
which is kind of a comment about running software

30:05.680 --> 30:08.800
on Fedora versus Ubuntu in a meta way.

30:08.800 --> 30:09.520
It's not so bad.

30:09.520 --> 30:10.800
I mean, it's really not.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.440
But like, OK, you're running some random script

30:13.440 --> 30:16.440
you found on the internet or from the readme of a GitHub

30:16.440 --> 30:17.080
page.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.000
They almost always have Ubuntu packages.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.960
You don't always get Fedora.

30:20.960 --> 30:26.160
Well, OK, so let's talk about setting up Fedora 31.

30:26.160 --> 30:29.680
I think a couple of years ago, maybe, maybe even a year ago,

30:29.680 --> 30:30.680
I don't know.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.600
I don't know.

30:32.600 --> 30:33.360
It's ish.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.640
Let's just say ish.

30:34.640 --> 30:38.840
It was good advice to say, wait a few days, maybe a week or two,

30:38.840 --> 30:40.920
before you upgrade to the next Fedora release.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.920
You go back a little bit further in time,

30:42.920 --> 30:45.260
the advice was wait maybe a month or two

30:45.260 --> 30:47.100
before you upgrade to the next Fedora release.

30:47.100 --> 30:49.160
That's legitimately how it went.

30:49.160 --> 30:51.240
Boy, has that changed.

30:51.240 --> 30:55.800
Now, I'm not advocating anybody do like Chris do or Wes

30:55.800 --> 30:58.200
or all of us on the show.

30:58.200 --> 31:01.800
But I upgraded to Fedora 31 yesterday,

31:01.800 --> 31:03.800
which was the day before release.

31:03.800 --> 31:08.160
Because a little birdie told me that the ISO is all finalized,

31:08.160 --> 31:09.160
everything's good to go.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.240
We're pretty much ready.

31:10.240 --> 31:11.320
Yeah.

31:11.320 --> 31:14.080
So I was having some problems.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.080
And I thought, well, I've been running Pop OS, liked it.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.440
But I had a little mouse laggy issue,

31:17.440 --> 31:18.440
just a little bit of mouse stutter.

31:18.440 --> 31:19.760
And it's like, eh.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.200
Yeah, we know you have a low tolerance for that.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.680
I have a low tolerance, I know.

31:22.680 --> 31:25.400
So I thought, let's put Fedora 31 on here.

31:25.400 --> 31:29.240
I also, because I like chaos, apparently,

31:29.240 --> 31:33.440
decided let's upgrade my Lenovo ThinkPad T480,

31:33.440 --> 31:37.080
which has been running like a fricking champ with Fedora

31:37.080 --> 31:41.880
30 on the road in day-to-day use every single day,

31:41.880 --> 31:43.120
every single night.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.560
This is kind of your golden boy.

31:44.560 --> 31:47.520
You've been just nothing but happy with this install.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.320
So I thought, why not scroll it up

31:49.320 --> 31:51.680
and let's upgrade to Fedora 31 the day before the release.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.280
What could go wrong?

31:54.280 --> 31:55.720
Turns out nothing.

31:55.720 --> 31:57.540
Yeah, nothing, nothing.

31:57.540 --> 32:00.600
I had to uninstall Crossover Office, unfortunately.

32:00.600 --> 32:04.560
And I had to uninstall, I think, Lavish, was it?

32:04.560 --> 32:05.360
Two packages.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.280
Yeah.

32:06.280 --> 32:07.160
Not much, though.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.280
It was kind of surprising.

32:08.280 --> 32:12.160
And the whole process sort of rekindled for us,

32:12.160 --> 32:15.040
I think, what we really like about Fedora.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.520
I went digging around in some of the scripts running

32:17.520 --> 32:19.320
behind the scenes to do the system upgrade

32:19.320 --> 32:21.640
and how that integrates with DNF.

32:21.640 --> 32:25.100
And Fedora's just so clean and modern.

32:25.100 --> 32:28.240
It's a fresh, well-put-together Linux machine.

32:28.240 --> 32:34.760
Oh, the peak experience for me, I did the little dash dash

32:34.760 --> 32:39.020
release equals 31 to change over to the new version.

32:39.020 --> 32:43.160
And the RPM Fusion folks thought of this ahead of time.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.880
And so it just automatically follows

32:45.880 --> 32:48.080
whatever you set that release version to.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.360
So the next time DNF did an update,

32:50.360 --> 32:53.540
I was just automatically getting the RPM Fusion 31 repos.

32:53.540 --> 32:55.680
And to their credit, those repos were already up

32:55.680 --> 32:56.560
and ready to go.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.120
Yeah.

32:57.120 --> 33:00.960
Same with a couple of copper repositories I was using.

33:00.960 --> 33:04.680
Already had their 31 copper repositories up.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.000
It's so easy, because then the rest of it

33:07.000 --> 33:08.800
is all covered with flat packs.

33:08.800 --> 33:09.360
Right.

33:09.360 --> 33:10.120
That doesn't really change.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.760
You just got to make sure you still have flat pack.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.440
They don't care.

33:12.440 --> 33:13.240
Yeah.

33:13.240 --> 33:18.440
And so I took a heavily modified dual desktop,

33:18.440 --> 33:22.480
because I had XSC on there, too, and Nome Show.

33:22.480 --> 33:26.560
Tons of crazy jack stuff we've done, my eGPU experiments,

33:26.560 --> 33:29.240
my PCI Passer experiments, all the things

33:29.240 --> 33:34.720
I've been doing to this machine since Fedora 30 came out.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.920
And it all just went up to 31 flawlessly.

33:36.920 --> 33:41.040
Even my WireGuard bolted on WireGuard support upgraded.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.880
It was a nice experience from the end user.

33:42.880 --> 33:45.400
Just watching you go through it, you kind of sat down,

33:45.400 --> 33:47.960
knowing that this might take a little while.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.400
And that transaction test that it

33:49.400 --> 33:51.720
does sort of gives you a little bit of peace of mind.

33:51.720 --> 33:52.200
Yes.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.520
Right.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.240
You're not just sort of going off into the wild here.

33:56.240 --> 33:59.200
There's some checks and boundaries.

33:59.200 --> 34:03.880
Now, all that said, I have had some problems,

34:03.880 --> 34:06.200
but not on my laptop.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.520
So I want to make this clear.

34:08.520 --> 34:12.000
This is unique, I think, to hardware setups.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.880
And I've been trying to track down

34:13.880 --> 34:15.760
some of these problems I've had, so much so

34:15.760 --> 34:18.720
that I've looped in Wendell and Michael Larabell trying

34:18.720 --> 34:20.480
to help me troubleshoot.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.240
You're desperate.

34:21.240 --> 34:22.080
I really am.

34:22.080 --> 34:25.640
Because the mouse leg issue that I was having on Pop OS

34:25.640 --> 34:29.720
on my main workstation got significantly worse

34:29.720 --> 34:31.840
when I went to Fedora 31.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.040
It got bad.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.920
I had mouse leg that sometimes would last 10 seconds,

34:35.920 --> 34:38.120
like where a mouse would just lock up for 10 seconds.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.040
Oh, just hard lock.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.460
There's other times where it's just you're using the system,

34:41.460 --> 34:44.240
and the mouse would just leg across the screen.

34:44.240 --> 34:48.000
So it would jump halfway across your screen.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.480
Have you considered just switching to i3?

34:52.480 --> 34:53.880
You son of a bitch.

34:57.880 --> 35:00.960
So I hard bailed on Wayland.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.880
Because I did a little digging, because actually, yes,

35:03.880 --> 35:07.840
I am thinking about going back to plasma.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.080
I did a little digging.

35:09.080 --> 35:12.800
And this is a problem that is getting worked at right now.

35:12.800 --> 35:15.920
There was a recent post by canonical employee Daniel

35:15.920 --> 35:17.360
Van Gogh.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.800
I don't know how to say his last name.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.000
It's not Van Gogh.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.360
Great guy, super sharp developer.

35:23.360 --> 35:25.880
And he writes in this post I'll have linked in the show notes,

35:25.880 --> 35:27.560
quote, the GNOME Shell and Mutter

35:27.560 --> 35:29.600
are single-threaded GLib event loop apps.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.640
So any pause could cause them to miss the next frame

35:32.640 --> 35:34.080
and exhibit stuttering.

35:34.080 --> 35:38.240
Some common pauses are for disk I.O. or GPU I.O.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.560
But the miscalculating when to render the next frame

35:40.560 --> 35:42.560
has also been an issue in GNOME Shell.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.920
Here's the fun thing.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.920
This, way worse on Wayland because of the architecture

35:47.920 --> 35:49.480
of GNOME Shell.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.200
And Chrome's a real son of a bitch

35:52.200 --> 35:54.720
because it's using GPU acceleration,

35:54.720 --> 35:58.600
so it's causing GPU I.O. And it's caching to your disk,

35:58.600 --> 36:03.760
so it's causing disk I.O. So it is the perfect storm of events

36:03.760 --> 36:06.080
that cause GNOME Shell to lock up.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.880
So I thought, I'll go to Firefox.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.120
Worse in Firefox.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.680
Worse.

36:11.680 --> 36:13.440
Significantly worse.

36:13.440 --> 36:14.920
Unusable.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.320
Can't select menu items at times.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.760
Not all the time.

36:18.760 --> 36:22.160
About three or four or five times an hour.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.720
So it's just enough that you sort of put your guard down.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.200
And then all of a sudden, boom, you're

36:26.200 --> 36:27.960
hit with this horrible mouse leak.

36:27.960 --> 36:32.240
It's better on X. It's like 95% better on X.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.000
Workable.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.520
Every now and then I get some leggy legs.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.880
But it's not that bad.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.040
It's nothing.

36:38.040 --> 36:40.920
It's just it really stinks because, first of all,

36:40.920 --> 36:45.400
the graphics card is an AMD RX 570.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.640
It's got 64 gigabytes of RAM.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.680
It's got six physical cores, 12 threads.

36:50.680 --> 36:53.000
The main root OS is on MV and E drive.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.760
My home is on a fast Intel SSD.

36:55.760 --> 36:59.240
My games, my Steam games, are on a separate Intel SSD.

36:59.240 --> 37:03.160
And all of my scratch work is on a RAID 0 of spinning rust.

37:03.160 --> 37:06.120
All of this is on separate controllers.

37:06.120 --> 37:09.760
Like, I have built this system to optimize disk I.O.

37:09.760 --> 37:13.480
and performance when I'm doing lots of transactions

37:13.480 --> 37:15.120
or encoding or whatever it is.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.760
That's what this system's designed for.

37:16.760 --> 37:21.680
And I'm getting a significantly smoother, better experience

37:21.680 --> 37:27.440
on my T480 because it's single screen Intel graphics.

37:27.440 --> 37:30.280
And I really think that my screen setup continues

37:30.280 --> 37:34.660
to influence this because I've got three 2K monitors, two

37:34.660 --> 37:36.400
of which are vertical, one is horizontal.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.280
It just had to be different, didn't you?

37:38.280 --> 37:41.400
And reading through the bug reports

37:41.400 --> 37:43.760
about these stuttery mouse issues, first of all,

37:43.760 --> 37:46.120
it could be caused by a million different combination

37:46.120 --> 37:48.080
of things.

37:48.080 --> 37:51.080
But the other thing is, it does get exponentially worse

37:51.080 --> 37:54.920
when you have extra monitors because of how

37:54.920 --> 37:58.200
the whole stack works.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.720
It has been really frustrating.

38:00.720 --> 38:03.540
Additionally, I got a new sound problem

38:03.540 --> 38:05.120
that I've never experienced before.

38:05.120 --> 38:05.640
Oh, no, really?

38:05.640 --> 38:07.360
Yes.

38:07.360 --> 38:10.680
This is both a good and bad.

38:10.680 --> 38:15.360
The bad is, say I watch a YouTube video in a browser.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.320
Video ends, and I choose not to listen to anything else.

38:19.320 --> 38:22.920
Five, 10 seconds go by, maybe 15 seconds,

38:22.920 --> 38:27.200
and I hear this audible click in my speakers.

38:27.200 --> 38:30.380
If you've ever had an optical audio connection

38:30.380 --> 38:32.080
and it goes to sleep after some inactivity,

38:32.080 --> 38:33.080
it sounds just like this.

38:33.080 --> 38:36.880
Only this is a standard, regular old audio cable.

38:36.880 --> 38:42.800
Once it goes to sleep, my speakers buzz,

38:42.800 --> 38:44.640
and I have a pretty big subwoofer,

38:44.640 --> 38:49.680
so it's whoo, which is crazy distracting.

38:49.680 --> 38:53.800
So between the mouse leg and the buzz, I'm going nuts.

38:53.800 --> 38:58.440
However, the positive side is, unlike Pop and Ubuntu,

38:58.440 --> 39:00.160
which were constantly defaulting,

39:00.160 --> 39:03.020
even after I change it to my monitor's built-in speaker,

39:03.020 --> 39:06.040
which sucks, this is actually remembering my speaker

39:06.040 --> 39:07.440
selection.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.680
Yeah.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.520
You've just got to always be playing background music,

39:10.520 --> 39:11.520
and then you'll be fine.

39:11.520 --> 39:14.040
The funny thing about Fedora 31 is

39:14.040 --> 39:18.120
it's positioning for just this total changeout of the audio

39:18.120 --> 39:22.680
system and migration to PipeWire in 32 and 33,

39:22.680 --> 39:25.000
and then eventually completed in 34.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.760
They've got this long arc plan for PipeWire,

39:27.760 --> 39:31.880
and 31 is all about getting things in position for it.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.240
But there's nothing really significantly different there,

39:34.240 --> 39:37.720
so I'm not sure why I'm having these problems.

39:37.720 --> 39:41.840
However, that stuff said, I really

39:41.840 --> 39:43.800
am happy with my install.

39:43.800 --> 39:47.360
It really is quite nice.

39:47.360 --> 39:52.200
The underlying Fedora system remains my favorite.

39:52.200 --> 39:56.880
It's reminiscent of Arch in its cleanness and its tightness.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.520
Yeah, it's modern.

39:58.520 --> 40:03.280
It doesn't feel bogged down by a bunch of cruft or legacy.

40:03.280 --> 40:06.360
It's very logically laid out.

40:06.360 --> 40:09.560
However, it feels more like a complete product,

40:09.560 --> 40:12.320
and it stays very up to date.

40:12.320 --> 40:15.880
But with these sort of thresholds,

40:15.880 --> 40:19.320
it has almost the feel of a rolling release distribution

40:19.320 --> 40:22.680
because you get new kernels, you get new core things

40:22.680 --> 40:26.720
during a release, but it doesn't have the roller coaster

40:26.720 --> 40:30.000
experience that you get with the really cutting edge distros.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.280
No, I mean, you can feel comfortable using it

40:33.280 --> 40:36.360
on your workstation, as long as you know,

40:36.360 --> 40:38.280
fairly often you'll have to do an upgrade.

40:38.280 --> 40:42.600
I think Fedora, for me, fills the role

40:42.600 --> 40:46.040
that Manjaro fills for a lot of people in the Arch land.

40:46.040 --> 40:50.360
They want that clean, tight, professionally built

40:50.360 --> 40:55.600
OS with really fresh software, but maybe having a testing

40:55.600 --> 40:59.680
layer is a good thing, which Rawhide provides for Fedora.

40:59.680 --> 41:02.440
So I think there's a real common experience

41:02.440 --> 41:04.800
between a Manjaro user's preferences and experience

41:04.800 --> 41:07.440
and a Fedora user's preferences and experience.

41:07.440 --> 41:10.400
And I just happened to like the Fedora take on it,

41:10.400 --> 41:14.960
in part because it dawned on me while doing this review

41:14.960 --> 41:18.240
that I have been trying out different Red Hat desktop

41:18.240 --> 41:20.880
installs for 21 years.

41:20.880 --> 41:24.480
This marks my 21 year of trying these.

41:24.480 --> 41:27.440
And so I may just be a little more inclined

41:27.440 --> 41:30.720
to like the Red Hat version more than the Manjaro version,

41:30.720 --> 41:32.840
but I completely kind of get the appeal of it now.

41:32.840 --> 41:35.120
Well, I mean, I've been playing around with it.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.520
It just feels like a nice, modern workstation,

41:37.520 --> 41:39.400
especially if you're someone who uses Linux

41:39.400 --> 41:42.160
and also does work in the cloud or development.

41:42.160 --> 41:44.480
I love that Git is just already installed.

41:44.480 --> 41:45.720
Oh, I know.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.760
Carl, you were saying they kind of have a term for Fedora

41:48.760 --> 41:50.640
that sort of fits this description.

41:50.640 --> 41:51.880
Yes, sir.

41:51.880 --> 41:55.080
Matt, his last name's escaping me right now, Matt Diem.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.640
He calls it a semi-roll-in release.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.560
That's a good way to put it, Matthew Millian.

41:59.560 --> 42:00.880
In fact, I reached out to Matthew

42:00.880 --> 42:01.720
and invited him to come on.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.600
He's at a conference.

42:02.600 --> 42:04.040
I invited him to come on next week

42:04.040 --> 42:06.160
so after we spend another week with Fedora,

42:06.160 --> 42:07.040
we can chat with him.

42:07.040 --> 42:10.080
So come back next week to chat with him, too.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.960
So we all gave it a go.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.960
I have really grown to like Fedora as a workstation,

42:16.960 --> 42:18.480
so I wanted to really kind of spend

42:18.480 --> 42:20.040
some time to go through it.

42:20.040 --> 42:22.160
And I don't know what I'm going to do.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.160
I think I'll just hang on X, where

42:24.160 --> 42:27.600
the mouse leg is acceptable, and wait for the next GNOME

42:27.600 --> 42:29.520
release because this is something they're actively

42:29.520 --> 42:30.760
working on.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.000
What about your experience?

42:32.000 --> 42:34.560
Oh, no, it's been very solid because I've only

42:34.560 --> 42:37.000
been using it on the ThinkPad.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.880
Right, where it's glorious.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.120
And you've been using Wayland?

42:40.120 --> 42:41.760
I've been using GNOME and Wayland,

42:41.760 --> 42:44.560
and I've not yet installed Chrome either.

42:44.560 --> 42:46.520
So I've been using Firefox.

42:46.520 --> 42:49.720
Honestly, it's just been clean and minimal and kind

42:49.720 --> 42:50.360
of perfect.

42:50.360 --> 42:52.400
I mean, you and I, yesterday, we did a little bit

42:52.400 --> 42:55.160
of tweaking and playing around with GNOME themes.

42:55.160 --> 42:58.240
But other than that, it's just ready to go.

42:58.240 --> 43:01.800
And I really love that about a nice, modern workstation.

43:01.800 --> 43:04.480
It was easy to get all the software I needed to do work,

43:04.480 --> 43:06.720
to prepare for the show.

43:06.720 --> 43:09.000
So I'm kind of back up and running already.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.160
Yeah, I would say now, GNOME on Wayland

43:12.160 --> 43:14.320
takes me about 15 minutes.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.760
That's it, yep.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.040
And I could probably spend all day tweaking Plasma.

43:18.040 --> 43:19.920
I kind of enjoy it sometimes, but sometimes I

43:19.920 --> 43:22.320
don't want to bother with that.

43:22.320 --> 43:23.840
I want to talk about the installer and all of that.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.720
But Cheesy, I think this is a good chance for you

43:25.720 --> 43:28.200
to jump in, because you kind of have the freshest eyes

43:28.200 --> 43:30.280
on the Fedora installation experience.

43:30.280 --> 43:33.520
I have grown more and more familiar with Anaconda,

43:33.520 --> 43:35.880
and I know that can be a little strange for somebody that

43:35.880 --> 43:38.280
doesn't install Fedora systems all the time.

43:38.280 --> 43:40.080
Yeah, so I mean, full disclosure,

43:40.080 --> 43:42.760
I'm not an avid Fedora user.

43:42.760 --> 43:44.760
Overall, the experience has been great.

43:44.760 --> 43:46.480
So just going through the installer,

43:46.480 --> 43:49.600
one of the things that I noticed immediately

43:49.600 --> 43:51.560
was whenever you go to format your disk,

43:51.560 --> 43:56.000
it asks you to reclaim space, which just seems kind of weird

43:56.000 --> 43:57.440
instead of formatting.

43:57.440 --> 44:00.120
And I'm kind of used to that Ubuntu installer

44:00.120 --> 44:03.120
with the kind of pictogram and a short description of what

44:03.120 --> 44:05.080
you're about to do.

44:05.080 --> 44:06.520
So that was a little weird for me.

44:06.520 --> 44:09.440
So I could see a new user coming into that

44:09.440 --> 44:12.960
and maybe getting to that point and being a bit confused.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.760
Yeah, the disk partitioner stuff is a bit strange

44:15.760 --> 44:18.680
to begin with, because you've got automatic mode, which

44:18.680 --> 44:21.840
is still a little strange, custom,

44:21.840 --> 44:25.640
which is sort of like the custom partitioner in Ubuntu's

44:25.640 --> 44:26.160
installer.

44:26.160 --> 44:27.960
And then you have the belt or whatever

44:27.960 --> 44:30.640
it is, the more advanced one, which is a whole other disk

44:30.640 --> 44:31.280
partitioner.

44:31.280 --> 44:34.760
It's my preferred one, but it's hard to wrap your head around,

44:34.760 --> 44:36.300
even if you've done it multiple times.

44:36.300 --> 44:37.440
And here's what I can tell you.

44:37.440 --> 44:39.200
The first couple of times, because they changed this

44:39.200 --> 44:41.400
a few years ago, the first couple of times I used it,

44:41.400 --> 44:45.160
I was really very unhappy with it.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.800
The more I use it and the more I install other distros,

44:47.800 --> 44:48.880
the more I appreciate it.

44:48.880 --> 44:51.240
Because this is really the only one

44:51.240 --> 44:55.360
that lets me properly take advantage of my LVM setup

44:55.360 --> 44:58.360
and really kind of clearly lays out all the disks

44:58.360 --> 45:01.320
and lets me kind of do the more sophisticated partitioning

45:01.320 --> 45:03.900
that I want to do properly.

45:03.900 --> 45:05.480
It's the only one that will do it.

45:05.480 --> 45:08.320
And what I've noticed is the more I use it,

45:08.320 --> 45:09.680
the less offensive I find it.

45:09.680 --> 45:11.160
And I think what's happening is they

45:11.160 --> 45:13.800
have reached that phase themselves, the developers.

45:13.800 --> 45:16.280
To them, they installed Fedora, and it

45:16.280 --> 45:18.800
seems perfectly usable because they're totally used to it.

45:18.800 --> 45:22.200
But if you come in fresh, it's a weird way

45:22.200 --> 45:23.720
to lay out your disks.

45:23.720 --> 45:26.400
Even the way it, even the language it uses is strange.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.200
And constantly hitting the Done button.

45:28.200 --> 45:30.560
Double Done buttons and Reclaim buttons.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.600
And yeah, the whole thing is strange.

45:32.600 --> 45:35.920
Well, and then whenever you do that initial setup,

45:35.920 --> 45:40.000
you don't set up your initial user until after you reboot,

45:40.000 --> 45:43.020
which, again, was a little bit strange.

45:43.020 --> 45:45.760
And then whenever you boot in, the first thing you get

45:45.760 --> 45:49.320
is a Welcome to Fedora screen that you

45:49.320 --> 45:53.600
have to click Next on before you can begin your user and setup.

45:53.600 --> 45:57.120
This is kind of the new way to do it, this post-install setup.

45:57.120 --> 45:59.800
Because one of the things that System76 says,

45:59.800 --> 46:02.120
and I think elementary OS said the same thing is,

46:02.120 --> 46:05.040
it's a great way to then take advantage of using encryption

46:05.040 --> 46:08.500
that an OEM can ship a system, and that last phase can

46:08.500 --> 46:09.900
be just handled by the user.

46:09.900 --> 46:11.780
And then they can set up their own encryption password

46:11.780 --> 46:12.280
and stuff.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.840
So there's some advantages to it.

46:13.840 --> 46:15.540
And that's exactly how I felt about it.

46:15.540 --> 46:18.500
I felt that it was more of, if you're coming from Ubuntu

46:18.500 --> 46:21.120
or something like that, it was an OEM-type setup, which,

46:21.120 --> 46:23.280
you know, no harm, no foul.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.520
But then, yeah, whenever I was greeted with the Welcome

46:25.520 --> 46:28.680
to Fedora screen before setting up my user,

46:28.680 --> 46:30.080
and you just have to click Next, it

46:30.080 --> 46:33.200
seems like that's one step that could be alleviated just

46:33.200 --> 46:36.600
to get you right into setting up your user.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.160
So that was a little weird.

46:39.160 --> 46:42.080
Searching for some of the software was a little weird.

46:42.080 --> 46:45.920
So initially, we were trying to set up Telegram.

46:45.920 --> 46:48.080
They had the Telegram web version

46:48.080 --> 46:51.760
in there, which is just not good,

46:51.760 --> 46:53.600
especially if you're older like me

46:53.600 --> 46:56.580
and you need that scaling to like 125%, right,

46:56.580 --> 46:58.000
to kind of get it where you need it.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.920
Yes, 125% club.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.520
Exactly, man.

47:02.520 --> 47:05.200
But that didn't take much to get into Flatpak,

47:05.200 --> 47:09.520
get the Flatpak repo set up, pull down Telegram desktop

47:09.520 --> 47:12.400
without any problems, had my scaling back.

47:12.400 --> 47:15.200
So that was pretty dead simple to get going.

47:15.200 --> 47:18.160
I didn't notice, though, that whenever installing apps,

47:18.160 --> 47:22.000
sometimes they would seem to hang for a bit,

47:22.000 --> 47:24.840
so like two or three minutes installing without giving you

47:24.840 --> 47:28.320
any progress, which was kind of weird.

47:28.320 --> 47:32.520
I think it's like pulling down different Flatpak layers

47:32.520 --> 47:35.240
and dependencies, and they don't have a good progress

47:35.240 --> 47:36.120
signal for that.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.500
And that's exactly what I was thinking,

47:37.500 --> 47:39.880
is that it was pulling down the layers in the background

47:39.880 --> 47:43.480
and just not outputting that onto the progress bar for me.

47:43.480 --> 47:46.040
But initially, I got all that worked out,

47:46.040 --> 47:47.440
got everything set up.

47:47.440 --> 47:51.080
Overall, pretty stock GNOME experience.

47:51.080 --> 47:54.320
I do like that they had the hot corners set up out of the box,

47:54.320 --> 47:58.720
because that's one of the things that I do with default GNOME.

47:58.720 --> 48:00.720
I do like the Ferronix test suite was already

48:00.720 --> 48:02.160
there in the shop.

48:02.160 --> 48:05.200
So boom, I didn't have to go to the Ferronix side

48:05.200 --> 48:06.640
and pull that down.

48:06.640 --> 48:08.000
It's one version behind.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.320
I'd love to see that updated.

48:09.320 --> 48:12.720
Just saying, just a note out to the universe.

48:12.720 --> 48:18.520
But the fingerprint reader works just as well as it did on Ubuntu.

48:18.520 --> 48:24.160
So I think that's just baked into GNOME 3.34.

48:24.160 --> 48:26.600
So that works great on this little ThinkPad.

48:26.600 --> 48:29.560
Overall, I mean, it really seems like a solid distro.

48:32.280 --> 48:34.800
I would like to see maybe the Flatpak repo added

48:34.800 --> 48:38.480
into, just to give that little more extensibility

48:38.480 --> 48:40.320
to have those apps that I want.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.920
But I do understand that that could be a security concern.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.240
So that might be one of the reasons

48:45.240 --> 48:46.800
they don't push that on you.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.120
Maybe a middle ground there could

48:48.120 --> 48:51.560
be a nice way to just add a checkbox for the Flatpak repo,

48:51.560 --> 48:57.500
because that is a third party community initiative.

48:57.500 --> 48:59.640
And I don't think Fedora wants to vouch

48:59.640 --> 49:02.440
for the quality or safety of the applications on there.

49:02.440 --> 49:06.480
But if they could come to a pretty easy way

49:06.480 --> 49:07.840
to get the NVIDIA graphics working,

49:07.840 --> 49:09.840
I think we could figure out a way to get FlatHub.

49:09.840 --> 49:12.300
Yeah, and I ran into the same issue with Quossel.

49:12.300 --> 49:13.800
Whenever I was downloading Quossel,

49:13.800 --> 49:15.640
I could get the full Quossel.

49:15.640 --> 49:18.640
But the FlatHub had the Quossel client, which

49:18.640 --> 49:20.160
is all I needed for that laptop.

49:20.160 --> 49:23.920
So there were a few things that were different that took some getting

49:23.920 --> 49:24.440
used to.

49:24.440 --> 49:29.720
But overall, it's been a great three or four days using it.

49:29.720 --> 49:32.960
I would think it would behoove them to make it easier

49:32.960 --> 49:34.640
to integrate FlatHub into GNOME software,

49:34.640 --> 49:38.240
simply because Ubuntu 19.10 ships with snaps integrated,

49:38.240 --> 49:40.240
and you get a much larger range of software.

49:40.240 --> 49:41.880
It's nice to have in there, yeah.

49:41.880 --> 49:44.280
And just like FlatHub has a lot of great apps.

49:44.280 --> 49:45.860
And it is now a little bit different,

49:45.860 --> 49:48.120
like depending on which distro you're using Flatpaks,

49:48.120 --> 49:52.080
or you're using the distro packages,

49:52.080 --> 49:54.960
there's a lot of little decisions you've got to make.

49:54.960 --> 49:56.920
Pluggy, pluggy again for that ChooseLytics.

49:56.920 --> 50:00.440
Of which, Drew, have you played with Toolbox?

50:00.440 --> 50:03.360
Because that's something that the Fedora project is really

50:03.360 --> 50:04.920
putting forward on this release.

50:04.920 --> 50:05.520
I have.

50:05.520 --> 50:07.800
I've played with Toolbox and Silverblue,

50:07.800 --> 50:12.920
which is where you really see Toolbox as part of the base

50:12.920 --> 50:13.960
operating system.

50:13.960 --> 50:15.720
You can get it on Workstation now,

50:15.720 --> 50:19.820
but it kind of grew out of their work with Podman,

50:19.820 --> 50:24.760
and wanting to make Podman easier to use in Silverblue.

50:24.760 --> 50:27.260
And it's a really cool project.

50:27.260 --> 50:31.960
Basically, it's a way to spin up an OCI container on the fly,

50:31.960 --> 50:37.480
or keep them around, and do work in that container off

50:37.480 --> 50:43.200
of essentially a base image that you can then

50:43.200 --> 50:45.560
drop in extra applications, or things

50:45.560 --> 50:49.000
that you maybe don't want to put in permanently

50:49.000 --> 50:50.720
into your own base system.

50:50.720 --> 50:52.440
Yeah, maybe you don't want to muck it up.

50:52.440 --> 50:55.120
And here's some of the neat things that it does,

50:55.120 --> 50:58.240
is it uses your existing username and permissions.

50:58.240 --> 50:59.960
So you're just, boom, you're up, and then

50:59.960 --> 51:02.160
it gives you a quick way to jump into that container's

51:02.160 --> 51:03.200
command line.

51:03.200 --> 51:05.440
You get access to your own home directory,

51:05.440 --> 51:08.240
and you get all your command line tools, including DNF.

51:08.240 --> 51:09.440
Containers have come so far.

51:09.440 --> 51:10.320
It's just amazing.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.040
Yeah, speaking of Silverblue, Silverblue

51:12.040 --> 51:14.520
doesn't have DNF in the base system.

51:14.520 --> 51:19.120
So if you want to look up packages using the command line,

51:19.120 --> 51:20.920
that's how you have to do it, is you

51:20.920 --> 51:24.240
have to drop into a toolbox, pull the package name,

51:24.240 --> 51:26.720
and then drop back out of the toolbox

51:26.720 --> 51:30.200
and install it via rpm-ostree.

51:30.200 --> 51:33.560
So you were our man on the scene over there in Silverblue town,

51:33.560 --> 51:36.280
but it sounds like after some initial success,

51:36.280 --> 51:38.200
you've wound up back on Workstation.

51:38.200 --> 51:38.720
I did.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.920
Yeah, I had some issues with it.

51:40.920 --> 51:43.200
I think I got a bad update at one point.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

51:44.360 --> 51:45.900
I thought the whole point of Silverblue

51:45.900 --> 51:48.800
was to prevent anything going wrong with bad updates.

51:48.800 --> 51:49.560
What happened?

51:49.560 --> 51:51.880
Well, yeah, so I'm not exactly sure

51:51.880 --> 51:55.960
what happened to my system, but the idea

51:55.960 --> 51:58.600
is that you have an immutable base,

51:58.600 --> 52:02.800
and you can kind of shift up and shift down.

52:02.800 --> 52:07.840
Like, I went to Fedora 31 early, early beta,

52:07.840 --> 52:11.440
and I was able to roll back to Fedora 30

52:11.440 --> 52:15.920
just within my boot menu, but something happened.

52:15.920 --> 52:18.680
And anything that I tried to boot just

52:18.680 --> 52:20.240
resulted in a black screen.

52:20.240 --> 52:22.560
I couldn't switch to another TTY.

52:22.560 --> 52:24.920
I couldn't get anything done.

52:24.920 --> 52:27.400
And I had to get rolling, so I just

52:27.400 --> 52:32.060
paved it and went to the Workstation 31 beta.

52:32.060 --> 52:36.720
So I think it's still a little too experimental for me.

52:36.720 --> 52:40.080
Now, I haven't checked it out with Fedora 31 stable,

52:40.080 --> 52:44.320
but I have been keeping track of what they're

52:44.320 --> 52:47.120
looking forward to in 32.

52:47.120 --> 52:52.160
And I think that they're going to really start taking down

52:52.160 --> 52:55.440
these little bugs, and getting Podman and Toolbox

52:55.440 --> 53:01.320
where it needs to be, and have everything really tightened up.

53:01.320 --> 53:03.000
It's looking good for that.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.960
So I'm hoping all of the feature sets make it into 32,

53:06.960 --> 53:10.720
and in another six months, I might be giving it another go.

53:10.720 --> 53:11.920
I could see it.

53:11.920 --> 53:13.920
I could see how technologies like Toolbox

53:13.920 --> 53:15.920
will evolve over time.

53:15.920 --> 53:17.960
I'm going to, after this release,

53:17.960 --> 53:19.960
because they kind of made a big stink about it,

53:19.960 --> 53:21.420
I was like, well, I'll check it out.

53:21.420 --> 53:24.320
I'm going to keep using it, because it allows me to have

53:24.320 --> 53:27.320
not only a couple of different user environments I can muck up,

53:27.320 --> 53:29.240
but it's super easy to get started.

53:29.240 --> 53:32.960
And that kind of technology wasn't really even around

53:32.960 --> 53:34.360
when Silverblue started.

53:34.360 --> 53:37.040
I mean, the tech was, but the implementation of it

53:37.040 --> 53:38.640
wasn't around when Silverblue started.

53:38.640 --> 53:40.960
That's the hard stuff here, is making it actually useful

53:40.960 --> 53:41.580
to you.

53:41.580 --> 53:42.120
Right.

53:42.120 --> 53:45.240
And Flatpaks were nascent.

53:45.240 --> 53:49.640
And things like projects like FlatHub hadn't even begun yet.

53:49.640 --> 53:53.480
And some of the advantages that Gnome Shell has with you

53:53.480 --> 53:56.080
going over to Wayland are only now becoming realized.

53:56.080 --> 53:59.380
All of these things are sort of happening around Silverblue,

53:59.380 --> 54:02.560
which seems like it's going to make it a better

54:02.560 --> 54:05.180
candidate once they've all kind of crystallized a bit.

54:05.180 --> 54:06.960
So I could see how in six months to a year,

54:06.960 --> 54:08.480
it could be in a much better state.

54:08.480 --> 54:09.000
Yeah.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.960
And for me, part of the problem that I have with it

54:11.960 --> 54:16.920
is there is absolutely no I686, no multi-lib, none of it.

54:16.920 --> 54:18.920
Right, which is bad for audio.

54:18.920 --> 54:21.800
It is, because I use a lot of things through Wine

54:21.800 --> 54:27.080
to kind of help out in my workflow, and I can't do that.

54:27.080 --> 54:31.720
So my options are run all my audio in a VM

54:31.720 --> 54:35.760
or possibly try to pass things through the toolbox,

54:35.760 --> 54:37.160
but that gets a little messy.

54:37.160 --> 54:40.680
And yeah, it's just not the best now.

54:40.680 --> 54:44.280
I'm hoping that the future of Pipewire

54:44.280 --> 54:48.000
helps to make things a little better for me down the line.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.880
Or other projects that may be in the works.

54:50.880 --> 54:54.080
There's other ways to solve that particular problem, which

54:54.080 --> 54:57.360
Westpain's been taking a crack at.

54:57.360 --> 55:00.360
I still think things are looking pretty good for 32.

55:00.360 --> 55:02.920
Some of the story of 31, to be quite honest with you,

55:02.920 --> 55:06.600
is just about the performance improvements,

55:06.600 --> 55:09.800
which we talked about with Ubuntu 19.10, right?

55:09.800 --> 55:10.880
Yeah, indeed.

55:10.880 --> 55:14.280
So if Ubuntu 19.10 hadn't happened,

55:14.280 --> 55:17.480
the majority of this would be about the performance

55:17.480 --> 55:19.480
improvements to Gnome Shell.

55:19.480 --> 55:20.200
They're all there.

55:20.200 --> 55:20.880
They're great.

55:20.880 --> 55:21.400
It is great.

55:21.400 --> 55:22.800
I'm really enjoying it.

55:22.800 --> 55:25.120
So I guess it's worth an honorable mention.

55:25.120 --> 55:28.160
And it's really kind of nice to see it all materialize.

55:28.160 --> 55:29.480
So what do you say?

55:29.480 --> 55:31.400
Will you give it another try in a little while

55:31.400 --> 55:32.440
and report back to you?

55:32.440 --> 55:33.280
Yeah, absolutely.

55:33.280 --> 55:36.880
I think I'm going to give it some time,

55:36.880 --> 55:42.200
let them really get 31 up to speed and look forward to 32

55:42.200 --> 55:44.640
and see how they're doing for that release.

55:44.640 --> 55:45.280
Yeah.

55:45.280 --> 55:48.040
And in the meantime, Workstation will do the job, right?

55:48.040 --> 55:48.920
Absolutely, yeah.

55:48.920 --> 55:52.600
I've been really happy with 31 Workstation.

55:52.600 --> 55:55.320
And I haven't had any mouse lag issues,

55:55.320 --> 55:58.240
even though I'm using a very similar setup to what

55:58.240 --> 56:03.920
you have on your desktop with dual monitors and a Ryzen

56:03.920 --> 56:08.520
card and AMD CPU SSDs.

56:08.520 --> 56:10.720
But no mouse lag for me.

56:10.720 --> 56:14.560
I think it could even come down to what USB port or bus

56:14.560 --> 56:15.760
my mouse is on.

56:15.760 --> 56:16.880
There's so many variables.

56:16.880 --> 56:18.400
It's three monitors, to be clear.

56:18.400 --> 56:21.680
It's not two, but it's still kind of the same thing.

56:21.680 --> 56:26.640
And I wonder if it's not just some unique combination

56:26.640 --> 56:30.080
of hardware that will never be solved on my system.

56:30.080 --> 56:32.240
And the reason why I know it's unique to that box

56:32.240 --> 56:34.280
is because it works so brilliantly

56:34.280 --> 56:35.560
on all the other systems.

56:35.560 --> 56:37.180
Well, at least that means it's solvable.

56:37.180 --> 56:38.800
We just got to get you a new rig.

56:38.800 --> 56:39.480
Yeah, that's it.

56:39.480 --> 56:39.840
That's it.

56:39.840 --> 56:42.320
I just got to get a brand new computer, a really nice,

56:42.320 --> 56:43.640
fast computer.

56:43.640 --> 56:46.160
I did a brief rabbit hole deep dive

56:46.160 --> 56:49.640
into schedulers with this Fedora release,

56:49.640 --> 56:53.400
because they switched to the BFQ scheduler by default.

56:53.400 --> 56:56.960
And now I have learned that Linux applications can actually

56:56.960 --> 56:59.600
choose from a list of schedulers that the kernel can

56:59.600 --> 57:01.840
make available, which blows my mind

57:01.840 --> 57:03.480
that this is even a thing.

57:03.480 --> 57:06.920
But just as of note, Fedora 31 switches

57:06.920 --> 57:09.720
to BFQ, which has some people excited.

57:09.720 --> 57:11.600
So Alex, last but not least, I know

57:11.600 --> 57:14.800
that you've been giving the new fresh release a go

57:14.800 --> 57:15.880
as we've been recording.

57:15.880 --> 57:18.640
Do you have any takeaways before we wrap up on the new release?

57:18.640 --> 57:22.320
I have about three or four different LVFS firmware updates

57:22.320 --> 57:25.080
to do.

57:25.080 --> 57:27.400
Oh, yeah, by the way, that is one of the funny things

57:27.400 --> 57:29.800
when you install Fedora or something that does LVFS

57:29.800 --> 57:31.180
and you haven't run it before.

57:31.180 --> 57:32.360
You've been on a desktop environment that

57:32.360 --> 57:33.060
doesn't have it.

57:33.060 --> 57:36.640
It's like, oh, I've been neglecting this.

57:36.640 --> 57:37.760
Are you on a laptop?

57:37.760 --> 57:39.880
Yeah, it's my ThinkPad T4ATS.

57:39.880 --> 57:40.840
Oh, yeah, of course.

57:40.840 --> 57:43.600
Yeah, yep, I had the same three updates, I think.

57:43.600 --> 57:45.640
I just have a hard time with GNOME.

57:45.640 --> 57:48.400
This is my issue with Fedora at the moment.

57:48.400 --> 57:50.560
As a server OS, I use it every day

57:50.560 --> 57:52.200
for hacking around and stuff.

57:52.200 --> 57:57.000
But I don't know, I just, GNOME, ah, just can't.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.880
I know, it's so clean and smooth and gets out of your way.

57:59.880 --> 58:00.520
Simple.

58:00.520 --> 58:02.200
Until you have mouse lag, and then you

58:02.200 --> 58:04.200
want to burn it to the ground.

58:04.200 --> 58:05.760
I think I might go back to plasma

58:05.760 --> 58:07.360
for a little bit on that machine.

58:07.360 --> 58:09.480
I want one environment on all my machines

58:09.480 --> 58:11.720
so that way I can muscle memory it, you know?

58:11.720 --> 58:12.920
Just stop thinking about it.

58:12.920 --> 58:15.360
And then I want to be that individual that's

58:15.360 --> 58:18.280
got the same environment for a decade,

58:18.280 --> 58:22.320
and so they just are one with the UI of their computer.

58:22.320 --> 58:26.280
Because I know a guy who's been using XFCE, well, besides Joe.

58:26.280 --> 58:29.400
But Joe would probably also be this individual.

58:29.400 --> 58:34.120
He's been using XFCE on this old computer for a decade.

58:34.120 --> 58:36.640
Same computer, same interface.

58:36.640 --> 58:41.160
He just upgrades Debian every time that a release comes out.

58:41.160 --> 58:44.060
And he is like a wizard.

58:44.060 --> 58:48.840
I mean, he moves around, and I move pretty quick, Wes.

58:48.840 --> 58:49.760
Indeed you do.

58:49.760 --> 58:52.240
And this guy is like a wizard, I tell you what.

58:52.240 --> 58:56.560
And in part, it's because in his fingertips,

58:56.560 --> 58:59.160
he knows where the elements of the UI are.

58:59.160 --> 59:00.600
Have you considered switching to I3?

59:00.600 --> 59:01.100
Yeah.

59:01.100 --> 59:01.600
Yeah.

59:01.600 --> 59:02.100
Yeah.

59:02.100 --> 59:03.920
Yeah.

59:03.920 --> 59:05.640
All right, let's get out of this.

59:05.640 --> 59:08.960
Let's get out of this, and let's talk about our pick this week.

59:08.960 --> 59:11.280
I really like this pick.

59:11.280 --> 59:13.680
As Wes always says, it turns out if you try hard enough,

59:13.680 --> 59:14.280
you can.

59:14.280 --> 59:16.880
I wanted a great way to get remote terminal access.

59:16.880 --> 59:19.440
And so what I was doing for some of these benchmarks that

59:19.440 --> 59:22.020
ran for hours and hours, and I wanted to get out of here,

59:22.020 --> 59:24.360
is we'd started up in a Tmux session,

59:24.360 --> 59:26.720
and then you'd have to SSH into one.

59:26.720 --> 59:28.120
Well, first you set up WireGuard,

59:28.120 --> 59:29.720
and then you'd SSH into the server.

59:29.720 --> 59:31.840
And then from there, you could hop into the box,

59:31.840 --> 59:33.640
or maybe you could go directly from the box,

59:33.640 --> 59:35.480
depending on your WireGuard config.

59:35.480 --> 59:37.720
And then you'd join the Tmux session.

59:37.720 --> 59:39.360
And then it's fine.

59:39.360 --> 59:41.760
It's fine if you've got nothing to do.

59:41.760 --> 59:43.560
But it was a few steps.

59:43.560 --> 59:45.760
If you've got nothing to do, and all you want to do

59:45.760 --> 59:48.240
is play with your computer, it's fine.

59:48.240 --> 59:49.360
This isn't for you.

59:49.360 --> 59:51.320
But for those of us that want to get in,

59:51.320 --> 59:53.680
kick some terminal command, and get out,

59:53.680 --> 59:56.480
I introduce to you my friend's teammate,

59:56.480 --> 59:58.440
Instant Terminal Sharing.

59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.600
Like nothing we've talked about before, friends,

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.520
and they both have a cloud version

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:09.320
and a self-hosted version, teammate is a fork of Tmux,

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:13.840
and they can exist on the same system together, no problemo.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.000
And it's a really easy way.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.440
You start a session in teammate, and it immediately

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:22.300
generates an SSH address with a unique hash in it.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.120
Somebody pops that into their terminal,

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.120
and bam, you're sharing a screen.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.800
Doesn't matter if you're behind NAT.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.880
It supports some actually pretty dodgy network conditions.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.120
And the tech behind it is super solid, all really well

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.200
laid out on the website.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.000
And then when you self-host it, too, it's nice and secure.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.460
You don't have to worry about them proxying the connection

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.120
or anything like that.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:48.800
Well, yeah, right.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:49.840
You set it all up.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.280
You can reuse existing SSH keys if you've got some set up

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.900
or generate new ones, and it'll accept them

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.120
as environmental variables.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.960
And of course, there's the Docker container out there

01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.680
already.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:03.120
And teammate was in the Fedora repo, so that was easy to go.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.240
Yeah, it is really easy to get installed.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.400
And so this is a super solid way to start something up

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.960
that you want to finish when you get somewhere else.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.800
And you're probably using Tmux anyway.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.180
Yeah, and if you're not, you really should look into it,

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.080
because this is so, so handy when you know a job's going

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.040
to be running for a while, but eventually

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.600
the dumb, stupid computer's going to stop,

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.000
and it's going to wait for the monkey to push a button,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
and it won't finish what it needs to do until the monkey

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.020
pushes the button.

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.120
And there's no reason you should stick around just

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.760
to push the button when you can SSH to this unique address

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.040
that it will generate, and you'll be on the box

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.600
and on that session immediately.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.060
It also supports read-only mode if you just

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.360
want to demonstrate.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.360
It has some of the feature sets of MOSH as well, which

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.840
is a pick we've covered before, which helps restore connections

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.600
when you move, or if you're on a mobile connection

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.960
and your IP address changes.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.920
You can run it as a service, or you can just run it as a command.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:58.880
It's pretty cool.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.120
We set it up as a server-side service, too, so.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.440
Yeah, and that wasn't too bad to get going.

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.320
You've got to go futz with it a little bit,

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.680
but that's always how it goes.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.660
Or you can just, if you need something super quick,

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:13.080
you can just install TeamMate, and by default, it

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.800
will use their TeamMate.io server.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.340
Yeah, they've got a hosted server.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.320
I think it's actually already geo-load balanced out there.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.720
So there's probably one, hopefully,

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.600
not too far from you.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.040
And all the code's free, open source.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.120
It's all available, and they have package.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.780
You can even get it installed on Mac OS.

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.840
It's in brew.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.720
How about that?

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.200
Yeah, and I think they even have a guide here

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.180
on how to get it working on Windows.

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:37.720
Wow, I tell you what, that's just pretty great.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.720
And of course, they've got packages for Ubuntu,

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.040
and it's in the Ubuntu repo as well.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.440
So check it out, TeamMate.io, or we will

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.160
have a link in the show notes.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.080
It's just one of those picks that we have just

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.160
found so super helpful, like the magic wormhole, which

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.000
is a really easy way to send files around.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.760
Not every pick actually sneaks into the tool belt,

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.880
but this one, I think.

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:58.440
Oh, yeah.

01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:58.920
Oh, yeah.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920
I'm using it.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.920
I'm using it to get into machines in the RV, too,

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.620
because what's great about it is those are behind a double mat,

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.820
and I can still use that to get into those sessions.

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:11.800
So I can kick my Shinobi box in the gear, that stupid Shinobi.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:17.400
Anyways, a link to the picks is at linuxunplug.com slash 325,

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.520
where you'll also find our contact page,

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.920
our subscribe page, references to everything

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.240
we've covered today, all that kind of stuff.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.080
Anything else we need to cover, Mr. Payne, any other duties

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.600
we need to perform before we get out of here?

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.160
If you want to find out a little bit more about benchmarking,

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.200
stay tuned.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.480
That's what Jim and I are talking about in this week's

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.320
episode of TechSnap.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:35.840
Oh.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.560
Yeah, so dive in.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.240
We talk about FIO, some of his favorite ways of doing that,

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.000
and what you need to know about IOPS and throughput.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.120
I love the way he explains stuff, so that is going to be great.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.720
And he knows that stuff, too.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.400
He really does, so that'll be good.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.200
Look for that later this week.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.080
TechSnap.systems for that.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.080
And go follow the network at Jupiter Signal.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.800
The show is at Linux Unplugged, I believe, on there.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.320
Sounds right.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.000
Yeah.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.480
I'm at Chris L-A-S. Go check out Drew at Choose Linux.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.600
And of course, Alex and I over at Self Hosted.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.400
Selfhosted.show.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.280
It's good stuff.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.760
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:37.760
I'm Chris L-A-S.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:47.200
All right, let's go title the show, jbtitles.com.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.680
And then we're going to do a little internet helps,

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.200
if you guys are ready, OK?

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.200
What?

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.880
We're going to do a little internet helps.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.800
Well, we need to help out the Linux Foundation.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.760
They're having some communications troubles.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.640
And I think we have just the crew to solve it, Cheesy.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.640
OK, let's do it.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.760
So anyways, go over to jbtitles.com.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.560
I think something with fedora in there would be nice, or a hat

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.440
full of hassles.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.520
That's kind of fun.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.120
I bet Matthew will be really excited to come on the show after

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:18.920
that one.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.560
But I do love it.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:27.000
Purism Throttled, Of Mice and Zen, Where is Aspen?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.520
Yeah.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.360
Yeah, really.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:29.840
Yeah, really.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.520
All right.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:34.200
So jbtitles, jbtitles, now we all got to go vote.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.520
All right, so go over there now.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.480
It's voting time.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.760
All right, so let's do a little translation.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.920
And we're going to have to start at the headline,

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.840
because even the headline's pretty thick.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.600
Brent, I'm going to ask you to define this first one, OK?

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.560
So this one's on you.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.400
Prepare yourself, sir.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.400
All right, I'm ready.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.800
New Linux Foundation effort to focus on data confidence

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.800
fabrics to scale digital transformation initiatives.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.840
What does that mean, Brent?

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.560
It sounds like a new apparel line that they're coming up with.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.480
Here, I'll put a link in the show notes, too,

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.360
so you can read the text yourself.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.000
New Linux Foundation effort to focus on data confidence

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.640
fabrics to scale digital transformation initiatives.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.640
Here's how I read that.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.240
Oh my god.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.920
The Linux Foundation has a new initiative

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:21.200
that wants to make people more confident in a whole layer

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.520
of data products.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.800
Don't worry, though.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.120
They did mention AI.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.360
That's in the second paragraph.

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.760
Yeah, OK, so here's the subheadline.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.680
Let's see, who should we pick on for this one?

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:32.920
Who do you want to pick on?

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.440
Should we pick on Alex?

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.640
Let's pick on Alex for this one.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.360
Wait, did I win or lose?

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.880
No, no, you didn't win.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.280
All right, Alex, this is the subheadline.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.040
I'd like you to translate this.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:46.120
We've only made it from the headline now.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.840
In partnership with leading industry players,

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.000
Linux Foundation to create Project Avalarium

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.200
to facilitate intrinsic trust in data and applications,

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.000
spanning heterogeneous systems of systems.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.200
Blah, blah, blah.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.480
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.200
No, no, you've got to say what you really think it means.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.320
You've got to say what you really think it means.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.880
I think it was written by someone

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.440
with a marketing degree that doesn't understand technology.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.520
No, they're trying to convey a message there.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.240
There is something they're trying to say.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.600
So all right, Alex, do you know?

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.520
GZ, do you got any guesses on what they're trying to say?

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.960
Leading industry players.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.840
Right.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.640
Avalarium facilitate intrinsic trust in data.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.080
So industry players are?

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.520
Like Dell, IBM.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.040
Right, right.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:38.560
And they are trying to facilitate intrinsic trust

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:43.040
with data from various different applications

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.520
on various different systems.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.760
I think that's pretty close.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.880
I think that's pretty dense.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.000
Systems of systems.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.520
Yeah, system of systems.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.720
All right, well, I'm sure they'll explain it

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.160
in the opening paragraph.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:56.120
It goes, the Linux Foundation, a nonprofit organization

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.880
dedicated to accelerating the growth of Linux

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.220
and collaborative development among sustainable open source

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:02.880
ecosystems, which they are pretty good so far,

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.240
today announced the intent to form the Project Avalarium.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.560
Project Avalarium will focus on building concepts

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:11.080
of data confidence fabrics, DCFs,

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.160
to facilitate measurable trust.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.320
OK, measurable trust, right.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.760
Now I'm starting to get lost here.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:19.360
Measurable trust means that somehow people

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:23.240
will be able to gauge how trustworthy it is, right?

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.360
So that's pretty easy.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:28.000
Measurable trust and confidence in data and applications

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.960
spanning heterogeneous systems.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:32.520
So OK, so data in the applications

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.360
across multiple types of systems.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:37.040
The product will be seeded by code from Dell Technologies

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.360
with support from industry leaders, including ARM, IBM,

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:40.960
and others.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.120
I like the second paragraph, though.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.040
A DCF, or trust fabric, is a framework

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.920
comprised of a variety of technologies

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.080
that help insert trust into the data path,

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:54.360
in turn facilitating the orchestration of trusted AI

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.720
models and the delivery of data from devices

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.080
to applications with measurable confidence.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.480
Oh.

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.480
I'm going to need a nap.

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:05.000
That's all I know.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.800
Can I attempt to sum this up in one word?

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.800
Yeah.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:38.160
Blockchain.
