1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Okay, I had a pre-show topic. I just thought since it's not directly Linux related, we

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,280
probably shouldn't do it in the main show, but I want to talk to you guys about it because

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,860
you got to wonder if there's going to be anything that changes for Linux. You have to hope not,

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,460
but everybody saw the news that Microsoft purchased Mojang for 2.5 billion and Notch

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,720
is on his way out the door already. And you know, you guys probably also saw because it

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,320
was grabbed in the last subreddit comments that Microsoft explicitly said they don't

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:38,440
have any plans to change Minecraft, to change where they deliver to Mac, PC, Xbox, PlayStation

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,800
and mobile. They didn't actually say Linux. Do you think I'm being paranoid?

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,960
Oh, it's definitely an elephant in the room.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
They didn't thought about it.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,040
I think that's the fuck Mark is going to write now.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,440
But to be fair, I think Microsoft is trying to become what they were before, a software

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,440
company that means producing software for whatever it's selling.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,320
So you think you think it would be silly for them to pull it up?

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,640
Yeah, I think so. Right. I hope so.

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,180
So the whole thing is if their goal and the only way to make what they're doing right

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,720
now totally Microsoft centric so that it can't run that on other operating systems would

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:30,680
be to actually undo what they've done that's good and what is to Java standard and to murder

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:39,200
it and do stupid things like instead of doing it from a canonical URL to something or canonical

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,760
connection to something, which is just assuming and going backwards from where you are and

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,760
then finding something else in the file system, they'd have to go and state some kind of awful

22
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,160
way to say, oh, look for the C drive.

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,720
So before we go like way down in the weeds, that's way down there.

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,260
Don't you think it's more likely that what would happen is Microsoft will continue to

25
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,640
deliver Minecraft as we know it today to all the places that Minecraft is shipped, but

26
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,360
then maybe in the future there could be like themed versions of Minecraft or specifically

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,880
Minecraft, I don't want to call them spin offs, but I can't think of a better term that

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,120
maybe would be exclusive to the Xbox platform or windows mobile first.

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,880
This is all about windows mobile.

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,440
This is all about windows mobile.

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Nothing else.

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,260
They need a great game for windows mobile.

33
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,920
They need the killer app for windows.

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,300
They need the number one seller on iOS.

35
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,760
And when, when like the kid goes into the phone shop with the parents and the parents

36
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,400
have got the money and they say, right, which phone do you want?

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,200
The question is, does it run Minecraft?

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,200
And you know, every kid in my kid's school, all the kids play Minecraft, all of them without

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
fail.

40
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,720
And when they go to like have a party over at someone's house, they sit there and pull

41
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,840
out their phones and do peer to peer playing Minecraft together.

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,320
I've seen the same thing.

43
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,920
And if you're the guy with the windows phone, you're like a loser.

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
You can't join in.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,120
It's horrible peer pressure.

46
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,120
And it's the thing we teach our kids not to succumb to, but you know.

47
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,480
Yeah, I think it is.

48
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,380
So but how do you, it's okay.

49
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,700
So obviously outside of, I mean, do you really think they'd spend 2.5 Bill and buy something

50
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,880
that is so counter to the Microsoft culture, right?

51
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,280
Because Minecraft's all about how the community has embraced and extended it and built their

52
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
own servers.

53
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,680
It's a huge freaking Java app, right?

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,160
This is so counter to anything that is normally in the Microsoft realm of expertise.

55
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,480
So there's no way they're, they're doing all of this just to make a windows mobile port.

56
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,560
It has to be much bigger than that.

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,940
I mean, outside of even merchandising and things like that, I think, I think they've

58
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,240
got to make exclusives out of this property.

59
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,920
Well, it's like I've been saying, I think we're going to start seeing a new Microsoft.

60
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
I mean, this is the same.

61
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
I don't think it's new.

62
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,760
I think it's just the old Microsoft, the actual old Microsoft, the original one.

63
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,040
The original one was endorsing Apple like hell when it made sense for them.

64
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,440
They just grew too much and decided to take to their own hands.

65
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,160
Come on, they were planning to backstab them the entire time.

66
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,240
Yeah, I think so too.

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,800
I think, I mean, I see what your point is.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,120
This would be a much more mature Microsoft, one that really is truly more interested in

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,480
just creating software for all platforms.

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
And maybe it'll be that.

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Okay.

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,220
So let's, let's shift gears from this.

73
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,900
Doesn't this also kind of guarantee like more support's going to be going towards like mind

74
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,620
test and other open source Minecraft alternatives?

75
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,620
I hope so.

76
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,560
It could do, but it would, they would, they need to step up their game.

77
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Yeah.

78
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,880
I mean, there's already other different like glowstone projects, all of this came out of

79
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,160
the big craft's bucket fiasco and it's already started and I think this has only improved

80
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,720
it and sped it up.

81
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,120
Yeah, I think so.

82
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,040
I mean, I think, I think like a Pope said, it's going to be, there's a long time to go.

83
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,920
And now if Microsoft does it right, they're going to have more money behind Minecraft.

84
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,640
Perhaps they could be, maybe they could make that even a better product even faster.

85
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,320
So there could be more competition for mind test to keep up with.

86
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
We'll see.

87
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
We'll see.

88
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
We'll see.

89
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Stay tuned and find out.

90
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
Hopefully it doesn't mean anything bad for Linux users.

91
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
I don't think it will.

92
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
All right.

93
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
Yeah.

94
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,200
See, I didn't really think that was the main show topic, but I thought it was worth chatting

95
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,040
about just cause I know it's a popular game on Linux, you know, that's what my son plays

96
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
it on.

97
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,600
He has a, uh, well now I'm going to put it, I don't know if it'll play on the Chromebook.

98
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,040
I'm going to, I guess I could try get it so that my son can see it and see what he thinks.

99
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Yeah.

100
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
I've got it.

101
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,760
No, it's the C seven 20, uh, yeah, that's Intel.

102
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,840
Uh, it's got, um, it's got an elementary OS on it right now, but he's got a HP laptop

103
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,640
at home that has enter gross on it that has Minecraft installed.

104
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,280
And that works really well for him.

105
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:55,080
And interestingly too, I didn't expect this, but he's taken much better to the track pads

106
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,920
on a laptop than a mouse because he started with touchscreen devices and then moved to

107
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
the computer.

108
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,300
He kind of graduated up to the computer.

109
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,240
And so the touch on the pad, on the touch pad, on the click pad made much more sense

110
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,400
to him than the mouse.

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,760
Now he's learned the mouse too, but I, he just almost immediately was able to translate

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,680
touchscreen to track pad, which I didn't quite expect cause it's not really a one-to-one

113
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,960
thing, but.

114
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
How old is he?

115
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Five.

116
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,040
So Sam started off with a mouse and a keyboard, Minecraft, and then eventually I bought it

117
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,880
on the Xbox 360 and he now favors the controller.

118
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
He's no son of mine.

119
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,320
I mean, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a mouse and keyboard kind of guy, but he, yeah, he's, he's big,

120
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,520
you know, him and Sophie as well, who's 11, she's much prefers the controller now finds

121
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
it a lot more accurate.

122
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,360
And do they use the controller on the PC or are they sticking to the console?

123
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,800
They generally only use the console because they, they use the multiplayer thing with

124
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
the, what's the camera thing?

125
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
Connect.

126
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Yeah.

127
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
And they, they chat to their friends.

128
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,720
So does that mean no custom servers?

129
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,920
Like how does that work on the console?

130
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Are there.

131
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,040
They make their own servers and their friends, they invite their friends, they call parties.

132
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
And they're persistent worlds.

133
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Yeah.

134
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Yeah.

135
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,040
They come back to, there's like a hundred of them saved on the Xbox.

136
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
I don't know where they are.

137
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
They're in the cloud probably.

138
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Yeah.

139
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,520
So they're hosted like on the Xbox live servers.

140
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
I guess so.

141
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Yeah.

142
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Huh.

143
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
So it's way easier than PC servers.

144
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Yeah.

145
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,000
You don't have to worry about, you know, spinning up a VDS.

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,680
But you can only play with other, it's only other console custom worlds.

147
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Yes.

148
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Like you can't go console to PC.

149
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Correct.

150
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,000
But there's a ton of people who have Xbox and Minecraft.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah.

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No, I think it's like a huge game on there.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,040
I think, I think they looked at it as a huge game on iOS.

155
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,520
It's a huge game on, on the Xbox and they went, huh, you know what we should do?

156
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,760
We should probably own that.

157
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,080
And plus you see, you got Notch there.

158
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,880
He's like, yeah, I don't want to be part of a big company.

159
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,480
I don't want to do this anymore.

160
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,960
I mean, it was just sort of, I mean, wow.

161
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,240
I think it was the time was right.

162
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,320
He, I think he, I think it's pretty accurate what he was saying that he, you know, I don't

163
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
think that was a cop out.

164
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,240
And I think it was fair to say that he's not CEO material.

165
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,860
You can tell from his tweets and stuff, he likes just hacking around on stupid games

166
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,360
and stuff and playing Ludum Dare and, and, you know, entering competitions.

167
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,300
And that's not CEO material, CEOs don't do that.

168
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,320
So I can see why he wanted to sell it.

169
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,440
You know, two years ago or whatever he said, billion is my price and the only company who's

170
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,960
going to pay two billion for Minecraft is Microsoft.

171
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Yeah.

172
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,400
With their nice overseas cash pile.

173
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,920
Blaster, are you a Minecraft player?

174
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Yes.

175
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
I didn't know that.

176
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:40,040
And actually the, the server on the servers on Xbox live actually don't, they're not spun

177
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,400
up on Microsoft servers.

178
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,440
You actually host it on your console and then the party connects to you.

179
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,280
So your friends can't, you have to spin up your save and then some people have to come

180
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,880
and connect to you while you're online.

181
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,120
And then once you close Minecraft, it's offline.

182
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,320
Wow.

183
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,560
That's interesting.

184
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
That makes sense.

185
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,400
It works almost exactly like the mobile version.

186
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Okay.

187
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,240
I like, see, I like the idea of a persistent world that people can be visiting all the

188
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
time.

189
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,400
That's, I think one of the coolest things when we had active, I don't know if they still

190
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
are active or not.

191
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
The Minecraft servers for Jupiter broadcast.

192
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
You just go in there.

193
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Oh God, yeah.

194
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
They are totally active.

195
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Yeah.

196
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,720
So you can go in there and there's just tons of people working on stuff.

197
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
So that's really cool.

198
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,360
My kids play on that as well and that's, that's another thing is having a game that your kids

199
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,400
can play, which is a safe environment.

200
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,440
Like if it's a curated server like Jupiter is where you know that the people aren't going

201
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,320
to mess about with your kids and you're not going to get dangerous people talking to them.

202
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,840
You can leave them playing on the PC for a while.

203
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Yeah.

204
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,880
You know, it's cool when my kids come in and they say, Hey dad, do you want to play on

205
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
the JB server?

206
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
That's quite cool.

207
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
You know?

208
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Yeah, it is really cool.

209
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,320
And I like the idea too that, I mean, I think sure you could make the argument that, you

210
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,120
know, it has to be maybe try to be balanced with, with other things, but at the same time

211
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,820
it's like, out of all the video games you could play for kids, Minecraft really seems

212
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,500
like it's gotta be not like, like super like healthier educational or something, but it

213
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,220
seems like it's, it's cultivating something like a creativity and building and problem

214
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,760
solving and, and, and, and resource management and all of these things that are actually

215
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,400
really good life skills.

216
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Yeah.

217
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Okay.

218
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Yeah.

219
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,520
You know, you can try and make an argument for it in the same way that when I had a Sinclair

220
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,520
Spectrum back in 1980, I would try and make the argument that I was doing my homework.

221
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Yeah.

222
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Yeah.

223
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,520
Yeah.

224
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
Yeah.

225
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Same thing goes with Minecraft.

226
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Yeah.

227
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
It's educational mom.

228
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Really.

229
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Yeah.

230
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
But it's also, yeah.

231
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Yeah.

232
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Minecraft has a really cool server too.

233
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
Yeah.

234
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Yeah.

235
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Some of the stuff they have on there.

236
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Yeah.

237
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Yeah.

238
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
They have a really great server.

239
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,440
I love that my son learned about smelting and different types of trees from Minecraft.

240
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
That's quite cool.

241
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
That is really cool.

242
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Hmm.

243
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,840
Well, the only thing I was thinking that maybe would change like the game, like I, I would,

244
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,000
if I was gonna look at my crystal ball, it seems like they're still going to ship to

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
all the same platforms.

246
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,720
They're probably not going to remove any features.

247
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,320
They'll probably make some things better and maybe make it more developer accessible.

248
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,200
But then you got to wonder if like years down the road, if there's just like really hard

249
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
things to measure that just never pan out.

250
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,040
Like this is a bad example, I think, but I'm working on the idea still like say like, say

251
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,920
like on Mojang's like five year roadmap, they have like this really awesome Twitch slash

252
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,840
YouTube live streaming integration.

253
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,200
I made the argument in tech talk today that potentially like maybe it was even going to

254
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,240
be server side where on the Linux server you'd have like this virtual camera that could live

255
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,020
stream multiple angles to different streaming services, right?

256
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,000
Well now that, now that Microsoft owns it, you know, they're not going to, they're not

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,100
going to integrate a feature that connects directly into Google's live streaming platform

258
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,220
or their, or Amazon's now either.

259
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,720
So there could be some things like that that would have been cross pollination because

260
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,520
Mojang was independent and didn't have any entrenched market interest that would influence

261
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,440
those types of decisions.

262
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,800
Now that freedom has been removed from them and there's going to be those types of biases

263
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,200
that will sort of form the future direction of what the game can and cannot do.

264
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:07,000
That's already happened once in the Twitch TV integration is Windows only.

265
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Hmm.

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Wow.

267
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That sucks.

268
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah.

269
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah.

270
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I mean, screw those guys, right?

271
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,260
I think that's more, I think that's more that they're using a third party library.

272
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,240
So whenever you bring in third party stuff that you haven't written, you're dependent

273
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,720
upon whatever platforms they support and the, whatever library they've used for Twitch

274
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,560
TV doesn't support anything other than Windows, I believe.

275
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Yeah.

276
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,960
It's, it's because it's not Java at all.

277
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,120
I actually believe it's a DLL file.

278
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Like it's brought down.

279
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Oh sweet.

280
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
I love DLLs.

281
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
I know.

282
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Sweet.

283
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Isn't it a beautiful thing?

284
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,720
You know how I like, you know how I like my libraries?

285
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:47,200
Dynamic and lean.

286
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's prepared to finally just

287
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,000
break down and invest in a caffeine IV.

288
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,800
My name is Chris.

289
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
My name is Matt.

290
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Hey Matt.

291
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Oh man.

292
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,060
I did one of these things where I, I had a couple of rough nights and then I was dumb

293
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,840
last night and I had too much to drink, Matt.

294
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,280
I had too much to drink and I woke up in the middle of the night with a hangover, like

295
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,840
in the middle of the night and I couldn't go back to sleep.

296
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
And it wasn't even that much.

297
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
I'm just a lightweight now, Matt.

298
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
What's that mean?

299
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
Does that mean I'm getting too old to drink?

300
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,860
I got to just stick to my prune juice.

301
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,600
You need the chat room there to like tell you all the things that you should have done

302
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,280
beforehand because that usually really helps.

303
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
That's true.

304
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Especially like, you know, hey Chris, you need to drink more water.

305
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Right.

306
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
You need HTML5.

307
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
Right.

308
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
You know, you need some other stuff.

309
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Yeah.

310
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,680
You know, I do like to get, I do like the hindsight 2020 advice that the chat room is

311
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,880
so good at providing.

312
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
And they're doing it out of love.

313
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
I mean, it's a great thing.

314
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
It is.

315
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,760
All right, so we're going to do a show today out of love.

316
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,040
We got a lot of your feedback to get through this week.

317
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Some really good stuff.

318
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,780
I've picked the best of the best.

319
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,580
And then Aaron Saigo took to Google Plus early one morning and said the community manager

320
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,960
role is a fraud and a farce.

321
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
And we'll break it down.

322
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
We'll talk about it.

323
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,040
I have a feeling that there may be some disagreements in the show today on that topic and we'll

324
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,680
bring in our mumble room.

325
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,680
And then after that, we're going to get into a few other topics time remaining and pertaining,

326
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,480
including potentially a little bit of info about some future changes coming to some Linux

327
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
distributions near you.

328
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,920
So we'll talk about all of that stuff as well as some additional links towards the end of

329
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
the show.

330
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Got a lot of stuff to cover today.

331
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
I'm just going through it right now.

332
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,680
I'm looking at the papers and I'm thinking, dang, this is looking like a pretty busy week.

333
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,160
I think our news cycle has come back.

334
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,560
I think the news is starting to pick back up again.

335
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,480
In fact, we've seen some really big things go down this week.

336
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,240
So I think we're going to have a huge news segment on the Linux Action Show on Sunday.

337
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,680
But today, our duty is to focus on the feedback, to focus on the people.

338
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,800
And so Stefan writes in and he says, hey, Chris and Matt, I don't know if you have already

339
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,640
seen the leaked preview of Windows 9, but in case you didn't know, there's quite some,

340
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,920
let's call it progress in this hell of a stagnation that Microsoft calls Windows.

341
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Anyways, to keep it short, they integrated multiple workspaces.

342
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,420
Oh, nice.

343
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,200
And when they finally developed something usable, however, you might think it looks

344
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,320
a little familiar.

345
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,600
My biggest concern is that I almost hear these F-ers at Microsoft, fanboys claim that Microsoft

346
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,320
opened up a whole new perspective of user experiences.

347
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,600
And I can predict that if you tell them multiple workspaces isn't something new because Apple

348
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,440
and Linux had this for years, they'll respond with, but Microsoft made it awesome and usable.

349
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,680
So have you seen this implementation of virtual desktops on Windows 9?

350
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
I have.

351
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,440
And just the interface as a whole, not just the implementation, but the interface as a

352
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,560
whole is the best box of Crayola crayons I've ever seen.

353
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,320
Yeah, it is very, yeah.

354
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,000
It looks like iOS 7 smacked Windows.

355
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Absolutely.

356
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,160
We throw enough color at it, people are going to think it looks great.

357
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,720
And that, and just, I'm so blown away at how they come up with concepts.

358
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,400
I can't even wrap my brain around it.

359
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,240
I don't even, I don't even know.

360
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
I don't even know.

361
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,200
So I have it in the video version here.

362
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,460
You can see their dynamic workspaces, all a gnome and, or, and, and of course other desktops

363
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
as well.

364
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,200
I guess actually Mac OS 10 has dynamic workspaces as well.

365
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,000
And then you can see, you can drag the windows around and move them.

366
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,840
I, you know, I mean, I'm not going to use this because I don't use Windows.

367
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,200
I guess it's nice to have it for Windows users finally.

368
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:18,480
It is, I think what is interesting is like, remember how like Windows 8 came out and Microsoft's

369
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
all like, yeah, so the desktop's dead.

370
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,800
We have that classic interface, quote unquote, when you need it, but you should do everything

371
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,200
in the new modern UI.

372
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
That's the future.

373
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,400
And now this version of Windows is coming out and they're like, hey, so we know you

374
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
like the desktops.

375
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
We're going to give you more desktops.

376
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,440
You can in fact have unlimited desktops.

377
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,480
How about some desktops, everybody?

378
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
Exactly.

379
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,000
And it's like, and not only that, but we're going to borrow it.

380
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,120
We're going to, we're going to travel back in time and basically provide an implementation

381
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,920
that quite honestly looks a bit dated.

382
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,920
Yeah.

383
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,160
It looks actually a little clunky to me.

384
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
It's not very smooth.

385
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
It does.

386
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,520
It feels a little bit like a, a little bit like an early KDE, maybe two point something

387
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,280
kind of, you know, thrust up some cookies on top of something.

388
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
I don't know.

389
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,440
They need to add a little, a little, a little, a little animation factor in there.

390
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Give it some, give it some jazz.

391
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Right.

392
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Put a little jazz in that desktop.

393
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Microsoft Biz.

394
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Microsoft Biz.

395
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
There you go.

396
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Yeah.

397
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Cause that's what makes it usable.

398
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
A spinning cube.

399
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
Yeah.

400
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
We'll add a spinning cube.

401
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
It is funny though.

402
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,680
So when they decide to reinvest in the desktop and sort of double down on it, what do they

403
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
do?

404
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,720
They go rip off features from Unix desktops.

405
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
Absolutely.

406
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
So there you go.

407
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
One stop shopping.

408
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,800
Redmond has indeed restarted their copy machines.

409
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,960
So yeah, I thought we'd just, it's always fun to kind of, you know, poke at my, poke

410
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
at Microsoft.

411
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
I mean, come on.

412
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
We had to.

413
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
It's so easy.

414
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
So Eric, you're here, right?

415
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
You're still here, Eric.

416
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Good.

417
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
We have a question that is right up your alley.

418
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,120
So Scotty ZA writes in, he says, hello, I'm loving, with a U, all the JB awesomeness.

419
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,800
I have a new Dell PC on the way.

420
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,920
The first thing I'm going to do is drop kick Windows 8 and install some Ubuntu goodness

421
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
on there.

422
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,400
It's going to be the gnome variety of it.

423
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,280
The Dell came with, comes with a touch screen and I was wondering how the gnome touch, touch

424
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,320
gestures are and if there's anything I need to watch out for or things that could improve

425
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
the experience.

426
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,600
Pseudo thanks, Scotty ZA.

427
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
So Eric, I know you got a touch screen laptop.

428
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,800
You've been trying out gnome, KDE and Unity with it.

429
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,360
What are your thoughts with regards to gnome's sort of touch features that are there right

430
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
now?

431
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,160
Well, the gnome touch features that are there right now in 3.12 are not up to the par of

432
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Unity yet.

433
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,920
So you can't resize your window.

434
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,740
You can't, you can drag your windows, but only from the title bar.

435
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,800
And I've noticed that gnome shell will tend to crash every now and then if you try that.

436
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Oh, really?

437
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Ouch.

438
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Yeah.

439
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
So it's not up to par.

440
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,280
Gnome 3.14 coming out later this month, if not the beginning of next month, that should

441
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,920
solidify their touch screen.

442
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,480
So 3.14 right now though, in your experience so far, Unity is the champion when it comes

443
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,080
to full touch screen support.

444
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Correct.

445
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Yeah.

446
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,040
And you also, does gnome have an onscreen keyboard?

447
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,760
I do, but you'd have, I really don't know.

448
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
It's handy.

449
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
I'm sure you could get one.

450
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,840
I mean, the one that comes with Unity is pretty nice and it's really easy to use.

451
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,600
It's a standard one, so I think you could just load it anywhere.

452
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,840
But anyways, so it sounds like, so what?

453
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,120
You can close windows, maybe you could open the activities menu, but you're not going

454
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,040
to be resizing windows or dragging windows around or, and there's no right click or anything

455
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
like that?

456
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Right.

457
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
There's no right click.

458
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,600
It's just, it doesn't work very well.

459
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,000
I mean, the best touch screen interfaces they have is the activities menu itself, but also

460
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Right.

461
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I would think so.

462
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah.

463
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yeah.

464
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,480
The activities menu itself is very touch screen friendly, but also the lock screen, but beyond

465
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:31,640
that the window management in 3.12 is not up to par, 3.14 is getting there, is going

466
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
to start to get there.

467
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
Okay.

468
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:40,720
And I know I asked you, but you've been trying it out too on KDE Plasma 4?

469
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,280
Plasma 4 and Plasma 5.

470
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,600
It's still not up to par.

471
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,520
They haven't done anything with multi-touch gestures or anything.

472
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
Okay.

473
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,240
And by the way, a little correction, Wikileaks pointed out in the chat room, GNOME 3.12 does

474
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,280
not have this, but GNOME 3.14 is going to have a long presses right click.

475
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
Okay.

476
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Oh, okay.

477
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Oh yes.

478
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
You know what?

479
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
I've read about that.

480
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Right-o.

481
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Yes.

482
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
I do recalls.

483
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Do I hear music?

484
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Oh yeah.

485
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Hey, it's my daily collections call.

486
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,280
Of course, I'm not in collections, but somebody is that gave out my number.

487
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,800
So this is the default Sailfish OS ringtone.

488
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Nice right?

489
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I can dance to that.

490
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Doesn't that sound good?

491
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Yeah.

492
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Sounds awesome.

493
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
And I've got a cool pirate ship in the background.

494
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,120
Oh, I wasn't able to answer it in time.

495
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
Darn.

496
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:34,920
I really like the Sailfish OS call interface, but it's a little funky because sometimes

497
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,200
you have to swipe in a certain direction to answer the call and if you're just late enough

498
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,880
it's that that that animation of making the swipe is just long enough that you miss the

499
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
call.

500
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
It's all right.

501
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
It's cool.

502
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
I'm just experimenting with it.

503
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
I'm just experimenting with it.

504
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
All right, Matt.

505
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,120
You know what else I'm experimenting with?

506
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,480
My mind over at linuxacademy.com go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to get our special discount

507
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,080
deal linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

508
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,880
So I've told you a lot about Linux Academy, how they're always working on their courseware,

509
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,600
new features and things like that.

510
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:13,440
Today, I got an email from Anthony, the founder of linuxacademy.com and he says he's passing

511
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,200
along some of the new exciting things they're working on and it's really something.

512
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,280
He says, our new lab platform now allows the users to have four running Linux servers at

513
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,320
one time.

514
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,640
You can have any distribution you would like from a list as well as two public host names

515
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,000
for each server.

516
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,880
You can even assign each server a role.

517
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,240
Let's say you want to have a DB server and another one to be a DNS server.

518
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,040
You can now label those roles to help you remember which lab you're working with and

519
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,520
you can have people, you can work with other people now.

520
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,200
They have cool new learning and plans too that allow users to select daily availability

521
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,040
and based on that availability, a study plan is automatically created for them.

522
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,600
So you say, I have this much time available and they will generate a plan that you can

523
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,580
go through and learn something.

524
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,040
Learning plans will give you the lessons and quizzes and labs that are due on each day

525
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,880
as well as even send you email reminders that you have items due on that day.

526
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,880
Based on your availability, it will even give you a projected completion date of the course

527
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,280
with some extra time included for studying.

528
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,040
How freaking cool is that, right?

529
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,160
He says, we're also really excited to announce the immediate availability of a few extra

530
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,720
courses we've been working on.

531
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,300
Today we've announced Chef Fundamentals, CentOS 7 Enterprise updates as well as Apache Tomcat.

532
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,200
We've launched our deploy and manage open stack on Ubuntu and Icehouse which is 50%

533
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,020
complete and they're working on it right now.

534
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,960
We have a list of 14 upcoming courses throughout the remainder of the year.

535
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,400
He's going to send me updates when they've got them.

536
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Isn't that awesome?

537
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,120
Sure, they're doing all this stuff.

538
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,420
You know, real servers with host names that you can have people publicly log in, these

539
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,600
automated coursewares, these learning plans, 350 new videos and content before the end

540
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,720
of the year, more scenario-based learning labs than ever before, all of these new additions,

541
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,960
no price increase.

542
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,640
You just get them as part of your Linux Academy subscription.

543
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,160
It just comes as part of the subscription.

544
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,520
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged right now.

545
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,800
You'll get that 33% discount.

546
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,580
That makes it a great deal.

547
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,480
You can go over there and learn courses on R-Sync and OpenStack and AWS, pick from any

548
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,040
of the seven plus Linux distributions.

549
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,120
The courseware will automatically adjust the documentation so that way it matches the distribution

550
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,720
you've chosen which is a really great way to also get up to speed on another distro

551
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,380
if you've taken on a job where you have to change your distro.

552
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,520
What a great way to get up to speed or if you know it's time to finally make that R-Sync

553
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,120
backup script, why not go take the R-Sync courseware?

554
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,520
And they're always adding new stuff as well as live videos and all that kind of stuff.

555
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,080
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a really big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

556
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
the Unplugged program.

557
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,240
You guys rock and great work you guys on the new updates.

558
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,480
That's crazy awesome.

559
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,680
I love the automated learning courses.

560
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,880
That's man.

561
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
If I...

562
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
They'll get you learning on.

563
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Well, I'm just thinking like, you know, I could go in there and say, all right, I need

564
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,000
a learning plan and I've got, I've got, you know, this much time this week to do it.

565
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,720
I just, I love that.

566
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
I think that's a really great system.

567
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
All right.

568
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,040
So Alec writes in, we had a ton, a ton, a ton of email about our Assistant D discussion

569
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,800
and I think a couple of people felt like it was our first time.

570
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,320
Maybe they were kind of new to the show and they didn't realize that we've done past episodes

571
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
on this.

572
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,900
So they felt, some people wrote in and felt like we left some, some details out and sort

573
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,680
of jumped in mid conversation.

574
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,920
So I apologize if that is how you felt.

575
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,640
I would suggest maybe go check the Unplugged back catalogue.

576
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,520
We've done a couple of episodes on it with some really good discussion that does fill

577
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,120
in some of the background details.

578
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,600
But Alec wrote in, he says, hi Chris, Matt and chat room.

579
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,000
And I thought Alec had one of the more interesting anti-System D concerns.

580
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,200
Like, like he's not like opposed to System D, but he's bringing up a concern about System

581
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,120
D that I think maybe has some merit worth discussing, discussing outside of what we

582
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,600
normally hear about, you know, some of the other issues that we've discussed before.

583
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,600
He says, I want to chime in with my thoughts about the recent System D discussion.

584
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,400
As a system administrator, I like System D and its innovative new features like D-Bus

585
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
and socket activation.

586
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Yeah.

587
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
You know what?

588
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
I agree with that.

589
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,040
But I have some concerns about its long-term viability.

590
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,880
From what I see, the main problem with System D is that it's a large attack surface, which

591
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,280
could lead to security problems in the future.

592
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,880
Also, because System D will be adopted by all Linux, I fear it could become a major

593
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
target for attackers.

594
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,560
In short, I think System D is a good thing for Linux right now.

595
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,240
But in the future, it could become insecure and unmaintainable.

596
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,280
And because more and more projects are starting to depend on System D, it could become a painful

597
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,480
process to move away from System D.

598
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,200
Thanks for all the awesome shows, Alec.

599
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,400
And I want to add to that, even outside of security, what about just code creep where

600
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,940
something gets to be such a massive project and it impacts so many distributions and so

601
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,960
many users whenever you change it, that it sort of becomes like this weight, this anchor

602
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:46,160
on Linux because you have this whole layer now that has to be updated and it has potentially

603
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,800
dramatic effects across the board.

604
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,000
Obviously, there's ways and updates that maybe would have very minimal impacts, but you have

605
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,040
to wonder if that could become a source of stagnation.

606
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,360
I wonder what you think, Matt.

607
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,800
Do you think there's a potential that maybe System D is going to make a large attack surface

608
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,280
for Linux, a common attack platform, or maybe an anchor that slows us down?

609
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,420
Or do you think the folks at Red Hat and people working on System D can stay on top of it?

610
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,200
I think at this point they can stay on top of it.

611
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,800
I think it's going to be something that they need to be vigilantly aware of and proactive

612
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,680
on because you never know, it could develop into what that concern addresses.

613
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,040
But I think at this point it's too early to tell and I don't see any point in borrowing

614
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
trouble.

615
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,920
I'm not saying to fall asleep at the wheel, but I'm just saying let's keep our eyes open.

616
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,160
But at the same time, let's go ahead and keep pushing forward.

617
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,100
It hasn't created any problems yet that are really significant that I'm aware of for my

618
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,600
personal use.

619
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,000
Others may have other gripes, I don't know.

620
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,480
For me personally, it's been great.

621
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Okay, Daredevil.

622
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,880
And you think it's not about security, but something else?

623
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
Yes.

624
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:50,680
So we saw what happened, like Linux as the kernel is super complicated now to get in

625
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,160
as a maintainer or to start contributing.

626
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,320
It's famous for that.

627
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,440
That is kind of the problem that I find.

628
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,760
Not the security aspect, we can solve security aspects.

629
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,400
I mean, we've been solving them in multiple fronts and now there's even a specialized

630
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
group for it.

631
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,680
But I think companies getting a hold on who maintains System D now becomes more and more

632
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,360
parts being just company control.

633
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,480
Even though community always have a say, that's actually more dangerous than the security

634
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
aspect.

635
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Yeah.

636
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,080
I think you have to look at the kernel and you say, yeah, the kernel is not a one to

637
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,920
one analog, but it is an interesting way to compare it to a large bit of code that obviously

638
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,200
impacts every Linux distribution and even mobile devices.

639
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,780
And yet we make that work, don't we?

640
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,780
We have that working.

641
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,480
I think it's in part because we have the right people on the job and I feel like right now

642
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,480
we have the right people on the job, but these things can change.

643
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,600
I do not know if I totally buy in with Alec on the... And I think Alec's not the only

644
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,400
one who's worried about the quote unquote System D lock in.

645
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,840
I'm not so worried about that really.

646
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,380
It's kind of a funny thing.

647
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,180
One of the reasons we all want a free and open platform is because we want to avoid

648
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,240
those problems and then we still worry about those problems even though it's open source

649
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,480
code with documented APIs and things like that.

650
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,520
So at some point we kind of just have to acknowledge we have to adopt a technology, but realize

651
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,720
that we can build our way out too if we need to.

652
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,560
I don't think it's as much lock in as people think.

653
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
All right, Fred, what do you think?

654
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:30,120
No, I just wanted to mention that I think there were these patches to get System D working

655
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:39,040
on BSD systems early days of System D and they were not accepted because the developers

656
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,080
thought they only wanted to target Linux and didn't accept patches for portability.

657
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Very good.

658
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,000
And Blackout rightly points out... Sorry, I just mentioned I didn't want to lose track

659
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
of this.

660
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,500
Almost 600 people contribute to System D, 200 alone in the last 12 months.

661
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,720
So there's a lot of people that are working on System D.

662
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,680
I think that seems like a lot of eyeballs.

663
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,360
I mean, it seems like a lot of people have got their fingers on the pulse and are watching

664
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
what's going on.

665
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,480
To me, that's my perspective.

666
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,080
So here's what we did, is Producer Q5 says put together a simple System D opinion survey

667
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,080
that we put out for folks to go take advantage of and just plug through the questions and

668
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,360
just so we can get a little data to kind of see where everybody's coming from in this

669
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,560
... where their heads at... Jack, close your mic.

670
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,000
And so it's a simple System D opinion survey and it's up on the subreddit right now.

671
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,240
I'll have it linked in the show notes.

672
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,840
We've got quite a bit of responses.

673
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,600
Q5 is going to be releasing the results in the future.

674
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,240
And it's not like a definitive scientific study, but I think it'll be interesting to

675
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,080
see where people who have different opinions, where they all stand and what their experience

676
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,840
level is and things like that.

677
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,880
So we'll have that linked in the show notes and if you'd like to participate in the survey,

678
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,000
we'll talk about the results in an upcoming episode.

679
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,240
And also you can keep sending your System D feedback in if you've got something really

680
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
good.

681
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,120
We'll put it on there, but either way I'll even read it so that way we can just at least

682
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,400
incorporate it into our opinions.

683
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,280
Hey, speaking of producers, we just heard from Eric a little bit ago and I want to plug

684
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,560
something for Producer Michael aka RottenCorps.

685
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:12,040
YouGet Beta 2 is coming and available for beta testing and YouGet is a great downloader

686
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
for Linux.

687
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,260
We've covered it before in the Linux Action Show and RottenCorps is one of the developers

688
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,260
for it.

689
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,700
And they just put out a new beta for their brand new version coming out.

690
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,700
So we'll link to that in the show notes.

691
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,000
It's a great downloader, YouGet, and it's my preferred way if I download large ISO images

692
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,680
and I don't want to leave my browser running and I'm doing, I like, you know, if I'm not

693
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,800
doing the torrent, I generally do the torrent, but if for some reason I'm doing an HTTP download,

694
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
boom.

695
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Boom.

696
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
There you go.

697
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
YouGet is where it goes, Matt, like a boss.

698
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Nice.

699
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Like a boss.

700
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,640
Hey, speaking of like a boss, I want to tell you about something else that's like a boss

701
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
and that's DigitalOcean.

702
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,120
Go over to DigitalOcean.com right now, DigitalOcean.com.

703
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,640
Not just walk, not just trot, but full on gallop because we've got a promo code that

704
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,560
will get you two months for free of a DigitalOcean droplet.

705
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,160
I know, it's crazy, if you use the promo code unplugged September, you're going to get armed

706
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
with a $10 credit.

707
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Oh.

708
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,200
So you see that value there, you get, for $10 you get two months of DigitalOcean service.

709
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Why?

710
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,640
Because they have pricing plans that start at only $5 per month.

711
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,920
That'll get you a 512 megabyte RAM droplet with a 20 gigabyte SSD, one blazing fast CPU,

712
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,760
and a terabyte of transfer connected to tier one bandwidth.

713
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,800
You don't know what DigitalOcean is?

714
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,600
My friend DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

715
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,280
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

716
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,840
And they've got droplet centers everywhere, or maybe you call them data centers, I don't

717
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
know.

718
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,480
Say like, oh I don't know, New York, you heard of that?

719
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
You heard of New York, right?

720
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,240
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, and they're rolling out new features all the

721
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
time.

722
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,040
Their interface is crazy simple and intuitive.

723
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,560
Their control panel is very powerful, but if you want to even go beyond that, they've

724
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,680
got a straightforward API that you can take advantage of.

725
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,480
DigitalOcean has also recently rolled out IPv6 in some of their data centers, CoreOS,

726
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,040
private networking, it gets better and better and better.

727
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,040
One of the things I love about the private networking is not only does that allow you

728
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,440
to build the etcd cluster you're gonna need to configure your CoreOS rigs, but it also

729
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,520
allows you to have say, a front end web server with a back end database server that isn't

730
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,380
exposed to the internet, and the best part is, there's no charge for the transfer over

731
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,560
that private link.

732
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,240
That's how awesome DigitalOcean is.

733
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,000
Something else that's kind of cool, and another great reason to hold on to Unplug September,

734
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,540
you can also do hourly pricing over at DigitalOcean.

735
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,420
This is super useful if you're doing testing, and you need to do it up somewhere that actually

736
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,800
has decent performance, where a lot of people can get to it, and you can turn it on, turn

737
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,440
it off, take snapshots, deploy, redeploy.

738
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,680
This is a great use of their hourly pricing structure.

739
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,040
It's so awesome, and their control panel makes it crazy easy to just get up and going.

740
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,400
DigitalOcean.com.

741
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,880
Unplug September when you check out, and a big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

742
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
Linux Unplugged.

743
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,240
I'll tell you, I keep spinning up droplets, I kind of say, oh, I really need to do that

744
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
one thing.

745
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
And I'll just spin up a droplet.

746
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
It's great.

747
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Oh yeah.

748
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Oh yeah.

749
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,480
Aaron Saigo lit the world on fire via Google Plus yesterday at 3.01 a.m.

750
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,120
I don't know why he's posting at 3.01 a.m., but that's what he was.

751
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,000
And I'm just going to read a few highlights, and then we can get into the meat and potatoes

752
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
of it here.

753
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
He says, here we go.

754
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,520
Flamethrowers on everyone.

755
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
Here's what I feel.

756
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,980
The community manager role that is increasingly common in the free software world is a fraud

757
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,260
and a farce.

758
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,880
The community manager role is a fraud and a farce, he says.

759
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:21,080
If your community has a quote-unquote manager, then it isn't being treated as a community

760
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,320
and probably isn't a community to begin with.

761
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,620
Community has an actual meaning that transcends a crowd.

762
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:32,480
Community is a structure derived from the self-determination of shared values.

763
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,320
Communities don't have managers, synthetic organizations do.

764
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,640
Nearly all community managers in free software ecosystems work for companies that own and

765
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,900
manage products that that community they are managing are built around, and that's not

766
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
a coincidence.

767
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,840
Communities, real ones, have facilitators and leaders of various forms and stripes.

768
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,640
It's okay if they do get paid, and if they're able to spend time and energy facilitating

769
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,600
and leading, but they damn sure are not managers of the community.

770
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,000
They are accountable to the community, selected by the community, and drive their influence

771
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
from the community consensus and can be replaced by the community at the community's behest.

772
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,640
Does that sound like the free software community managers you know?

773
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,600
I'd be fine in the situation if there's some honesty on the ground about this because then

774
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,560
we wouldn't be tainting the word community for those blessed souls who have managed to

775
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,680
actually erect the real deal.

776
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,120
There wouldn't be quite so many diluted individuals out there who think that they're a true stakeholder

777
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,580
with equitable rights and privileges in the actual community.

778
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:38,880
In summary, a community manager is really an audience handler, as in they handle you

779
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:44,000
as members of their audience, as part of their marketing program, and frankly, I've run out

780
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,960
of patience for this deception.

781
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
Get off my lawn.

782
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,720
Matt, I'll open the floor to you.

783
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,640
So I don't subscribe to his thoughts or his feed for obvious reasons, because personally,

784
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,680
so let's take a step back and let's go to this thing called Wikipedia and let's look

785
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,280
at what the term community is.

786
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,080
A community is a social unit of any size that shares common values.

787
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
Period.

788
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,440
Okay.

789
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,200
Why is it a problem to have a name of manager or facilitator or reach around guy or whatever

790
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:22,500
you want to call them that comes in and facilitates, I don't know, something we like to call communication

791
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,800
between a large mob of people and in some cases a company or in some cases, I don't

792
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,320
know, the developers.

793
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,400
Fun fact, developers and end users don't always speak the same language.

794
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:39,200
Sometimes it requires a manager to come in and help facilitate that line of communication.

795
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,640
His post was the biggest pile of drivel I've ever read in my entire life.

796
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
He's a nice guy.

797
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
I like him, but this pissed me off.

798
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,120
It was absolute nonsense.

799
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
Absolute crap.

800
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,360
I couldn't even wrap my head around it.

801
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,200
I'm hoping he was drunk because it's like, was he just up to a fight?

802
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:59,060
I mean, he's such a nice guy and I mean, I like the guy I do, but he's just so negative

803
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,640
about nothing.

804
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,360
It's like, oh my God, relax.

805
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
Take a pill.

806
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Take your own.

807
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
Do something.

808
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:11,520
I do wonder, I think part of the problem is the term community manager can mean a lot

809
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,720
of different things to a lot of different groups and businesses, so you can't blanket

810
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,120
hate on just one term.

811
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,280
I mean, it might not be the right manager, might not be the right word.

812
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,800
So I'll take the opposite.

813
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,840
I'll play devil's advocate here and I don't know if it is fair to compare the community

814
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:36,340
of Jupiter Broadcasting to the community of, say, a well-established open source project.

815
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,340
I don't know if that's fair or not.

816
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:44,880
I would guess the Jupiter Broadcasting community size probably dwarfs many open source projects

817
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,560
that aren't super famous, right?

818
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,560
Easily.

819
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,560
Yeah.

820
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:57,200
So we have a huge community, huge, and I very consciously have chosen to, whenever we start

821
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,000
up a new aspect of the community somewhere, to generally sort of wind my involvement down.

822
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,280
I don't know if manage is the right... curate.

823
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,040
I'll curate the community there for a bit and then sort of wind myself down as I notice

824
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,920
certain personalities in the community sort of stand up and take on leadership roles.

825
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,560
Not even leadership roles so much as much as just... I don't know how to explain it.

826
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
I really don't.

827
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,880
But let's take this mumble room that we're all in right now.

828
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,720
This is something that Blaster, on his own initiative, went out and created and now he

829
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,160
is the operator of our mumble room.

830
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,560
I didn't set that up.

831
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,720
Blaster set that up and everybody knows that it's Blaster's creation here and that is,

832
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,680
in my opinion, community taking on their own leadership in a much more organic and real

833
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,880
way than when you have an artificial manager who really kind of more ends up playing PR

834
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,240
guy and try to smooth things over and a lot of times kind of keeps the community at arm's

835
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,320
length from the business.

836
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,440
So the business is allowed to make the decisions it needs to make to be a profitable business

837
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,400
and then the community manager ends up being the guy who tries to sell it to the community

838
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,520
and tells everybody we're having a great time and it's really because of your participation

839
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
that it's all working out.

840
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
Oh absolutely.

841
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,740
And that drives me crazy.

842
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,640
It does and that's the mark of a poor community manager.

843
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,200
If you're working on stuff like Operation Lightning Rod, which I've actually known people

844
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,720
that worked on an operation called Operation Lightning Rod as a community manager, it exists.

845
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,500
If you're in those situations, yeah, that's a bad situation to be in and that's honestly

846
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,520
a bad role to be in.

847
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,280
But at the end of the day, if something happens with Jupiter Broadcasting, generally speaking,

848
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,040
you or Angela or maybe even one of the producers will reach out to the community and say, hey,

849
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,360
by the way, we're going to do this, that and the other thing.

850
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,280
There's some information passed.

851
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,880
We have a more distributed system where there's producers and staff and generally speaking,

852
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,920
you take on that role a lot of it, especially it's like, hey, by the way, this is being

853
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,080
rescheduled or hey, we're going to be having this guest on or we're going to be doing that.

854
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,680
You're going to be making that communication happen.

855
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,840
You do need some kind of leadership in some fashion and sometimes it does fall to a person

856
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,720
that is hired for such a role.

857
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,640
It really just depends.

858
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,920
I do agree that when you get to a certain size, it does become easier to just make it

859
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,760
a person's responsibility because it can be one of the things that gets neglected and

860
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,600
also that sort of fits in better with how businesses are structured.

861
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,680
All right, well, this is your responsibility, Bob, and you're going to manage the community.

862
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,560
But I wonder if maybe there isn't a bit of a different approach that needs to be taken

863
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,280
when you are deriving some of your success from the fruits of labor of that community.

864
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,880
I think there needs to be a guide.

865
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,600
I think there needs to be like a community, like everybody gets together, including the

866
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,680
communities themselves to say, look, here's how not to be a D-bag when you're talking

867
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
to us.

868
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,200
Here's how to actually have like a level of, because a lot of times you are talking about

869
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,080
like let's say Red Hat and the Fedora project or whatever it may be.

870
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,520
You do need someone in between those things to actually make that conversation happen.

871
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,840
I've lived in this world for a long time.

872
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
You just do.

873
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Let's toss it to Popey.

874
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
I'd like to hear your thoughts on this, Popey.

875
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
Go ahead.

876
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:06,520
I read Aaron's post and I can see an argument there that's worthwhile.

877
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:13,360
I can see how it could be misconstrued that someone who works for a corporate entity who

878
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:19,640
tries to rally people around and basically do their bidding for them for free is not

879
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,080
a pleasant person to be, right?

880
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:31,640
And I can see how there's a good argument for that being not an appropriate person in

881
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
a community.

882
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:40,760
It's not a community person, but I would flip that around and say that I would say a company

883
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,200
who is comprised of a bunch of people who aren't necessarily close to the community,

884
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,880
who have a product that is used by a wide community of people, there needs to be an

885
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,600
interface between them.

886
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,400
If you hire people in the company who have never worked in an open source company, you've

887
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,840
got to be able to interface those people to these random drive-by community contributors

888
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,600
and say, look, this guy who just fixed a typo in your code, he's trustworthy.

889
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
He's a good guy.

890
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,560
You should accept that contribution.

891
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,400
That person could serve as an advocate for the community.

892
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
Right.

893
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,560
Or it could be just a drive-by edit and they're gone and then you'll never see them again.

894
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,200
They were just scratching an itch because in their language, that word didn't make sense

895
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
so they fixed it, right?

896
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,200
But I do feel like the core argument that Aaron's getting at that there has been a quote

897
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,440
unquote perversion of what the term means and what that role does, I think for a lot

898
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:47,780
of companies, a lot of times companies grow and all of a sudden the community almost becomes,

899
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,080
their view of them changes and the community shifts from asset to liability.

900
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,560
And now it's like this thing we need to manage so that way they don't damage our public perception.

901
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:04,440
And it becomes like this distorted time of, it's not community management so much as keeping

902
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,640
the community sort of boxed and that's not a good thing.

903
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,580
I can see how that perception can happen because I've seen that happen and I've seen people

904
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:22,320
being labeled as the PR guy or the guy who fixes when there's a problem in the community.

905
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:30,120
From my perspective, that's not the role I play but I can see how that could be seen.

906
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,280
The problem is that a lot of people outside of a particular community, and obviously I'm

907
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,600
speaking from experience of the Ubuntu community, look in and only see someone with a public

908
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:45,680
face like Jono, for example, and only see his public blog posts and his public conversations

909
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,480
with people and think that's all he does.

910
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,320
Right, he doesn't see the day to day.

911
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Right.

912
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:58,400
And the full calendar he had talking to, I'm not talking in the past tense as if he's dead

913
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,040
but just because he's known with the company.

914
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,000
The late Jono Bacon.

915
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Yeah.

916
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,800
He had a calendar that was full of meetings with people inside the company making sure

917
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:16,080
that the community's needs were addressed and that any decision that was made in the

918
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,000
company was made with full thought and respect for what the community wanted.

919
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,760
And whatever name you give that role, yeah, manager, he's got people under him in the

920
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,760
company.

921
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,760
Okay, he's a manager.

922
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,760
He deals with the community a lot.

923
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
Yeah, okay.

924
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
Let's put the word community in there.

925
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
Right, right, right.

926
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,520
You can futz around with the job title but the fact is that he's a very pro community

927
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:44,480
guy who is doing his best to interface a corporate entity with a community of contributors who

928
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,600
are doing what they're doing willingly and they can walk away at any time and they do.

929
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,600
You know?

930
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Right.

931
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:58,440
I object to Aaron's post mostly because I think he has a very blinkered view of the

932
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,080
term community manager and what a community manager is.

933
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
Bingo.

934
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,080
Yeah.

935
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,120
I mean, I totally see it from the – when you come at it from the inside of how a business

936
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,760
works, like it makes so much more sense versus when you look at it from the outside where

937
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,440
you just kind of end up seeing them continually play that PR buffer zone.

938
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,720
And I look at this and I think there is a lot of ways you can parse this.

939
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,760
There's a lot of ways you can change around the terms but I wanted to give Daredevilin

940
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,960
a chance to kind of get in because I know he's had a couple thoughts on this.

941
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,960
So Daredevilin, is that – is the semantics of this something you wanted to touch on?

942
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,840
Yes, because I don't think even the term is applied to the community.

943
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:42,000
I also think that the post is actually looking at the community creating and forming itself

944
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,160
around the company when actually a lot of times the companies go and join the communities

945
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,760
that already exist.

946
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,340
And it's like making the post is under the impression that the community is dependent

947
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,880
on the company when it's most of the time the other way around.

948
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,040
It can always go on their own and suddenly there's no point.

949
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:10,960
And I see the manager to be actually a manager for the company as like Poppy pointed out.

950
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,400
I completely agree.

951
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,040
And I get people PM me on IRC and say, hey, I've seen this winter phone thing, I'd

952
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,040
like to help out.

953
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,040
What can I do?

954
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,400
And my response, I'm the right person they should come to because I can point them in

955
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,880
the right direction, right?

956
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,880
Is that a community manager?

957
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,000
Well, that's not what my business card says but that's arguably what I'm doing.

958
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,440
People are coming to me and saying, hey, I'd like to contribute.

959
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,440
And I say, well, what do you know?

960
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,200
What do you want – what are you so passionate about?

961
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,880
What do you want to contribute to?

962
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,680
And these are people who have lives, they've got other jobs, they've got families, they've

963
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,200
got other stuff they need to be doing, but they're willing to contribute to a product

964
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,520
that's made by a corporation.

965
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,360
And if they're willing to do that, yeah, they can walk away at any time.

966
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,440
If they're willing to do that and they want to contribute, then it makes sense for the

967
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,000
company to have someone who is a point of contact for them, someone who can facilitate

968
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,180
that conversation and find the bugs that that person can fix or poke the right people inside

969
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:18,920
the company in order to fast-track a bug through or release a piece of software or whatever

970
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,920
it is.

971
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,600
That's what the community manager does.

972
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,680
It's not like running around the streets grabbing press-ganging people off the streets

973
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,280
and putting an Emacs in front of them and saying, you code for me now, that's your

974
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,400
job now and you work for me, bitch.

975
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
That's not what a community manager is.

976
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:40,160
The last time I held the position, no.

977
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,760
I wanted to give Eric a chance to chime in because Eric, I know that you've done a lot

978
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,800
of work with community management and taken training in it specifically.

979
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:54,080
Do you agree with Aaron's point that the term community is sort of being muddy down here?

980
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,440
It's getting sort of distorted by these corporations and it's sort of devaluing the term community

981
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,440
and what it actually means.

982
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,600
Do you think that's an issue?

983
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,000
I think it depends on the corporation.

984
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,920
Basically you've got a lot of volunteer management going on or community management as it's called.

985
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,280
You still have to have somebody who's acting as a liaison between the community and the

986
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,280
company.

987
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,300
When that person becomes a PR person, that's where it's getting a little fuzzy.

988
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:24,380
The person does have to inspire the community to do better things but at the same time they

989
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:29,480
also need to be putting the community toward the vision of the company and saying this

990
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,080
is kind of what we have in mind.

991
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,720
Do you guys like this?

992
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,840
And here's why we think this is a good idea.

993
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,840
So there's a lot to it.

994
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,400
There's a lot to it more than being a PR guy.

995
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,240
A lot to it more than just talking to the community.

996
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:52,440
It's a lot of trying to vision cast as I call it the vision of the company to the community

997
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,400
at large.

998
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,400
That's a huge part.

999
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,320
And also getting them involved in company events as well.

1000
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:07,160
The community manager in the past in Ubuntu would send out all the invites and figure

1001
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,240
out who were the kind of people that you needed at an Ubuntu developer summit and would send

1002
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,800
out invites to like 100 people to get them along and get them involved in conversations

1003
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,680
and planning about what's happening in the next release.

1004
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,040
And I've just had to do this.

1005
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,200
I've invited a bunch of people to come to a sprint in Washington to help us form Ubuntu

1006
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,200
phone.

1007
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,000
And these are people, yeah, they're giving up their own time to come along and help us

1008
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,360
figure out what a free software phone should look like in the future.

1009
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,680
And you need someone to do the crappy work of figuring out what flights they can go on

1010
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,000
working out what their visa requirements.

1011
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,760
Trust me, I've had to do this.

1012
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,520
So yeah, this is exactly what a community manager does.

1013
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,440
It's nowhere near as nefarious as Aaron makes it out to be.

1014
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,640
It might be in some companies, but not in my experience.

1015
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,760
Yeah, I guess that's the difference is when you get assigned community manager as your

1016
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,080
job title, what do they have in mind for you?

1017
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:08,760
Is your job to, you know, mollify the community and keep them from sending hate mail to the

1018
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,760
company?

1019
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,560
Or is it to get the most out of the community that you can to, you know, get as many of

1020
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:19,360
those people involved in actually forwarding the project along or what?

1021
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,360
I would say the latter, Alan.

1022
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,680
I would say all the above it's different with each company, what their why they decided

1023
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,360
they needed a community manager.

1024
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,240
That's why it's not black and white, because it is literally different for every single

1025
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,240
case.

1026
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
It's ambiguous.

1027
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:38,840
It's become a buzzword for a job title that could mean anything from I remember when the

1028
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,720
first time I heard it, it was when a company hired someone to manage like a forum about

1029
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,720
something.

1030
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,560
Yeah, see, this is this is the part of Aaron's post that I the registers with me is this

1031
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,960
has actually bothered these kinds of things have bothered me for a while.

1032
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,520
Alan, since you're here, would you would you can you give us an overview of how this works

1033
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,520
for FreeBSD?

1034
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,520
You guys have assigned liaisons?

1035
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,040
Is that how it works?

1036
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,040
Not really.

1037
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,160
Like there are certain people who volunteer to try to be that matchmaker type person like

1038
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,280
Popey was describing.

1039
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,840
There's I think it's FreeBSD help and a couple of their Twitter accounts that when they see

1040
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:18,080
somebody tweet having this problem with FreeBSD or whatever, they'll, you know, be like, hey,

1041
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,440
well, does this help?

1042
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,560
You know, make sure you file a PR or oh, that thing you're asking about.

1043
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,240
Well, why don't you talk to this person who's the guy that worked on that most recently

1044
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,960
or whatever, kind of like Popey was describing.

1045
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,040
But you know, the FreeBSD foundation doesn't pay someone to to do that.

1046
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,040
Gotcha.

1047
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,040
All right.

1048
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,480
Well, I wanted to get I want I want to cover Mark Shuttleworth's response because I actually

1049
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,000
really liked his response to Aaron's post.

1050
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,380
And as you'd expect, I'm one of Aaron's provocative Google Plus posts.

1051
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,640
The comments were about a mile long and just as I was about to abort because I was getting

1052
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,640
a little burned out on the comments, I saw Mark Shuttleworth's dragon and I had to read

1053
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,640
his post.

1054
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,520
So we'll we'll read what Mark Shuttleworth had to say.

1055
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,520
But first, I want to thank Ting over to Linux.Ting.com.

1056
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,520
That's right.

1057
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,520
Linux.Ting.com.

1058
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,160
That'll take twenty five dollars off your first Ting device.

1059
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,800
If you already got a Ting compatible device, they'll give you a twenty five dollar credit.

1060
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,560
That's also a great option to go if you're going to get one of their dedicated data units,

1061
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,340
like a little LTE hotspot device.

1062
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,340
So what is Ting?

1063
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,880
Well, Ting is truly mobile that is different.

1064
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,040
No contract, no early termination fee, and you only pay for what you use.

1065
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,000
Flat six dollars for the line, plus the taxes the man's going to take.

1066
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,160
And then it's just your usage.

1067
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,720
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, your megabytes, they add them all up at the end

1068
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,760
of the month, whatever bucket you fall into.

1069
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,460
That's what you pay.

1070
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:35,520
It's so much better than paying for the amount of minutes and data and text you may or may

1071
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,520
not use.

1072
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,960
That's such a freaking rip off.

1073
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,120
And the best part is to like if you if you've been feeling what a rip off that is and you're

1074
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,920
like, OK, it's time to do something differently.

1075
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,560
You can go over to Linux.Ting.com, try out their savings calculator, get an idea of what

1076
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,000
you'll save over like the two year contract period that you'll be getting away from.

1077
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,200
And if you're ready to make the jump but you're still in the contract, well Ting has an early

1078
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,840
termination relief program, Ting.com slash ETF, where they'll help pay seventy five dollars

1079
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,480
per line that you have to get canceled.

1080
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,360
That just sort of supercharges your transition over to Ting.

1081
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,280
And if you are an Apple user and you have an iPhone 5S or 5C, Ting has launched the

1082
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,720
countdown to when you can bring the 5S or 5C over to the Ting network, which is a great

1083
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,680
option if you are on that device now because you can take it and just get even more use

1084
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,680
out of it.

1085
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,880
And if you're thinking about getting perhaps a different phone down the road, you could

1086
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,440
take this iPhone and convert it over to Ting and then just pay for what you use.

1087
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,760
What a great opportunity.

1088
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,960
What a great way to get value out of it.

1089
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,200
I've got the Nexus 5 on the Ting network, too.

1090
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,200
Matt's got the Note 2.

1091
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,680
They both absolutely rock.

1092
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,680
I love the Ting network paired with the Ting devices and you own them outright.

1093
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,680
They're yours.

1094
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,360
You never have to worry about getting screwed in a contract.

1095
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,020
They have an amazing dashboard.

1096
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:42,280
No hold customer service at one eight five five Ting FTW any time between 8 a.m. or

1097
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,400
8 p.m., East Coast time, and a real person answers the phone.

1098
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,400
Linux.ting.com.

1099
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,280
Linux.ting.com will give you $25 credit if you've got a compatible device like the iPhone

1100
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:58,280
5S, 5S or 5C or any of the devices available on the Ting store.

1101
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,280
Lots of good stuff.

1102
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,840
Linux.ting.com.

1103
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,840
Check them out.

1104
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,720
Maybe even give them a call.

1105
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,560
See just how great that customer service is.

1106
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,560
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring.

1107
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,560
Linux Unplugged.

1108
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:14,120
Okay, guys, let's parse Mark Shuttleworth's response to Aaron Seigo.

1109
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,480
Mark Shuttleworth wrote, from my perspective, the great people in this kind of role really

1110
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,660
love the people and the project and help unblock things which would otherwise cause a project

1111
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,720
to stagnate.

1112
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,200
It's perfectly possible to stick a fraudulent label on a job, yes, there are companies that

1113
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,880
think they can get people to work for them if they have a manager for those people.

1114
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,240
But those cases usually don't work out very well.

1115
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:42,840
By contrast, invest in people who love both the goals of a huge project and the opportunity

1116
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:48,520
to work with folks who can only participate part-time and some magic happens.

1117
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,400
That's worth investing in, in my opinion.

1118
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
I like that he leaves the H off.

1119
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,120
Mark's like, I'm not going to put H in that.

1120
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,080
So Jono, Michael, David, Daniel and others are wonderful to work with and I'm very proud

1121
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,120
of the things they've done and the things they've enabled to get done by others.

1122
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,560
Whatever label people might try to attach to them, those are my heroes.

1123
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,560
He said something in this post, pretty short, but something that I think is perhaps the

1124
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:15,320
most, the most realistic like day-to-day task that a good community advocate or manager

1125
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,400
or organizer has to do is a lot of times an open source project, there's a lot of people

1126
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:24,660
in your community who come and go, they can't contribute a lot of hours and if they are

1127
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,920
on a regular basis, it's very limited.

1128
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,320
And so because of their time constraints, they need an enabler to help them when they

1129
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,320
do have the time.

1130
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:37,720
So that is a critical role that that community manager, whatever you want to call it, could

1131
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,720
play.

1132
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,880
And at the end of the day, that is truly about enabling people in your community to help

1133
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,080
work with you and it really is a two-way street in that case and that, that kind of thing

1134
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,160
I think is a great example of a good role a community manager can have.

1135
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,600
Any closing thoughts you guys on this before we wrap up?

1136
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:59,280
Well that just tells me that Kynockle has a great idea of where they want to go with

1137
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:05,640
the community and, or at least Mark Shelworth does and since he is the dictator as it were,

1138
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,640
then sure.

1139
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,360
Well and of course Aaron did reply to Mark if you guys want to see Aaron's response to

1140
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,840
Mark it's further down in the comments, what were you going to say Matt?

1141
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,960
I was basically just going to point out, when we see things like this, two things that,

1142
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,320
you know, first of all, when you start off with just a really ugly title like that, you

1143
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,240
know, fraud and all this stuff, you've lost me already.

1144
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,420
So even if he has like relevant points throughout the article, you lost me at the title.

1145
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,960
Just ugly, ugly stuff.

1146
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,520
The end point that people need to remember with stuff like this is that, you know, it's

1147
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,720
apples and oranges with every company, every community.

1148
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,120
There are some real d-bags that are just total placeholders in certain companies and they

1149
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,800
exist and I realize this, but there's a lot of times where these people are doing this

1150
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,780
stuff because they actually started out as members of the community that were perhaps

1151
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:50,680
brought in to fill a void and they have a really unfortunate title.

1152
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,580
Oh no, it's got the word manager in it.

1153
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,560
Maybe we can call him the community advocate or the community hug guy or something.

1154
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,560
I don't know.

1155
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,040
But whatever makes people feel warm and fuzzy, but at the end of the day, they have a critical

1156
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,840
role if it's a company you want to do business with or if it's community that you want to

1157
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,840
be part of.

1158
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,840
If it's not, go away.

1159
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,840
Yeah.

1160
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,840
That would be my message.

1161
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,480
I walk away mostly thinking, you know, you can't make it black and white, but I still

1162
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,040
remain slightly skeptical of the position.

1163
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:19,360
I think in my case, it's I wait and see, actions speak louder than words, and I'll treat each

1164
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,360
case individually.

1165
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,360
There you go.

1166
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,360
Yeah.

1167
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,360
Because like I said, there are some exceptions.

1168
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,360
There's some real d-bags.

1169
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,360
I'm not debating that at all.

1170
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,360
There really are.

1171
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,560
I mean, I don't think anybody's going to debate on that topic.

1172
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,120
I think we all pretty much agree.

1173
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,680
The internet is full of d-bags.

1174
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,880
Matt, so that's going to wrap up the show today.

1175
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,120
Actually, we do have a post-show topic.

1176
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,840
So if you're going to be listening after the music, stick around for that.

1177
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,280
I'm curious to hear what you think about this next topic coming up.

1178
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,560
Matt, on Sunday, I got two different topics that I'm brewing right now to see which one

1179
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,560
completes.

1180
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,600
Whichever one finishes first will be the one we roll with on Sunday, but I like both of

1181
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,600
them as much.

1182
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,160
So we'll eventually do both of them, but I'm not sure which one we're going to do first.

1183
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,800
Tune in on Sunday and find out with us.

1184
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:59,360
JBLive.tv, Sunday, 10 a.m., or just come back here next Tuesday, jblive.tv.

1185
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:04,080
We do this show in the afternoons, jupitabroadcasting.com, slash, calendar, to get it in your local time

1186
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,080
zone.

1187
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,080
All right, Matt.

1188
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,080
Well, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1189
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,080
All right, see you then.

1190
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,080
All right, everyone.

1191
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,800
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1192
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:38,120
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1193
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:49,480
You see a lot of companies out there right now that are sort of in this transition phase,

1194
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,420
like Amazon's really developing into something interesting, too.

1195
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,080
Like with the Fire Phone and the tablets, and they seem to be having some success with

1196
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,240
the Fire Tablets, and we don't really know, but they seem to be.

1197
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,600
Yeah, Fire Phone seems to be flopping, and I think part of that is because it's only

1198
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,600
available on AT&T.

1199
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,440
But then you've got the Fire TV, which, from all accounts, seems to be a pretty credible

1200
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,440
product.

1201
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,000
I wanted to pick one up one day myself.

1202
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,320
Also Android-based, right?

1203
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,440
And then you've got folks like Apple that are slowly turning up this TV stuff.

1204
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,600
It's really in this weird phase where they're entering into watches, they're entering into

1205
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,800
TVs, and they're entering into home automation stuff, which we've really just seen the very

1206
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,040
beginnings of.

1207
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,480
And I'm just kind of watching all of this because you all are kind of working against

1208
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:37,160
each other, and because of that, none of it really appeals to me, because I don't want

1209
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:41,480
to be stranded in one person's ecosystem, or one company's ecosystem.

1210
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:46,200
This is why the watches don't appeal to me, because I don't want to have to buy a watch

1211
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,480
that they're not going to buy a specific phone.

1212
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,480
That's no fun to me.

1213
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,200
Well, and that's why I was glad to jump ship from Apple when I did.

1214
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,880
And I think the Android wear has the advantage of you can move it between different Android

1215
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,120
devices, but I don't even like that restriction, which kind of means I'm screwed, I think,

1216
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,880
unless I'm just happy with something like the Pebble, and that's not really a compelling

1217
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,800
device to me personally, although I know Chase really likes his.

1218
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:19,000
But I kind of want to want this stuff, because I do want some of the convenience they offer.

1219
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,400
At the same time, I'm just so sick of the lock-in.

1220
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
Yeah.

1221
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
I can wait.

1222
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,400
Yeah.

1223
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,400
Yeah.

1224
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,400
I think so.

1225
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,320
Yeah, and a lot of people in the new world would say, why give up your freedom like

1226
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,320
that?

1227
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,680
WikiLeaks says, Google is a disgusting ad-selling hypocrite company that pretends not to be

1228
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,200
evil when their entire business is based on having and using your personal information.

1229
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,200
Ouch.

1230
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,200
I don't know if they're hypocrites.

1231
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,680
I think they're kind of upfront about that.

1232
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,680
Yeah, they are.

1233
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,680
They are.

1234
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,680
That's all you like is.

1235
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,480
I guess we're all kind of negative on the watch thing.

1236
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,480
Really?

1237
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,480
Nobody in here wants a watch?

1238
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:56,000
I wouldn't mind an Android one, but I mean, I'm not going to spend that much money on

1239
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
a watch.

1240
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,880
I just want the dummy watch.

1241
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,640
Something that is able to receive a few instructions from something remote, and I don't think a

1242
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:12,000
watch having processing capabilities is going to be of really any good use.

1243
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,680
I think it's kind of a device to use as a gateway to any other company or place that

1244
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,960
you are in, and just maybe some very simple functionality, but mostly a receiving device.

1245
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,720
I think what I want is something I could do messaging, and the problem is that, and it

1246
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,200
doesn't want advanced messaging, you just want something that does voice dictation or

1247
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,200
voice notes.

1248
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,200
Where would you use that?

1249
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:38,200
Seriously, where would you use voice dictation on a watch?

1250
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,000
What do you mean?

1251
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
When I'm driving.

1252
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Right.

1253
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,560
So why would you not use your phone?

1254
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:50,080
Well normally I have my phone in my pocket, which is just kind of like, you know, right

1255
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,080
there anyway.

1256
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,240
So yeah, I could just grab it.

1257
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:58,440
The thing is, when I'm driving, sometimes I have like the phone in a spot where my audio

1258
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,960
is actually connected to a Bluetooth system, and so then I'm using a different microphone

1259
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,880
that doesn't work as well for the dictation, whereas if the mic was built into the watch

1260
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,360
and I could speak more clearly into it, I think it would work better.

1261
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,360
Okay.

1262
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,360
What are you on about?

1263
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,360
You won't be driving for too long.

1264
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,360
Yeah.

1265
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,360
Yeah.

1266
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,880
I mean, okay, so this is the other thing where I don't want to get all like Zen Master about

1267
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,720
it, but like I think we've already crossed a threshold with our smartphones.

1268
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,720
Okay.

1269
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,720
I think, okay, all right.

1270
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:29,840
I don't, you guys feel like, like do you guys go to restaurants and stuff and like you look

1271
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:33,520
around and everybody's got their face in their phone and maybe it's getting, it's going on,

1272
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:38,020
it's gone a little too far and that, and that sometimes like, do you get the sensation that

1273
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:43,640
maybe people are like avoiding like being alone with their thoughts for 30 seconds and

1274
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,280
don't jumping in their phone so that way they don't have to deal with, you know, being a

1275
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,600
human being or something like that.

1276
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:53,220
Like it, I have watched the progression over the last five years where like, I remember

1277
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:58,080
a time where it was kind of considered inappropriate to have your phone at the dinner table in

1278
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,520
a restaurant and that was kind of like considered bad taste.

1279
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,440
And now I go out and everybody's buried in it and it happens everywhere I go.

1280
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,440
I do it.

1281
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,440
My friends do it.

1282
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,440
My family does it.

1283
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,800
Everybody's got their faces buried in these phones and I'm thinking, geez, we already

1284
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:15,360
are so distracted that we don't even look up and just like look up at the moon one day.

1285
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,840
We're always looking at our phones.

1286
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:22,260
And so I, I worry that these watches and especially things like Google Glass take it so much further

1287
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,840
that it, it actually isn't maybe healthy for the way our minds process information and

1288
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:32,520
it could leave us like, I think over sensitized or overexposed to this stuff.

1289
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:36,600
I don't, for example, particularly want Google Now notifications on my watch.

1290
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,660
In fact, I'm thinking about turning Google Now off.

1291
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:43,680
So then that sort of pretty much makes an Android wear useless.

1292
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,880
Well, when I look at it, I see two things.

1293
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:55,560
I see one that modern work environment and people have to relocate.

1294
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,200
It's kind of why those gadgets feel a gap that it's right there.

1295
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:04,760
It's like people are going to another state to, or living in another country for large

1296
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,800
periods of time.

1297
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:11,000
And those devices do feel a gap that they have.

1298
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
That's a real gap.

1299
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
That's the real modern world.

1300
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:21,480
And that's when you find most people, but people that are just on the local, sharing

1301
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:28,000
with people that they know and live nearby, it seems that when some time passes, they

1302
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,760
eventually start gradually decreasing the usage, especially among friends.

1303
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:39,480
That has been my experience is like people got just bloated.

1304
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,480
It was new.

1305
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,480
It was shiny.

1306
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,480
Yeah.

1307
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,480
I could see that.

1308
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:50,120
But if you're dealing with some with actual remote relationships, then it feels a gap.

1309
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:57,120
So you will find that and also like when you go to do a restaurant, you're kind of already

1310
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,840
doing something that it's remote.

1311
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:05,860
Gradually with age, people technically, depending on the country, of course, but culturally

1312
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:11,080
also start moving to eating at home, eating with family, eating with friends.

1313
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,280
It's not so much the restaurant thing either.

1314
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:22,120
So I wonder if these watches will, could these watches become podcast clients?

1315
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,600
Could this be a way to listen to podcasts where you don't have to bring your phone if

1316
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,600
you want to go on a walk?

1317
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,600
I would be all down.

1318
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,160
Well, of course you have to have your phone with these phones, with these watches, right?

1319
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,960
All of them require your phone.

1320
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,160
What happens if they don't, they can't operate on their own just with minimum functionality,

1321
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,160
local functionality?

1322
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,000
I think they would like just timekeeping and whatnot.

1323
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,560
Well, and maybe media playback.

1324
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:46,360
Like if you could, if you could, you know, put a Bluetooth headphone in or whatever and

1325
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:50,800
listen to a podcast while you're on a walk and not need your phone, I would love that.

1326
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:58,960
I think this will actually push further for mesh networks of Wi-Fi networks.

1327
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,560
Oh man.

1328
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:04,480
Wouldn't that be bad-ass if everybody's watch formed a secured mesh network?

1329
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,080
Well, why not just do that now with phones, right?

1330
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,560
Again, well, we go back to that.

1331
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:11,080
Because you're wasting battery or something important.

1332
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,080
That's true.

1333
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,080
Yeah.

1334
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,080
Yeah.

1335
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,080
Okay.

1336
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,080
All right.

1337
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,080
At least your phone available for as a communications device.

1338
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,080
Yeah.

1339
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,800
And also like we're now at the current stage of software as a service that companies do

1340
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:28,400
have an incentive of having you connected at all times, not just through data plans

1341
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:35,080
of telecom because ultimately a lot of other things will start to factor in like because

1342
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:43,280
the amount of devices is also huge and the expansion is not as quickly if you're relying

1343
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,960
on just the telephone operators.

1344
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,960
True.

1345
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,960
True.

1346
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,560
Last time I had a watch, they were called Swatch and you know, and before that it was

1347
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:54,560
a calculator watch.

1348
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,560
Yeah.

1349
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,560
I think that was the 80s.

1350
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,560
I'm just not a real watch guy.

1351
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,120
I do kind of feel like actually there's a point to that.

1352
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,760
Like I kind of feel like maybe I was, I think when the smartphone came out, I was like,

1353
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,760
oh finally I don't have to wear a watch.

1354
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,760
Right?

1355
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,760
I mean, I don't know.

1356
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,760
It's just something else for me to break.

1357
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,760
I don't know.

1358
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,760
Well, there's that and charge every night.

1359
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,760
Don't forget that.

1360
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,760
Oh gosh.

1361
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,760
No kidding.

1362
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,760
There is the problem with that as well.

1363
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,760
That's it.

1364
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,760
I really.

1365
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:22,600
I'm back with chargers and your desk is in place, workplace being filled with those.

1366
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,080
Chargers everywhere is what you're saying.

1367
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,080
Yeah.

1368
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,080
But then it's actually not as easy.

1369
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:30,520
So when you take the watch off, like in the case of the Apple watch, it like doesn't,

1370
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,680
it deauthorizes your capability for payments.

1371
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,480
It doesn't track your health stats.

1372
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,840
Like it becomes significantly less useful when you take it off your body, which you

1373
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,320
have to do at least once a day.

1374
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,320
Yeah.

1375
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,680
When the hell are we going to get decent batteries?

1376
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,360
What do you want to pay when you're sleeping though?

1377
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,840
People are trying on the battery front.

1378
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,840
Yeah.

1379
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:53,640
Whatever happened to that one battery that was actually a capacitor invented by a teenager

1380
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,480
that lasts like for all day, if not more.

1381
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,200
He was murdered by the oil industry and then they destroyed the, no I'm kidding.

1382
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,640
No, no, no.

1383
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:06,480
Him and water car guy went up to another point.

1384
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,860
So you know, you asked what would you, why would you want to wear your watch at night?

1385
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,240
I track with a Fitbit, I track my quality of sleep.

1386
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,160
So I know how I'm doing with my sleep apnea.

1387
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:21,120
And so I actually, a crucial part of the Fitbit is the functionality I use for it while I'm

1388
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,120
sleeping.

1389
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:25,760
It's actually, I probably would consider that more important than the step tracking for

1390
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,820
me.

1391
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:31,320
So you were saying that there are people who are sat in restaurants out of the house who

1392
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,320
can't stop with the digital connectivity.

1393
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,320
Oh yeah.

1394
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,320
You don't see this?

1395
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,320
You're doing it in your sleep.

1396
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,320
Everywhere.

1397
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,600
I'm not staring at a screen though and I'm not distracted by it.

1398
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,600
It's different.

1399
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,600
It's more actually what I like about it.

1400
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Yeah, that's different.

1401
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,600
That's completely different.

1402
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,160
Well, cause my point is like it's passive tracking and you go in and get the data when

1403
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:52,120
you want, but these phones and these watches are active, require your attention, distract

1404
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,560
you from the fact that something's bad in your mind that you're not paying attention

1405
01:07:55,560 --> 01:08:01,640
to or you know, they're like these bursts of like indulgence on let me take a selfie and

1406
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,640
make sure I get some likes.

1407
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,640
I was kind of pulling your plunker a bit.

1408
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,640
But I can see what you're saying.

1409
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:09,720
I was at a wedding a couple of weeks ago and it was in the middle of nowhere and there

1410
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,400
was no cell reception at all and there was no wifi.

1411
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,560
Nobody had their phone out other than for taking photos of the bride and groom.

1412
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,120
The rest of the time everyone was talking, dancing, drinking, having fun.

1413
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,120
Wow.

1414
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,120
Nobody had their phone out.

1415
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,120
It was amazing.

1416
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,120
It was the best wedding.

1417
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,880
Aside from the fact it was a fabulous steak, it was the best wedding I've been to for a

1418
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:28,880
long time.

1419
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,240
We are now reactivating the wifi.

1420
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,000
You may now turn your smartphones back on and everybody got quiet.

1421
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,720
Shouldn't have a faraday cage over places so you don't connect to anthem.

1422
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:40,640
No, we have trees into the countryside.

1423
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,640
That'll work.

1424
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,640
That'll do it up here too sometimes.

1425
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,160
I was in the ER and I couldn't make a phone call out.

1426
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,160
That is a weird thing.

1427
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:52,720
The deal is okay, I need to open a company that just sets up a signal blockers for weddings

1428
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,720
and events.

1429
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,720
Yeah.

1430
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,720
No, they have those already.

1431
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,040
We have a post-show topic.

1432
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,040
This is an interesting one.

1433
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,740
In fact, I didn't put it in the main show because I've noticed almost zero discussion

1434
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:04,740
online about it.

1435
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,760
It seems like nobody gives a crap and I care.

1436
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,760
So I just wanted to ask.

1437
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:09,760
It's probably important.

1438
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,560
Usually it's the stupid crap that everybody gets all testy over.

1439
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,560
Right.

1440
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,560
Yeah.

1441
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,560
Like you two albums being auto-downloaded to phones and things like that.

1442
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,560
Exactly.

1443
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,560
It's like, oh my God.

1444
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:23,560
Chris, can I just say that I personally guarantee if you buy an Ubuntu phone, we won't force

1445
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,560
you to buy one.

1446
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,560
Yeah, thank you.

1447
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,560
All right.

1448
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,560
Deal.

1449
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:28,560
Deal.

1450
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,560
All right.

1451
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,800
So speaking of buying stuff, Micro Focus has bought AttachMate for $2.3 billion.

1452
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,920
Of course, AttachMate is the company that owns SUSE Linux.

1453
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,840
Oh, that is kind of a big deal.

1454
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,840
Don't you think?

1455
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,840
I think so.

1456
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,440
Although, SUSE Linux is what percentage of AttachMate though?

1457
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,280
Not that much, but I suppose it's still, yes, it matters.

1458
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,640
Well, I don't know.

1459
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,640
That's what my concern is, is maybe it doesn't matter to them because they make their money

1460
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,940
off mainframes and writing cold ball apps.

1461
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:51,940
That's where they make their money.

1462
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:52,940
Check the name.

1463
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:53,940
OpenSUSE has.

1464
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:54,940
Visual cold ball.

1465
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,940
That's interesting.

1466
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:56,940
Yeah.

1467
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:59,520
OpenSUSE have posted their response to say basically nothing changes.

1468
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,520
Yeah.

1469
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,520
Okay.

1470
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,520
Good.

1471
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,520
Good.

1472
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,520
I mean, it seems like it would be complimentary to a mainframe business.

1473
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,520
I mean, they've got a good strong position there in the market.

1474
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:13,000
Well, yeah, AttachMate group owns SUSE, Novell, and AttachMate.

1475
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,120
AttachMate is based in Seattle, Novell is based in Provo, Utah, and SUSE is based in

1476
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,120
Germany.

1477
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,360
So it's kind of an interesting thing they just picked up.

1478
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,560
So they say, yeah, no changes for SUSE are planned.

1479
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,720
The business structure and leadership remain.

1480
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,000
There's no need for any action taken.

1481
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,320
Commitment to open source remains passionately committed to open innovation.

1482
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,080
Commitment to open SUSE is fully committed to being a sponsor and supporter of open highly

1483
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,080
independent.

1484
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,080
I'll just kind of boilerplate.

1485
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,080
Yeah.

1486
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:42,280
Well, it sounds like AttachMate bought Novell and then it turns out that didn't make them

1487
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,280
any money.

1488
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,280
Right.

1489
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,600
And so then they had to sell because they had to pay back those loans.

1490
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,600
Yeah.

1491
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,600
Well, and they sold off a bunch of patents.

1492
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,600
So.

1493
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,600
Ah, there you go.

1494
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,600
There you go.

1495
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,600
There you go.

1496
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,600
All right.

1497
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,600
Yeah.

1498
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,600
So there you go.

1499
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,600
There really was not much to say, is there?

1500
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,240
It just seems to be really kind of a non big deal.

1501
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,240
Yeah.

1502
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,680
As long as business continues for the SUSE project, I think everybody's happy.

1503
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:07,600
Do you think the the constant sale of Novell and SUSE devalues the SUSE brand?

1504
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,440
Yeah, I think it's weird, too.

1505
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,920
I think it's weird that it keeps getting shoved, you know, pushed around like a hooker.

1506
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:17,160
It's everybody thinks that they can make money with it, but it turns out they can't.

1507
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:20,160
Well, but that kind of makes it sound like SUSE is a loser.

1508
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,240
Well, she sounds more like a hooker with a PayPal swipe.

1509
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,240
I don't know.

1510
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,720
You know, at the end of the day, everybody wants to be the next Red Hat because Red Hat

1511
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,720
made billions.

1512
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,720
Right.

1513
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,720
And.

1514
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,720
Yeah.

1515
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,280
You know, though, I mean, for all we know, it has nothing to do with SUSE.

1516
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,560
Maybe SUSE is the only thing that makes any money at all.

1517
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,560
Yeah.

1518
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,560
Yeah.

1519
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,200
In this case, it's it's, you know, a line item that's kind of buried in there.

1520
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,480
Well, you know, SUSE is way bigger than Red Hat over in Europe.

1521
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,760
I mean, way bigger.

1522
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,760
Yeah.

1523
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,040
So if you're if you're putting a SAP ERP system in, you're either going to if you're going

1524
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,360
to put it on Linux, you're either going to put it on Red Hat or SUSE.

1525
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,120
If you're in the US, that's probably Red Hat.

1526
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,000
If you're in Europe, possibly SUSE.

1527
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Do you.

1528
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,240
So, yeah, it could be some big iron.

1529
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,880
You asked me, but you didn't answer the question yourself.

1530
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,640
Do you think it devalues the SUSE brand?

1531
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:05,440
I think it kind of does.

1532
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,800
It does kind of.

1533
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,960
It's like the blue headed step chart or the green headed step chart keeps getting pushed

1534
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,960
around.

1535
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:13,960
It feels like sloppy seconds to me.

1536
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:14,960
Well, yes.

1537
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,320
And the other thing is, it's like when you're trying to pick an enterprise platform to base

1538
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:22,800
like your entire server infrastructure on, stability of the company is a major component.

1539
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,660
In fact, some people will pick the stability of the company, IBM or Microsoft, over the

1540
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:28,800
stability of the actual software product.

1541
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,800
Right.

1542
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,800
That's scary.

1543
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,800
Yeah.

1544
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,540
And so when you see this keep moving around, it starts to cast doubts because you never

1545
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:37,720
know if the next time it changes hands, if that'll be the time they decide to end it.

1546
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,720
Right.

1547
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,720
You just never know.

1548
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,720
And maybe that would never be the case.

1549
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:41,720
I don't know.

1550
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,320
And I actually think the enterprise products are really good product, too.

1551
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,120
So it seems like it should be a moneymaker.

1552
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,800
But I think this damn Ubuntu LTS thing came around and sort of ate their lunch in the

1553
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,800
cloud.

1554
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,800
Yeah.

1555
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,800
Big time.

1556
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,800
Son of a gun.

1557
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,800
All right.

1558
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,600
So it's interesting to look at Linux's version of long term support and see how different

1559
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,840
it is from what companies actually look for.

1560
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,840
There's a dig.

1561
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,120
It turns out that companies actually want like insane levels of long term support.

1562
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,120
Yeah.

1563
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,640
Like they want to stick with one version for 10 years.

1564
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,640
Yeah.

1565
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,640
Yeah.

1566
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,640
Yeah.

1567
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:19,720
Well, Red Hat Enterprise, Linux, and CentOS are around for like fricking ever because

1568
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,720
they have their long term support.

1569
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,200
Well, they're almost five years, I think.

1570
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,200
No, more than that.

1571
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,760
We're talking like seven or eight.

1572
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,760
Well, FreeBSD does five, but CentOS is about the same.

1573
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:33,360
But Zinus is basically making their version of FreeBSD that has 10 plus years of support.

1574
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,360
Yeah.

1575
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,360
Which is insane.

1576
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,240
I think that's meant to compete with HPUX and all that other stuff.

1577
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:43,600
Well, it's specifically to replace the product they already have, which was scope.

1578
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:44,600
Yeah.

1579
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:48,720
So you can actually pay for what they call extended life support on Red Hat.

1580
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:55,840
Well, you actually get patches for 13 years, but you got to pay out the butt for it.

1581
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,960
Like $5,000 per server or something like that.

1582
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,960
Is that actually a radio button on their web page?

1583
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,600
The butt charge.

1584
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:06,400
I like GNU news is good news.

1585
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,480
I also like community D debate.

1586
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,440
I like all of the system D references.

1587
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:19,440
Man, the people who disagreed with our overall end opinion on our system D discussion, I

1588
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,440
were really upset by that.

1589
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,440
Did you guys see what we had?

1590
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:26,000
I haven't gone back in there, but that feedback thread is like a record setter for Linux unplugged

1591
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
in the subreddit.

1592
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,240
Does it make me evil that I actually popped popcorn for that when I was reading it?

1593
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,240
That's what I should do.

1594
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,240
I did too.

1595
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,040
I literally did, because I just found it so amusing.

1596
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:39,160
I didn't mean to insult anybody.

1597
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,320
Just the interesting views, I was just like, okay.

1598
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,320
I don't know what these people think my background is, but I've managed servers for a really

1599
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,000
long time, and I think system D is a great advancement for server management.

1600
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,960
When I see these server guys that go in there like, I don't want it for my server, I'm like,

1601
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,960
are you kidding?

1602
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,960
I want it for my servers.

1603
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:56,960
What are you smoking?

1604
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,960
Yeah, I just don't get it.

1605
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,960
All right, so I'm going to refresh the vote page, and I mean, I understand, honestly,

1606
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,680
I don't want to force anything on anybody.

1607
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,080
If they want to use OpenRC or whatever, have at it.

1608
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,080
I'm fine with it.

1609
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,080
Well, here's the problem.

1610
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,400
Everyone always gets so fired up about it.

1611
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,080
What they really need to be talking about is...
