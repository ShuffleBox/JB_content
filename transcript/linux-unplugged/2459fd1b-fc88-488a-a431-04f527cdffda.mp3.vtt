00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Speaking of breaking, how about a little breaking news?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
This is CNN Breaking News.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.120
Coming in from the beard himself, GetGamesGo.com, never even heard of it, but I guess they're

00:10.120 --> 00:11.120
known.

00:11.120 --> 00:16.000
GetGamesGo.com is having a 75% off Linux game sale, and some of them are just Steam codes,

00:16.000 --> 00:19.160
some of them are direct downloads, some of them are DRM free, some of them aren't.

00:19.160 --> 00:23.400
Anyways, I'll have a link in the pre-show, I don't know how long it's going on, they

00:23.400 --> 00:29.560
take Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal, and it's GetGamesGo.com, and 75% off Linux game sale.

00:29.560 --> 00:30.560
Thought I'd mention it.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.560
Check it out.

00:31.560 --> 00:32.560
See?

00:32.560 --> 00:33.560
See what I do for you?

00:33.560 --> 00:37.560
Now you can go get some gaming going for your 75% off.

00:37.560 --> 00:38.560
No?

00:38.560 --> 00:39.560
No?

00:39.560 --> 00:40.560
That didn't work for you?

00:40.560 --> 00:41.560
All right, okay.

00:41.560 --> 00:42.560
I'm just scrolling through the list.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.560
All right, how about this one?

00:43.560 --> 00:44.560
All right.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.560
Nothing's jumping out.

00:45.560 --> 00:46.560
All right, here we go, here we go.

00:46.560 --> 00:59.800
Here's the answer, and you're in the situation room.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.480
Hello guys, I'm here reporting on scene at GetGamesGo.com where I can report there is

01:03.480 --> 01:06.000
indeed some sort of catastrophe going on.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.160
I believe it is a cyber attack, a glitch in the computer.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.000
All Linux games are 75% off.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.640
Situation, situation.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.640
That's right, Wolf.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.640
This is quite the situation.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.360
We recommend you go over to GetGamesGo.com.

01:17.360 --> 01:21.360
I've never heard of them before, but holy crap, 75% off.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.360
Hackers be crazy.

01:23.360 --> 01:29.600
Do you like that one better?

01:29.600 --> 01:34.880
Actually, it's gotten me kind of interested to go to that website now.

01:34.880 --> 01:41.160
So I saw Wimpy posted, or someone posted some screenshots of Marte on BBC.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.640
Yeah, that's pretty popular, isn't it?

01:43.640 --> 01:44.640
Wimpy, what's going on there?

01:44.640 --> 01:46.600
What the hell?

01:46.600 --> 01:47.600
What did I do?

01:47.600 --> 01:48.600
Oh, PowerPC.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.160
This is not something that I've had a huge amount of involvement in.

01:54.160 --> 01:57.520
This is community developments.

01:57.520 --> 02:04.520
So a couple of people in the Ubuntu Marte community have ported Ubuntu Marte to PowerPC,

02:04.520 --> 02:11.560
and this whole underculture of people that are sitting on PowerPC equipment have suddenly

02:11.560 --> 02:18.900
turned up, and we've reinvigorated these computers that previously were struggling for a decent

02:18.900 --> 02:20.160
operating system.

02:20.160 --> 02:28.600
So there's these guys turning up with PowerPC G4s, PowerPC G5s, and Amiga X1000s, and all

02:28.600 --> 02:30.400
sorts of funky stuff.

02:30.400 --> 02:35.120
People are just hanging on to these old Macs, and then they're just putting Linux on it.

02:35.120 --> 02:42.360
Not just old Macs, but other equipment that's based on PowerPC.

02:42.360 --> 02:48.920
Like anything, we all gravitate to something that at some point we really love.

02:48.920 --> 02:56.040
I still have a real soft spot for the IBM ThinkPad 760, which came out in about 1998,

02:56.040 --> 03:00.820
and it's an old piece of cruft now, but it was the first really decent computer I had.

03:00.820 --> 03:02.800
So I think of it fondly.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.960
And I imagine these guys that have got these PowerPC equipment, they know it, and they're

03:06.960 --> 03:08.480
able to make it work for them.

03:08.480 --> 03:12.760
And some of those G5 rigs that they've got are really quite pokey.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.120
And were very expensive, though.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.580
Some of those G5 rigs they bought, they may have spent eight grand on some of those high-end

03:17.580 --> 03:18.920
production rigs.

03:18.920 --> 03:24.280
Yeah, and these guys that have got eight core systems with eight gigs of RAM, so back then

03:24.280 --> 03:28.000
this would have been a significant investment.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.840
And yeah, they've got Ubuntu Mate running on it, with QEMU running, and they're doing

03:33.840 --> 03:37.400
multiple Ubuntu Mate sessions running within there.

03:37.400 --> 03:42.340
They've got all the 3D gaming going, the whole nine yards.

03:42.340 --> 03:43.700
So I'm working on it at the moment.

03:43.700 --> 03:55.320
So I've actually bought an iBook G4 off eBay, secondhand, to help with the PowerPC testing.

03:55.320 --> 04:02.200
And last week, or the week before, did the PowerPC enablement in the official canonical

04:02.200 --> 04:06.400
build infrastructure for Ubuntu Mate.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.880
So I don't know if we're going to get over the finish line, but we've started to put

04:09.880 --> 04:14.200
all the bits in places to introduce it as an official architecture.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200
That though, wow.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.220
I mean, when you go down that route, that is big.

04:18.220 --> 04:19.760
That's a new arm of the distro.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.760
Wow.

04:20.760 --> 04:25.560
Although, you know, I think about it, there is an old G4 tower that is kicking around

04:25.560 --> 04:29.080
here somewhere that just, it does nothing because it's worthless.

04:29.080 --> 04:31.480
If I could throw a Linux on it.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.480
ISO's available.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.200
ISO's are available.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.960
You could say that it's Wimpressive, I'll say.

04:36.960 --> 04:37.960
Oh, don't.

04:37.960 --> 04:42.440
This is what all my school teachers used to put on my school reports, thinking that they

04:42.440 --> 04:44.600
were being clever and original.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.600
What was it?

04:45.600 --> 04:46.600
What was it?

04:46.600 --> 04:47.600
Wimpressive?

04:47.600 --> 04:48.600
Hey Rob, did you hear that?

04:48.600 --> 04:49.600
Wimpy basically called you a dick then.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.600
Yeah, yeah, he totally did.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.600
I'll see myself out.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.600
It's okay.

04:52.600 --> 05:01.800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's getting ready to flip some

05:01.800 --> 05:06.280
old power PC equipment on the side to fund its RV ambitions.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.880
My name is Chris.

05:07.880 --> 05:08.880
And my name is Matt.

05:08.880 --> 05:13.240
One of these days, Matt, I will be broadcasting this very show from the road.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.760
I can't even say it's going to happen before episode 100, Matt.

05:16.760 --> 05:17.760
One day.

05:17.760 --> 05:22.520
One day, Chris will be in the Jupiter Broadcasting Mobile Studio, broadcasting the Unplugged

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
show.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.240
And we'll have a real lug meetup with real in-person microphones.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.040
This week, we're going to have a great show.

05:30.040 --> 05:34.200
A project that you may or may not be familiar with, and maybe not familiar with as well,

05:34.200 --> 05:37.960
as I should be, is the Arch Linux ARM project.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.880
Now I don't really know what you would use Arch on an ARM device for, but I have a few

05:41.880 --> 05:42.880
ideas.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.040
So one of the members is going to join us to give us a little bit of background, tell

05:46.040 --> 05:49.760
us what some people out there use Arch and ARM devices for, and we're going to pick his

05:49.760 --> 05:53.520
brain and we're also going to have the mobile room ask any questions they might have.

05:53.520 --> 05:58.560
And then in the second half of the show, something we've talked a lot about is delivering applications

05:58.560 --> 05:59.560
on Linux.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.700
Something where you could make an application and move it across distributions, maybe have

06:02.700 --> 06:07.300
it secured from the rest of the system sandbox, so that way if the application has an exploit,

06:07.300 --> 06:08.800
it can't really go very far.

06:08.800 --> 06:13.600
Well, this week, we saw the first demo of a fully sandboxed application on the Linux

06:13.600 --> 06:18.080
desktop, thanks to advancements in Wayland, and a lot of other things that we'll get into.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.920
And it was actually a video game, a OpenGL video game that was fully sandboxed, fully

06:21.920 --> 06:25.800
portable, and demoed this week on Linux, and we're going to talk about that and how far

06:25.800 --> 06:26.800
out it might be.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.080
It might be closer than you think.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.920
So to get started, Matt, why don't we bring in that Mumble Room.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.400
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.400
Hello.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.400
Hello.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.400
Hello.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.400
Greetings.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.400
Hello.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.400
Hi.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.400
Hello from Trinidad.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.400
Hi.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.400
Hi.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.400
Well, hello from Trinidad.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.160
Let's put Poppy right up there on the spot.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.080
I just wanted to pick your brain, Poppy, on any updates.

06:48.080 --> 06:54.500
Since we talked, the launch happened, the flash sale was very flashy, and I'm just curious

06:54.500 --> 06:57.920
if you got any updates for us on how it's gone, and maybe we're going to see any future

06:57.920 --> 06:58.920
sales.

06:58.920 --> 06:59.920
Yeah.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.680
We had a flash sale for the Ubuntu phone, the first Ubuntu phone, the BQ, last week

07:04.680 --> 07:08.640
on Wednesday, just after the show where we discussed it.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.560
Hence all the sales.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.560
Yeah.

07:11.560 --> 07:17.560
They sold out pretty quick in the morning, and so they ran another sale in the afternoon

07:17.560 --> 07:23.360
and they sold out then as well, and I think they sold out in minutes, you know, really

07:23.360 --> 07:24.360
stupidly quickly.

07:24.360 --> 07:28.400
I don't think they quite anticipated how many people were going to buy them, but there'll

07:28.400 --> 07:29.400
be more flash sales.

07:29.400 --> 07:34.520
There'll be one this week at some point, BQ have said, so keep an eye on the Ubuntu Twitter

07:34.520 --> 07:37.680
account and the BQ Reader's Twitter account for more info.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.400
Any early feedback or responses or anything like that?

07:40.400 --> 07:43.000
You guys just sort of like listening and collecting data right now?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.880
What's going on right now at Canonical HQ after the phone finally ships?

07:45.880 --> 07:46.880
Yeah.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.360
Or I guess it hasn't shipped yet, but sales have gone out.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.360
So I guess they're not...

07:49.360 --> 07:50.360
Right.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.320
We don't really have them in consumers' hands until, what, a month or so?

07:53.320 --> 07:54.320
Well some are.

07:54.320 --> 07:58.200
There's 30 of them for the people who came to London, and they've been giving us loads

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
of feedback.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.720
You know, some of it we didn't go and ask for, they just started posting photos and

08:02.720 --> 08:08.440
screenshots and, you know, problems that they've had or, you know, things they've liked, and

08:08.440 --> 08:13.040
we've been gathering all this information, like, you know, stalking them all on their

08:13.040 --> 08:16.480
social media accounts to see what they're posting and, you know, gather that feedback

08:16.480 --> 08:18.080
and give it back to the developers.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.440
But also some of them have been filing bugs and giving us log files and stuff when there

08:21.440 --> 08:22.440
are problems.

08:22.440 --> 08:26.240
So it's been a really useful exercise because they're using it in the real world.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.400
Now Wimpy, you had a question that those of us maybe with a Nexus 4 or Nexus 5 device

08:30.400 --> 08:32.400
want to know about.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.400
Yeah.

08:33.400 --> 08:41.280
So I've got the Nexus 4, which I've just had for a few days because I wasn't successful

08:41.280 --> 08:45.560
in the flash sales last week, and I wanted to learn more.

08:45.560 --> 08:51.040
So I've noticed there are some differences with what the Nexus 4 ships with versus what

08:51.040 --> 08:52.200
the BQ ships with.

08:52.200 --> 08:58.280
For example, the Scopes implementation on the BQ phone seems to be a little bit more

08:58.280 --> 09:03.440
tightly integrated and it's got this today scope, and I was wondering if Canonical are

09:03.440 --> 09:08.960
going to bring that same software enablement to the other devices.

09:08.960 --> 09:09.960
So yeah, they should be.

09:09.960 --> 09:16.800
I mean, the idea is that each manufacturer or carrier or OEM can tailor the experience

09:16.800 --> 09:22.080
and add their little layer on the top and some of what you might see in screenshots

09:22.080 --> 09:30.600
and videos of the BQ phone might be BQ specific stuff for Spain or for BQ's customers or based

09:30.600 --> 09:34.400
on deals that BQ have with partners and that kind of stuff we probably wouldn't put on

09:34.400 --> 09:35.920
other devices.

09:35.920 --> 09:40.600
But the generic stuff like the today scope and nearby and other stuff, then that should

09:40.600 --> 09:43.280
go into the store and it should be available to anyone.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.080
It just hasn't yet been done.

09:45.080 --> 09:50.200
I did ask you, you asked me earlier on Telegram and I pinged everyone and they said it's currently

09:50.200 --> 09:51.200
in process.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.920
Yeah, I'm being a bit of a stooge here, but you know, it was topical for me.

09:54.920 --> 10:00.720
I have to say, having played with it, I get the scopes concept and I'm just disappointed

10:00.720 --> 10:08.640
there are not more scopes built in for the core apps, because they're really...

10:08.640 --> 10:12.480
So here's a bit of feedback for you, Popey.

10:12.480 --> 10:18.080
Scopes to me are like a cross between widgets on Android and Google Now, and I don't know

10:18.080 --> 10:22.760
if it's because I live outside North America, but Google Now for me is completely pointless.

10:22.760 --> 10:28.000
It doesn't actually do anything useful, doesn't tell me anything that I want to know, so consequently

10:28.000 --> 10:31.240
I go to great lengths to disable it on my Android devices.

10:31.240 --> 10:37.400
I have to say, in just a couple of days of using Ubuntu phone, scopes actually deliver

10:37.400 --> 10:42.680
the promise of what I thought Google Now was supposed to do, which was to keep me informed

10:42.680 --> 10:48.520
about the things that I wanted to know about, because I've chosen to follow it, or because

10:48.520 --> 10:54.640
it's geo-located around me and it makes me aware of my surroundings.

10:54.640 --> 10:59.320
I'd like to see more scopes, particularly things like the...

10:59.320 --> 11:05.360
There's a decent text messaging app, but there's no scope for it, and the killer app on Ubuntu

11:05.360 --> 11:10.600
phone as far as I'm concerned is Telegram, because I've moved all of my immediate friends

11:10.600 --> 11:14.800
and family over to it, and there's a scope for that and an app for that, and it's brilliant,

11:14.800 --> 11:16.920
but the text messaging app lacks a scope, and I feel it needs one.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.480
There's a scope for Telegram?

11:18.480 --> 11:19.480
Yeah.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.480
Oh, yeah.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.800
So it shows you your most recent messages and the people you contact the most, that

11:24.800 --> 11:25.800
kind of stuff.

11:25.800 --> 11:30.720
But we made a change in the way that apps are packaged so that you can bundle an app

11:30.720 --> 11:36.200
and a scope together at the same time, so when a user or a customer installs it, they

11:36.200 --> 11:39.600
get both and they share the same data set.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.640
And that Telegram is an example of one of those.

11:41.640 --> 11:42.640
And I agree with you.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.640
We need more of those.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.640
Yeah, that's fascinating.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.440
I can't wait to play with it on an actual device.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.160
And we won't know anything about that until more like June, right?

11:50.160 --> 11:51.160
That's kind of the word?

11:51.160 --> 11:52.160
What, for the US market?

11:52.160 --> 12:00.000
Yeah, I think Christian Perrino teased to OMG Ubuntu a couple of weeks ago that we hope

12:00.000 --> 12:06.720
to announce something in June for the US market.

12:06.720 --> 12:10.920
So far away, Bobby.

12:10.920 --> 12:11.920
Sorry.

12:11.920 --> 12:12.920
That's all right.

12:12.920 --> 12:13.920
It turns out making phones is hard.

12:13.920 --> 12:14.920
Yeah.

12:14.920 --> 12:15.920
Who knew?

12:15.920 --> 12:16.920
Who would have thought, right?

12:16.920 --> 12:21.120
Okay, so I wanted to kind of spend a moment to reflect positively upon Linux as a general

12:21.120 --> 12:26.240
bit of real time feedback, as an exercise from the chat room and the mumble room.

12:26.240 --> 12:31.760
And I'll start and then I'll have maybe Matt chime in with something that he would miss.

12:31.760 --> 12:36.680
So every now and then, you have to spend a little time away from Linux, less and less

12:36.680 --> 12:37.680
these days.

12:37.680 --> 12:38.680
But every now and then it happens.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.960
Maybe let's just say for the sake of argument, you're on the Windows platform.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.120
So that way we can all just kind of focus on one thing.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.360
What is it you miss the most from Linux?

12:46.360 --> 12:50.520
I was inspired by a thread I saw a day ago on our Linux and it's a lot of great responses.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.920
And I would like to be curious about your response.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.160
So I'll tell you mine.

12:54.160 --> 12:58.960
Just as like one of the first things I noticed when I sit down at a Windows box that I miss

12:58.960 --> 13:06.520
when I'm sitting down at a Linux desktop is that you have to click to focus and then scroll

13:06.520 --> 13:07.520
in order to get scroll to work.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.760
Like you can't just bring your mouse over any random window and scroll it under Windows.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.960
It has to be a focused window in order for the scroll to work.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.200
It turns out I use that all the time with multiple Windows and stuff.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.000
I always am scrolling Windows without wanting to actually click them.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.440
Like maybe I have my web browser up and I'm also looking through a directory, but I want

13:22.440 --> 13:24.920
my web browser to be the active window, but I still want to be able to scroll the list

13:24.920 --> 13:27.000
of the file directory.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
You can't do that in Windows.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.200
You've got to click the Explorer window and then scroll it.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.400
That is just like one of the first things.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.640
Like there's a million things, but like in terms of like things that bug me when I move

13:35.640 --> 13:37.400
away from Linux, that's one of the first.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.600
Matt, do you have one that comes to mind?

13:39.600 --> 13:44.080
I think the most annoying thing to me personally would definitely have to be the fact that

13:44.080 --> 13:50.000
I can't just do a couple of button clicks and get the launcher that I want or even just

13:50.000 --> 13:52.520
the menu layout in general is just obnoxious.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.280
I mean that's been the big stuff that I've noticed.

13:54.280 --> 13:58.240
Yeah, were you thinking, Popey, what, like KitKat, because there's like a program.

13:58.240 --> 14:02.760
No, I mean years ago I used to do Focus Follows Mouse or Sloppy Focus or whatever you call

14:02.760 --> 14:03.760
it.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.640
On Windows 2000 there was a tweak for it from...

14:07.640 --> 14:11.680
Focus Follows Mouse though is, I don't know, yeah, I don't know.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.960
I thought that's basically what you, yeah, you can either have it raise the window or

14:14.960 --> 14:18.640
not and if you have it not raise the window, put your mouse over it and scroll.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.000
I mean, yeah, it's not built in.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.560
It's not easy and it didn't work all the time.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.560
What about you, Popey?

14:23.560 --> 14:24.560
I love that.

14:24.560 --> 14:28.000
When you're not on the Linux desktop, what are you missing the most?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Opening a terminal with Control-Alt-T.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Yeah.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.720
Because I just find myself doing that all the time.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.320
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.200
Yeah, Wimpy, you too?

14:37.200 --> 14:38.200
Terminal?

14:38.200 --> 14:45.920
Yeah, yeah, the terminal is the best hotkey utility ever created, so fire up a terminal

14:45.920 --> 14:53.120
and then you can just ping off and manipulate everything on the system from a few keystrokes

14:53.120 --> 14:56.560
and it's deeply frustrating to not have that on Windows.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.760
Yeah, one of the nice things about it, basically every Linux desktop now is there's a built-in

14:59.760 --> 15:04.960
launcher of some kind and some of them are better than others and then it's nothing like

15:04.960 --> 15:05.960
that.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.080
You have the start menu but it's not quite the same thing.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.680
Eric, do you have any that jump out at you for things you miss when you step away from

15:10.680 --> 15:11.680
Linux?

15:11.680 --> 15:14.440
Yeah, well, you mentioned the terminal thing.

15:14.440 --> 15:21.180
I also was thinking about, in terms of the terminal, I was just thinking it's nice to

15:21.180 --> 15:27.160
have that F12 for like Yackquake or Guake for the terminals to just pop down.

15:27.160 --> 15:35.480
So like if I need to get to the command line, I have to type Windows R to open that up.

15:35.480 --> 15:41.800
So it's just, it gets really aggravating but also being able to tile my Windows where

15:41.800 --> 15:42.800
I want them.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.360
Windows Aerosnap only does the left or the right halves.

15:46.360 --> 15:50.520
It won't do it in quadrants at all and I like that.

15:50.520 --> 15:54.480
You know the big one, I'm surprised nobody's mentioned, the obvious one, package management.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.480
Oh, duh, right?

15:55.480 --> 15:56.480
How did I not mention?

15:56.480 --> 15:58.480
Oh my God, I feel ashamed now.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.480
Yeah.

15:59.480 --> 16:02.920
And then of course, another big one is the virtual desktops.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.320
The Windows is getting those things as well.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.040
I mean, 10 is addressing a lot of these things, isn't it?

16:07.040 --> 16:09.280
I believe also the scroll wheel thing is fixed in 10.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.840
It does but it doesn't really properly address package management.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.400
Please feel me as a proper launcher though.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.400
Yeah.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.640
Surprisingly, the thing I miss in Windows is pulse audio.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.640
Really?

16:19.640 --> 16:20.640
Yeah, right?

16:20.640 --> 16:21.640
Really?

16:21.640 --> 16:22.640
Really?

16:22.640 --> 16:23.640
Yeah.

16:23.640 --> 16:27.200
It's a fact that I can send it over the network instead of it just being on one machine easily

16:27.200 --> 16:28.200
as well.

16:28.200 --> 16:32.440
So, and how easily and how often do you actually take advantage of that feature?

16:32.440 --> 16:34.720
Not often but it's a neat feature.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.720
Yeah.

16:35.720 --> 16:36.720
Yeah, I agree.

16:36.720 --> 16:41.640
Even along those lines, being able to quickly change your input route, output device when

16:41.640 --> 16:42.780
it comes to audio.

16:42.780 --> 16:44.480
You can't do that very easily in Windows.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.480
You can't.

16:45.480 --> 16:49.280
You have to go into the control panel and mess with a few things and you can't do like

16:49.280 --> 16:52.800
simultaneous outputs or simultaneous inputs or anything like that.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.840
You have to choose one and stick with it.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.840
Very interesting, gentlemen.

16:56.840 --> 16:57.840
All right.

16:57.840 --> 16:58.840
So, moving on.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.040
I'll link to the main thread in our Linux.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.280
They had a whole bunch of good ones in there.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.280
Package management was the one that jumped out at me and then, of course, millions of

17:05.280 --> 17:06.280
other things.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.240
Nobody said wobbly Windows, unfortunately.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.240
I'm sure...

17:09.240 --> 17:10.240
Oh, oh.

17:10.240 --> 17:11.240
Yeah.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.240
Yeah.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.240
Yeah.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.240
Desktop cube.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.240
Okay.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.240
Very good.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.240
Yeah.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.240
Burning your Windows when you close them.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.240
That kind of stuff.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.240
Yeah.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.240
Yeah.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.240
Not was.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.240
Is cool in my world, Matt.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.240
Is cool.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.240
Hey, you know what else is cool?

17:25.240 --> 17:26.240
Our first sponsor this week.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.240
That's Linux Academy.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.920
Head over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and get our special 33% discount.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.320
Linux Academy is a great resource to go train yourself up on something.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.480
They have step-by-step video courses with everything you're going to learn, downloadable

17:36.480 --> 17:39.040
comprehensive study guides.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.760
A lot of the materials you can just download and pop in your MP3 player and listen in the

17:42.760 --> 17:44.200
shower or listen on the road.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.560
As a podcast, it's great supplemental learning material.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.040
They have learning plans so you can set your availability.

17:48.040 --> 17:51.600
They have seven plus distros you get to choose from and all of the courseware will adjust

17:51.600 --> 17:53.000
to those distributions.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.800
And they have some really good stuff because the thing is is the guys behind Linux Academy

17:56.800 --> 17:58.980
are really passionate about the source material.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.840
They don't run courses on Photoshop.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.680
They don't run courses on AutoCAD.

18:02.680 --> 18:06.360
They focus in on this material because this is their world.

18:06.360 --> 18:10.280
Linux enthusiasts, educators, and developers came together to create Linux Academy.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.160
And it's successful because of that because once you get in there, once you start using

18:13.160 --> 18:15.840
their dashboard and see how easily it is to wrap your head around what you're going to

18:15.840 --> 18:19.580
have to do, how each section is broken out, how they have all of the courseware, how everything

18:19.580 --> 18:20.580
kept up to date.

18:20.580 --> 18:23.740
If there's changes in Docker, they make those changes in their courseware.

18:23.740 --> 18:26.560
They have live streams where you can ask the educator questions and those educators are

18:26.560 --> 18:28.440
currently up to date.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.600
They're deploying this stuff and you get to deploy this stuff too because they have scenario

18:31.600 --> 18:32.600
based labs.

18:32.600 --> 18:36.600
So if you're going to go do an NGINX implementation with like an Amazon S3 backend storage, they're

18:36.600 --> 18:40.400
going to have a scenario that actually has you use those utilities including provisioning

18:40.400 --> 18:43.540
that storage and setting that up and getting all of that to work with every application

18:43.540 --> 18:47.160
you're going to be using to do that storage and talk to S3.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.760
You actually get to work with this stuff so you have a real idea of how to use it when

18:50.760 --> 18:52.600
you're out in the real world.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.440
And you're ready to go get trained and they have a good community too that constantly

18:55.440 --> 18:57.800
helps lift you up if you slow down a little bit.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.480
And really I think one of the other things that I've liked a lot about it is I can go

19:00.480 --> 19:03.880
in there and kind of jump around and see what's new and interesting to me.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.240
Because I honestly really haven't had a chance to play with some of the stuff as I've got

19:06.240 --> 19:08.320
out of consulting a little while ago.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.320
And it's great.

19:09.320 --> 19:12.680
Like when I'm ready to jump into a new language like Ruby or Python, they have courseware

19:12.680 --> 19:13.860
on that.

19:13.860 --> 19:17.480
Including a whole set of courseware on AWS and they've really got some great stuff.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.960
And they're adding stuff like new Live Labs two to three times a week right now.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.680
And they also have accounts for groups.

19:23.680 --> 19:27.640
So if you have a business and you want to have a group of you on there, that's a great

19:27.640 --> 19:28.640
way to work together.

19:28.640 --> 19:32.120
They've got Python, OpenStack, Android, Linux courseware, Red Hat specific stuff which is

19:32.120 --> 19:37.240
always extremely valuable, PHP, Android, it's really good, DevOps, Ruby and the list goes

19:37.240 --> 19:38.240
on and on.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.780
I just go over there from time to time and just check out some of the new stuff because

19:40.780 --> 19:43.320
they're always adding stuff and they're really good about updating the community in the news

19:43.320 --> 19:44.760
section when you log in.

19:44.760 --> 19:45.760
Just go try out the dashboard.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.920
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and go poke around.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.680
It's a great opportunity to take it up to the next notch and they've got lots of great

19:51.680 --> 19:53.720
resources for you to try it out.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.200
And I want to do a little PSA.

19:56.200 --> 19:59.200
So this weekend is scale.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.720
And I don't know how many folks, let's see, anybody in the Mumba room going to be at scale

20:02.720 --> 20:03.720
this weekend?

20:03.720 --> 20:05.960
It's going to be February 19th to the 22nd.

20:05.960 --> 20:06.960
Nobody.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.120
But one of my coworkers is.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.760
Okay, very good.

20:10.760 --> 20:11.920
Well Noah will be there.

20:11.920 --> 20:16.200
He'll be there this weekend and he'll be there Sunday live during the Linux action show.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.880
So you can hunt him down.

20:17.880 --> 20:22.240
So scale is the 13th, this is going to be the 13th annual Southern California Linux

20:22.240 --> 20:23.240
Expo.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.160
It's going to be the Hilton Los Angeles Airport.

20:25.160 --> 20:29.760
And you can bump into Noah and say hi to him and he'll be tweeting from his Twitter account

20:29.760 --> 20:33.880
at Colonel Linux for where he's currently ranting about how much he hates PayPal right

20:33.880 --> 20:34.880
there.

20:34.880 --> 20:35.880
Oh yeah.

20:35.880 --> 20:36.880
You know what I'm going to do?

20:36.880 --> 20:37.880
I'm going to give that a favorite.

20:37.880 --> 20:38.880
I'm going to give that a favorite.

20:38.880 --> 20:39.880
I think I might as well.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.440
I've been on that side of it.

20:41.440 --> 20:45.800
Oh, you've done something odd that we're just going to go and hold onto your stuff forever.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.640
So he'll be tweeting if you want to meet up with him and then during the Linux action

20:48.640 --> 20:51.840
show he's going to try to do it live from the floor and if he can get a hardwired connection,

20:51.840 --> 20:55.960
hey if anybody from scale is listening and you want to hook Noah up with a hardwired

20:55.960 --> 21:00.080
connection we here would really appreciate that because he wants to give you free coverage

21:00.080 --> 21:04.120
live from the floor and he's also going to be there conducting interviews so if you are

21:04.120 --> 21:10.280
there and want to hook up with Noah you can email him, noah at jupitabroadcasting.com and

21:10.280 --> 21:13.400
talk with him and he'll probably get you on camera and then so here's, this is a good

21:13.400 --> 21:14.840
time for me to mention this.

21:14.840 --> 21:21.360
So this, because we're doing this, scale is landing during the Beardpocalypse.

21:21.360 --> 21:26.080
I don't know if you guys know about this but we are currently going, starting Friday, Jupiter

21:26.080 --> 21:27.920
Broadcasting goes nearly dark.

21:27.920 --> 21:28.920
There's a Beardpocalypse.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.380
We are running on a reduced staff.

21:31.380 --> 21:33.180
Reduced staff next week and so.

21:33.180 --> 21:35.160
We need like an evil bumper set for this.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.080
I do have a few things.

21:37.080 --> 21:40.640
I could try out a few things and Matt won't be able to hear them but Erica, here you tell

21:40.640 --> 21:43.560
me if you think, is that appropriate?

21:43.560 --> 21:44.560
No?

21:44.560 --> 21:45.560
No?

21:45.560 --> 21:46.560
Okay how about this one?

21:46.560 --> 21:47.560
Next week is Jupiter Broadcasting's Beardpocalypse.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.560
There we go.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.560
Perfect.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.560
Perfect.

21:50.560 --> 21:59.720
It's the Beardpocalypse next week and so there's going to be a reduced show load next week.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.900
You'll hear more about that soon and one of the things we're doing is Linux action show

22:02.900 --> 22:04.560
on Sunday's release.

22:04.560 --> 22:08.140
It's going to be a retro blasted action of the Linux action show where we've gone back

22:08.140 --> 22:11.980
through your best of submissions, dusted off the ones that didn't suck and then we kind

22:11.980 --> 22:15.680
of gave them a massage and then put them in a righteous position of hindsight and then

22:15.680 --> 22:16.920
allowed you to re-watch them.

22:16.920 --> 22:17.920
You're welcome.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.840
And I show up from time to time with random anecdotes and tell you about people I love.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.400
So that'll be on Sunday's Linux action show that'll get released into the feeds.

22:25.400 --> 22:30.640
We will be live though on Sunday doing scale coverage.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.240
We just will not be releasing it that Sunday.

22:32.240 --> 22:36.960
It'll be the following Sunday where we do a scale extravaganza and we put all of Noah's

22:36.960 --> 22:40.880
on location live coverage and pre-recorded interviews in one episode and we make it the

22:40.880 --> 22:42.800
master scale episode and that'll be it.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.120
So if you followed all of that, good job.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.920
If you didn't follow all of that, screw you.

22:46.920 --> 22:47.920
I'm sorry.

22:47.920 --> 22:48.920
There's nothing I can do about it.

22:48.920 --> 22:49.920
It's complicated.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.720
Welcome to the world of production.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.960
And then let's talk about something that's really going to rock and I don't even need

22:54.960 --> 22:59.000
to ask the Mumble Room because I know every single one of those Mo's in the Mumble Room

22:59.000 --> 23:03.560
is going to be at Linux Fest Northwest in Bellingham, Washington, April 25th to the

23:03.560 --> 23:04.560
26th.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.960
We're going to try to get as much of the Jupiter Broadcasting crew out there and have as big

23:06.960 --> 23:08.560
of a party as possible.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.720
If you want to party with us, you better show up early because I think we're going to be

23:11.720 --> 23:15.800
partying Friday night and then Saturday and Sunday we'll do a live Linux action show on

23:15.800 --> 23:16.800
Sunday.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.860
Saturday I plan to kind of get up and go around and maybe not sit at the booth the whole day

23:19.860 --> 23:21.440
this time.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.440
I don't know.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.440
Yeah.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.440
But, yeah.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.520
And we're going to have, we're going to try to get extra space mats so we can have a good

23:27.520 --> 23:31.720
spot for How To Linux and Women's Tech Radio and we'll be doing some interviews for some

23:31.720 --> 23:33.160
shows at Linux Fest Northwest.

23:33.160 --> 23:36.920
So that's going to be a big show to go to and most of the Jupiter Broadcasting crew's

23:36.920 --> 23:37.920
going to be at that one.

23:37.920 --> 23:41.440
So if you want to say hi to people and we'll have swag there of course and all that kind

23:41.440 --> 23:42.440
of stuff.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.120
We'll have stuff to give away and it's going to be a good show so you can book it now if

23:45.120 --> 23:46.120
you want.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.880
It's April 25th and the 26th, Bellingham, Washington.

23:49.880 --> 23:50.880
It's going to be a pretty good party.

23:50.880 --> 23:52.200
And no food illness.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.680
This will be the second year in a row.

23:53.680 --> 23:54.680
Oh yeah.

23:54.680 --> 23:55.680
I'm going to make sure it's going to happen.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.880
I'm going to wear, I'll be the guy in the really weird mask.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.880
I still remember that one year like it was yesterday.

24:00.880 --> 24:01.880
Oh my God.

24:01.880 --> 24:02.880
Yeah.

24:02.880 --> 24:03.880
All right.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.400
I just, I had a quick question while we have everybody assemble.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.400
Yeah.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.400
I know.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.440
It came in from the subreddit from RDP5008.

24:10.440 --> 24:14.960
Hey guys, I finally decided to try Guake and I'm loving it.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.160
Now if you're watching the video version, boom, that's Guake right there.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.160
Bam.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.160
Bam.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.160
Bam.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.160
It just drops right down.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.160
It's a terminal that I just hit with my tilde key.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.160
Bam.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.160
There it's great.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.160
Boom.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.160
All right.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.160
And when I go to drop down terminal and I go to drop down terminals online, is Guake

24:27.160 --> 24:28.880
the original or are there other worthy alternatives?

24:28.880 --> 24:29.880
Please educate me.

24:29.880 --> 24:33.480
I'm running Linux Mint 17 cinnamon on my laptop, Arch with normal on my desktop and a bunch

24:33.480 --> 24:37.920
to 14 report a bunch on my HTPC and I want me some drop down terminals.

24:37.920 --> 24:41.880
So he was curious about dropdown terminal alternatives and I realized I'm kind of a

24:41.880 --> 24:45.440
Guake bigot, I guess I've never looked outside of Guake.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.440
Gosh.

24:46.440 --> 24:47.440
I listen on KDE.

24:47.440 --> 24:48.440
Yeah, right.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.000
I think I'm going to fall into the same category.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.920
All right Wimpy, you know of one, right?

24:52.920 --> 24:53.920
I know of two others.

24:53.920 --> 24:54.920
Lay it on me brother.

24:54.920 --> 25:01.240
okay okay there's one called yeah yeah quake yes another quake right I've not

25:01.240 --> 25:11.200
used that there's another and there's yet another one simply called tilde which

25:11.200 --> 25:17.000
has all of the features of quake but it uses more modern underpinnings for

25:17.000 --> 25:21.780
managing configuration and such and it is significantly lighter on memory

25:21.780 --> 25:28.000
resources and I've integrated that into Ubuntu mate 1504 so when you install

25:28.000 --> 25:33.960
Ubuntu mate 1504 you zap f12 or tilde and you get a drop-down terminal all

25:33.960 --> 25:38.280
themed and matching the Ubuntu mate desktop well now I recommend Tilda oh

25:38.280 --> 25:41.880
okay so Tilda yeah I saw that also recommend in the subreddit so I will

25:41.880 --> 25:47.440
look into that yeah Tilda a go T I L D a and the site on

25:47.440 --> 25:51.720
the source for it does not seem to be working but I'm sure it's in everybody's repo and

25:51.720 --> 25:55.840
it's also on guess what surprise surprise there's also an arch wiki post

25:55.840 --> 26:00.840
about it everybody shot I know it's oh yeah shotgun stand yeah all right I'll

26:00.840 --> 26:06.480
put a link to the github page oh yeah this is this looks nice this looks

26:06.480 --> 26:10.000
really nice I'm gonna put a link to that in the show notes for people that the

26:10.000 --> 26:13.600
people that want to grab it only runs in five mix of RAM so I like it for that

26:13.600 --> 26:18.880
reason whoa do you do have a music in the chat room mentions xfce drop down

26:18.880 --> 26:22.720
terminal and cue terminal has dropped out as well so there's a couple more okay

26:22.720 --> 26:28.400
I know it I mean wimpy do you happen to remember what quakes memory usage was

26:28.400 --> 26:35.320
compared comparatively ah it was several times that it was about 30 Megs because

26:35.320 --> 26:40.320
it's um Python application and it uses the old g-comp for settings and what

26:40.320 --> 26:45.280
have you I'm gonna look right now yeah I'm 28 6 right now are you really eight

26:45.280 --> 26:49.720
megabytes of RAM yeah it bounces in the beat up between that and 30 yeah all

26:49.720 --> 26:53.560
right I'm yeah that's I'm switching that's that tears it that is crazy I

26:53.560 --> 26:58.520
never even thought to look like look at that I pride myself on stripping the

26:58.520 --> 27:01.080
stuff now and I'd love to switch I'm sorry what was that you pride yourself

27:01.080 --> 27:06.360
on I pride myself on stripping it I pride myself on you know running down

27:06.360 --> 27:09.440
hard to the metals again so I think I'm gonna switch this looks really cool are

27:09.440 --> 27:15.680
you still on mate man oh yeah yeah oh man I I've not worked back I've taught

27:15.680 --> 27:21.200
and I I did elementary kind of lulled me over on one of my one of my old laptops

27:21.200 --> 27:24.480
that I had and it barely runs but you know I got it going you know it's like

27:24.480 --> 27:27.160
oh that was cool for about ten minutes and then I kind of you know but all my

27:27.160 --> 27:31.160
other computers run mate it just just what I do sure so before we get on to

27:31.160 --> 27:37.400
arch Linux arm right arm arm arch Linux did anybody want to touch on the

27:37.400 --> 27:40.760
elementary OS topic I know rotten corpse you mentioned you wanted to bring it up

27:40.760 --> 27:43.920
so I was gonna open the flight up I don't want this to turn into like a dog

27:43.920 --> 27:48.240
pile thing on the project though but if there's any follow-up I'm happy to hear

27:48.240 --> 27:52.360
well I don't want to you know attack him or anything but there was a part in the

27:52.360 --> 27:57.920
interview where Noah asked him do you know how much has been how much of the

27:57.920 --> 28:02.240
money has been updated has been sent to Debbie and in a bun to because they were

28:02.240 --> 28:06.400
talking about the entire operating system yeah and the answer is nothing I

28:06.400 --> 28:10.560
thought it was like a couple hundred dollars or something no they're bounty

28:10.560 --> 28:14.200
source actually bounty source is not really that good of an idea because the

28:14.200 --> 28:19.480
concept is it's good but it's also broken because they you're fit you're

28:19.480 --> 28:24.080
not paying the project you're paying the developer who fixes a particular bug so

28:24.080 --> 28:28.280
if someone just comes in and fixes it that just fixes that one bug and you're

28:28.280 --> 28:31.200
paying for that bug but that that doesn't even mean that that bug is a

28:31.200 --> 28:35.560
really good fix and that the project will even take the fix so not they don't

28:35.560 --> 28:39.160
get the money and they don't maybe don't even get the fix in the first place but

28:39.160 --> 28:48.320
there has only been like roughly there's like okay GTK get like 35 bucks don't

28:48.320 --> 28:52.440
you feel like like saying that the poor people aren't donating to people more

28:52.440 --> 28:55.520
like I mean they're they're currently clearly saying they're not making enough

28:55.520 --> 29:02.080
money as it is well no they made well they allow themselves to call other

29:02.080 --> 29:06.640
people cheers for not contribute well also and it's not that they don't have

29:06.640 --> 29:11.320
the money is because they spent $1,300 fixing bugs in my Pantheon files I mean

29:11.320 --> 29:15.960
if they just gave anything at all to Ubuntu or Debian that'd be fine it's not

29:15.960 --> 29:19.120
it's not about the money anyway it's it's the fact that they say that they

29:19.120 --> 29:23.800
don't know when they do know and it's nothing and also that they are still

29:23.800 --> 29:28.160
claiming that for their for one they're claiming that they're asking for money

29:28.160 --> 29:31.760
for the entire operating system which they're not actually putting money into

29:31.760 --> 29:36.320
the entire operating system they're also saying that you're not cheating us

29:36.320 --> 29:40.440
you're cheating open source so implying that not paying for elementary is

29:40.440 --> 29:43.760
somehow cheating the entire open source ecosystem and that's just absurd

29:43.760 --> 29:49.440
www as a user of the OS you want to chime in yeah you can consider me an

29:49.440 --> 29:55.120
ex-user I'm gonna move to kaboom 2 I've talked to the mumble room throughout the

29:55.120 --> 30:00.520
week in depth about this since even before this happened and I've talked to

30:00.520 --> 30:05.480
some devs that have tried to contribute to the project and been spurned away

30:05.480 --> 30:11.600
and I'm just I'm just kind of done with what I what I've seen the how the

30:11.600 --> 30:15.880
community has been managed like Eric has said in the past and things like that

30:15.880 --> 30:20.680
I'm just gonna move on to something else and maybe even think about getting more

30:20.680 --> 30:26.360
technical knowledge on Linux to do my own distro eventually or do contribute

30:26.360 --> 30:30.840
more to other distros so that's actually good so daredevil and I mean

30:30.840 --> 30:33.880
he would love to cap this entire thing off but now some rumor-mongering go ahead

30:33.880 --> 30:42.160
there devil good guys it has been a while the problem is mostly the people

30:42.160 --> 30:47.520
apparently the looks are good the technicalities could be improved and the

30:47.520 --> 30:52.760
problem is on the social aspect I see a forthcoming mmm we'll see we'll see I

30:52.760 --> 30:57.280
will see I think this distribution what it is is that what we're watching is can

30:57.280 --> 31:02.560
can can a distribution be led by truly just led by ultimate ultimate design and

31:02.560 --> 31:07.160
if you if that is the distribution's purpose and you fork it and you don't

31:07.160 --> 31:11.680
have those people okay what's the point but we'll see I'd be really I would be

31:11.680 --> 31:16.400
skeptical if I was well one possibility and this is horrible and I hate myself

31:16.400 --> 31:20.000
for even mentioning this but I think one possibility that could happen if someone

31:20.000 --> 31:24.240
forks it and essentially waits for elementary to do a UI update and then

31:24.240 --> 31:26.960
they say oh that's great we take the they take the code they update it to

31:26.960 --> 31:30.520
their fork and they sit there nothing happens and that happens I that's how I

31:30.520 --> 31:34.000
see them overcoming the design thing it's a horrible thing but you know karma's

31:34.000 --> 31:41.360
a beyond becomes the upstream and they start sending it's not sending us the

31:41.360 --> 31:47.680
package of patches and stuff up to them it could happen but the other thing is

31:47.680 --> 31:53.080
it's just one more thing is that people typically are saying that why are you

31:53.080 --> 31:56.920
getting mad at people wanting for money and no one's doing that it's not about

31:56.920 --> 32:00.880
the money if they ask for money great feel free if they sell it for money and

32:00.880 --> 32:03.920
they don't actually give out buying Azure free that's fine there's a lot of

32:03.920 --> 32:08.360
dishes that already do that I don't care it's not about that it's about them

32:08.360 --> 32:12.840
telling people that they are doing something wrong when they're actually

32:12.840 --> 32:20.400
just doing what they said they could do that's a messaging thing that they'll

32:20.400 --> 32:23.240
work on and this is what I point to you when they say we don't need community

32:23.240 --> 32:28.640
managers oh yes you do well yes you do provoke a you had an interesting piece

32:28.640 --> 32:31.520
over at data nation people should go check out yeah take distributions it

32:31.520 --> 32:35.160
kind of fits in with this whole thing check out Matt's article over data

32:35.160 --> 32:40.040
nation calm all right well so we gotta let's let's talk about arch and arm here

32:40.040 --> 32:43.360
for a sec I mean this is come on come on this is why we're gathered here today so

32:43.360 --> 32:46.400
real quick I'll mention our next sponsor and we'll do that digital ocean head

32:46.400 --> 32:50.440
over to digital ocean right now and and but guess what you can go over there and

32:50.440 --> 32:53.040
I'm gonna give you something that makes you a little special so you're not like

32:53.040 --> 32:56.420
all those other people that are visiting digital ocean it's a popular website it

32:56.420 --> 33:01.200
gets some traffic but you my friend you have the unique promo code of power do

33:01.200 --> 33:05.760
unplugged one word lowercase $10 credit over there you're gonna be one of the

33:05.760 --> 33:09.300
few the elite that has that and supports our show and they go over to digital

33:09.300 --> 33:12.320
ocean comm and what is digital ocean digital ocean is simple cloud hosting

33:12.320 --> 33:15.280
provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive easy way for you to spin up

33:15.280 --> 33:18.600
your own cloud server users can get started in less than 55 seconds and

33:18.600 --> 33:22.920
pricing plan started only $5 per month they get your 512 megabytes of RAM a 20

33:22.920 --> 33:27.880
gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte terabyte of transfer and digital ocean

33:27.880 --> 33:31.120
is data center locations in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam and

33:31.120 --> 33:35.280
London but boy let me tell you oh just go over there check this out this is a

33:35.280 --> 33:39.720
masterpiece in design right there speaking a good design it's dat interface

33:39.720 --> 33:43.120
it's intuitive control panel and you can replicate that functionality on a much

33:43.120 --> 33:47.360
larger scale because digital ocean has an API and it's a good API son I'm

33:47.360 --> 33:50.080
saying it's a good one and people are already taking advantage of it because

33:50.080 --> 33:53.420
it's so good you know when something's good people use it like digital ocean

33:53.420 --> 33:55.680
and they're great API so there's a lot of great apps you can just take

33:55.680 --> 33:58.760
advantage of right now that make it even more powerful like command-line stuff

33:58.760 --> 34:02.400
for your Linux box applets for your Ubuntu menu shoot they probably got

34:02.400 --> 34:06.120
scopes who knows go check it out you can write your own you you could write the

34:06.120 --> 34:08.960
first Ubuntu phone scope oh my gosh you should do this actually you should go

34:08.960 --> 34:12.280
over to digital ocean and write a scope for the Ubuntu touch phone thingy to

34:12.280 --> 34:14.640
manage your droplet that would be so awesome because they got a straightforward

34:14.640 --> 34:18.320
API you can do that you can manage your systems you got your DNS management your

34:18.320 --> 34:21.360
snapshots your one-click installations all through this crazy great interface

34:21.360 --> 34:25.600
all sitting on top of Linux powered by KVM all riding on top of SSD drives so

34:25.600 --> 34:29.080
that way you get that IO performance then connected to tier one bandwidth it

34:29.080 --> 34:32.280
is an amazing package and you can try it out two months for free when you use the

34:32.280 --> 34:37.440
promo code do unplugged I love it we're gonna tell you more about our super cool

34:37.440 --> 34:43.200
video conferencing system that we built for last that's all fancy HD great audio

34:43.200 --> 34:47.280
quality high-fidelity all powered by digital ocean droplets we'll tell you

34:47.280 --> 34:50.400
more about it in an upcoming episode and it's like when I go to deploy some

34:50.400 --> 34:53.880
infrastructure on Linux now this is just where I go it's so fast it's so great

34:53.880 --> 34:57.800
the values there and it's all under one account digital ocean comm do unplug when

34:57.800 --> 35:02.440
you check out in a big thank you digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplugged

35:02.440 --> 35:06.560
program alright so let's bring in warhead here hey warhead welcome to the

35:06.560 --> 35:10.960
Linux unplugged show and first of all start with your first name because I

35:10.960 --> 35:13.960
don't want to just you have you on the internet known as warhead and tell us a

35:13.960 --> 35:18.160
little bit about yourself don't worry I've already been known around the

35:18.160 --> 35:23.000
internet for about ten years as warheads anyways okay my actual name is Jason

35:23.000 --> 35:27.560
plum okay and I'm one of the core developers well Jason I'm really glad

35:27.560 --> 35:29.960
you could make it because this is getting to be a pretty interesting

35:29.960 --> 35:32.840
category and it's one that we want to spend a little more time talking about

35:32.840 --> 35:36.360
from time to time on the unplugged show and maybe we could start could you give

35:36.360 --> 35:40.400
us a little background on the arch Linux arm project like when it's been around

35:40.400 --> 35:47.520
and anything like that the UK to share with us yeah sure so in 2009 before I

35:47.520 --> 35:51.280
was actually involved with the project a little thing that some of you may have

35:51.280 --> 35:55.720
heard of called the Shiva plug came out of the market oh yeah and at the time

35:55.720 --> 36:01.640
the only thing you could get was Debian and a particularly aging version of

36:01.640 --> 36:06.080
Debian at the time as well and then after that a commercial piece called the

36:06.080 --> 36:10.800
pogo plug came out of the market after that and you had a very specific set of

36:10.800 --> 36:13.920
change and everything went out of date rather horribly fast but at the same

36:13.920 --> 36:18.320
time people went this box literally is the same thing as the Shiva box and I

36:18.320 --> 36:22.760
can get it for a reasonable price hmm what if I can run the full-blown Linux

36:22.760 --> 36:29.160
instead of just what they gave me hmm and that's where the original project of

36:29.160 --> 36:35.560
open pogo came along that was where you would have our binaries that would you

36:35.560 --> 36:40.200
would use on that through an originally a mix through IP case so it was sort of

36:40.200 --> 36:47.560
in the Debian behavior and then we became plug block plug box in early 2010

36:47.560 --> 36:53.440
and that's when we actually became officially a port of arch to the arm

36:53.440 --> 36:58.600
architecture and at the time we only had arm v5 support now this isn't

36:58.600 --> 37:02.400
necessarily so could you help me understand the relationship between I

37:02.400 --> 37:07.480
arch Linux arm and arch Linux it's because it's not officially part of arch

37:07.480 --> 37:12.680
is that correct or am I wrong no you're very much correct we are not the same

37:12.680 --> 37:16.960
distribution if you go to their forums and ask about our stuff they will point

37:16.960 --> 37:22.520
you at us and if you ask us about Nvidia we will point you at them either which

37:22.520 --> 37:25.520
way neither one of us knows how to fix those proprietary bits if we aren't

37:25.520 --> 37:32.280
familiar with it hmm just kind of how it is but we actually got our name as it is

37:32.280 --> 37:38.080
today in early 2011 and before we did that we got permission from the arch

37:38.080 --> 37:43.440
Linux team and everybody involved there to use the name arch Linux appropriately

37:43.440 --> 37:48.880
and contacted arm and got their rights to actually use the arm name and the

37:48.880 --> 37:53.640
logo obviously unaltered so we can actually call ourselves and label

37:53.640 --> 37:59.040
ourselves arch Linux arm so we are a complete port that is separate from arch

37:59.040 --> 38:06.440
Linux but we derive 90% of our package builds directly from the ABS trees a you

38:06.440 --> 38:12.240
are etc and then anything that we do differently we put into our github okay

38:12.240 --> 38:15.640
so that sounds pretty actually pretty clean and pretty manageable really from

38:15.640 --> 38:19.240
like from a standpoint of somebody on my side and wimpy you wanted to kind of

38:19.240 --> 38:25.000
mention something up from the arch developer side yeah when when I was was

38:25.000 --> 38:31.280
first working on the Marte packages for arch Linux I was aware that alarm take

38:31.280 --> 38:35.960
the packages from the ABS tree and cross compile them and build them into their

38:35.960 --> 38:42.240
repository so and I it's still running here I've got four alarm boxes running

38:42.240 --> 38:46.440
in a cluster here that we're doing that initial building work and I built all of

38:46.440 --> 38:51.840
my packages on arm to make sure when I release them into the official repository

38:51.840 --> 38:57.480
they'd build cleanly and just flow into arch Linux arm and I know other

38:57.480 --> 39:04.000
developers are mindful of that and do some testing before they release things

39:04.000 --> 39:07.680
and there's this good bug reporting coming back the other way from the alarm

39:07.680 --> 39:12.280
team into the arch bug tracker if we release something that doesn't build on

39:12.280 --> 39:17.840
on arm very good so warhead what would be so this is when I told a few folks

39:17.840 --> 39:20.760
that we're gonna be chatting with you on the show today they said this so the

39:20.760 --> 39:25.240
response I got is oh why would you run arch on an arm device like what's the

39:25.240 --> 39:28.560
advantage there and so warhead what are some typical use cases for arch on there

39:28.560 --> 39:34.360
okay so what's the biggest problem that you see with an Ubuntu install from

39:34.360 --> 39:39.200
somebody who has used arch and you know that when you install Ubuntu out of the

39:39.200 --> 39:45.000
box what's the biggest difference between an Ubuntu or a fedora 20 etc

39:45.000 --> 39:49.880
so arch install it's not even necessarily the age no it's your amount

39:49.880 --> 39:54.320
of decisions that have been made for you yeah yeah of course sure but couldn't

39:54.320 --> 39:57.640
you say I mean there's other there's a ways of paring that down there's things

39:57.640 --> 40:03.840
coming along yes is it is it not is it not the rolling nature that is appealing

40:03.840 --> 40:07.800
to some people is that not part of it no the rolling nature and the being able to

40:07.800 --> 40:12.520
keep up with upstream packages at the speed at which arch itself can keep up

40:12.520 --> 40:16.480
with those is definitely the advantage of being able to run arch on an arm

40:16.480 --> 40:21.600
device especially where you have kernels that are evolving at a weekly pace right

40:21.600 --> 40:25.200
we have some of our devices that are actually running RC kernels they get

40:25.200 --> 40:30.680
rebuilt every time Linus tags hmm yeah and this area is under you have element

40:30.680 --> 40:36.920
it isn't ridiculously rapid development and now we're finally getting

40:36.920 --> 40:42.280
manufacturers to listen to us and begin doing the mainline work Marvel was

40:42.280 --> 40:46.680
traditionally a problem in that area and they've been kind enough to listen to us

40:46.680 --> 40:51.800
after several years of going please please please can you try and they've

40:51.800 --> 40:55.020
enlisted to help with the guys over at free electrons and it's where you see a

40:55.020 --> 41:00.600
lot of the Marvel tree the and the EBU architecture stuff coming in from their

41:00.600 --> 41:05.600
work that's fascinating and so has it been just the size of the community over

41:05.600 --> 41:08.880
time has gotten larger has it been the persistence that you think has made them

41:08.880 --> 41:14.360
start listening to what has changed that attitude on their part as more

41:14.360 --> 41:19.880
consumers get the devices and say somebody gets an older Android tablet

41:19.880 --> 41:24.320
that they've they can now run Linux on now tablets being a really special case

41:24.320 --> 41:30.000
because of the nature of the drivers but the pogo plugs the NAS devices that you

41:30.000 --> 41:33.360
may have floating around the office or have given to one of your clients in the

41:33.360 --> 41:38.280
past the various other things that are available I mean the entire generations

41:38.280 --> 41:42.680
of the Beagle boards the Beagle bones of course the Raspberry Pi one and two the

41:42.680 --> 41:47.600
entire o droid line everything that olem X makes like cannot leave them out they

41:47.600 --> 41:53.720
have created a demand in a market space that didn't exist before and previously

41:53.720 --> 41:59.160
you were as a manufacturer working almost exclusively with corporate and

41:59.160 --> 42:02.120
you're dealing with things that are going to be put in place and then

42:02.120 --> 42:07.280
maintained at their state and then replaced in the near future hmm whereas

42:07.280 --> 42:10.880
now you're getting consumer device who generally speaking these are people that

42:10.880 --> 42:15.800
are technical and they want to go and see hey how well can I make this work in

42:15.800 --> 42:21.680
a low power environment be that from a power usage standpoint or a low CPU

42:21.680 --> 42:25.320
power you know which way do they want to look at that aspect and they're

42:25.320 --> 42:29.200
realizing that to really keep up with the Linux world they can't sit in the

42:29.200 --> 42:34.880
dark ages and just plug their ears and I remember if anybody has any questions

42:34.880 --> 42:39.680
for I guess take me mum in the chat room I I guess what I wanted to kind of get

42:39.680 --> 42:44.240
out of you is I'm trying to I'm still trying to place all of this in in in my

42:44.240 --> 42:48.160
world in context in my world and so I'm curious from you warhead what is sort of

42:48.160 --> 42:54.600
one of your favorite implementations of an arch arm powered maybe it's a server

42:54.600 --> 42:59.120
maybe it's a it's powering a combat robot I don't know but could you give me

42:59.120 --> 43:01.520
an example of an implementation where you've been like that is a great use of

43:01.520 --> 43:06.120
that technology I may set the mumble room off but I do know of at least three

43:06.120 --> 43:15.240
drones that are running us personally I have a Zeiss L NAS 325 under my desk

43:15.240 --> 43:20.440
that runs the lighting control inside my house runs MPD that streams out to my

43:20.440 --> 43:25.320
chromecasts and is one of my primary sources to feed my chromecasts through

43:25.320 --> 43:29.400
my plex that's pretty neat and rotten curves you had a you had it wasn't me

43:29.400 --> 43:36.280
on ring for noobs yeah is the arch Linux package in early structure in the noobs

43:36.280 --> 43:42.840
for Raspberry Pi is that an alarm build the original images were made by us the

43:42.840 --> 43:47.640
foundation was not able to keep up we issued a new image on a monthly basis

43:47.640 --> 43:53.040
and they generally updated the image every three months and at that point it

43:53.040 --> 43:57.400
was a month behind every time so now we are only available through the net

43:57.400 --> 44:01.440
installer type which uses a download to get the tar to actually do the install

44:01.440 --> 44:07.960
so that's why we don't make SD card image files anymore because their CDN

44:07.960 --> 44:13.760
apparently couldn't update fast enough but the there's the news has an install

44:13.760 --> 44:20.520
doesn't it then there is now a net install noobs SD card image yes but the

44:20.520 --> 44:24.960
here's my noobs image that has all the distro bits on it no we are no longer a

44:24.960 --> 44:29.280
part of that image okay okay very good so warhead if I'm listening at home and

44:29.280 --> 44:31.600
I'm thinking okay maybe I want to start playing with this I know I can get a

44:31.600 --> 44:35.000
device that's not too much money I could load Linux on there what's your favorite

44:35.000 --> 44:37.760
what are you recommending people grab the Raspberry Pi what do you tell people

44:37.760 --> 44:41.640
to try with they're gonna jump into this I think it really depends on what

44:41.640 --> 44:44.640
exactly they want to learn what are they already familiar with when it comes to

44:44.640 --> 44:49.400
Linux personally if you want something low power that has all the options you

44:49.400 --> 44:54.000
want to be able to get to the Odroid c1 is an awesome choice if you want to

44:54.000 --> 44:57.500
learn about how all the components interact and maybe can take some of your

44:57.500 --> 45:04.640
knowledge from Arduino and immediately apply it over into running with Linux

45:04.640 --> 45:09.240
and having all the GPIO and SPI access that's very direct and has a lot of

45:09.240 --> 45:14.920
existing documentation through sites like Adafruit etc then the pie and the

45:14.920 --> 45:20.400
pie two are possible options but if you're looking for sheer capability the

45:20.400 --> 45:24.240
Odroid line currently outclasses everyone on the market except for the

45:24.240 --> 45:27.600
Chromebooks ah yeah I'm noticing in your forums it seems like a lot of people

45:27.600 --> 45:31.320
like the Odroid a lot of people using that in there so yeah well you get a

45:31.320 --> 45:36.120
very performant device and they come with the capability of using eMMC 5.0

45:36.120 --> 45:42.600
which is a ridiculously fast storage medium the Raspberry Pi 1 & 2 have the

45:42.600 --> 45:48.160
same SD controller that runs at the same speed and also the Ethernet is much

45:48.160 --> 45:52.840
faster on the c1 as well yeah because it's actually attached to a bus

45:52.840 --> 45:58.380
design for Ethernet big difference then yeah a lot of people talking about the

45:58.380 --> 46:05.000
c1 c1 on the arch Linux arm dot org form so it looks like that yeah the Odroid c1

46:05.000 --> 46:10.040
hits the price point of the Raspberry Pi and even if you take the direct

46:10.040 --> 46:15.480
comparison between the Raspberry Pi 2 and the c1 yeah that had been done all

46:15.480 --> 46:19.680
over the place on the net at this point yeah it definitely comes down to exactly

46:19.680 --> 46:22.600
what you want to do with it there are some things in which the Raspberry Pi

46:22.600 --> 46:27.280
does win unfortunately most of our users would prefer the performance and

46:27.280 --> 46:30.440
behavior that you get out of the c1 yeah that makes sense and it seems like

46:30.440 --> 46:33.320
that'd be a good way a good way to go if you want support from the community too

46:33.320 --> 46:39.080
yeah right well again it's all which way you want to go but yeah warhead thank

46:39.080 --> 46:41.720
you for the fascinating insights I mean I then I'll just I'm just kind of

46:41.720 --> 46:44.440
getting you know my head wrapped around all of this and I appreciate any kind of

46:44.440 --> 46:47.800
info is there anything you want to touch on before we run yeah just remember that

46:47.800 --> 46:52.040
it's not arch arm it's not arm arch it is arch Linux arm if you want to

46:52.040 --> 46:57.000
abbreviate it's alarm alarm arch Linux arm or alarm I like it and I'll put a

46:57.000 --> 47:00.400
link to the to the board you were talking about up on your on your site

47:00.400 --> 47:03.240
there well check in with us from time to time and keep us up to date on cool

47:03.240 --> 47:07.280
developments and stuff well the appropriate people know how to reach me

47:07.280 --> 47:13.480
yeah very good well and I I one of these days one of these days I'm actually gonna

47:13.480 --> 47:16.560
get around to setting up a Raspberry Pi in here because I have one from the same

47:16.560 --> 47:20.560
person who got in touch with you a little birdie yeah I think you have a

47:20.560 --> 47:25.120
u3 floating around somewhere too yeah maybe so maybe so oh I guess and

47:25.120 --> 47:28.400
mandatory I should ask you where do you want folks to go to find out more about

47:28.400 --> 47:33.760
the project oh that's very simple arch Linux arm org there you go arts Linux

47:33.760 --> 47:37.880
arm org and we will have a link in the show notes I might also put a link to

47:37.880 --> 47:42.880
Jason's blog in there and the team link on the wiki as well all right well

47:42.880 --> 47:47.300
warhead you sir are more than welcome to stick around we're going to shoot the

47:47.300 --> 47:52.720
the breeze on the first actual sandbox Linux application that seems to be

47:52.720 --> 47:55.680
portable but first I'm going to tell you about my cell phone provider and that's

47:55.680 --> 47:59.580
ting go to linux.ting.com right now once you and support this show you also got a

47:59.580 --> 48:03.720
$25 discount off your first ting device or a $25 credit ting is mobile that

48:03.720 --> 48:06.480
really does make sense no more contracts no more early to my name no more

48:06.480 --> 48:10.400
illiterate nation fees $6 a month and then you just pay for your usage they

48:10.400 --> 48:14.160
have an amazing dashboard that kicks every single other dashboard or those

48:14.160 --> 48:16.560
other guys don't even have dashboards so I guess I don't even call them that

48:16.560 --> 48:20.320
they're crappy little slow websites that are horrible and seem like they're

48:20.320 --> 48:23.480
designed for an explorer don't even hold a candle to what ting can do so not only

48:23.480 --> 48:26.240
does ting have the best dashboard out there kicks all their butts they've also

48:26.240 --> 48:29.000
got no whole customer service they got a whole great range of devices they're

48:29.000 --> 48:32.360
unlocked they're adding GSM supports they're gonna have CDMA and GSM support

48:32.360 --> 48:34.560
by the end of the month they're rolling out a beta program right now you can go

48:34.560 --> 48:39.160
pre-order an iPhone 6 or get yourself a fancy one of them I think I think myself

48:39.160 --> 48:42.160
the new moto x2 looks really sweet anyways they got a whole range of

48:42.160 --> 48:45.600
devices seriously I want you to go over to ting and check them out they are an

48:45.600 --> 48:49.000
amazing company and where your money should go because think about this if

48:49.000 --> 48:51.840
they're doing this and they're putting pressure on the big guys and if we can

48:51.840 --> 48:54.640
get them to keep putting pressure on the big guys that's good for the entire damn

48:54.640 --> 48:57.320
mobile industry and one of the things I'd like to recommend you check out from

48:57.320 --> 49:01.160
time to time is the ting blog they have stuff posted up there all the time and

49:01.160 --> 49:04.780
this is really a great way to get sort of insights into the company and they

49:04.780 --> 49:08.320
just recently read refined a few feet of a few details on their bring your own

49:08.320 --> 49:13.300
device program and they have those changes up on their block again no

49:13.300 --> 49:17.440
contract nor the termination fee you only pay for what you use and they also

49:17.440 --> 49:20.440
have an early termination relief program if you're stuck in a contract right now

49:20.440 --> 49:24.760
it's flat six dollars for the month then it's just your usage on top of that no

49:24.760 --> 49:29.320
hold customer service go check them out at linux.ting.com I've been using them

49:29.320 --> 49:32.560
for over two years and I'm even more excited than ever as a customer out of

49:32.560 --> 49:35.520
the rolling out GSM because when I go to events and stuff like that I'm just

49:35.520 --> 49:38.660
gonna use whichever network works best and I know things gonna have that super

49:38.660 --> 49:42.320
dialed in linux.ting.com supports the show and gets you a discount off your

49:42.320 --> 49:45.880
first device thanks to ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show and

49:45.880 --> 49:50.800
thanks to you guys for supporting our sponsor so the first fully sandbox Linux

49:50.800 --> 49:54.680
desktop app was showed off this week it's pretty exciting has a few

49:54.680 --> 50:01.060
requirements no x11 right there totally impossible if you have x11 cannot do it

50:01.060 --> 50:05.780
it cannot be secured enough got to have Wayland and they also have to have KD

50:05.780 --> 50:09.040
bus which means you got to have a super modern kernel and totally up-to-date

50:09.040 --> 50:12.760
system D to allow desktop integration to port fully be filtered down to the

50:12.760 --> 50:17.280
kernel level so wait recently using the big strides made in Wayland loaded on

50:17.280 --> 50:23.480
fedora 21 we can start to see some true genuine sandboxing and this is over on

50:23.480 --> 50:28.280
Alexander Larson's blog he's a developer and right here he's gonna start on a

50:28.280 --> 50:33.040
fedora workstation a build of never ball running inside an absolute minimal

50:33.040 --> 50:37.820
sandbox it is absolutely independent of the host distribution has no access to

50:37.820 --> 50:40.720
any system or user files other than the ones from the runtime and the

50:40.720 --> 50:45.120
application itself has no access to hardware devices other than DRI for GL

50:45.120 --> 50:48.720
render because that's what's been allowed no network access I can only get

50:48.720 --> 50:53.080
input via Wayland can only show graphics via Wayland can only do audio out via

50:53.080 --> 50:56.620
pulse audio and of course all the other benefits of sandboxing like can't touch

50:56.620 --> 51:00.320
other stuff on the file system and as you would expect as he starts it up he

51:00.320 --> 51:03.520
builds the container right here so he's just done he's just done all of that and

51:03.520 --> 51:08.680
now he's about to fire it up and he runs it from the gnome launcher and from the

51:08.680 --> 51:11.120
gnome launcher it starts up in a sandboxed environment and now he's

51:11.120 --> 51:16.240
playing never ball in a sandbox that is so wild and in theory he could pick this

51:16.240 --> 51:22.120
up and move another distribution if they had all of the same things like Wayland

51:22.120 --> 51:29.360
KD bus system D and all of that it is so crazy trying to think back to when we

51:29.360 --> 51:32.800
had the whole monkey suit bet and all that and where all things are evolving

51:32.800 --> 51:36.680
to now yeah with Wayland and everything and what Wayland's making possible well

51:36.680 --> 51:41.040
that's what I found really striking about the entire thing is that this is

51:41.040 --> 51:46.920
possible like almost before all of this technology is laid down mm-hmm it's like

51:46.920 --> 51:50.400
it's like here that we're gonna do where we're gonna do KD bus that we I mean

51:50.400 --> 51:53.760
obviously you couldn't ship this today but it's not close up poppy go ahead

51:53.760 --> 51:56.640
you were something it's what do we get wrong something on the details what

51:56.640 --> 52:00.960
what's the matter no no I'm confused as to how this is the first given the unity

52:00.960 --> 52:08.240
next desktop ISO that's been around for months has had siloed applications like

52:08.240 --> 52:11.840
this already so I'm confused how this is the first this is the first one of the

52:11.840 --> 52:15.000
this is the first one of the kind of version that we've been talking about

52:15.000 --> 52:18.720
for several episodes like this this whole gnome start with the gnome

52:18.720 --> 52:23.120
application go all the way down to the kernel sandboxing right which we have on

52:23.120 --> 52:26.800
Ubuntu I which is why I'm confused why this is the first fully sandboxed Linux

52:26.800 --> 52:33.360
desktop app when it's the only one I mean this is the one this is the this is

52:33.360 --> 52:35.960
what we've been talking about for a few weeks it's gonna be coming and now it's

52:35.960 --> 52:40.280
right I don't I don't know I'm using this implementation yes yes yeah you're

52:40.280 --> 52:48.680
using Wayland and under context using all that but I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure

52:48.680 --> 52:54.520
Ubuntu's is very nice poppy I'm sure I'm sure lots of people use how does it is

52:54.520 --> 52:59.120
it now is the sandboxing under is it Ubuntu is it legitimate sandboxing or is

52:59.120 --> 53:04.760
it app armor and enforced profiles it's a palmer so it's not really sandboxing

53:04.760 --> 53:09.040
why not well if you let go through the end go through the steps that he's got

53:09.040 --> 53:13.180
there no access to system files check no access to hardware devices check no

53:13.180 --> 53:17.520
network access check how it's actually done though like the way so so the app

53:17.520 --> 53:20.880
armor is things happen it's checked against a set of rules and then denied

53:20.880 --> 53:24.280
whereas in sandboxing those things just don't even exist for the application I

53:24.280 --> 53:27.400
mean it's not really I mean at the end of the day it's kind of the same thing

53:27.400 --> 53:32.080
but fundamentally like the application under app armor can be aware that there

53:32.080 --> 53:35.680
is a device out there it just is denied access to that device whereas a

53:35.680 --> 53:38.180
sandboxed application would be completely unaware that there's even a

53:38.180 --> 53:44.240
hardware device to begin with I think you're splitting hairs I mean if you

53:44.240 --> 53:47.000
want to if but if you wanted to if you wanted to say that you could say Sousa

53:47.000 --> 53:52.520
had sandboxing ten years ago when they first shipped that open open Sousa or

53:52.520 --> 53:56.440
when they first shipped Sousa Enterprise with with app arm I mean that's not it's

53:56.440 --> 54:00.080
interpretation of a definition I at the end of the day I kind of leaning with

54:00.080 --> 54:03.680
where Chris is at and that one one's missing these things and another one's

54:03.680 --> 54:07.280
comparing them based on rules that seems like a fairly good thing how we label

54:07.280 --> 54:10.880
them we could label one you know a Pepsi challenge one and then Pepsi

54:10.880 --> 54:14.280
challenge to just kind of put that I'll tell you the difference the reason why

54:14.280 --> 54:17.320
I'm talking about this one because this is the first one where you could see

54:17.320 --> 54:21.120
this this is something you could pick it up and move it between distros right

54:21.120 --> 54:23.480
you don't have to have app armor profiles it's not it's not a boon to

54:23.480 --> 54:27.040
specific this would move you could pick this up and have the same stack on an

54:27.040 --> 54:31.760
arch box and run never ball in on the arch desktop and that's kind of the big

54:31.760 --> 54:36.320
piece interesting right yeah so I don't know if now the other question is how do

54:36.320 --> 54:41.000
you deliver that but yeah yeah and it's all up in the air who knows I mean a

54:41.000 --> 54:45.600
lot of technologies as well though yeah which need to be there yeah not as

54:45.600 --> 54:51.240
widespread yet very nascent technologies right now yeah so I think I think it's

54:51.240 --> 54:54.840
interesting to watch but I think like like you're saying it's not gonna be

54:54.840 --> 54:57.800
probably not even this year maybe because you figure there's no way you're

54:57.800 --> 55:00.920
gonna get out in the next couple of distro release cycles no way so you know

55:00.920 --> 55:04.520
if you think of it in terms of distro release cycles it's a ways out it's not

55:04.520 --> 55:08.240
coming well and this particular implementation is as you put you know

55:08.240 --> 55:12.120
it's a ways out where a boon to his implementation and their vision of doing

55:12.120 --> 55:15.320
essentially you know their vision of it is available to everyone now so that I

55:15.320 --> 55:17.840
mean there's some benefits there too you could go up armor up by your ability

55:17.840 --> 55:22.760
right now yeah you betcha and I you know I I also just from somebody who had to

55:22.760 --> 55:27.200
implement app armor and se Linux I always found app armor to be a little

55:27.200 --> 55:34.800
easier to use but yeah I have I actually prefer so and better branding hey one

55:34.800 --> 55:38.040
actually one last story that just because every now that I like to prove

55:38.040 --> 55:42.000
that Richard Stallman was absolutely right and we probably should have been

55:42.000 --> 55:51.500
listening to RMS all along okay yeah that's cool no I did you hear about the

55:51.500 --> 55:57.320
equation group where the Kaspersky Kaspersky labs Kaspersky the Kaspersky

55:57.320 --> 56:03.080
labs guys over in Moscow have pinned hard hard drive firmware based malware

56:03.080 --> 56:07.960
square on the nose of the NSA and it kind of makes that Richard Stallman's

56:07.960 --> 56:10.880
point that all the firmware in your machine should be free I'm just saying

56:10.880 --> 56:14.320
oh no I agree with his vision that's just the implementation that I have

56:14.320 --> 56:17.960
concerns about but now in defense of his vision he's been spot-on for a while I

56:17.960 --> 56:23.760
mean like really spot-on I just wish there was a way to give him another

56:23.760 --> 56:28.240
spokesman maybe in front of him that is more presentable to the company I mean

56:28.240 --> 56:32.080
I mean even Richard Stallman has to use a hard drive how can I exactly can you

56:32.080 --> 56:37.880
how can you like how can we as just regular like just humans how can we

56:37.880 --> 56:42.040
possibly think about the firmware in every single device like can't be done

56:42.040 --> 56:47.520
and that's the problem that's the rub is is you're basically forced into you know

56:47.520 --> 56:51.560
living living in a cabin in the woods and just saying screw everything or you

56:51.560 --> 56:56.000
know basically accepting a certain level of it and I say accepting with a shutter

56:56.000 --> 56:59.800
I hate the idea myself but you know there's a certain level of we're here

56:59.800 --> 57:03.920
and unfortunately our ability all we can do is make everyone known know about it

57:03.920 --> 57:07.440
and hopefully folks will gripe enough that something will happen maybe enough

57:07.440 --> 57:10.880
open source projects will get together and create a multi-billion dollar

57:10.880 --> 57:14.080
company that can start reproducing these pieces of hardware without that stuff I

57:14.080 --> 57:18.320
don't know I wish it would happen I really do but I just have concerns that

57:18.320 --> 57:23.160
it may be too late I hate to say that but you know I mean there doesn't you

57:23.160 --> 57:28.320
want to chime in with something yes one is once it becomes a company and the

57:28.320 --> 57:33.000
off the suggestion might just give it becomes usually tight or to

57:33.000 --> 57:37.160
responsibilities to a government so it may just result into the same thing

57:37.160 --> 57:44.160
again that said there is another thing that I sometimes really wonder is we

57:44.160 --> 57:50.160
campaign so much because what there was a potential was that campaign an open

57:50.160 --> 57:56.680
eyes an opening of eyes off the actual potential right leveraging that did it

57:56.680 --> 58:04.640
did they make them aware of it yes because it's like in like 13 years it's

58:04.640 --> 58:09.000
more than 30 years with this mission and this for example this project is 14

58:09.000 --> 58:13.280
years so it's off it's a baby that's funny that's a good catch I don't think

58:13.280 --> 58:15.680
so I think they're probably pretty clever to figure out on their own but

58:15.680 --> 58:18.400
that is sort of funny like a self-fulfilling prophecy if you had a

58:18.400 --> 58:21.640
time machine the way to prevent massive NSA surveillance would be to make RMS

58:21.640 --> 58:27.480
not out there warning of it that's a big great that'd be a great Linux nerd novel

58:27.480 --> 58:30.340
right there I think that would be right travel and dinosaurs and you got

58:30.340 --> 58:35.400
yourself a seller dude RMS fan fiction why is this not a thing I think it has

58:35.400 --> 58:39.040
to become one okay so one last little public service announcement before we

58:39.040 --> 58:44.560
run so as we talked about and I got to tell you I maybe gonna have to go find

58:44.560 --> 58:47.960
myself some anxiety medications it's gonna be it's dramatic but as we said

58:47.960 --> 58:51.240
next week is

58:52.120 --> 58:57.520
so your Linux unplugged show episode 81 will be a retro extravaganza of your best

58:57.520 --> 59:03.200
of moments but don't worry see these new these are like it's new in a way it's

59:03.200 --> 59:07.200
stuff you've seen your favorite moments but now available with the self

59:07.200 --> 59:11.400
gratifying feature that we've just implemented known as hindsight so now

59:11.400 --> 59:15.840
you can listen to the things we said with that smug hindsight and nail

59:15.840 --> 59:19.520
everything we say nails for it so they were just gonna do that next week

59:19.520 --> 59:23.940
because of the beard apocalypse and then we'll be back in full force with the

59:23.940 --> 59:27.240
show in episode 82 but it's gonna be good episode because they're all the

59:27.240 --> 59:30.720
ones that you guys submitted a while ago when we did the best of for the holiday

59:30.720 --> 59:33.680
season there were so many and we threw out a bunch of they're like wait a minute

59:33.680 --> 59:36.680
these these are really good we should use these again we're like what would we

59:36.680 --> 59:39.440
ever use these for we're not gonna do a best of we're never gonna take a week

59:39.440 --> 59:44.160
off and then we guys like actually yeah I gotta leave and nobody's gonna be here

59:44.160 --> 59:49.520
to edit and that's the weekend of scale so and I'm like oh you know what maybe a

59:49.520 --> 59:53.680
best of would be a good idea and so it's not a best of it's a retro look back I

59:53.680 --> 59:57.280
don't know what the difference is other than it's slightly different wording

59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.120
branding yeah yeah exactly Matt so you get to take next Tuesday off but tune in

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.200
and listen to all the crazy things you said as like you know homework or

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.600
something okay sounds good sounds good and I'll go check out Matt's article of

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.560
data nation is a great article about the danger or risk I guess of boutique

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.420
Linux distributions as I got totally nailed it totally nailed it and you could

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.800
also comment come over join us live on Tuesdays over JB live TV hang out in the

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.680
mumble room Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar for the local time alright everybody

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.760
thanks so much to this week's episode join us next week for episode 81 when we

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:56.320
have the retro flavored edition of unplugged

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:04.040
we should do we gotta get like a special group of people sending like a runs

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.680
Linux in the field we need more runs Linux in the yes so if that would be

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.600
cool when you're traveling or something and take a picture I'll even accept a

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.600
selfie if it's in front of a Linux machine send it into the Linux action

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.960
show Jupiter broadcasting.com with runs Linux in the subject I'll have to get

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.840

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.720

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.120
really cool stuff a lot of heavy networking armed with ARCH sound the

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.860
alarm those are good JBtitles.com do you see that American prison where

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:42.400
they're learning development on Linux yeah I did that's you know well it's

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.600
shaking more time you don't have to pay for to educate people on the system to

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.080
be able to do something when they get out oh we're paying there you go trust

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.920
me you're paying for it yeah oh no we're paying for them to be there but we're

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.720
not paying to teach them to run an OS they don't have to pay for in the first

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.920
place yeah I'm the open source Regis that's what Regis is about.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:08.800
yeah that beard pocalypse music is perfect because I did have a small heart

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.400
attack when you played it yeah your heart just drops in your your feet it's

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:18.800
like oh I'm gonna be playing a special edition of women's tech radio today on

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:23.760
the stream a little bit and you know there's some people they've been

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.480
interviewing some ladies on there that are big-time Linux users like one of

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.880
the one of the one of the gals they interviewed was a big system D fan

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.680
I was like what really oh they start how much system dealing okay that's

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:38.400
interesting that's cool yeah I was just at a play lug meeting last night where a

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:49.760
Gentoo developer was talking about system D oh if it got to the Ubuntu

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.400
project you know it's gonna eventually get to Gentoo those guys that are

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.880
going on if gentoo start talking about system D we're gonna have another system

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:10.600
the flame war they do have it separated out so you can actually replace open RC

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:14.840
at the time yeah to be able to do that now so you can actually replace open RC

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:19.660
or just install system DS binary so that you can manage remote items through

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:24.640
system D journal control machine control etc so I mean they're using bits and

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:27.560
pieces of it from the user land you can use it as the init you don't have to

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:35.000
etc ZFS for the wins just posted in the chat room about these bloody HP right

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:44.160
that so here's the the final report HP amazing HP are they are I don't have the

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:49.160
words actually I don't have the the derogatory superlative that sums up

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:55.480
their incompetence sufficiently so after they've done after trying to place the

01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:02.960
order four times and and then and then cancelling it twice okay so on two

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:07.880
occasions they cancelled the order we placed so we were like right enough of

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:13.520
that nonsense we'll we'll just cancel the accessories order and we'll we'll

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:19.160
find something else my boss has been off in Singapore for three weeks doing some

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.240
business down there and of course you've got every vendor imaginable has got

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:27.800
storefront you know shops down there so he's been able to go around the

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.440
bazaars and have a look at everything and actually touch it feel it play with

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.440
it and and he's come to the right conclusion he's he's bought himself a

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.840
brand new think pad x1 carbon yeah that's what he's that's what he's got

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.600
and that's what he's traveling back with and I think this is a very wise

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:52.040
decision and then today we we get an email from Hewlett-Packard saying our

01:04:52.040 --> 01:05:00.360
order has been dispatched and then and then moments later fuck mothering HP 14

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:10.520
Z turns up at the office two weeks after you cancelled the order and the things

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:17.600
just turned up and they've billed us for it this is two and a half weeks after

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:23.400
they dated the last order that they cancelled no as in you said they said an

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:35.160
email sent an email saying it was dispatched that oh moments yeah so it's

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:51.400
really been the gift that keeps on giving
