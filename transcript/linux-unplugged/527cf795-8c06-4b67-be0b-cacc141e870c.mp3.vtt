00:00.000 --> 00:19.680
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 300 in Lucky 33 for December 24th, 2019.

00:19.680 --> 00:24.220
Hello friends and welcome into a special holiday edition of your Unplugged program.

00:24.220 --> 00:25.220
My name is Chris.

00:25.220 --> 00:26.220
My name is Wes.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.220
Hello Wes.

00:27.220 --> 00:28.220
Hello.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.960
I'm impressed that you dressed up even though this is an audio podcast.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.040
Yeah, I mean this is not a comfortable suit.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.040
You gotta be warm right now.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.320
For the holidays.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.040
You are such a trooper.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.520
And look at this beard.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.440
Also wearing a pretty hat, it's Alex and Cheese.

00:42.440 --> 00:43.440
Hello gentlemen.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.440
Hello.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.440
Ho, ho, ho.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.440
Is that one hat?

00:46.440 --> 00:47.440
They're sharing the hat.

00:47.440 --> 00:48.800
Yeah, I'm impressed.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.400
You guys both fit in that really well and the audio still sounds good.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.400
Pros.

00:53.400 --> 00:57.960
And then of course here to help us celebrate this special event, it's our virtual log time

00:57.960 --> 00:58.960
appropriate.

00:58.960 --> 00:59.960
Greetings mumble room.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.960
Hello.

01:00.960 --> 01:01.960
Hello everybody.

01:01.960 --> 01:09.880
You know, I'm, I just got to say as a special holiday, welcome to Ace Nomad, Ben, Mr. Big

01:09.880 --> 01:18.520
Daddy Linux, AKA Rocco, Brent, Byte, Cubicle, Nate, Jill, Minimac, and the Silent Drifter.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.520
Happy holidays.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.120
Thank you for joining us live today guys.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.820
It's nice to have you here.

01:22.820 --> 01:25.840
Now we're going to do something sort of special this episode.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.200
We're going to look back at the last decade of how open source has changed the world and

01:29.200 --> 01:34.720
a couple of key moments that bent the universe that led to the eventual takeover.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.960
I think it's indisputable.

01:37.960 --> 01:42.740
Open source has won the technology sector to the point where every major company you

01:42.740 --> 01:45.100
can announce has some skin in the game.

01:45.100 --> 01:47.680
It's on most people's handsets.

01:47.680 --> 01:54.120
It runs the cloud and here we are not 13 years later, still podcasting about the very topic.

01:54.120 --> 02:00.720
And when you look back over the decade, there's a few monumental moments, just a few, just

02:00.720 --> 02:02.720
massive things that changed everything.

02:02.720 --> 02:06.960
And we're going to look at those, but then because we like to always kick things up a

02:06.960 --> 02:12.160
notch here on the old unplugged cooking program, we're going to ask, what would the world be

02:12.160 --> 02:15.280
like if that never happened?

02:15.280 --> 02:21.240
And we'll use our future casters to kind of talk about what things would be like if some

02:21.240 --> 02:24.480
of those wins and successes had never happened.

02:24.480 --> 02:25.480
I think that's going to be a lot of fun.

02:25.480 --> 02:30.760
I'm a little scared for a world we come up with, but I'm comforted that we live here.

02:30.760 --> 02:39.000
I know it's funny because so often, you know, we think about how there is just awful consequences

02:39.000 --> 02:42.760
of these platforms or those platforms or this is a lock-in or that's a lock-down.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.760
All the limitations of proprietary tech that's out there.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.960
But we take for granted some of the wins that we really should celebrate.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.140
Yeah, you get where I'm at.

02:50.140 --> 02:51.320
You get where I'm coming from.

02:51.320 --> 02:55.200
So we just have a couple of community items I wanted to cover before we get into that.

02:55.200 --> 02:59.480
A couple of them actually must just be the time of the year are also looking back at

02:59.480 --> 03:02.960
the last 10 years for Tails and looking back at the last 10 years at GNOME.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.160
But let's start with something that's a little more modern.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.400
This is an accumulation of all the stuff we're about to talk about.

03:09.400 --> 03:13.680
And Alex really found a great article over at the Linux server IO blog.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.680
This sounds really cool because it's got a couple of words in the headline, Alex, that

03:16.680 --> 03:17.680
I like.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.680
And that's all it really takes these days.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.680
That's how you get in the show.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.680
Tell me about it.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.280
Well, it's nothing new, really.

03:23.280 --> 03:28.640
You last covered this on last 400 back in January 2016.

03:28.640 --> 03:32.160
And this is netboot.xyz.

03:32.160 --> 03:37.560
And what this lets you do is network boot over pixie boot any server, really.

03:37.560 --> 03:42.560
So rather than having to download an ISO and flash a thumb drive and yada, yada, yada,

03:42.560 --> 03:45.800
you can just netboot off of this pixie server.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.780
So it's very useful for those of us that like to distro hop or whatever.

03:49.780 --> 03:54.320
And now thanks to the team over at Linux server, you can run it out of a Docker container.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.360
So are pixie booting containers now?

03:56.360 --> 03:57.360
Not quite.

03:57.360 --> 04:05.400
It still lets you pixie boot ISOs effectively to boot into Debian, Ubuntu, Zorin OS, like

04:05.400 --> 04:06.800
any.

04:06.800 --> 04:12.080
To be honest, you can actually have a BSD installer in there, a Windows installer, as

04:12.080 --> 04:13.080
well as any Linux ISO.

04:13.080 --> 04:17.120
So it seems like it's sort of streamlined that from somewhat from the somewhat arcane

04:17.120 --> 04:20.920
sort of set up a pixie server somewhere, go find and source all the images, get them set

04:20.920 --> 04:21.920
up the right way.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.460
If I can just do that all that with one container, right.

04:24.460 --> 04:27.880
And then when you're done, unless I'm unless you don't have a network bootable system,

04:27.880 --> 04:31.560
but pretty much every systems network bootable, you could kind of be all done with using thumb

04:31.560 --> 04:37.700
drives and burning ISOs to sticks like just use this on your network.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.400
That's that's pretty slick.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.680
And you plug it in with the nginx let's encrypt container that they offer as well.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.880
And you can host any image you want locally.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.480
There's no cloud required.

04:48.480 --> 04:55.080
Wes, this is this is how we could sort of do like a parachute approach for the arch

04:55.080 --> 04:56.080
server.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.000
So we've got the snapshots and then this as like a backup.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.640
You don't remember when you were saying if you could have it any way you would have it

05:02.640 --> 05:03.960
where we would deploy images.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.680
So we would just do the updates as an image.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.680
Yeah.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.680
What if we use pixie boot?

05:08.680 --> 05:09.680
Yeah.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.680
Okay.

05:10.680 --> 05:11.680
And we use this right?

05:11.680 --> 05:12.680
Right.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.400
I think you're trying to find some ways to make this setup go horribly wrong.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.400
But I'm it.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.400
Oh, you crazy guy.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.400
You're supposed to tell me now just imagine a net bootable mem test or a net bootable

05:21.400 --> 05:24.400
G party or something, you know, it's useful, right?

05:24.400 --> 05:27.400
So you add a container to one of your systems that does that host this thing.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.840
And then I guess you'd have to update your DHCP config to to point to that container.

05:30.840 --> 05:31.840
Correct.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.280
Yeah, they go over the full details in the article.

05:33.280 --> 05:37.680
But you can download there's a web interface built in and you download the ISOs that way.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.760
Oh, it's got so cool.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.520
Look at that.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.520
That's pretty cool.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.160
But the friendliest way to set up pixie I've ever seen.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.160
Wow.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.520
No kidding.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.520
That is all right.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.440
That is pretty great.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.440
Hmm.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.200
Linux home plug calm slash three three three if you want to get a link to this.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.080
I mean, I've had that before, you know, like an arch ISO ready to go and it can be nice

05:57.080 --> 05:59.760
you have your you know, you have someone over need to do tech support, you just plug it

05:59.760 --> 06:03.120
in, you've got your environment ready to go and you can start inspecting their device.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.280
Anybody here ever use Norton ghost and like did like the whole ghosting of a whole lab

06:07.280 --> 06:08.280
or anything like that?

06:08.280 --> 06:10.800
This is the sound of me sheepishly raising my hand.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.800
Yeah.

06:11.800 --> 06:12.800
Yeah.

06:12.800 --> 06:13.800
I mean, we're talking about the proprietary stuff.

06:13.800 --> 06:14.800
That was boom.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.800
Norton ghost.

06:15.800 --> 06:19.760
I can't remember like that some sort of like ghost cast can't remember the name multicast

06:19.760 --> 06:23.440
where you would broadcast the image to all the stations at once.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.440
It was pretty slick.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.320
Yeah, it was kind of cool.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.720
It's just that it was just a hell of a thing to have to manage.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.280
It was too much.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.920
But this is way cooler.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.720
So check out a link to that in the show notes.

06:33.720 --> 06:37.800
Now let's talk about tales celebrating 10 years of well, itself.

06:37.800 --> 06:38.800
10 years of tales.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
What kind of a legacy really?

06:39.800 --> 06:44.840
I mean, the first release of tales was really called amnesia back in 2009.

06:44.840 --> 06:50.200
Since then, they've released 98 versions of tales and remember tales is this secure live

06:50.200 --> 06:55.380
environment you can go into, you know, do all your private Bitcoin and whatnot.

06:55.380 --> 06:56.380
It's very handy.

06:56.380 --> 06:57.520
I'm glad it exists.

06:57.520 --> 07:01.040
And to their credit, they also call out some of the projects that sort of inspired and

07:01.040 --> 07:05.760
helped them when they got started way back in the 2000s.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.280
And one of those stood out.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.280
That was Knoppix.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.280
Remember Knoppix Chris?

07:09.280 --> 07:11.480
Oh, yes, I remember Knoppix.

07:11.480 --> 07:15.920
Knoppix was the first live CD and what's incredible about Knoppix and you can check this out for

07:15.920 --> 07:16.920
yourself.

07:16.920 --> 07:17.920
Go to knoppix.org.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.920
K-N-O-P-P-I-X.org.

07:20.920 --> 07:25.520
I swear to Linus that looks just like it did back in 2000.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.920
I don't think it has changed.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.800
It really hasn't changed at all.

07:28.800 --> 07:34.720
But it was the first live CD that kind of gained wide adoption.

07:34.720 --> 07:38.760
And Jill, you remember this had like the little hardware scanning progress thing when Knoppix

07:38.760 --> 07:39.760
would boot up?

07:39.760 --> 07:40.760
Oh, yeah.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.760
Oh, definitely.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.760
That was cool.

07:42.760 --> 07:48.220
It would felt like, oh, man, Linux can detect anything like it can just adapt and boot on

07:48.220 --> 07:49.220
any system.

07:49.220 --> 07:50.360
That's what Knoppix felt like to me.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.360
Yeah.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.360
Yeah, definitely.

07:52.360 --> 07:56.200
In fact, I still have it installed on an old Penny and Pro 200.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.200
That's awesome.

07:57.200 --> 08:01.520
Well, I remember thinking it was one of those things that sort of stood out to Linux, even

08:01.520 --> 08:04.720
if you weren't yet into some of the, you know, the philosophy underlying it.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.400
It was like, here's this thing that your other operating systems can't do.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.640
What a demo.

08:09.640 --> 08:10.640
What a demo.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.640
Yeah.

08:11.640 --> 08:16.080
And now that's how we install every distro basically.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.920
Well, not every distro, but you know what I mean.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.640
And we still call them live CDs.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.000
Yeah, it's so funny.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.240
I saw recently the Fedora project was discussing like if they actually want to make CD compatibility

08:26.240 --> 08:29.480
like a blocker for the release or not, and they're like, yeah, maybe we should drop this.

08:29.480 --> 08:32.740
There's a lot of complicated stuff that goes in there, you know, to make these images that

08:32.740 --> 08:36.420
work on CDs and USBs, I'd be, I'm all for simpler.

08:36.420 --> 08:39.480
So here we are now, started as Amnesia, but now it's known as Tails.

08:39.480 --> 08:45.080
Now, of course, they've got the installer, which is forked from the Fedora live USB creator.

08:45.080 --> 08:49.800
They have persistence mode if you want to stay in Tails all the time, automatic updatings,

08:49.800 --> 08:54.480
back spoofing, the Tails greeter, which helps you get through some of the initial stuff,

08:54.480 --> 08:59.600
the metadata anonymization toolkit, which they've been using since 2011, as part of

08:59.600 --> 09:04.240
it started as a Google Summer of Code thing, like, so much legacy now.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.240
Yes.

09:05.240 --> 09:09.080
One thing that I really like about this post at the end is one of their section titles

09:09.080 --> 09:15.340
2015 to 2019, sort of the era we've been in now, and the section title is maturity, user

09:15.340 --> 09:17.440
experience in automation.

09:17.440 --> 09:22.280
And I think that just sums up a lot of what has happened in the entire Linux ecosystem.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.320
Really, seriously.

09:24.320 --> 09:27.680
We just really have seen a lot of that from automated testing to automated continuous

09:27.680 --> 09:30.760
building and deployments to all of it.

09:30.760 --> 09:31.760
It's really...

09:31.760 --> 09:35.160
I mean, we're still here to gripe about the edges that are not yet polished.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.960
We have to hunt pretty hard to find them.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.800
Not hard enough.

09:40.800 --> 09:46.160
And then over on Feronix, Michael Arbel has a 10 years past Gnomes 10 by 10 goal.

09:46.160 --> 09:49.440
The Linux desktop is still far from having 10% market share.

09:49.440 --> 09:53.240
I think he woke up on the wrong side of the bed one morning and he wrote this piece because

09:53.240 --> 09:54.240
he's just...

09:54.240 --> 09:56.280
Maybe his Gnome shell crashed.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.280
I know.

09:57.280 --> 10:01.920
He's just kind of having an unnecessary go at Gnome.

10:01.920 --> 10:07.760
We all know this happened, but he writes way back in 2005, the Gnome 10 by 10 goal was

10:07.760 --> 10:13.100
formed to, quote, own 10% of the global desktop market by 2010.

10:13.100 --> 10:17.000
Now approaching 10 years past that failed goal, Gnome or even the broader Linux desktop

10:17.000 --> 10:20.400
market share is still well off from seeing a 10% market share.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.400
All right.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.400
This is relevant for our episode today.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.400
Let's talk about this.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.400
Yeah.

10:24.400 --> 10:27.760
He does note that that very ambitious goal is still documented on the Gnome wiki.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.520
Yeah, it's still there.

10:30.520 --> 10:34.320
The year of the Linux desktop is another cliche and all of that.

10:34.320 --> 10:39.320
It's something that Rocco and I got into in my Linux spotlight actually was what is really

10:39.320 --> 10:41.300
the year of the Linux desktop?

10:41.300 --> 10:45.040
And you've probably asked that question Rocco in a few different ways and you must get various

10:45.040 --> 10:46.840
different answers on that.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.480
Everybody has a different take on it.

10:49.480 --> 10:55.560
And one of my favorites is actually Cubicle Nate's take on it where he said that the year

10:55.560 --> 10:59.080
of the Linux desktop is the year you found Linux.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.080
Right.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.080
That's what I thought.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.760
He's kind of, you know, like larbles kind of having a shot here.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.520
It's like, well, haven't we all gotten past this mentality?

11:05.520 --> 11:07.100
We're kind of over this.

11:07.100 --> 11:12.320
And I think to those of us who really see people's choice of an operating system is

11:12.320 --> 11:16.520
a very personal thing and you know, you choose what works for you.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.760
I have found what works for me.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.360
I pass no judgment if something else works better for you.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.360
We have a lot of things going on in life.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.120
This is something I'm passionate about.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.120
You don't have to be.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.120
Right.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.120
I'd love for you to be passionate about it.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.120
I'd love to share it with you.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.120
Very willing to tell you why it's great.

11:30.120 --> 11:33.120
But yeah, people, you know, you got to make the choices that work for you at the end of

11:33.120 --> 11:34.120
the day.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.120
Here, listen to my podcast.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.120
Listen to my podcast.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.120
Only one?

11:37.120 --> 11:38.120
Okay.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.120
Listen to all of them.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.760
But no, really, I genuinely do try to practice in real life.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.120
When I meet somebody, I try to be accepting of what operating system they use.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.920
And I think we've all, well, I shouldn't say that, but a lot of us have kind of come to

11:47.920 --> 11:50.400
that way of thinking.

11:50.400 --> 11:57.560
Ten years in, we're really kind of looking at like, by most metrics, it seems to be somewhere

11:57.560 --> 12:01.120
around 2% market share.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.980
I wonder, too, how much of this is, you know, we're in a different position.

12:03.980 --> 12:07.840
We talk a lot about the Microsoft's new position in terms of open source and Linux.

12:07.840 --> 12:12.480
So I think us being so vitriolic about the fight to convince everyone, it makes less

12:12.480 --> 12:15.360
sense when there's less parties that we're fighting against.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.360
Hmm.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.360
Yeah.

12:17.360 --> 12:21.880
And I think, too, the type of user can matter a lot.

12:21.880 --> 12:29.160
It can be 2% of a very particular type of user that can matter a lot to a large industry.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.000
I think the Sputnik program is an often cited example of that.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.160
But you look at the desktop strategy of Ubuntu in general, and I think it is an indicator

12:36.160 --> 12:40.880
that that 2% is something that corporations are still interested in catering to.

12:40.880 --> 12:45.120
2.1, I think, was the latest net market share report.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.120
Something around there.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.120
You look at the valve stats.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.120
You look at different stuff.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.120
Right.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.280
And it also doesn't tell the story of, you know, like what the support actually looks

12:51.280 --> 12:52.280
like.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.240
We've seen a lot more, at least just with the advance of web technologies in general,

12:55.240 --> 12:59.840
we're in a lot better place now than we were for the software you might need for everyday

12:59.840 --> 13:04.560
life actually running on Linux, despite relatively no change in market share.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.560
Unquestionably.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.280
Just so much better now.

13:07.280 --> 13:14.160
So much better off with, I mean, there's so many things that we do for work now that are

13:14.160 --> 13:20.960
web based or online that in the past required Windows to do basic things at work like submitting

13:20.960 --> 13:21.960
for time off.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.440
I mean, I remember having a complicated virtual box set up to run Outlook so that it would

13:25.440 --> 13:27.400
pop up in its own little window.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.400
So glad I don't have to do that.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.400
Heck yeah.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.400
I totally rock one of those.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
Yeah.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.640
I made a lot of sacrifices back in the day to make Linux happen.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.720
I was one of those individuals running Xandros.

13:39.720 --> 13:40.720
You remember Xandros?

13:40.720 --> 13:41.720
Yeah, Xandros.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.760
If you bought the pro edition or whatever it was, came with crossover office out of

13:45.760 --> 13:52.360
the box and during the first user set up would allow you to join to a Windows domain.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.360
Really?

13:53.360 --> 13:54.360
Yeah.

13:54.360 --> 14:00.760
So I could log in to my Xandros KDE4 desktop using my Active Directory or NT4.

14:00.760 --> 14:04.720
I can't remember how long ago this was, credentials, both worked eventually.

14:04.720 --> 14:10.020
And I would even be able to set like file permission ownerships based on the usernames

14:10.020 --> 14:12.280
and groups from the NT domain.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.280
That is nice.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.280
Yeah.

14:14.280 --> 14:17.640
Although still that we don't have to do that.

14:17.640 --> 14:18.640
I know.

14:18.640 --> 14:22.800
And this was like a special commercial version of Linux that I personally paid for.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.540
And then like, on the low key installed on my work computer.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.200
It's funny, you know, we had to have those fights.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.000
But it was made easier by the fact that Linux is so flexible and that you can actually do

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
things like that.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Yeah, really.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.640
It really, it really was, it was, it was incredible what the operating system could do.

14:40.640 --> 14:46.840
And 10 years ago, plus I felt like I was trying to show everyone the light.

14:46.840 --> 14:50.600
Like I had found out and discovered about this new promised land that nobody believed

14:50.600 --> 14:51.600
in.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.600
Right.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.640
And we were all staying in this place where there wasn't enough water and there wasn't

14:54.640 --> 14:56.560
enough food and everybody was miserable.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.280
It's just over this Windows XP Hill.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.040
Yeah.

15:01.040 --> 15:05.780
And now that is clearly not the position we're in anymore.

15:05.780 --> 15:10.120
There are so many voices advocating and there are so many reasons to run free and open source

15:10.120 --> 15:14.240
software or to build products around it that it advocates for itself really.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.600
I mean, the momentum of it.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.600
Right.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.600
I mean, and people who are in that space, you know, they don't use it.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.080
I mean, you know, business people, everyone knows at least that it's involved or it's

15:22.080 --> 15:23.600
a name in the space.

15:23.600 --> 15:31.000
So every year I go on this annual shopping trip since I've been 21 with my dad and his

15:31.000 --> 15:33.160
two lifelong buddies.

15:33.160 --> 15:37.440
And every year it's my opportunity to kind of check in with where they're at, you know,

15:37.440 --> 15:38.840
on the technological curve.

15:38.840 --> 15:41.920
How they observe what's happening in the tech space.

15:41.920 --> 15:45.960
And you know, gone now are the questions of what, what is Linux?

15:45.960 --> 15:48.160
What is this Linux thing?

15:48.160 --> 15:50.960
And it's, oh yeah, that's what's the cloud runs on there, right?

15:50.960 --> 15:52.640
Linux run, that's what the cloud runs on.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.640
I'm like, yeah, and your phone.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.640
Yeah.

15:55.640 --> 15:56.640
Yeah.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.040
And your phone and your bank and, you know, everything.

16:00.040 --> 16:04.560
But it's interesting that they actually are aware that it's a thing, even though there's

16:04.560 --> 16:08.840
nothing they connect to on a daily basis that says the word Linux, nothing they interact

16:08.840 --> 16:11.120
with that says Linux, none of their jobs.

16:11.120 --> 16:15.720
I mean, mostly they're in the telco industry, the construction industry, yeah, and the construction

16:15.720 --> 16:19.880
industry and like, there's nothing really in there that has anything to do with technology.

16:19.880 --> 16:25.720
So it's always fascinating to see what the sort of perception level is.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.760
And they, they get it.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.360
They get that services are a thing.

16:30.360 --> 16:35.520
They might not quite understand the scope of responsibility, all the privacy implications,

16:35.520 --> 16:38.840
but they get the idea that there's these third party services.

16:38.840 --> 16:42.400
And they, one of the things they were discussing is, well, how can I back up my photos when

16:42.400 --> 16:45.400
I take them on my phone, but not put them on the cloud?

16:45.400 --> 16:48.160
Like I want to transfer them to like a thumb drive if I can.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.760
And how can I do that, Christopher?

16:49.760 --> 16:52.640
Cause they'll, they'll, all three of them call me Christopher.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.720
And of course I'm walking through all the different scenarios and asking about their

16:55.720 --> 16:58.720
dumb little Android devices that are horrible and all these kinds of things.

16:58.720 --> 17:04.520
And oh, and then of course my dad's got the iPhone, so I'm like, yeah, well, listen, dad,

17:04.520 --> 17:05.520
here's what you got to do.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.320
You got to go through this whole rigmarole because otherwise you're going to be using

17:08.320 --> 17:11.280
iCloud and it's just this whole process, but they get the questions now.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.120
And I didn't introduce them to these things.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.120
Yeah.

17:15.120 --> 17:16.120
Yeah.

17:16.120 --> 17:19.480
Amongst their buddies on their various excursions.

17:19.480 --> 17:23.480
So it's been fascinating to watch that trend, but we got a lot to get into.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.480
You ready to do this?

17:24.480 --> 17:26.640
A decade of Linux West.

17:26.640 --> 17:31.540
So we do have a couple of probably just, let's say last week we had a big housekeeping.

17:31.540 --> 17:33.120
This week we have a short housekeeping.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.680
So just a couple of things right off the top.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.620
Great chance to get caught up on Linux headlines.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.640
It will be taking a holiday break.

17:40.640 --> 17:41.800
All of that's in there.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.780
So go check that out if you haven't yet.

17:43.780 --> 17:45.800
If you, if you haven't, it's fine.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.800
It's totally fine.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.200
It won't take you long to catch up.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.160
Just three minutes or less.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.280
I mean, last week you were so hard on people, Wes, about not listening to headlines and

17:53.280 --> 17:54.280
I just want to say it's fine.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.280
You're right.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.280
I was wrong.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.320
I don't want to be a big man and say that.

17:57.320 --> 18:01.960
And if you'd like to get all your content with YouTube DL, you know, I do Jupiter extras

18:01.960 --> 18:04.080
is on YouTube now so you can go get that.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.760
Go subscribe to so we can name it.

18:05.760 --> 18:06.760
Have we gotten enough?

18:06.760 --> 18:07.760
Let's go look Wes.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.640
Have we gotten enough subscribers to name our, uh, extra show?

18:10.640 --> 18:11.640
139.

18:11.640 --> 18:12.640
I think that might be enough.

18:12.640 --> 18:13.640
Right?

18:13.640 --> 18:14.640
Oh, probably.

18:14.640 --> 18:15.640
Was it a thousand?

18:15.640 --> 18:16.640
We need it.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.640
I can't remember.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.640
Better go subscribe.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.640
You bet.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.640
You better go over there and subscribe.

18:20.640 --> 18:21.640
Cause I can't remember.

18:21.640 --> 18:22.640
And you'll get some extra notifications about, you know, when there's a new extra.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.320
Now I know over the holidays you're missing us.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.320
We're not live.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.680
We're not around.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.180
You want a little more West pain.

18:28.180 --> 18:31.760
Don't we all Jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.080
Keep the conversation going in our telegram group.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.080
We're chatting over there all the time.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.760
I try to pop in a couple of times a day.

18:37.760 --> 18:40.600
Most of us are in there in and out throughout the day over there.

18:40.600 --> 18:43.520
Check it out at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.520
Yeah.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.520
I promised you it was a short one.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.520
Didn't I?

18:46.520 --> 18:47.520
Boom.

18:47.520 --> 18:51.640
It's just a couple of things to mention.

18:51.640 --> 18:58.640
Now last week we talked about brunch with Brent and Jason.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.640
Help me with the Brent.

18:59.640 --> 19:00.640
Help me with it.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.640
You got this.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.640
You got this.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.640
All right.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.640
Spezac.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.640
Spezac.

19:05.640 --> 19:06.640
Spezac.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.640
Spezac.

19:07.640 --> 19:08.640
Spezac.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.640
I wrote it down.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.640
You did write it down and then crossed it out for some reason.

19:10.640 --> 19:11.640
Cause I nailed it.

19:11.640 --> 19:12.640
So then I cried.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.640
I don't need that anymore.

19:13.640 --> 19:14.640
Four thoughts.

19:14.640 --> 19:18.900
Just going to throw this away.

19:18.900 --> 19:24.280
We got a great brunch and part two is out now and it made me really kind of think about

19:24.280 --> 19:26.840
this topic we're about to get into this decade.

19:26.840 --> 19:32.720
And Jason makes a fantastic point from a great perspective of years past.

19:32.720 --> 19:36.520
And we look here now where open source is ruling the world and we're joking about Android

19:36.520 --> 19:39.720
on their phones and yucking about how it runs the cloud.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.720
Ha ha ha.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.720
Look at us.

19:41.720 --> 19:42.720
The champions.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.440
We are the champions.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.560
But it didn't actually have to go down this way.

19:47.560 --> 19:51.560
Maybe if the antitrust case hadn't gone the way it had or the right deals have been made

19:51.560 --> 19:56.400
or the right person offered Linus the right job maybe maybe we wouldn't have had these

19:56.400 --> 20:01.220
victories and in Brent's chat with Jason he really got me thinking so I want to play this

20:01.220 --> 20:03.160
clip it's just a couple of minutes long.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.720
It'll set the stage for the rest of our conversation.

20:05.720 --> 20:10.660
It was my first experience with the idea that you have all the source code.

20:10.660 --> 20:16.680
You're not beholden to a corporate entity to run your computer to license the software

20:16.680 --> 20:21.280
and if you make a change and you improve the software if you have an idea it can be contributed

20:21.280 --> 20:28.880
back to the greater whole for everybody so to me it was a micro example of human knowledge.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.000
Patents are not.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.360
He's talking just to set this up a little bit about Linux and open source and free software

20:34.360 --> 20:35.360
in general.

20:35.360 --> 20:39.640
He's talking about how the difference between something being available for free and something

20:39.640 --> 20:44.060
being locked behind a patent is the difference between all of humanity knowing something

20:44.060 --> 20:45.240
and a select few.

20:45.240 --> 20:50.480
millennia you know thousands of centuries when a human gets an idea he shares it with

20:50.480 --> 20:54.640
another human and then she shares it with somebody else and then she gives it to her

20:54.640 --> 20:59.680
kids and then he shares it to his kids and then you basically have the volume of human

20:59.680 --> 21:09.540
knowledge accelerated our ability to enforce our will upon nature at such a pace because

21:09.540 --> 21:12.200
of the interconnections and sharing.

21:12.200 --> 21:16.640
That's why we are the dominant species on the planet not just luck but our ability to

21:16.640 --> 21:22.000
communicate and share ideas and then share knowledge because of that allows us to get

21:22.000 --> 21:26.860
solve problems that there's just no way you could solve them if your your knowledge died

21:26.860 --> 21:33.900
with the last person that knew a certain thing you know fast forward centuries into the future

21:33.900 --> 21:35.360
and here we are.

21:35.360 --> 21:43.920
That's why Linux has such a snowball rolling downhill effect when it comes to software

21:43.920 --> 21:48.960
for computer and then Mike the ecosystem around it is because it's basically a representation

21:48.960 --> 21:52.280
of what's happens with human knowledge without any restrictions.

21:52.280 --> 21:56.940
If you don't have patents and if you don't have arbitrary lines between you know boundaries

21:56.940 --> 22:02.580
between countries or whatever you know we share ideas with each other and just to make

22:02.580 --> 22:06.520
the sum total of that knowledge better for everyone.

22:06.520 --> 22:09.600
Well that's why it works that's why it works and that bit me in the leg.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.240
I'm like okay this is awesome.

22:11.240 --> 22:17.420
So it's the embodiment of what human knowledge and sharing is normally in software which

22:17.420 --> 22:23.560
part of this point hadn't been and it was digital freedom or what I call digital independence

22:23.560 --> 22:28.360
and that's huge because I could see the future developing around me that the internet would

22:28.360 --> 22:32.440
soon be everything fax machines were just on their way out.

22:32.440 --> 22:37.320
And I was like okay if everything happens inside the computer and wires that connect

22:37.320 --> 22:42.160
us he who controls the wires and the computer controls everything will control the knowledge

22:42.160 --> 22:43.160
of the world.

22:43.160 --> 22:47.640
So we can't let that be a company especially not Microsoft.

22:47.640 --> 22:51.760
They were awful awful from a business practice perspective not just a convicted monopolist

22:51.760 --> 22:54.960
but good night.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.840
So that's a bit of the framework I want to work from as we discuss through some of this

22:57.840 --> 23:04.360
is let's appreciate the success we have seen so far even if we don't have 10 percent of

23:04.360 --> 23:08.560
the desktop market share like we thought we would 10 years ago.

23:08.560 --> 23:13.620
We still have some incredible wins and maybe we're not at that 10 percent because in some

23:13.620 --> 23:16.280
areas things didn't go super well.

23:16.280 --> 23:23.760
I think a lot of us remember the day when Ubuntu shipped Gnome 2 and then there was

23:23.760 --> 23:26.600
the day when they no longer shipped Gnome 2.

23:26.600 --> 23:31.720
Well I mean just to think that at the start of this decade Gnome 2 was still quite relevant.

23:31.720 --> 23:32.720
Yeah.

23:32.720 --> 23:33.720
Yeah.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.760
Gnome Shell became the default.

23:35.760 --> 23:40.960
Gnome Shell 3 became the default I should say in April of 2011.

23:40.960 --> 23:43.640
That's how long ago it was.

23:43.640 --> 23:48.520
Ubuntu 11.04 shipped with Unity.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.720
Mate first released in August of 2011.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.160
Are you seeing how close these are together?

23:54.160 --> 24:00.320
Razer Cute and LXDE merged in July of 2013.

24:00.320 --> 24:05.280
Once that announcement was made about Gnome Shell 3 we just kind of went off in a bunch

24:05.280 --> 24:08.540
of different pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, we just went off in all these

24:08.540 --> 24:09.540
different directions.

24:09.540 --> 24:12.880
We just we really fractured as a community.

24:12.880 --> 24:17.840
You can really see it in the desktop there and of course that also was around the Vista

24:17.840 --> 24:25.920
and Windows 8 timelines where we had our own missteps and very cunningly Apple picked up

24:25.920 --> 24:31.240
a bunch of the DevOps sysadmin type terminal workers that also wanted a reliable stable

24:31.240 --> 24:32.480
GUI.

24:32.480 --> 24:37.240
Their OS was beginning to mature, their Mac OS, next based OS was beginning to mature

24:37.240 --> 24:38.240
at that time.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.320
They had time to iterate there on that.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.600
So it's not a huge win.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.920
It probably depends on your perspective though.

24:42.920 --> 24:47.360
I think we often get too distracted by the miss on the desktop and we don't focus on

24:47.360 --> 24:48.880
all of the other wins.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.280
It's like wins everywhere else.

24:51.280 --> 24:56.800
It's this one area and I personally, and I think I speak for you too, I'm very happy

24:56.800 --> 24:57.800
with my Linux desktop.

24:57.800 --> 24:58.800
Right.

24:58.800 --> 24:59.800
So that's it.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.880
I mean it depends on what we've defined as success because in some ways if you were using

25:01.880 --> 25:07.200
one of these desktops that emerged from that tough period you're probably ecstatic, right?

25:07.200 --> 25:12.680
We have Montair, we have the very different direction that Gnome has ended up going.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.120
We're on the other side in some sense.

25:15.120 --> 25:20.520
Yeah, and now looking back at it, it seems almost necessary, like we had to work through

25:20.520 --> 25:21.520
it.

25:21.520 --> 25:26.440
It also sort of speaks to what is different about the software we're using and the Linux

25:26.440 --> 25:27.440
desktop communities, right?

25:27.440 --> 25:28.720
Like it has cost us.

25:28.720 --> 25:29.720
There were costs to pay.

25:29.720 --> 25:33.680
We missed up on some adoption, drove some users away for a while, but at the same time

25:33.680 --> 25:38.360
it happened because it can happen in our ecosystem because there is this free sharing of ideas

25:38.360 --> 25:39.360
and code.

25:39.360 --> 25:40.360
Hmm.

25:40.360 --> 25:41.360
True.

25:41.360 --> 25:42.360
True.

25:42.360 --> 25:49.640
So it was Ubuntu 11.04 that shipped Unity and then it was Ubuntu 17.10 that went back

25:49.640 --> 25:51.800
to Gnome.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.800
Some years in there.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.800
Yes.

25:53.800 --> 25:58.000
I mean I remember I was one of the ones that was like, oh like Unity, no.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.840
That's when I first started playing with XFCE, so that's one thing that hasn't changed too

26:02.840 --> 26:03.840
much.

26:03.840 --> 26:08.480
Isn't that the UI they made for netbooks?

26:08.480 --> 26:10.400
Unity, that was my reaction.

26:10.400 --> 26:14.720
Unity, that's the netbook UI.

26:14.720 --> 26:17.200
And now you know there's people listening that are still running it.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.480
It ended up being a great desktop.

26:19.480 --> 26:25.800
So let's talk about where we're clearly doing really well, and that's on the server side.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.560
And there's been a few key technologies over the years.

26:28.560 --> 26:34.720
I think it's without a shadow of a doubt, in part due to the accessibility of Linux,

26:34.720 --> 26:39.120
the cost of getting them started, the way you can run on your own systems to test development,

26:39.120 --> 26:42.960
and you can move something that you built on your own system up to the cloud and run

26:42.960 --> 26:47.040
it in production, and it's just as reliable with thousands of users using it.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.200
I mean this decade was the cloud decade, right?

26:50.200 --> 26:54.080
It was one of the biggest transitions we've seen, and Linux was ready for it.

26:54.080 --> 26:58.400
It wasn't absolutely necessarily clear though, and this is one of the areas I'd like us to

26:58.400 --> 27:00.960
reflect on if things hadn't gone right.

27:00.960 --> 27:04.360
I want to take you back to, when was it Wes?

27:04.360 --> 27:05.760
Go back in the time machine.

27:05.760 --> 27:06.760
September 9th, 2013.

27:06.760 --> 27:07.760
Doodly-doot, doodly-doot.

27:07.760 --> 27:14.520
So we're going back to September 9th, 2013.

27:14.520 --> 27:21.720
Before Docker was a thing, it had just recently been open sourced, and it wasn't clear really

27:21.720 --> 27:25.200
what the point was and how big it was going to be.

27:25.200 --> 27:33.240
And so a couple of dudes from DocCloud joined Mike and I to talk about this new Docker project

27:33.240 --> 27:34.840
that they open sourced recently.

27:34.840 --> 27:35.840
Right.

27:35.840 --> 27:41.280
So we were running a platform as a service company, and platform as a service basically

27:41.280 --> 27:47.040
makes it easier for developers to get their ideas up and running in production.

27:47.040 --> 27:53.800
And the thing that we noticed as we were running this platform as a service company is that

27:53.800 --> 27:57.720
developers were, even with a great service like ours, were still spending far too much

27:57.720 --> 28:04.480
time worrying about whether their code would run in-house, whether it would run on different

28:04.480 --> 28:05.480
clouds.

28:05.480 --> 28:12.160
And so in 2013, it was hard to appreciate that you were hearing what these developers

28:12.160 --> 28:13.760
were solving.

28:13.760 --> 28:18.100
They were solving a problem they had for their own software as a service platform, and in

28:18.100 --> 28:21.440
doing so, they created this thing called Docker.

28:21.440 --> 28:26.980
And then they thought, well, if it's useful for us, maybe it'd be useful for other people.

28:26.980 --> 28:28.940
And that's when it caught our attention.

28:28.940 --> 28:32.880
And so they're worried about how the code is going to run rather than worrying about

28:32.880 --> 28:35.120
creating awesome code.

28:35.120 --> 28:40.000
And so we took a lot of the core technology that we had in running our platform as a service

28:40.000 --> 28:43.060
and released it as open source, and that's the Docker project.

28:43.060 --> 28:49.560
And Docker really basically lets you, as a developer, take any application and its dependencies

28:49.560 --> 28:54.160
and package it up in a lightweight virtual container that will run almost anywhere.

28:54.160 --> 28:59.840
It will run on any Linux server, so it can be in-house, it can be at Amazon, it can be

28:59.840 --> 29:03.600
at Rackspace, it can be at any other of the cloud providers.

29:03.600 --> 29:08.440
And you know that what works on your laptop as a developer will work in cast and production,

29:08.440 --> 29:09.440
et cetera.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.640
What a trip to hear that now.

29:11.640 --> 29:17.960
The co-founders of Docker coming on our humble little podcast, Coder Radio Episode 66, to

29:17.960 --> 29:22.040
talk about this new thing they'd started called Docker.

29:22.040 --> 29:27.640
And now here we are many years later, and it has obviously led to the dominance in the

29:27.640 --> 29:28.640
cloud.

29:28.640 --> 29:29.640
It's interesting how it caught fire too, right?

29:29.640 --> 29:35.600
I mean, cgroups emerged back in 2008, and LXC had been around roughly since then.

29:35.600 --> 29:39.360
But Docker had the right pitch, it had the right explanation, and then the right interface

29:39.360 --> 29:42.160
to get people excited about what containers could do.

29:42.160 --> 29:47.200
And it's that classic open source story where they had a problem that they needed to solve

29:47.200 --> 29:50.480
and they thought, hey, maybe somebody else could use this.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.680
Real treat to talk to the co-founders before it was even a thing.

29:53.680 --> 29:59.580
And if you follow Mike on social media, he's doing a Thaleo giveaway right now for students

29:59.580 --> 30:00.580
I think.

30:00.580 --> 30:01.580
I think it's students.

30:01.580 --> 30:06.080
So check that out, because if you're a student and interested in getting a Thaleo, he's got

30:06.080 --> 30:07.820
details on his social media.

30:07.820 --> 30:12.280
So Episode 66, if you want to hear our full interview with the co-founders of Docker before

30:12.280 --> 30:15.160
it was even really a thing, it's really a treat.

30:15.160 --> 30:21.080
And the thing that I want to stress from that discussion is, in talking to them, we had

30:21.080 --> 30:22.520
a sense this was going to go somewhere.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.960
That's why we invited them on the show, obviously.

30:24.960 --> 30:28.220
But you really had no idea the revolution it was going to lead to.

30:28.220 --> 30:32.960
Because there had been what seemed like similar attempts to solve this problem.

30:32.960 --> 30:33.960
Right.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.760
Obviously, those sort of concepts weren't new.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.360
But there was enough to push it over.

30:37.360 --> 30:41.040
I mean, you've sort of just recently come around to having containers everywhere in

30:41.040 --> 30:42.040
your life.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.040
It took a little while to get there.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.200
I got them at home and at work now.

30:45.200 --> 30:49.960
But the tooling has advanced so that the tooling created to solve these scaling problems for

30:49.960 --> 30:52.520
cloud providers can help you too.

30:52.520 --> 30:53.520
Yeah.

30:53.520 --> 30:59.220
So, fast forward, we have a community around these things, like Linux server IO speaks

30:59.220 --> 31:00.220
to that, Alex.

31:00.220 --> 31:05.120
There's a huge community, billion plus users over there, or dead polls or whatever the

31:05.120 --> 31:06.120
quote is.

31:06.120 --> 31:10.200
But I mean, it's a huge group of folks all around open source software shipping using

31:10.200 --> 31:11.200
Docker.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.600
6.4 billion image pools at the latest count.

31:14.600 --> 31:15.600
Holy smokes.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.480
Yeah, I don't know that we would have seen that, right?

31:18.480 --> 31:21.980
I mean, it made sense sort of from the developer side, you're working on it in the back end.

31:21.980 --> 31:25.160
But it's also become an app distribution platform.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.680
Well, there were other projects trying to solve this issue.

31:27.680 --> 31:32.480
You know, HashiCorp had Vagrant trying to make developer images that were kind of shippable,

31:32.480 --> 31:33.480
so to speak.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.480
Right.

31:34.480 --> 31:37.940
But where I saw Docker really win was in the enterprise.

31:37.940 --> 31:42.400
And I think that bears out pretty well over the next five or six years of containers and

31:42.400 --> 31:45.160
orchestration and that kind of thing.

31:45.160 --> 31:49.960
Because it allowed software developers who were working on their laptop to have quote

31:49.960 --> 31:54.480
unquote, the same environment as was in production for the first time.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.480
Yeah.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.000
The Docker co-founders mentioned that too.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.360
That was a thing that really mattered to developers.

32:00.360 --> 32:03.040
That quality of life thing mattered.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.560
More people were making code.

32:05.560 --> 32:10.680
And you know, by 2015, they gained a bit of a reputation for moving too fast.

32:10.680 --> 32:14.640
In 2016, things have sort of shifted.

32:14.640 --> 32:18.520
Red Hat started getting more involved.

32:18.520 --> 32:23.280
Then Red Hat actually shipped Docker in RHEL.

32:23.280 --> 32:27.740
In 2018, Red Hat got Sirius and acquired CoreOS.

32:27.740 --> 32:28.960
And it's really kind of just gone from there.

32:28.960 --> 32:34.640
Now here we are in 2019, and Mantis has acquired the enterprise division of Docker.

32:34.640 --> 32:35.640
Right.

32:35.640 --> 32:39.840
I mean, it sort of popularized things, but as those ideas were proved out, somewhat been

32:39.840 --> 32:44.240
undercut in the sense that all the tech was just packaged up essentially in the kernel

32:44.240 --> 32:45.960
and other open source utilities, right?

32:45.960 --> 32:50.680
So you've got other implementations of basically all the different features of Docker now.

32:50.680 --> 32:54.040
I think there's a little bit of a question of what's the next decade going to look for

32:54.040 --> 32:55.040
them.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.640
Everyone has a container strategy.

32:56.640 --> 33:02.440
You know, Amazon have EKS, Google have their Kubernetes offerings, and so does Azure as

33:02.440 --> 33:03.440
well.

33:03.440 --> 33:08.400
VMware acquired Pivotal, who were competing in that kind of container space as well.

33:08.400 --> 33:13.280
So you know, if you don't have a container strategy at this point, you're not a player.

33:13.280 --> 33:17.000
It is interesting to me to note how well Linux has continued to do in the sense that, you

33:17.000 --> 33:20.260
know, you see Docker having somewhat of a troubled path, but Kubernetes has taken off

33:20.260 --> 33:25.580
in that time and become a rising star based on a lot of the same technology because of

33:25.580 --> 33:26.580
open source.

33:26.580 --> 33:30.640
It's a little surprising in some sense that, you know, some of the technology underlying

33:30.640 --> 33:33.080
Linux hasn't already been broken off to new tooling.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.880
In fact, in a lot of ways, it's become the universal runtime.

33:35.880 --> 33:36.880
Right.

33:36.880 --> 33:40.800
I mean, that's why we have the WSL and Chromebooks can run Linux stuff now.

33:40.800 --> 33:45.280
I mean, there's really not a reason besides maybe the adoption, the right timing, it could

33:45.280 --> 33:47.600
have been a BSD, it could have been some proprietary OS.

33:47.600 --> 33:48.920
Should we shift gears?

33:48.920 --> 33:53.840
You want to talk about what would happen, what would the world look like if that hadn't

33:53.840 --> 33:55.000
come along?

33:55.000 --> 33:59.280
I think we would have been stuck in dependency hell.

33:59.280 --> 34:05.040
What Docker truly solved was reliable shipping of software from how you designed it to how

34:05.040 --> 34:07.120
you sold it to production.

34:07.120 --> 34:11.460
Like we think about it in a different context than the way the market thinks about it.

34:11.460 --> 34:17.620
The market thinks about it in I've created a product, I've promised the product as XYZ,

34:17.620 --> 34:21.600
and I've created documentation on how to make it do XYZ, and I've sold it for tens of thousands

34:21.600 --> 34:26.900
of dollars, and now I give it to client A. And they expect it to do exactly what the

34:26.900 --> 34:29.280
box said it would do.

34:29.280 --> 34:33.480
And you don't always get that until you can exactly reproduce the environment.

34:33.480 --> 34:40.280
And that's what VMs allow for, but at a much higher overhead and not nearly as distributable.

34:40.280 --> 34:45.800
Containers came along and solved Linux's packaging problem on the server in a big way.

34:45.800 --> 34:49.320
The reality of it is, right, they made software more immutable, more portable.

34:49.320 --> 34:53.360
Yeah, I mean, it's a nicely defined boundary that you have where you've got an inside and

34:53.360 --> 34:56.520
an outside and communicate only through certain channels.

34:56.520 --> 35:01.120
So if for the purposes of this discussion, we assume that particular problem hadn't been

35:01.120 --> 35:07.360
solved, it would have meant shipping software on Linux would have been much more complicated.

35:07.360 --> 35:12.760
I think it would have meant we would have had to consolidate more, even more so around

35:12.760 --> 35:14.960
one or two leading distros.

35:14.960 --> 35:15.960
Right.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.080
I mean, because if you think about things in the decade before, you know, you had virtualization,

35:18.080 --> 35:22.640
but I think there was still a large era of, you know, sys admins sort of caring for their

35:22.640 --> 35:23.640
pet servers.

35:23.640 --> 35:28.520
And it worked well at the scales at the time, but clearly there were issues where that just

35:28.520 --> 35:32.720
wasn't going to meet the new demand for all the services that were trying to be created.

35:32.720 --> 35:37.920
Look at how many businesses can scale up because they're doing things in containers instead

35:37.920 --> 35:41.660
of VMs or physical hardware, like I think of DigitalOcean and your GoDaddy's out there

35:41.660 --> 35:44.320
that can sell 599 WordPress a month.

35:44.320 --> 35:48.920
But yeah, back in the day you had cPanels, didn't you, that you had to log into and all

35:48.920 --> 35:50.800
that kind of nonsense, which is just gone now.

35:50.800 --> 35:51.800
Right.

35:51.800 --> 35:55.320
And that was all hocus pocus behind the scenes with Apache virtual hosts and whatnot.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.480
I mean, that was, yeah.

35:57.480 --> 36:03.840
I think what we did have is you'd have an even more consolidated Linux ecosystem.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.100
You'd have maybe Red Hat and Ubuntu.

36:06.100 --> 36:09.720
You wouldn't really have, you wouldn't hear much from any of the other distros in terms

36:09.720 --> 36:12.320
of any kind of like software distribution.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.640
It would really have limited the game.

36:14.640 --> 36:19.560
Today we're able to run CrazyArch on a server and run the exact same software we ran when

36:19.560 --> 36:21.960
it was Fedora because of containers.

36:21.960 --> 36:27.800
And it just, the OS became an implementation detail up to the admin and sort of abstracted

36:27.800 --> 36:31.040
away from the actual function of the application.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.460
We wouldn't have that.

36:32.460 --> 36:34.360
That would be gone in this scenario.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.320
Your applications would still be very closely married to the operating system.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.760
They might be in a VM, but they're still very closely managed.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.080
The dependencies are spread out across the file system.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.080
Right.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.080
You're shipping whole systems.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.080
Yeah.

36:46.080 --> 36:50.840
And the thing is now, you know, with a container that's properly packaged, you are leveraging

36:50.840 --> 36:55.280
the expertise of people that know how to deploy applications properly.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.680
It could be the developers of the application themselves, or it could be some third party

36:58.680 --> 37:00.480
like Linux server or whatever.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.560
Hopefully, hopefully they know what they're doing.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.240
There is the other side of that coin too.

37:04.240 --> 37:07.720
The hub is full of a bunch of, a bunch of stuff that isn't so great.

37:07.720 --> 37:13.960
But you know, when I was getting into Linux to start with, Docker was kind of that gateway

37:13.960 --> 37:19.480
drug that let me deploy stuff that was well ahead of where my understanding was at that

37:19.480 --> 37:20.480
point.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.480
Yeah.

37:21.480 --> 37:25.680
I could do Docker run Plex and suddenly I didn't have to install dependencies or anything.

37:25.680 --> 37:26.680
It just worked.

37:26.680 --> 37:27.680
It was magic.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.800
I'm also grateful for some of the other technologies that fell out of that.

37:30.800 --> 37:34.600
I was just talking with Brent the other day about network namespaces and just sort of

37:34.600 --> 37:38.320
all the, you know, the things that needed to get invented to make containers work.

37:38.320 --> 37:42.840
That's just made, you know, using Linux for other regular admin tasks way better.

37:42.840 --> 37:43.840
Yeah.

37:43.840 --> 37:47.320
There's ways that stuff gets used now that is totally transparent, but very beneficial.

37:47.320 --> 37:48.320
Okay.

37:48.320 --> 37:49.320
All right.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.320
So that was fun.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.320
Mobile Linux.

37:51.320 --> 37:52.320
Not so fun here.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.320
Mobile Linux time, guys.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.320
I see how you're doing this.

37:54.320 --> 37:55.320
It's been a day.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.320
Yeah.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.320
It's been a decade for mobile Linux.

37:57.320 --> 38:01.080
Shuttleworth's grand vision for Ubuntu on phones launches in October, 2011.

38:01.080 --> 38:05.840
It includes TVs, smart screens, tablets, and phones.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.840
What a world that would have been.

38:07.840 --> 38:08.840
Ubuntu Touch.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.400
I still kind of would like a bunch of TV.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.400
That sounds fine to me.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.400
Yeah.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.400
Yeah.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.200
Wes and I reviewed a bunch of clips for this to, you know, we thought we'd play a couple

38:17.200 --> 38:18.200
different ones.

38:18.200 --> 38:22.880
And we found one where Matt and I on the Linux Action Show were running Ubuntu Touch on a

38:22.880 --> 38:23.880
tablet.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.920
And it was kind of usable.

38:25.920 --> 38:29.640
So that was around October, 2013.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.200
Wow.

38:31.200 --> 38:36.240
BQ launches their Ubuntu edition phone in April of 2015.

38:36.240 --> 38:37.440
Those were exciting times.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.440
Yeah.

38:38.440 --> 38:42.880
And then the Ubuntu phone project was killed by Canonical in April of 2017.

38:42.880 --> 38:50.600
And of course, Ubiports took over and released their first stable OTA update in June of 2017.

38:50.600 --> 38:51.720
That was a hard moment.

38:51.720 --> 38:55.960
The Librem 5 crowdfunder kicked off in 2017 of August.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.000
Yes, it's been that long.

38:58.000 --> 39:05.440
And of course, the very first early devices shipped to backers, a handful of backers in

39:05.440 --> 39:06.440
December of 2019.

39:06.440 --> 39:10.220
And then the PinePhone was announced at Fosdom 2019.

39:10.220 --> 39:14.980
And the Braveheart editions went on pre-order on November 2019.

39:14.980 --> 39:20.080
And they are estimated to begin shipping on January 8, 2020.

39:20.080 --> 39:26.640
In there, there's Firefox OS, there's WebOS, there's a lot of different tracks to go down.

39:26.640 --> 39:30.000
But this is the one that I think when a lot of us that have been watching this for a while

39:30.000 --> 39:32.960
look back, these are the ones that really stand out.

39:32.960 --> 39:39.340
That mobile vision that grabbed Canonical, that convergence vision that grabbed them.

39:39.340 --> 39:46.240
They really followed that with a passion for a very long time, from 2011 to 2017, without

39:46.240 --> 39:48.280
ever realizing a profit on it.

39:48.280 --> 39:50.680
I think it felt something like a failure, too.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.340
We talk a lot about whenever the year of the Linux desktop, etc., but it's enough of a

39:54.340 --> 39:58.100
nebulous effort that I don't think we've, we can't really succeed at, but we can't really

39:58.100 --> 39:59.280
fail at the same time.

39:59.280 --> 40:04.520
And I think when Canonical stopped pursuing this, it was just kind of a big, it was a

40:04.520 --> 40:05.520
big failure.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.520
Right?

40:06.520 --> 40:07.520
Yeah.

40:07.520 --> 40:13.360
I remember being so excited when these ideas initially started coming out, and the idea

40:13.360 --> 40:18.480
of convergence, and having this one device to kind of rule them all.

40:18.480 --> 40:23.520
And then I was really upset because I couldn't get a BQ phone here in the U.S.

40:23.520 --> 40:28.400
Because the GSM radios were different or something like that, or they weren't licensed with the

40:28.400 --> 40:31.760
FCC or something similar, I don't remember.

40:31.760 --> 40:32.760
Still stings, actually.

40:32.760 --> 40:33.760
Now that you bring it up.

40:33.760 --> 40:34.760
It does.

40:34.760 --> 40:35.760
Still stings.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.240
Now, I'm in the mumble room, I'd like to flip this one around now.

40:38.240 --> 40:39.600
So let's go the other way.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.400
What if this had been a success?

40:41.400 --> 40:44.240
What if Ubuntu Touch had been a hit?

40:44.240 --> 40:46.040
What would 2019 look like?

40:46.040 --> 40:49.440
I'd like to hear a couple of thoughts from the mumble room, and Brent, I'll go to you

40:49.440 --> 40:51.960
first to let other people warm up.

40:51.960 --> 40:57.840
Can you imagine a world where there was maybe a third option, or perhaps it was iPhone and

40:57.840 --> 40:58.840
Ubuntu Touch?

40:58.840 --> 41:04.120
Yeah, I feel like I've been dreaming of that for this last 10 years.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.240
What would be different?

41:05.240 --> 41:10.760
At least for those of us who are sitting in this virtual room right now, I feel like we

41:10.760 --> 41:14.060
would be taking whole advantage of these technologies.

41:14.060 --> 41:20.360
So we wouldn't be kind of handcuffed with some of the compromises that we're making.

41:20.360 --> 41:24.200
I can easily say that all of us feel like we're making some compromises.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.160
You've said that with some of your choices.

41:27.160 --> 41:31.840
I know, certainly, I would love to be running something that matches my ideals a little

41:31.840 --> 41:33.260
bit closer.

41:33.260 --> 41:37.360
It feels like a real shame that we keep getting a little bit closer, you know, one step ahead

41:37.360 --> 41:39.800
and then it feels like it falls back quite a bit.

41:39.800 --> 41:47.900
But if we were there, man, I would be so much happier with my everyday interactions on these

41:47.900 --> 41:53.880
little devices, because then it would be Linux on all of my devices, open source on all of

41:53.880 --> 41:58.200
the devices I interact with on an hourly basis, really.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.200
Absolutely.

41:59.200 --> 42:05.520
And that would feel like a true sign of success that we actually are there.

42:05.520 --> 42:07.460
Do you think we would be able to appreciate it, though?

42:07.460 --> 42:10.520
Would we fully be able to appreciate it if it just had happened?

42:10.520 --> 42:13.100
Can we only think it'd be a big deal now because it didn't happen?

42:13.100 --> 42:15.080
So the contrast seems amazing.

42:15.080 --> 42:19.920
Well, I think you might still have that contrast because, you know, you could look 10 years

42:19.920 --> 42:23.600
back and say, Oh, remember when we didn't have this?

42:23.600 --> 42:24.600
And now here we are.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.180
I mean, we can do the exact same.

42:26.180 --> 42:31.400
You just did the exact same thing with probably we would have a world of a lot of sort of,

42:31.400 --> 42:35.600
you know, mid range phones, maybe a few flagships, and there would still be Android.

42:35.600 --> 42:36.600
Yeah, for sure.

42:36.600 --> 42:42.400
I just the thing that came to my mind is, and who knows, who knows what directions this

42:42.400 --> 42:46.520
would have gone with the carriers, who knows what the product would have turned into.

42:46.520 --> 42:49.160
So this is all just speculation, obviously.

42:49.160 --> 42:56.520
But assuming Canonical could have walked the line, we may, as a general society, have a

42:56.520 --> 42:59.520
much better privacy situation had the Ubuntu phone.

42:59.520 --> 43:00.520
Yes.

43:00.520 --> 43:04.620
One, because at the end of the day, they're not an advertising company.

43:04.620 --> 43:11.480
But Minimac, you put your money on the line, if I recall, for the Ubuntu touch phone device.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.600
And you were really hoping this thing would materialize.

43:13.600 --> 43:20.920
Could you imagine when they started to get some money for the phone, that was a premium

43:20.920 --> 43:21.920
device.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.680
Hardware specs were gorgeous.

43:23.680 --> 43:26.600
That was a really premium device.

43:26.600 --> 43:31.120
And I was really ready to give my money.

43:31.120 --> 43:38.560
It was like the same like the Librem 5, it was about $500, $600, if I remember well.

43:38.560 --> 43:45.240
But it was packed really as a premium phone with a guarantee that it will be a long time

43:45.240 --> 43:47.640
software update and anything.

43:47.640 --> 43:53.740
And if I remember well, they got millions, millions of dollars from the backers.

43:53.740 --> 43:57.120
But it was not enough to get it straight.

43:57.120 --> 44:03.600
And the thing is, afterwards, I switched to Sailfish OS and there were a lot of people

44:03.600 --> 44:05.960
from Nokia in it.

44:05.960 --> 44:10.480
But they knew how hard the business of mobile will be.

44:10.480 --> 44:15.320
So the mobile business is one of the hardest, I think, when it comes to hardware and software

44:15.320 --> 44:16.960
that we see now.

44:16.960 --> 44:19.960
And they knew how hard it is and they were struggling.

44:19.960 --> 44:21.800
They are still there.

44:21.800 --> 44:27.680
But to get some foot in the mobile business is one of the hardest things that you can

44:27.680 --> 44:28.680
get.

44:28.680 --> 44:30.400
I think we all learned that.

44:30.400 --> 44:33.000
We watched Canonical publicly learn that lesson.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
And it's so sad.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Imagine.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
If that Ubuntu phone.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
There were other tries.

44:37.000 --> 44:43.920
You see that Mozilla tried it and Firefox OS and everything.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.160
Firefox OS lifts on with KaiOS.

44:46.160 --> 44:47.160
As do some of the other projects.

44:47.160 --> 44:52.840
Like WebOS is considered one of the best smart TV platforms now, which is kind of funny.

44:52.840 --> 44:56.040
You have Ubuntu OS that lifts on with UbiPorts.

44:56.040 --> 44:57.640
It's a geek OS.

44:57.640 --> 45:00.840
But they are getting lots of things done.

45:00.840 --> 45:03.960
Sailfish OS is still there and they're getting better and better.

45:03.960 --> 45:07.840
So yeah, but it's hard to get a foot in the mobile business.

45:07.840 --> 45:08.840
Yeah.

45:08.840 --> 45:11.680
Although one of the things I mean, I think we could look at this and say, yeah, OK, it

45:11.680 --> 45:14.520
was a quote unquote failure.

45:14.520 --> 45:19.520
But what's sort of beautiful about free software is the code lives on.

45:19.520 --> 45:22.720
I think Cubicle, Nate, you could probably argue wasn't necessarily a failure at all.

45:22.720 --> 45:26.820
Yeah, I really don't think that that Ubuntu Touch was a failure.

45:26.820 --> 45:29.720
Maybe from a business standpoint, it turned out to be a failure.

45:29.720 --> 45:32.840
But if you look at it, most things in the open source are a slow burn anyway.

45:32.840 --> 45:36.960
I mean, Linux has been a slow burn and look at plasma.

45:36.960 --> 45:40.000
Just a few years ago, everyone was harping on plasma saying, oh, it's so bloated and

45:40.000 --> 45:41.560
slow and blah, blah, blah.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.560
Now look at it.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.780
It's actually it's great.

45:43.780 --> 45:44.960
It's light on resources.

45:44.960 --> 45:49.920
I think what UbiPorts is developing is going to be far greater than what Canonical even

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
conceived of.

45:50.920 --> 45:54.560
You know, we're now with a PinePhone and also you can run on Raspberry Pis.

45:54.560 --> 46:00.120
So it's a whole world of, I think, better devices or potential for better devices than

46:00.120 --> 46:01.160
we could imagine.

46:01.160 --> 46:06.680
It's a much more open and I look at it as an incredibly, incredibly positive outlook

46:06.680 --> 46:08.760
on Linux in the mobile space.

46:08.760 --> 46:09.760
Well said.

46:09.760 --> 46:10.760
Absolutely well said.

46:10.760 --> 46:12.160
And I hope you're right about UbiPorts.

46:12.160 --> 46:17.300
I hope we're in a future down the road where we have a couple of different hardware devices

46:17.300 --> 46:21.240
and I can load different mobile operating systems like I load different distros on a

46:21.240 --> 46:22.240
laptop.

46:22.240 --> 46:23.240
I want a dream.

46:23.240 --> 46:24.240
Wouldn't that be?

46:24.240 --> 46:26.300
And let's be realistic.

46:26.300 --> 46:28.720
There's only a few efforts out there that are going to get us there.

46:28.720 --> 46:29.720
And that's one of them.

46:29.720 --> 46:30.720
And they're doing a great job.

46:30.720 --> 46:31.720
Absolutely.

46:31.720 --> 46:32.720
And they're just keeping at it.

46:32.720 --> 46:35.280
And they're humble still to this day, even after years of work.

46:35.280 --> 46:38.280
And they're doing they're literally doing the people's work.

46:38.280 --> 46:40.760
So there's a few other things on this list.

46:40.760 --> 46:43.200
We'll have some additional links in the show notes.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.360
There's so much area we could talk about.

46:45.360 --> 46:49.440
Like we have a section in here for universal packaging.

46:49.440 --> 46:52.740
It's funny because it's kind of solved in a big way on the server with containers, but

46:52.740 --> 46:54.040
not 100 percent.

46:54.040 --> 46:55.840
It's not a perfect solution for everything.

46:55.840 --> 46:59.240
And then, of course, the desktop sides all over the place still.

46:59.240 --> 47:02.640
But taking advantage of some of the same, you know, the benefits of open source technology

47:02.640 --> 47:07.360
is invented, pioneered by large cloud companies to secure their applications we can use on

47:07.360 --> 47:08.360
the desktop to secure ours.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.360
Isn't that funny?

47:09.360 --> 47:10.360
That's so great.

47:10.360 --> 47:12.200
Because we have the same kernel.

47:12.200 --> 47:13.960
That's something Mac users just can't really appreciate.

47:13.960 --> 47:16.040
And I don't mean to be disparaging when I say that.

47:16.040 --> 47:18.800
I'm just simply saying on the desktop.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.640
Yeah, Cubicle Nate said it perfectly.

47:20.640 --> 47:21.840
It's a slow burn.

47:21.840 --> 47:29.640
But when we are using something that's a contained or, quote unquote, sandboxed application,

47:29.640 --> 47:36.020
it's using technologies that have been tested at a billion dollar scale.

47:36.020 --> 47:38.720
And in Mac OS, like their container stuff is like kind of bolted on.

47:38.720 --> 47:41.960
If you use the app store, like it's just kind of a mess, right?

47:41.960 --> 47:47.280
And it's just simply the difference between an operating system that's made for a couple

47:47.280 --> 47:52.600
of desktops and laptops and an operating system that runs the world's economy.

47:52.600 --> 47:57.200
And that technology trickles down to the applications you're using in your desktop.

47:57.200 --> 48:00.520
And I don't know how you pitch that to people when they're asking what the difference between

48:00.520 --> 48:03.120
the Linux desktop is and every other desktop on the planet.

48:03.120 --> 48:08.440
But about a trillion dollars is our many trillions is probably the answer.

48:08.440 --> 48:16.160
So Chrome OS came around in July of 2009, became widely available when some of the first

48:16.160 --> 48:19.560
Chromebooks arrived in June of 2011.

48:19.560 --> 48:23.840
We got the first pixel book thingy or no phone, I guess.

48:23.840 --> 48:24.840
No, book.

48:24.840 --> 48:27.160
I can't remember what they called the first pixel Chromebook.

48:27.160 --> 48:28.160
What did they call it?

48:28.160 --> 48:29.160
Chromebook Pixel?

48:29.160 --> 48:30.160
Okay.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.160
Whatever that was called in 2013.

48:31.160 --> 48:35.160
Not the phone, because this is confusing, but they called the 2013 laptop.

48:35.160 --> 48:38.840
Yes, that it was called the Pixel and it came out in 2013.

48:38.840 --> 48:41.400
It was kind of the first higher end Chromebook.

48:41.400 --> 48:42.400
Very high end.

48:42.400 --> 48:43.400
Yeah.

48:43.400 --> 48:48.440
Many apps arrived on Chrome OS in 2014 and that's when we started taking it a little

48:48.440 --> 48:49.440
more seriously.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.440
Yeah.

48:50.440 --> 48:52.240
You and I think both kind of like raised an eyebrow at that when we started doing the

48:52.240 --> 48:55.920
coverage and luck for pretty much then on, because then you got network file support

48:55.920 --> 48:57.320
in September of 2018.

48:57.320 --> 49:02.800
Linux app betas arrived in October of 2018 and May 2019, it was announced that all new

49:02.800 --> 49:05.680
Chromebooks would support Linux apps.

49:05.680 --> 49:12.100
And then in Q4 of 2018, Chromebooks were reported making up 21 percent of all notebooks sold

49:12.100 --> 49:17.240
in the US market and that was in 2018 of Q4.

49:17.240 --> 49:21.600
And if that trend continues on, it's probably ticked up a few percentages since then.

49:21.600 --> 49:29.880
And if that wasn't an interesting story all into itself, you then have the Raspberry Pi.

49:29.880 --> 49:35.240
What a few years it has been and it has just been getting faster and every iteration has

49:35.240 --> 49:36.240
gotten better.

49:36.240 --> 49:42.480
In early 2012, the first 10 boards were put up for auction on eBay.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.680
You remember that's how this went down, right?

49:44.680 --> 49:51.600
The 10 boards with a total real price, retail price of two hundred and twenty funny monies

49:51.600 --> 49:55.560
raised around sixteen thousand dollars total when all was done in auction.

49:55.560 --> 49:56.680
That's how they started.

49:56.680 --> 50:03.480
And now look at them in that something initial sales commenced in February of 2012.

50:03.480 --> 50:06.680
The Pi 2 came out in February of 2015.

50:06.680 --> 50:12.600
The Pi 0, I can't believe it was this long ago to tell you the truth, November 2015.

50:12.600 --> 50:13.840
Feels like it was a lot sooner.

50:13.840 --> 50:18.000
It's interesting, you know, it's another space where Linux was just like the right fit, ready

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
to go, adaptable.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.380
I mean, you can get Windows on your Raspberry Pi, but why do you remember those attempts

50:23.380 --> 50:24.380
early on?

50:24.380 --> 50:26.200
Yeah, it took them a long time to get it right.

50:26.200 --> 50:27.480
It was bad.

50:27.480 --> 50:31.540
Pi 3 came out in February of 2016 and then the Pi 4.

50:31.540 --> 50:36.220
My personal favorite, glorious June of this year, 2019.

50:36.220 --> 50:43.160
As we reported in Linux headlines recently, as of December of 2019, the Raspberry Pi folks

50:43.160 --> 50:52.920
have sold 30 million boards and just crossed the one billion dollars in revenue.

50:52.920 --> 50:53.920
That's amazing.

50:53.920 --> 50:54.920
Fantastic.

50:54.920 --> 50:59.400
Selling thirty five dollar computer boards running Linux.

50:59.400 --> 51:06.360
That's 30 million Linux devices that are in the hands of kids, adults, enthusiasts, makers.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.560
Deployed in whole little corners all over the world.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.920
Like the best market possible.

51:10.920 --> 51:13.920
Like when you think of like, who would you like to get Linux in front of?

51:13.920 --> 51:15.520
It's all of the things I just said.

51:15.520 --> 51:17.800
Oh, God, it's so exciting.

51:17.800 --> 51:22.240
It's just genuinely thrilling to see some of these successes.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.480
And how critical do you think these are?

51:23.480 --> 51:25.840
So what if the Raspberry Pi hadn't happened?

51:25.840 --> 51:29.720
I think it was one of the best things that happened to Linux.

51:29.720 --> 51:33.080
On like the consumer side in a very, very, very long time.

51:33.080 --> 51:34.080
What do you think, Cheezy?

51:34.080 --> 51:35.640
Because I know this is an area of passion for you.

51:35.640 --> 51:36.640
Yeah.

51:36.640 --> 51:43.160
So for me, you know, I followed this project much like Ubuntu Touch originally, and I believe

51:43.160 --> 51:47.560
the first boards were actually based on a different CPU, the Amtel CPU or something

51:47.560 --> 51:48.560
like that.

51:48.560 --> 51:51.440
I don't remember the auction bit.

51:51.440 --> 51:57.680
But you know, I think obviously with 30 million boards out there now, that's an amazing number.

51:57.680 --> 52:05.280
And the real heart and soul behind this is that they wanted to basically replicate the

52:05.280 --> 52:06.800
BBC Micro.

52:06.800 --> 52:14.080
So they wanted a computer for kids that they could learn on.

52:14.080 --> 52:18.280
And you know, not only did the board and the hardware come out, which is amazing in itself

52:18.280 --> 52:20.740
and we're using it for so much stuff now.

52:20.740 --> 52:24.880
One thing that we didn't mention on there, too, is the compute module, which, you know,

52:24.880 --> 52:29.460
Raspberry Pis are used everywhere, like you said, in industry to now, it's really a widely

52:29.460 --> 52:32.520
adopted format.

52:32.520 --> 52:35.820
But all of the additional stuff that they've created around it.

52:35.820 --> 52:42.400
So if you were to go to Raspberry Pi dot org slash education and the time that they've

52:42.400 --> 52:50.520
spent to really cultivate that, I think it's going to bring up the next group of Linux

52:50.520 --> 52:51.520
users.

52:51.520 --> 52:56.640
You know, these kids are going to have had Linux experience when they were much younger,

52:56.640 --> 52:58.360
which I really wish I had had.

52:58.360 --> 52:59.360
Yeah, for sure.

52:59.360 --> 53:02.160
Oh, how fun would that have been?

53:02.160 --> 53:03.160
Yeah.

53:03.160 --> 53:06.940
And in four decades, where would I be if I had Linux when I was a kid, right?

53:06.940 --> 53:12.680
So you know, I think it's a really interesting project.

53:12.680 --> 53:16.720
Obviously it spawned several other hardware manufacturers that are doing similar things

53:16.720 --> 53:18.720
now, Pi being one of them.

53:18.720 --> 53:25.160
I think in part it was a result of the technology coming down, pressures from the mobile industry

53:25.160 --> 53:28.480
and other embedded industries that were bringing some of these costs down.

53:28.480 --> 53:33.680
So I think if the Raspberry Pi had never happened, you'd still have the small board computer

53:33.680 --> 53:34.680
market, right?

53:34.680 --> 53:35.680
Absolutely.

53:35.680 --> 53:36.680
You'd still have devices out there.

53:36.680 --> 53:42.840
But would you have that critical mass, would you have that 30 million number, that 1 billion

53:42.840 --> 53:43.840
revenue number?

53:43.840 --> 53:48.040
All the tutorials, all the introductions, you know, the ARM ramps that makes it really

53:48.040 --> 53:50.680
easy to get started with Linux and all this foreign world.

53:50.680 --> 53:55.040
I talk about my Pi 4 servers a lot on Self Hosted and people write in all the time, like

53:55.040 --> 53:59.160
Chris, don't you know there's more powerful boards out there that cost less or cost just

53:59.160 --> 54:01.800
a little bit more and do all these things?

54:01.800 --> 54:04.080
And I try to emphasize, yes, I know that.

54:04.080 --> 54:07.880
But the Raspberry Pi is, it's more than just the hardware.

54:07.880 --> 54:12.520
It's the foundation behind it, it's the commitment to iterate, it's the community, it's the pre-baked

54:12.520 --> 54:15.720
images, it's the network effect for support.

54:15.720 --> 54:21.500
All of these things come together to make it almost a product, like it's a complete

54:21.500 --> 54:26.240
entire product where you have a whole ecosystem of open source things that you just write

54:26.240 --> 54:29.880
to an SD card like it was a floppy disk and you put in the computer and boot like it's

54:29.880 --> 54:34.960
the old days and now you have a dedicated device to do something.

54:34.960 --> 54:40.200
Yeah, and like I said, they've really reached out into education and the foundation has

54:40.200 --> 54:42.200
done a lot there.

54:42.200 --> 54:48.400
They do their Raspberry Pi jam and all these additional tools and programs that they have

54:48.400 --> 54:53.680
set forth to really bring, I feel, the Linux desktop into education and I think you touched

54:53.680 --> 54:58.480
on it when you said we would probably still have single board computers.

54:58.480 --> 55:06.920
And 20 years ago we had microcontrollers that were running industry and now we have these

55:06.920 --> 55:09.980
other microcontrollers that are consumer level that we can use.

55:09.980 --> 55:15.600
But now we have a single board computer that can run a full-fledged desktop.

55:15.600 --> 55:20.280
While it's not always the best experience, it's still great.

55:20.280 --> 55:26.760
It's a great way, I think, for the next generation to get into Linux and I'm really excited

55:26.760 --> 55:33.040
about this most of all because I think what we all grew up with and over the last decade

55:33.040 --> 55:39.120
what we've seen in Linux is going to be so much more than what we ever expected in another

55:39.120 --> 55:45.720
decade and it's because of the Raspberry Pi Foundation and single board computers and

55:45.720 --> 55:47.840
bringing that forth to education.

55:47.840 --> 55:51.440
I think it's going to be another real push.

55:51.440 --> 55:53.640
Long-term knock-on effects.

55:53.640 --> 55:54.640
Absolutely.

55:54.640 --> 55:55.640
Yeah, preach it.

55:55.640 --> 55:57.120
I like that.

55:57.120 --> 56:00.880
Jill, you have another pitch for the Raspberry Pi.

56:00.880 --> 56:01.880
Yes.

56:01.880 --> 56:07.800
To me, I've always considered the Raspberry Pi as the Heath kit for the modern age.

56:07.800 --> 56:10.240
Okay, explain the Heath kit to me.

56:10.240 --> 56:11.240
Yeah.

56:11.240 --> 56:20.880
So back in the 50s, actually when it became very popular, the Heath kit was a radio that

56:20.880 --> 56:26.320
you could build with tubes, vacuum tubes.

56:26.320 --> 56:32.000
I had learned how to build one as a kid with my grandmother and grandfather who were both

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
into radio.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.480
It just seems like the Raspberry Pi is that tool.

56:39.480 --> 56:45.760
The Heath kits became wildly popular in the 60s and 70s and up through the 80s.

56:45.760 --> 56:50.600
To me, the Raspberry Pi is the continuation of that development.

56:50.600 --> 56:52.120
That's a great way to put it in that term.

56:52.120 --> 56:54.640
That's exactly how I think of it with my kids.

56:54.640 --> 56:58.800
I've done a couple of projects with them now and one of them was, I can't remember, I think

56:58.800 --> 56:59.800
it was a Kano kit.

56:59.800 --> 57:03.040
It was a whole kit where we assembled a little computer using the Raspberry Pi.

57:03.040 --> 57:04.040
Oh, cool.

57:04.040 --> 57:05.320
Yes, it is particularly great.

57:05.320 --> 57:10.360
And Minimac, you make a great point that it's not just the educational aspect, but the software

57:10.360 --> 57:15.520
that runs on these has also enabled a whole other kind of, I would say, increasing quality

57:15.520 --> 57:17.260
of life.

57:17.260 --> 57:18.360
Increasing quality of life.

57:18.360 --> 57:19.360
That's a good point.

57:19.360 --> 57:20.360
Isn't it?

57:20.360 --> 57:24.960
In fact, a lot of people started buying Raspberry Pis to have some multimedia center.

57:24.960 --> 57:26.200
Yeah, some Kodi.

57:26.200 --> 57:33.840
So software like Kodi Plex started with that and have developed in a way that it's just

57:33.840 --> 57:34.840
great.

57:34.840 --> 57:35.840
Yeah.

57:35.840 --> 57:41.520
Imagine you have all these open source add-ons that you can use now in these media centers

57:41.520 --> 57:46.800
and imagine all these things were closed source and you wouldn't have this possibility.

57:46.800 --> 57:49.280
So there is a lot of development in that regard.

57:49.280 --> 57:50.280
Oh, gosh.

57:50.280 --> 57:54.760
I can remember having like an x86 with Windows Media Center on it or something.

57:54.760 --> 57:55.760
Oh, dark days.

57:55.760 --> 57:56.760
Oh, dark days.

57:56.760 --> 57:58.080
I tried so many things.

57:58.080 --> 58:03.160
I tried, I had boxy boxes, I had popcorn hours, which I thought were pretty good.

58:03.160 --> 58:09.000
I had Windows Media Extenders that were built by Logitech or Linksys or something.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.240
And I didn't, even back then, I wasn't a Windows user necessarily, but I was willing to use

58:13.240 --> 58:16.440
Media Center if it meant I could watch and pause stuff around my house.

58:16.440 --> 58:20.760
Let's not forget, XBMC is named after Xbox, right?

58:20.760 --> 58:23.920
Which I ran on hacked Xboxes back in the day.

58:23.920 --> 58:26.760
I actually ran XBMC.

58:26.760 --> 58:28.920
Until they closed down it for the patch.

58:28.920 --> 58:29.920
Yes.

58:29.920 --> 58:31.320
Well, that's why you don't get those Xboxes.

58:31.320 --> 58:33.200
You buy them on eBay without the patch.

58:33.200 --> 58:40.320
Yeah, you make a great point because the Media Center software that we have today genuinely

58:40.320 --> 58:44.440
does improve my quality of life because I have a limited amount of time where I can

58:44.440 --> 58:48.480
just sit down and hang out with the old wife skis on the couch and watch something.

58:48.480 --> 58:52.600
And if I'm sitting there fiddling with, that's why when you blokes out there tell me, oh,

58:52.600 --> 58:57.360
yeah, I just have my laptop hooked up to the TV and I just use VLC on the second monitor.

58:57.360 --> 58:58.360
It's no bigs.

58:58.360 --> 59:04.040
I'm like, bro, that's like a solid five minutes of setup that I don't want to spend that.

59:04.040 --> 59:07.960
I get my dinner and I like to watch me something while I eat.

59:07.960 --> 59:08.960
I don't know about you.

59:08.960 --> 59:09.960
Do you do this?

59:09.960 --> 59:10.960
That's nice.

59:10.960 --> 59:11.960
Yeah.

59:11.960 --> 59:12.960
I like to watch something every time I can.

59:12.960 --> 59:13.960
Breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

59:13.960 --> 59:15.280
I like to watch something while I eat.

59:15.280 --> 59:19.540
By the way, subreddit MealtimeVideos, it's a real thing.

59:19.540 --> 59:21.120
And so I like to just get right into it.

59:21.120 --> 59:22.920
I don't want to be munching around with anything.

59:22.920 --> 59:29.760
And so the fact that Kodi is just right there, or in my case, Plex and Kodi together, kumbaya,

59:29.760 --> 59:35.200
it's so reliable, it's so solid, it's so fast, and it's so well done that it makes everyone

59:35.200 --> 59:40.280
in my family comfortable using it, which means it's a solution that sticks.

59:40.280 --> 59:43.640
And that it's not just crazy dad likes to have his tech collection.

59:43.640 --> 59:45.720
It's actually something the entire family can use.

59:45.720 --> 59:46.720
Right.

59:46.720 --> 59:47.720
It's easy enough.

59:47.720 --> 59:49.320
It's worth the extra time that we're learning it.

59:49.320 --> 59:53.160
When we do get an opportunity to sit down and like watch a holiday movie or something

59:53.160 --> 59:55.480
like that.

59:55.480 --> 01:00:00.180
One of the most embarrassing like dad moments in my life has been when you hit the old play

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.400
button and it doesn't work.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.520
And I haven't had that hand on wood table right here.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.980
I haven't had that in years thanks to the quality of media center software available

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:11.980
on Linux now.

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:19.680
You see, I have an IPTV service that I pay about $8 a month, and the implementation

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.600
on Kodi is almost better than the software you get from the company.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.600
No, almost about it.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.600
It's really amazing.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.600
Yeah, it is.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.600
So you're right.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.440
If we didn't have that, I think we'd all be, you'd have to just have whatever the proprietary

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.960
streaming service has available.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.000
And I do worry where this is going.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.840
I worry about when streaming is mainstream and I've got my Netflix box, right, and there's

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:53.240
motivation perhaps to go after your jellyfins, your MBs and your plexes and Kodi's.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:57.320
There's maybe a little more motivation to shut down things that enable your own personal

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.320
streaming.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.560
When the world's mentality shifts to streaming, and this could be a few years out, I just

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.680
wonder if maybe there's going to be some doors that get knocked on.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.560
And if that isn't why you see Plex pushing their ad-supported streaming service now inside

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:16.600
the Plex software, because simply put, if you look like you're enabling piracy, they're

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600
going to come for you.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.680
I mean, we're talking about Disney now.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.160
We're talking about Apple.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.360
We're talking about all of these major corporations that are in the media game now getting into

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.360
streaming.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:32.780
And if they discover their software that makes it super easy to pirate their stuff, so this

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:34.160
reality could happen.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.820
So I think it is really good that we have such well-developed, sophisticated, open-source,

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:43.080
free software projects that if they want to play whack-a-mole.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080
Yeah, that's it.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.080
Once it's open source.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.080
I mean, good luck.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.080
You can take that one.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.940
And if it hadn't gotten to this point, to Minimech's point, if it hadn't gotten to this

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:54.560
point where it is now, and we were in this streaming revolution, we could really be screwed.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:02.600
Well, and I think if you flip that, too, when you talk about going after the piracy aspect

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.320
of some of these media players, or these streaming services, these streaming services wouldn't

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.120
exist without Linux.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.320
Yeah, right?

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.320
No kidding.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.280
How much of all of this is running on Linux boxes, and they're pulling all these files

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.440
off of Linux file servers, and all the applications doing are running in VMs and containers.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.840
It's encoding the files in Linux.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.360
Yeah, that is very true.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.600
And we can watch them on Linux, which is nice.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.960
Yeah, actually, Disney Plus ratcheted their DRM one down, and so now...

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.800
And think about all the hoops we used to go through just for Netflix.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.800
Oh, yeah.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.800
Speaking of Disney Plus, one of the authors of the Cloud Native Infrastructure book actually

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.840
works on the Disney Plus infrastructure.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.840
I saw that.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.840
Yeah.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.120
The guy is really brilliant.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.840
Yeah, at Rothgar on Twitter, if you want to follow him.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.480
It turns out Disney didn't just slap together some streaming service.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:55.120
They really built something special, including their own custom accelerated optimized encoders

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.500
and decoders and all kinds of stuff.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.560
They really went all out.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.560
That's what...

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.240
I mean, who knows where the next 10 years are going?

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:06.920
However, in all the categories we typically talk about, I feel like Linux is sitting pretty

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:07.920
good.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.500
It's positioned pretty good in all of these.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.500
Even the desktop.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.160
We're looking pretty good.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:17.520
The slow burn effect, that slow burn, we're in that phase now where things are getting

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.520
pretty good.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.280
And if that burn continues, by the time we get to the end of it, we're...

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.000
I mean, geez, I'm happy.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.360
I'm already happy.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.360
So I'm really...

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:27.920
I think the next decade is going to be really great.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.200
I don't think Linux is going anywhere other than up and up and up.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.200
What do you think?

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.200
I agree.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:37.840
Well, Wes Payne, we have some very important feedback to cover before we leave.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:43.760
Stuff that really covers an issue that's been going on for a decade itself, really plagues

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.160
the open source community.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.960
And honestly, I'm not sure if there's anything that can be done.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:48.960
It's a travesty.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:49.960
So let's go ahead and address it here on the program.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:50.960
Yeah.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.820
I mean, we've tried to fix it.

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:56.520
Some severe regimens of torture and the like.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:01.360
Chris, I'm curious, what sort of drive do you have in that really nice computer upstairs

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.360
again?

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.360
My boot drive?

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.360
It's an NVME drive.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.360
It's a, yeah.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.360
It's an NV...

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.360
So we've got some excellent...

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.360
NV drive.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.920
Excellent feedback that might just help here from our friend, Colonel Panic.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:19.160
Chris, please, it's NVME, not M-V-N-E.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.160
Every single time.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.160
I know.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.160
I know.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:26.120
And actually, just to really mess with him, last episode, I said it right once.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.120
Yeah, you did.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.120
You caught that?

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.120
That's hilarious.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.640
Well, I could see you were clearly focusing intensely.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.640
Yeah, you could see it in my face.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:34.640
Yeah.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.640
Okay, Colonel Panic does have a tip for you.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.640
It's NVME.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.640
Yeah.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.880
Like NV My Fast Storage.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.880
That's funny.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.840
He also says, thanks for the coverage on Nebula.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:50.320
It seems like a fantastic product, which Nebula is that peer to peer VPN solution.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.040
Don't call it a VPN.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.040
Overlay network.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.320
Overlay network that Slack just released as open source that we talked about recently.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.120
If you haven't caught some of our recent episodes, do go catch up on the Unplugged catalog.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.680
But do not fear, even though we're not live over the holiday, we still have episodes planned

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.520
over the next couple of weeks, including our predictions, our results, and more.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:17.400
So do go to linuxunplugged.com slash 333 for show notes and links to some of the things

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:22.280
we talked about, including some of those stories with some quotes that are a little cringe-worthy

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.760
these days.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:27.920
And I should also mention, oh yeah, we got holiday music.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.920
Whoa!

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.920
I was like, where is that?

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.280
What was that, Wes?

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.080
I should also mention the all shows feed.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.080
Gotta give this a plug.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.480
Now is a great time to get subscribed to that.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.880
There's good stuff in there because that's where the extras land.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:43.440
That's where Choose Linux lands, or TechSnap, or UserAir, or all the other shows.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.200
Probably other ones like Linux Action News, probably.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:50.040
If you just want more Jupiter Broadcasting content, the one link.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.680
That's over at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.560
Now when we are live again, great question.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.560
You are on the ball today.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.560
Look at our audience.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.560
Sometime next decade, right?

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.560
Yeah.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.560
Wow.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.760
JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:01.760
Have a great holiday.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.760
Thank you for joining us, and we'll see you soon.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:22.760
Happy holidays!

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:42.840
Two things that I'm glad that I don't have to deal with in Linux anymore.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.760
One is XF86 config and potentially blowing up your monitor.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.760
Yeah.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.760
Oh my gosh.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.760
I couldn't agree with that.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:56.080
And the other is FW cutter or the NDIS wrapper to get wireless working.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.440
Oh gosh, cheesy.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.120
Those are two really good ones.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:06.800
I also remember the era before CUPS printing and after CUPS printing.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.360
Printing is so much simpler now in Linux than it used to be.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.440
In fact, I think it's simpler on Linux than it is Windows.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.440
I completely agree.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:18.400
I have a bit of a controversial one, and for me it's System D.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.480
I like System D. You're not going to get any hate from me.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:26.040
Yeah, well before System D, you had to muck around with upstart scripts and all sorts

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:31.080
of non-standard stuff between each distro, and now I can switch from Arch to Ubuntu to

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.800
Red Hat to whatever, and it's all System D, and it's the same, and I just like that.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.520
I'm liking Linux Wayback Machine as a title, that's pretty good.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.520
That's fun.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.520
That's pretty good.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:45.800
When it comes to printers, we have that interesting fact that CUPS is now maintained by Apple,

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.400
and that's changed a lot, I think.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:52.200
And it's been like that for a really long time now, and they haven't screwed it up apparently.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.200
Because they need it.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:59.560
Well, the fact is now I can just plug in a printer in any Linux distribution and the

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:05.760
driver is just loaded, and it's just working, besides some HB printers that have scanners

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:10.320
within, but nowadays, plug in a printer and it works.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.080
This is something I'm really surprised by, to be honest, because it's always been such

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.080
a pain in the butt.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.600
I'm curious if anybody else in the old virtual lug there has a glad that they don't have

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.240
to fight with us on Linux anymore story, because these are fun.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.720
I know you got one, Jill.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.720
Yeah.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:29.480
In some modding for sound card drivers, to get sound card drivers working.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:32.840
That was a thing.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.840
Oh, my gosh.

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.080
Sound on Linux.

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.100
And remember this one.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:42.520
Only one application could use the sound card at a time, back in the old also days.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.520
Yes.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.520
Awesome.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.520
Also, yes.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.520
You got to choose carefully.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.520
Yeah.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:48.520
Wow.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.520
I think I've got one.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.520
Yeah.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.520
What is that?

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:56.760
I think one of the very first Linux experiences just getting squashed with dependency hell.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:02.000
And I don't really deal with that anymore, but just kind of all gets handled in the background.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.120
I did get on my universal packaging soapbox for a brief moment there.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.880
But in the back of my mind, I was thinking that it is so much easier to get software

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.880
now.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:16.640
It really, if you take the time, if you take a day to educate yourself, problem solved.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.260
It's really all it takes.

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.840
And is that a big ask?

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.840
Yes.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.840
Is it an impossible ask?

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.840
Nah.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.520
I mean, like half the time we have picks, I can end up during the episode cloning them

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:30.280
down and I'm able to get them working, almost regardless of what language they are from

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.600
a makefile or a Docker container or whatever.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.600
Yeah.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.600
You just boot into Kexec for those things, do you?

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.600
I was going to make a Kexec one.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.040
Well, to keep it clean, you know.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.920
All right, Drift, I'd love to hear yours.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.160
So the one that I'm grateful for is stable updates.

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.160
Much better than they were.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.160
Yeah.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.160
Oh, man.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.120
Yeah, we recently had a coworker that was having some weird grub air messages after

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.000
an update, and it just totally took me back to a time where you had like these impossible

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.840
questions that were asked by your package manager.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.240
Would you like to destroy your config or completely overwrite your config?

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:02.240
What?

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.240
Neither.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.240
Yes.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:05.600
What about you, Cubicle Nate?

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.800
I don't have to worry about win modems anymore.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:08.800
Oh, good one.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:09.800
That's a good one.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.800
Yeah.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.280
Win modems were the worst.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.880
Oh, man.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:19.160
It took me like days of just tooling away and back on Mandrake Linux.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.120
And when I got it, when I finally got it, man, I was jumping up from office chair to

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.120
office chair.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120
I mean, I was so happy.

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.880
Man, Cubicle Nate, I kid you not.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:35.160
I think win modems was the hardware that taught me it's worth paying a little more if it has

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.880
Linux compatibility.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:41.960
And to this day, I just a few days ago, I ordered myself a steering wheel to play video

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:46.920
games on Linux, and the first question I have is, which of these is actually compatible

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920
with Linux?

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:48.920
That's where I start.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.680
And that was drilled into me because of win modems.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.920
I was going to say, I think my first incompatible purchase of hardware was a win modem.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.280
And then whenever I got it home and realized I had purchased the wrong piece of hardware,

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.040
I was so incredibly upset.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:10.960
My first machine I really used was actually a laptop that put Linux on in 2003, late 2003.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:16.640
And getting all the different little pieces of it working, specifically the win modem,

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.360
was just such an exercise in frustration.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:24.040
Rockwell, I'm curious, roughly how long have you been running desktop Linux?

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.360
Probably the early 2000s.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360
So it's not...

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.960
That's a pretty long time.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:28.960
It is.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.600
Do you have a recollection of something you used to struggle with that no longer is an

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.600
issue?

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.960
Well, to be honest with you, I don't even have to go back that far to think about it.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:42.280
I mean, you think about the installers themselves, how far they've come, but just think about

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:47.560
things like no mode set and having to edit the grub menu just to get into a Linux system

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:49.800
where you don't have to do that anymore.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:52.440
I never thought I'd have a flicker-free desktop, honestly.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.440
Right.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:57.700
And remember, I kind of vaguely remember the time before the Intel graphics were just always

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.400
baked into the kernel.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.440
There was a time where you didn't necessarily have a guaranteed video mode that was going

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.440
to work.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.520
You did have to just essentially go say, all right, very basic graphic.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.920
Let's just get this thing off the ground and then fix it after you got it loaded.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.600
Yeah, that wasn't that long ago.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.480
No, and NVIDIA drivers have come a long way since then, so...

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.000
I mean, even Fedora now makes it easy to install, right?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Or God forbid, the old Lilo.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Lilo.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Aw.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Aw, I miss Lilo.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
I actually still use it.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Do you really?

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I love Lilo.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
I really do.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Yeah.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.560
Yes, me too.
