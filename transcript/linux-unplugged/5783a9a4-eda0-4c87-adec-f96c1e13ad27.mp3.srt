1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I present you the perfect pet. It is OpenCat. It's a GPL3 highly programmable and maneuverable

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,520
robotic cat that's powered by AI and 3D printing with a Raspberry Pi for extra flavor.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,520
Well isn't that neat?

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,600
This is, oh they got a video. Should we roll the, should we roll the live dice?

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,600
Oh yeah, let's check it out.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
Okay here we go.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,880
Is it creepy or cute? That's what we want to know.

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:33,600
The OpenCat demo. Oh boy. Oh boy. So it's crawling. It looks like a kid's robotic toy.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,920
It does, yeah.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,640
It does have the ability to get itself back up when it gets knocked over.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
That'll be useful.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,520
Here's version two. You know I gotta say, version two's looking a lot better. They really,

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,520
they're really committed to this thing, Wes. They're really committed to this thing.

14
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,480
I mean it is pretty, pretty impressive. Now I don't know that I want to have it like around

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,120
my house if I didn't, didn't build it, but.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,720
Right, or when you're sleeping would you always make sure to turn it off? I mean think about

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,160
that for a second. Do you want some robot cat ramp? Because a real cat, they roam around

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,520
the house at night. You can respect the project here on this.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,840
Maybe you could turn it into like a robo-cat security droid.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,720
Maybe mount a laser on there?

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,320
Oh yeah.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:31,440
This is Linux Unplugged episode 238 for February 27th, 2018.

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,560
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is covered in barbecue and

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,600
been cleaning up dog poo. My name is Chris.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
My name is Wes.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,360
It's one of those pre-shows, Wes, good and bad. Good and bad.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,560
We made it. We're here. The show must go on.

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,560
We fired up the barbecue pre-show for the first time. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,680
The grill.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,680
For the first time and we had to feed ourselves to prepare our bodies to cover all of the

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,960
community news that we've got this week. I feel like this should be a nice, calm, relaxing

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,680
Linux Unplugged that will wander through before I head off to scale. I need something low-key

33
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
because the next week.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
Take it easy, recharge.

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,240
It's going to be crazy. It's going to be crazy. Going down to Pasadena, California. So we're

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,300
going to go through just a few bits, a couple of apps, some nice community news, an update

37
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
on XFCE.

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,800
Did you know there actually is some progress on the XFCE desktop? Yes. Yes, they're nearly

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,980
to GTK3. We'll tell you all about that, their current status. Our buddy Wimpy's here with

40
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,640
a pretty cool option for Ubuntu Mate installers for 1804 coming up. And the crew over at KDMLive

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,960
has a killer new release that's in the works that might just give Final Cut a run for its

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
money.

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,320
Then we'll check in on that poll about dropping Discord and switching back to IRC, see what

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,680
the results were. And then, Wes, it's time to bring a little freedom to your vehicle.

45
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Finally.

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,520
I've been debating this myself. Should I get one of them like, you know, Android auto dashes

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,480
because my radio needs to be replaced. It's bad. And I'm like, yeah, maybe I'll do that.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,240
But then I don't want to be locked into like one particular hardware vendor, and they're

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,640
probably not going to update it properly, and it's probably going to be underpowered.

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,880
So I've never really pulled the trigger on like upgrading my car sound system. But friends,

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,560
if you wait long enough, the open source community always provides a solution.

52
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,960
So this week, we're going to talk about Crankshaft, which is a turnkey Linux distribution for

53
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:29,040
the Raspberry Pi that transforms it into an Android auto headset. All you need is a Raspberry

54
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,860
Pi 3 board and the official Raspberry Pi 7 inch touchscreen, which is like 60 US dollars.

55
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,120
And then you got a turnkey Linux distro. We'll tell you about it. Yeah. Have you heard of

56
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Crankshaft, Wes?

57
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
No, I have not.

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,480
Well, you will hear more about it coming up. But let's start with some community news.

59
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,140
This has been sort of leaking out in bits and details here and there. Corbin Davenport

60
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,640
over at Android police.com writes that it looks like Chrome OS may soon be able to run

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,840
Linux applications in a container. Of course, you're probably thinking, well, why does that

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,800
have to do in a container? Chrome OS is based on Linux. Well, I'm sure it's many reasons,

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,920
security being one of them. It looks like this is coming from some documentation that's leaked

64
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,680
out. And if you go to Chrome Unboxed, they have a Chrome OS developer who uploaded two

65
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,840
screenshots of the container feature and what it will look like. You should get a pop up

66
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,780
that comes up with a description that says, would you like to develop on your Chromebook?

67
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,080
You can run your favorite Linux apps in command line tools seamlessly and securely. And then

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,920
it gives you a couple of prompts to install terminal.

69
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Ooh, yeah, that I like that reminds me of the subsystem for Linux. It's like a freedom

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,440
box right there. Doesn't this kind of remind you? Yeah, it's like Google's answer to the

71
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,560
subsystem for Linux on Windows for Chrome OS. Does that make sense? It's like that they're

72
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,240
trying to be competitive with that feature on Windows. Well, I mean, it kind of targets

73
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,440
that splits the difference. You can still have a simple platform for most end users,

74
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,440
but your developers or other people that need a little bit extra, that option is there.

75
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,560
Is it actually usable though? That would really be my question. That's a good question. Are

76
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,360
Chromebooks fast enough? I don't know. Let's ask the Mumble Room. Time appropriate greetings

77
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,160
there, Mumble Room. Welcome to the show, guys.

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
G'day.

79
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Hello.

80
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Hello.

81
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,960
Snuck it in there. You didn't know when I was going to do it, did you? I surprised you.

82
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Get it out of here.

83
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,080
So Wimpy, what do you think of this? Do you think this would actually make Chromebooks

84
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,880
a viable solution? The thing that crossed my mind is students. Like my son has a Chromebook

85
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,360
provided by his school.

86
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,360
I think anything that enables people to experiment with Linux in an accessible way is a good

87
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,880
thing, particularly for students.

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,400
Yeah. And I could see too, like if you've got a limited budget or whatever, or it's

89
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,720
like again, it's provided. It just sort of opens up a whole new range of functionality.

90
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,240
And I wonder what the limits will be. That's really going to be the question. How far will

91
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,760
Google let you take this? What are they going to make available? Is it only just going to

92
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,840
be a couple of things? Terminal is interesting. That makes sense.

93
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
That's a big start, yeah.

94
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,160
Yeah. And then if it's all contained, they don't have to worry about you mucking around

95
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,160
with Chrome OS. So check that out. We'll have a link in the show notes. Anybody else in

96
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
the Mumbroom if you have anything to add? If you're a Chromebook user, I'd be particularly

97
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
interested.

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:15,000
But I'm not a Chrome OS user. I am still reluctantly an Evernote user. And this is, I don't know,

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,600
how many different Evernote clients or Evernote alternatives or Evernote killers that we have

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,080
covered on this show. But we have one more. One more because the question still comes

101
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,440
in. And if you're like me, you're still stuck with this thing, especially when you travel.

102
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,760
It's called Tusk. It's an Evernote client. And it seems to actually connect to the Evernote

103
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:43,640
backend. It's also available as a snap. They say they've improved integration with Linux.

104
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,800
That seems like a good thing.

105
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
That's great.

106
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,400
It's got some markdown sheet support. I haven't tried it myself because I still haven't decided

107
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,240
if I'm going to just quit Evernote cold turkey or not. But it does look pretty compelling.

108
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,880
And Joey over at OMG Ubuntu wrote a pretty good write up that kind of makes me want to

109
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,080
give it a go again. It looks good.

110
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
If you look at the video.

111
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
It is sharp looking.

112
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Yeah.

113
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,200
It actually looks better than the official Evernote client. So this is almost Tusk is

114
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,160
almost taken to the point where it's like, I don't even want Evernote. I don't even need

115
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,480
them to. This looks even better than what they're done. I'm good.

116
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,040
And it's just a snap away.

117
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,600
Just a freaking snap away. Have you tried it? Wimpy, it's a snap. Aren't you obligated

118
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
to try all snaps?

119
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
In the contract.

120
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,800
I actually hope he's been working on that one. So I've not installed that one yet. But

121
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,580
then again, I don't use Evernote. So I've got no real need to.

122
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,920
Good on you for avoiding that trap.

123
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:47,120
I got into it like poison when mobile was brand new. And I just assumed they'd just

124
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,080
assume they'd eventually get something for Linux. And I was I regret that decision. But

125
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,120
damn, if it doesn't have some of the best OCR features, like when I'm traveling, I can

126
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,600
take pictures of signs of places that I need to note for like show reference or just for

127
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,120
travel purposes. That is extremely valuable for me.

128
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,480
So maybe Tusk will solve that. We'll see. Maybe I'll give it a go once I get back because

129
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,040
I'm probably going to end up using Evernote on my phone while I'm traveling. It almost

130
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,080
always happens, you know, reservation stuff.

131
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,280
It's just easy. It's there. It works.

132
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,520
I tell you what, Wes, tell you what. Let's talk about something else. Something to pick

133
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,120
me back up. Improving laptop battery life. This is some work that the Fedora project

134
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,460
has been putting in. And they've outlined some of the ways that they're trying to enable

135
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,120
various hardware power saving features by default in Fedora. So one of the things that

136
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,880
they're implementing, and maybe we're going to see this in other distributions too, I

137
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,880
would assume, but right now Fedora is the one that's talking about it. They're going

138
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:44,480
to make a new satellite power management policy, which actually mirrors the Windows defaults.

139
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,240
Surprisingly is often a good way to go when it comes to some of this hardware power management

140
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,640
stuff. Enable Intel HDA codec power saving by default with a one second timeout, which

141
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,640
saves 0.4 watts of power on an idle laptop. That's a huge amount really. And by the way,

142
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,680
the satellite power management could save up to 1.5 watts of power on an idle laptop.

143
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
That's a sweet deal.

144
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,600
That's a big deal right there. And then enable USB auto suspend for USB Bluetooth receivers

145
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,360
by default. We'll see how that goes. Which could also save 0.4 watts. And I like that

146
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,020
they actually put numbers on this stuff. When you add all that up though, it could be a

147
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,600
pretty decent battery savings on Fedora, which could really kind of make the distro stand

148
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,600
out. And I like that they're enunciating all of the stuff they're doing over here on the

149
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Wiki.

150
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,160
And that stuff takes tuning, and so it's nice to be explicit about it.

151
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,400
Look at this too. They have this table, I guess, of the SATA power link management policy

152
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,720
changes testing. And so they have Dell laptops, and HP laptops, and Lenovo laptops, and Asus

153
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:53,040
Zenbooks on here as well. And it's legit. It's pretty legitimate. So they have comparisons

154
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,800
before and after. So I'll just pink out. Let's say the ThinkPad T400, for example, we're

155
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,640
using an SSD. Before their tweaks on idle, it was sitting there taking 13.6 watts of

156
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:12,000
power. After their tweaks, which will just be enabled by default, idle, it drops to 11.8.

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,040
So it goes from 13.6 to 11.8 watts. And that could really translate into more minutes on

158
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
a battery.

159
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,380
And some of the changes are less dramatic. Some of them are even more dramatic. Some

160
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:28,280
of them are barely noticeable. One of them that kind of jumps out at me is the Elite

161
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:36,920
Book, the HP Elite Book 8540W. It goes from 18.8 to 17.9. You know, a point actually.

162
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,320
It's decent actually. They're all noticeable. None of them are actually anything to scoff

163
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
at.

164
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,960
They're all savings all take, that's for sure.

165
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,480
They tried on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 carbon second gen. They tried to enable some of the

166
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,760
SATA link power management stuff, and it produced data corruption.

167
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Whoopsie.

168
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Whoa.

169
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,920
That's a nice thing to know about ahead of time.

170
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,340
So don't go just playing with this stuff maybe. Don't go just trying that on your own distro

171
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,680
to see if it's going to...

172
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,600
Or at least not with data you care about.

173
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,600
But it'd be really interesting to run Fedora 28 on a laptop and then run 27 and see if

174
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,840
I could actually just perceive a difference, not have to measure, but can I just perceive

175
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
it?

176
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, does it feel different to the end user?

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,520
Yeah. And what's nice about this is it doesn't require a bunch of crazy software they have

178
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,360
to pre-install. It's not requiring a whole bunch of new packages on the ISO.

179
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,920
Just some new good defaults.

180
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,640
Yeah. And people will talk about, hey, if you want great battery life, use Fedora for

181
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,600
at least a little while. So that'll be good for them too.

182
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,400
You just said it right there. So now people are seeing it.

183
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,900
It's being said. It's being said. There's some great news too for those of you that

184
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:47,320
instead of installing Fedora 28 are going to be installing Ubuntu 18.04. But we're just

185
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,240
talking about the future releases here, aren't we? On Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that you will

186
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,280
now be able to switch snap package channels. I'm probably screwing that up a little bit,

187
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,920
but my layman's understanding is one of the features of snap packages is that you can

188
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,920
have like a beta channel and a release channel. And now the GNOME software app, or I think

189
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,340
it's just called software, will let you choose which channel you want to subscribe to.

190
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,080
I think I'm getting that all right. Winby, do you want to errata any of that?

191
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,640
Yeah, yeah, you've got that about right. So by default, there are four channels. There's

192
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,840
stable, which is self explanatory, candidate, which is where developers will put their release

193
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,240
candidates, betas for betas and edge, which is typically what you'd hook up to your CI

194
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,800
system. So after every commit or your daily or nightly builds, they would all land in

195
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,840
edge so you can do your integration testing. And now what you can do in GNOME software

196
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:52,440
in 1804 is when you look at the details for a snap in software center, it has a label

197
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,540
there for the track or rather the channel that it's currently installed from, which

198
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,800
by and large would be stable. And if you click on that, it will produce a list of the other

199
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,460
channels that are available to you. So if you want to test the current beta or you want

200
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:16,400
to get the latest crack from edge, then you can switch that and switch those channels.

201
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:23,720
But what it also enables you to do is some of the people that are publishing in the store

202
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:31,680
are using tracks, which are in addition to those channels. So for example, JetBrains

203
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,960
have their early access program. So you can access the early access versions of all of

204
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:46,360
their products through their EAP track. And likewise with Skype, you can access their

205
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,800
insiders builds. So if you want to test out the really, really latest stuff, then you

206
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,520
can also switch to those tracks through GNOME software as well now.

207
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,400
That is really cool that JetBrains is doing that. The aspect that I like about it from

208
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,240
an end user's perspective is it's tidier when I search for an app because instead of getting

209
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:14,120
three or four entries for Slack or Mumble, it's just one entry. And then I can tack on

210
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,280
which channel I want during installation.

211
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,760
What level of risk you're prepared to take as a user.

212
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:30,720
And so if I say do an edge release of something, that doesn't necessarily mean it's containerized

213
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,920
or not, it's sandboxed or not. It could be an edge release and still be sandboxed.

214
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:44,840
Correct. The edge is just the release. They're just labels. So it's whatever the developer

215
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,160
feels comfortable inputting in those channels.

216
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,280
What is the terminology for one that isn't sandboxed? Is it legacy or what's the term

217
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,800
that when you're doing installs?

218
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,480
There's classic, which is it's without any confinement. And then there is also dev mode,

219
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:08,640
which you can't publish in the stable channel. And dev mode is kind of a reduced confinement

220
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,280
model whilst you're iterating on your snap and scaffolding it together.

221
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,520
Classic I think is what I was thinking of. And so now you don't even have to worry about

222
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,880
what was the syntax or how do I add it to the install command. Now it'll just be exposed

223
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,520
via the GUI for users installing software, which is great.

224
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,120
Yeah, it makes it seem much more first class.

225
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,280
Yeah, so that way when you know it's available like I just did, but I couldn't quite remember

226
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,400
the syntax, that's perfect for that. That's where that kind of stuff is really nice. And

227
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,000
is that, do you know an upstream thing Wimpy or is that unique to Ubuntu?

228
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,640
It's part of the snap plugin for GNOME software.

229
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,600
Ah, of course. So it's implemented at the plugin level. That is. That actually is. You

230
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,400
got to say, GNOME software is actually keeping up. When it was thought up, we weren't talking

231
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,400
about flat packs and snaps, were we? And in the past, I could have seen that having to

232
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,880
be completely revamped. I'm not going to say it's my favorite way to install software or

233
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,600
find software or even look at software, but I got to give them credit for the fact that

234
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,200
they haven't had to throw out the entire thing to support flat packs and snaps.

235
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,000
That's an open source win.

236
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,200
Yay for plugins, I guess. All right, Wes. I know you're not a big XFCE user. Have you

237
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
ever been an XFCE user?

238
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Oh yeah, back in the day.

239
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Oh, were you?

240
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,120
Oh, well, that's nice. That's nice. I was, too.

241
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
It's been probably five years now.

242
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,640
Yeah, same. Yeah, I'd say it's been about five years. Yeah, I actually used it quite

243
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:41,080
a bit for a while. It's a meme, in a way, in the Linux community about how long it takes

244
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:49,520
for XFCE to ship. They've been working on 4.14, I think, for three years. The big part

245
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:58,760
of 4.14 is the transition to GTK3. Don't think of XFCE as one monolithic thing, either. Think

246
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,720
of it as a set of many different software components. You have Thunar for the file management.

247
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,360
You have the window manager. You have the panels. You have the settings daemon. You

248
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,680
have the power manager, the session initializer itself. Then, of course, you have the XF Desktop,

249
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,200
which is the program that's responsible for managing desktop icons and backgrounds. There's

250
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,240
lots of subcomponents. It goes on, actually. There's lots of other components. 4.14 has

251
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:31,560
really been a process of porting everything to GTK3 Plus instead of GTK2 and using GDBus

252
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,520
instead of DBus Lib and then using symbolic icons for all the panel plug-ins and removing

253
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,360
depreciated widgets from code, old crap in the code. As they've moved along, they've

254
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:49,320
made some good progress. They have ported many things to GTK3, including Thunar, the

255
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,000
file manager, and the panel, and the power settings, and the settings manager itself,

256
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,140
and the desktop session manager. But there is some low-hanging fruit that doesn't even

257
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,400
have maintainers, like the calendar application, or the archive manager, or the CD burning

258
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,960
application, or the volume control. So there's a few things that just, they're not even getting

259
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:21,800
started yet. So that's a bit rough. There's 118 open bugs in XF Desktop, 119 in XFCE4

260
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:29,200
Session, 206 in XFCE4 Settings, and it goes on. So they're behind here. And I think what

261
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,160
my concern is, is you're dealing with 15 contributors, essentially, who are working on their free

262
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,620
time to port these projects, to get them ready. And there's no real big corporate interest

263
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:49,600
in XFCE. There's no Red Hat, or Canonical, or SUSE behind XFCE. And there's not any real

264
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,560
big major distro that's even shipping it as its default desktop. So they're kind of

265
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:00,800
let underdog here. It is just a passion project for these people. And there's no escaping

266
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,880
the elephant in the room that is GTK4. I mean, like, it's getting close. By the time they

267
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,480
get XFCE4.14 out, GTK4 could really be close to stable. And then they have to start again.

268
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,480
I don't know if it's going to be the same amount of work. But that's to say nothing

269
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,000
of Wayland support.

270
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,680
Yeah, I mean, XFCE has a lot, there's a lot going on. It's not, you know, it has a lot

271
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,320
of functionality as a desktop. It's not a bad desktop. I'm sure there's a sizable code

272
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,920
based support.

273
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:36,800
Yeah, it's hard for a project like that. It really is tough. And I know that we have folks

274
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,620
in the audience that love it. You know, Joe from Linux Action News and Late Night Linux,

275
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,640
it's his number one driver. And I've used it myself.

276
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,440
I mean, the pace is concerning, but it's nice to at least see some details of the process

277
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,200
that it is, it seems like they have at least semi structured way to go about doing it and

278
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,000
to work does progress.

279
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,640
Yeah, yeah. Anybody in the Mumba room an XFCE occasional user or a full time user? I'm betting

280
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
no.

281
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,400
Yeah, I don't I don't use the desktop per se. Yeah, but I do. I use XFCE for terminal.

282
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Yeah, it's great for that. Yeah, or like X2GO. But honestly, I think I think Wimpy has played

283
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,080
a big role in making it irrelevant for me, because MATE has gotten so compelling and

284
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,280
especially Ubuntu MATE over the last few years.

285
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,400
And so where I used XFCE in the past, I now use MATE. So it's kind of your fault, Wimpy.

286
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,800
Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the XFCE project for that. But I would like to point out that,

287
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:43,200
you know, it took MATE an awfully long time to port from GTK 2 to GTK 3. The only reason

288
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:52,200
it wasn't so obvious is we were maintaining a GTK 2 and GTK 3 code base in parallel during

289
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,560
that transition, which to some extent probably delayed things. But for as long as I've been

290
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:06,320
involved in MATE, which is getting on for six years now, we were doing that migration

291
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,040
to GTK 3. And I think as a team, we're only satisfied that we've really kind of got there

292
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:19,320
with the last release, which was last month, in terms of the GTK 3 stuff, in that now every

293
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:26,800
if def rule in the code for special casing different versions of GTK have been removed

294
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:35,120
because we're now just coalesced around GTK 3.2.2, which is the last stable release of

295
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
GTK 3.

296
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
You're right.

297
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
You know what that said?

298
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Yeah, go on.

299
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,480
Well, no, I wanted to finish.

300
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,720
You said that, you know, the next thing is GTK 4.

301
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Yeah.

302
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:55,280
There is no obligation to immediately start, you know, porting to GTK 4. GTK 3, everything's

303
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:03,480
just landed on GTK 3, even things like Chrome, Firefox, LibreOffice, you know, those things

304
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,040
have only just, you know, within the last, you know, months even, you know, LibreOffice

305
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:16,840
a bit longer, but, you know, within months have started to properly take their hints

306
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
from GTK 3.

307
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Right.

308
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,200
So I think it's going to be some time and there's even, you know, the bigger projects

309
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,100
like GIMP, you know, that have been around forever, they're still GTK 2.

310
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,240
So they still, you know, catch up to be done, you know, all over the place.

311
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,980
Yeah, that's a great point.

312
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:37,280
That is a GTK 3 will be a stable target for, you know, desktops and application developers

313
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,240
for some time to come.

314
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:45,160
Even in the world of flat packs and snaps, does it perhaps matter a little bit less if,

315
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:52,520
you know, you, if you've got an application in theory that needs GTK 3.22, you should

316
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,880
be able to ship that for quite a while as a flat pack or a snap, even if my desktop

317
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,840
is GTK 4 at that point.

318
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,160
Yeah, absolutely.

319
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:07,600
But I think you'll see GTK 3 and GTK 4 living alongside each other in distros in the future

320
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,960
in the same way that we have GTK 2 and GTK 3 living along side each other, you know,

321
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,640
and have done for many years now.

322
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,800
That makes that makes a lot of sense.

323
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
You know what?

324
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,680
I so they're not talking about Wayland.

325
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,240
But I don't see I don't see Monte talking a lot about Wayland.

326
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,040
I've seen you make a few hints that, you know, in a recent 1804 post, I think you said don't

327
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,440
don't get too excited by some of the Wayland work in there.

328
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,280
It's not what you think I think was something similar to that wording.

329
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:43,080
Yeah, we've been having well, the Wayland, the Wayland references that you may have seen

330
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:50,760
in the change logs were actually to explicitly turn on x Wayland for some of the applications.

331
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:57,080
So for people that were installing the Marte applications in a genome session, for example,

332
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,320
which was, you know, Wayland by default on Fedora, and you know, on Ubuntu 1710, it meant

333
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,800
that those applications would actually work.

334
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,080
But they are is not a full, you know, Wayland implementation, it just enables x Wayland

335
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,600
to step in and take over.

336
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:23,840
But we have had our, our upstream conversations with the core Marte team, just this week about

337
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,360
our road to Wayland.

338
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,920
We've got some more discussions to have there, but we're starting to form a plan about how

339
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,840
we're going to go about that.

340
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,400
Is your sense that it is more work than the port to GTK 3?

341
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:48,720
Yes, although we may get lucky in terms of how we can go about doing this, in that there

342
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,520
may be some people who can can assist us some do some heavy lifting, as it were, yeah, yeah,

343
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
yeah.

344
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,160
So in the future, when when that's all fleshed out, I will, I will come back on and explain

345
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,200
more about that one.

346
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,800
I think that's gonna be extremely interesting to watch, because I think that could be useful

347
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,440
for other projects as well.

348
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
All right.

349
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Well, good stuff.

350
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
All right.

351
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Well, don't go too far.

352
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,760
I want to keep talking about Marte for just a moment.

353
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,920
But I do want to take a break and think digital ocean.

354
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,080
So standby while we mentioned that I did get I did get this in last week, this great deal

355
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,360
we have digital ocean.com.

356
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,120
You go to do dot co slash unplugged.

357
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,160
That's the world I go to right now, because I am pretty sure that's the best way to get

358
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,420
the special $100 credit offer.

359
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,560
The digital ocean is offering the Jupiter broadcasting audience.

360
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,240
It's a limited time offer.

361
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,080
And I believe it lasts for 60 days once you apply it to your account.

362
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,280
Now, this is incredible, because, honestly, in the past, the traditional and it's gonna

363
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,440
what I'll go back to is the $10 credit, which is legitimately enough to get real work done

364
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,200
for like two months on digital ocean.

365
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
It's awesome.

366
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,080
So the $100 credit blows my mind and build anything you want.

367
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,760
Yeah, and I think this is what they're thinking, because it's true infrastructure on demand.

368
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,700
Everything's SSDs, eight data centers all over the world, a killer dashboard to manage

369
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,940
all of it, and then an API to automate it when you're ready to go or just grab some

370
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,640
open source code that does it already.

371
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,840
But here's where I think they're going with the $100 credit is they got a couple of new

372
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,000
types of droplets that are killer.

373
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,160
So they got a $15 a month one where you can mix and match the different resources, which

374
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,840
depend on what you're doing, maybe you don't need just work out.

375
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,880
Yeah, maybe you need more RAM, and you don't necessarily need a lot of local disk, or maybe

376
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,560
you need a ton of CPU for something, and you just mix and match as you need it.

377
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,160
And they also, there are standard droplets, which you can get for $5 a month starting

378
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,280
there.

379
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,680
They just got even more competitive.

380
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,440
They have more everything, more everything, and if you have an existing one, you can upgrade

381
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
it for free.

382
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,800
They're crushing it.

383
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
It's great.

384
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,480
Digitalocean.com or do.co slash unplugged.

385
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,820
I've been a customer for, I think, four years now, which blows my mind.

386
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,360
We have large parts of the Jupyter Broadcasting infrastructure, which run on DigitalOcean

387
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:04,240
24-7, and that means I am now down to one server on premise, which is just a large storage

388
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,000
free NAS server now.

389
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,040
When we first started at Jupyter Broadcasting, we brought in an i7 rig with lots of memory

390
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:16,120
and lots of local disk and an NFS disk, and we ran a bunch of systems in a VM, Proxmox,

391
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,080
I mean, I've told you guys about this all on the show.

392
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:27,400
And over the years, it is so much simpler, so much faster, and honestly, long term, it's

393
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,360
costing me way less to run on DigitalOcean than having to spend thousands and thousands

394
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,240
of dollars on local infrastructure.

395
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,800
And the nice thing is we can build for what we need today and then easily expand it.

396
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
I've said enough.

397
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:44,320
Really, all you need to know is do.co slash unplugged, $100 credit if you're a new customer.

398
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,200
Hot off the presses right there, Wes.

399
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Limited time offer.

400
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,480
Take advantage of it because I was negligent in telling you about it soon enough.

401
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,640
Also, if you want to get yourself some web mail set up, I'm a fan of the Roundcube.

402
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:00,640
That's one of my more, I think it's like, I don't know what else you could compare it

403
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
to, actually.

404
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:07,000
It's the closest to something like a Gmail or like a commercial web mail client that

405
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,520
you can run and host yourself.

406
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,280
Roundcube, it just connects to your mail server over IMAP and SMTP, so you don't even necessarily

407
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,620
have to host your own mail server.

408
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,840
You could connect it to just another IMAP server that you have or that you may be already

409
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
using.

410
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,880
Roundcube, they have a tutorial on DigitalOcean for how to set it up.

411
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,600
I don't actually know.

412
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,800
Don't tell them I said this, but I don't think there's anything necessarily too DigitalOcean

413
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,920
specific maybe than just the very beginning of installing the computer.

414
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,960
But the rest would work if you just had your own system.

415
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,280
Yeah, it's just great documentation.

416
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Yeah.

417
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,240
Or go spin up a VPS over on DigitalOcean.

418
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,620
They call them droplets.

419
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,260
Put up Roundcube and then point it to an IMAP server that you've been using.

420
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,680
And now you just got yourself a web mail that you're hosting that somebody else isn't slurping

421
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
down.

422
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
That's pretty great.

423
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
do.co.

424
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
slash unplugged.

425
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
All right.

426
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,800
So, Wimpy, I was talking before the show with you, and you started describing the minimal

427
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,280
installer work that you're doing for Ubuntu MATE, and I thought, okay, yeah, that sounds

428
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
decent.

429
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,920
But the more you talked about it, I started thinking, geez, this might be the most popular

430
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
implementation.

431
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,040
This is sounding really, really good.

432
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:14,220
So let's back up a little bit and maybe just a super quick refresher on what the minimal

433
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,220
install is.

434
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,040
And I guess maybe some of the work you had to do to get it into Ubuntu MATE, because

435
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,560
I guess you don't just inherit that, you have to make some choices and implement some decisions.

436
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Yeah.

437
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Tell me a little bit about it.

438
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:30,880
So this is piggybacking on the work of my colleagues, Didrox and Lainey, who have landed

439
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,480
the minimal install capability in the Ubiquity installer.

440
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,680
So I just happened to be poking around in the Ubiquity code on an unrelated matter yesterday

441
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,640
evening, and I noticed that this feature had landed.

442
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,840
So I contacted Lainey and said, so how do I turn this on for Ubuntu MATE?

443
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,040
And he said, oh, it's easy.

444
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,340
You just create this file and you put the things in it that you want to be removed from

445
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,200
your install.

446
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:07,420
So I did that work for Ubuntu MATE last night, and then the nightly images ran.

447
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,920
So it's built for the flavors to use as well.

448
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,960
It was purpose built for that.

449
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,240
It's not just unique to just upstream Ubuntu.

450
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,300
No, any of the flavors can take advantage of it.

451
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:24,520
So I'll just go into some text because I know some of the flavor maintainers listen to the

452
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,920
podcast.

453
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:36,640
So what you do is you modify your seeds and the seeds are where you list what your distribution

454
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
is comprised of.

455
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,980
So the applications that are in the core image, in the base image.

456
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:49,280
And you add a new file in there and it's simply called desktop.minimal-remove.

457
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:56,840
And in that file, you basically list all of the packages that you want to be removed from

458
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,020
the default install.

459
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:07,160
And if that file exists, when Ubiquity runs, it will now present a new option in the installer.

460
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,040
So in the install screens, if you've installed Ubuntu before, you will have seen a screen

461
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:17,140
where it asks you if you want to install updates while it's installing, and if you want to

462
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,960
install additional codecs on that screen, you'll see a new option, which is do you want

463
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,600
the minimal install?

464
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,720
And it describes the minimal install as the desktop and utilities and browser only.

465
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Oh yeah.

466
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:35,520
I mean, now when you're combining lightweight Mote with a minimal install, so it's just

467
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:42,320
Firefox, basic desktop tools, core utilities, no VLC, no Thunderbird, no calculator?

468
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:50,960
Well, the calculator is part of the core Mote desktop, so you get the file manager and the

469
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,640
text editor and the document viewer and the image viewer, but you don't get LibreOffice,

470
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:04,600
you don't get Thunderbird, you don't get VLC, you don't get Rhythmbox, all of that extra

471
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,400
stuff, you don't get transmission.

472
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:13,240
So everything additional to the core desktop is effectively removed.

473
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,960
So you get a very trim, simple system.

474
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,200
And I was thinking to myself, who would use this and why would you use it?

475
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:29,520
And I've heard a few people say, oh, well, I like to curate my own desktop experience.

476
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,040
I know what applications I want, so they would want that.

477
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,160
But I was thinking to myself, how would I use it?

478
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,120
And I was thinking, well, I've got one machine that I use specifically for gaming now, and

479
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,720
I would choose the minimal option on that machine.

480
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,360
So I just get the base stuff and then I can slap Steam on top of that, and I've just got

481
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:58,720
a real trim machine for running Steam or you could create your own Kodi boxes in a similar

482
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
way as well.

483
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,120
Yeah, I do like that.

484
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:08,320
I was just thinking, too, you could absolutely see it as a workstation OS, where maybe you

485
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,200
go to work and you install Slack and you have to install Chrome and maybe even Skype and

486
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,280
all of these things that just are kind of, I don't know, they're just applications now

487
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,200
that you can snap install or go get the...

488
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,840
Have a real minimal base.

489
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
Or you can get the devs.

490
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,840
Yeah.

491
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,420
The software boutique actually makes some of that easier on MATE, but yeah, I really

492
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:34,000
like that because I'm generally going to Ubuntu MATE for a minimal lean, lean, mean fighting

493
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
machine.

494
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah.

495
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,640
But what it retains is all of the underlying hardware support.

496
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,040
So anything you need for your network devices to function, that's all still included.

497
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,160
Anything you need for Bluetooth and audio, that's all still included.

498
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:56,640
So it's just that layer of applications on the top, but it's down to each flavor maintainer

499
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,140
to choose what they want to remove.

500
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,240
So there's no prescribed list.

501
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,640
The list in Ubuntu MATE is different than the list in Ubuntu, for example.

502
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:16,200
And so the question that's coming up, before we go too far off that, is how is this different

503
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,640
than an install script that just is like a different set of packages to install?

504
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,240
How is this different than an install script is essentially what the chat room is asking

505
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,880
in IRC.

506
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,900
How it's different from an install, where it's the opposite of an install script.

507
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,760
It's an uninstall script, essentially.

508
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
I like that.

509
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Yeah.

510
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,720
Because it's an image that's getting deployed to the hard drive, right?

511
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,080
It's getting based on the live environment.

512
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Yeah.

513
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,640
So the image that's on the ISO, there is a squashFS file system, and that is effectively

514
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,800
put on your hard disk.

515
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,240
And then at the end of that process, there are already some packages that get removed.

516
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,960
The installer itself, for example.

517
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:59,520
So Ubiquity, the installer, removes itself as part of the cleanup of the installation.

518
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,920
So what this minimal install does is it tags itself on to that piece of the code that's

519
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,680
already there to build out a bigger list of what should be removed.

520
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,420
And then it rattles through that list and removes anything that the maintainer has identified

521
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,160
as, this is stuff you don't need in a minimal install.

522
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
Okay.

523
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,160
Interesting.

524
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
That makes sense.

525
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,760
So it's the opposite of an install script.

526
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,060
And this will be landing in 1804.

527
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,120
It's already essentially the work's done, right?

528
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,440
It landed in the daily images yesterday.

529
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
Oh!

530
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
Yeah.

531
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Fantastic.

532
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,400
It's just down to each of the flavors now to create their minimal remove file in their

533
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,040
seeds.

534
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,320
And then they can take advantage of that function as well.

535
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,400
That's really great.

536
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,840
It's funny that we're just getting to it now, don't you think?

537
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
In a way?

538
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,660
Like, why haven't we had this for years?

539
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:01,800
It's interesting because before I worked at Canonical, I did some work with the Xubuntu

540
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,360
team, where we were trying to achieve precisely this.

541
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:12,600
Because we wanted minimal installations, and in fact, Xubuntu make their own set of, I

542
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:18,160
think they call them core images available, and have done for a couple of years now, where

543
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,600
they effectively have an ISO, which is the minimal ISO.

544
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,640
So it's, you know, what I've just described, but already packed in an ISO.

545
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,920
And we did some work to try and land that in a way that everyone could have two ISOs.

546
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:38,480
So you can have an Ubuntu Mate, I think we called them base, an Ubuntu Mate base ISO,

547
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,760
and the full fat ISO.

548
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,160
But for reasons people were busy, that never got any traction.

549
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,820
And now, you know, now we have this, which is, I think, quite an elegant solution because

550
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,160
now there's still one ISO to download, but you can use it in two ways.

551
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,600
So did this ball get rolling from what you probably understand, because I know it's not

552
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,240
directly work that you were involved in?

553
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,440
Did Rock's probably better to ask, but did this get started based on some of the feedback

554
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,440
that people, like people, I like Chrome, or I prefer MPV.

555
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,760
And so is this sort of a middle ground?

556
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,240
I think you're well connected with did Rock's, and you should ask him that question, because

557
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,600
I don't know the origin story of how this came to be.

558
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,480
Because it is funny that it's just showing up now in 1804.

559
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,040
I mean, I'm thankful for it.

560
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,800
But I think this, to a degree, is probably why some people have chosen other distributions.

561
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,480
I'm sure not by a very large percentage.

562
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,880
But I bet there's people in our audience that have decided to go a different route just

563
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
because of the package selection.

564
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,360
I mean, that was what drove people to Ubuntu, too, at the same time.

565
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,360
Yeah.

566
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,680
And you've got both options now.

567
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:46,040
You know, those people that like a very specific desktop experience can do that.

568
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,040
You know, for some people, all you actually need is the minimal install, because you can

569
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,460
do everything in a browser.

570
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,560
You've basically created a Chromebook at that point.

571
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,400
And now you can install containers, or applications in containers, and that's all cyclical, or

572
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,440
whatever it is, circular, what is it?

573
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,120
What am I looking for, Wes?

574
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,120
Cyclical!

575
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,960
Cyclical, that's what it is, cyclical.

576
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
You got there yourself.

577
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,800
Well, Wimpy, thank you for telling us all about that.

578
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,000
You know me, I just love hearing about that.

579
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,160
I hope other people do, too, because even if you're not an Ubuntu Monte user, I think

580
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
this stuff is fascinating.

581
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Because right here, I'm sitting on a Plasma Neon desktop, but yet, this, I love hearing

582
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
about.

583
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,080
I love the thought behind it and all of it, so I really always appreciate when you come

584
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
out here and tell us all that stuff.

585
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
You're welcome.

586
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,280
I don't know if anybody out there has had a chance to try Cadian Live recently.

587
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,960
A lot of people ask about video editing still.

588
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,400
We get a lot of questions, and I just sort of, I kind of punt, and I punt, and I punt.

589
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,120
But it's getting legitimate with Cadian Live.

590
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,040
I'd like to know if people who are doing actual serious amounts of video editing under Linux,

591
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,680
like, you know, like Ven Stone, who edits, you know, I think he's doing two shows a week

592
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,160
under Linux, but I think he uses OpenShot, like an old version of OpenShot, because he's

593
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
a madman, Ven.

594
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,160
You're a madman.

595
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
That's crazy.

596
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,160
You're a madman.

597
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,040
So I don't know if, I'd like to know if somebody like Ven, or there's probably not as many

598
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,200
people that do as much editing as he does, but on a regular basis, they're putting out

599
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,480
complex, long content on Linux.

600
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,600
Have you tried the new Cadian Live, because this, to me, is hitting a lot of what draws

601
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,840
me to Final Cut, and this is getting, I don't know, maybe it's also the fact, probably is

602
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,080
a bit of the fact that I've been on a plasma kick recently, too, and this is a cute application,

603
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,600
so it also looks really great on my desktop.

604
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,120
But I downloaded the app image, yes, it's an app image, so you can, it's kind of a convoluted

605
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
process.

606
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,720
I will link to the fastest way for you to get the app image, because they don't just

607
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,160
link to it directly.

608
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:39,220
They make you attend this cafe session, and you can find a link to a text file that has

609
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,880
a list of the mirrors, which will then land you on this page that I have found.

610
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,040
So I will link this to you if you want to try it and give me feedback, because I'm going

611
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,680
to experiment a little bit with it, but I'm honestly just not doing as much video as I

612
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,340
was in the past, so I'm not the best candidate.

613
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:55,040
But it looks like a super great release.

614
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,880
One of the things that I really like about Cadian Live is they have this really steady

615
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:05,320
approach, and they've been like on this, we do, like, so for example, 17.12 series has

616
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:12,680
just been constant, solid, fix this little thing, solve this bug, come up with a solution

617
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,800
for that, minor bug fix stuff.

618
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,720
And so you can just say, well, I'm on this branch, that's what I get, and I really like

619
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,140
that about that, too.

620
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:25,760
So 18.04 is the next version, which I don't think is necessarily synced up to any Ubuntu

621
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,720
server, but it's sort of that same versioning system.

622
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,480
And they are working out the rough edges right now.

623
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,040
They've published it as a app image, which I'll link to.

624
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,480
And if you're out there and want to give them some feedback, if I was going to bet on a

625
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,280
horse right now for getting really good approachable video editing on desktop Linux, as much as

626
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,920
I respect Jonathan and all of the hard, continuing work he's doing into OpenShot over the years,

627
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,440
the horse I would bet on right now is KDE and Live, not Lightworks, not all of the other

628
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
ones that we send in.

629
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
It's looking really nice.

630
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
It's KDE and Live.

631
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,440
Yeah, there's a lot of different ones.

632
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,400
There's, like, a clip editor one, you know, but it's just, yeah.

633
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:10,160
So anyways, if you want to help what I think is potentially our best hope for good video

634
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
editing.

635
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
And we need one.

636
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,600
Yeah, I just, it's called, the link in the show notes will be called KDE Experience Freedom

637
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:21,000
with an exclamation mark, KDE dash Experience Freedom with an exclamation mark.

638
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,680
That's the link to look for because that's the typical kind of communication you get

639
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,800
from the KDE group out there.

640
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,680
They just, they're not so good with the way they phrase things or the, that kind of, I

641
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,680
love them.

642
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,160
It's like you haven't invested in freedom enough over there.

643
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
I know.

644
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,160
I know.

645
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,980
I need to invest in, I need to invest in freedom as their website tells me, and I need to experience

646
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,240
freedom with an exclamation mark.

647
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,320
I'm feeling pretty free right now.

648
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,640
I do appreciate that about it.

649
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,800
I do appreciate that.

650
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,640
That may be the new air freshener, but I don't think so.

651
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,580
I'm feeling pretty, pretty free.

652
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,320
So we'll have that linked in the show notes if you want to check that out.

653
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,920
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

654
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,360
That's where to go to support the show and sign up for a free seven day trial, free seven

655
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
day trial.

656
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,920
What's better than free?

657
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,340
Freedom.

658
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,240
And maybe sometimes like a cold drink on a really.

659
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,400
Oh, that's way better.

660
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,720
It's really good.

661
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,640
But free, like that, if that drink was free, it's even better.

662
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
You see what I'm saying?

663
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,920
Like it can't get better.

664
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,840
So seven day free trial Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

665
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:23,820
It's a platform to learn about Linux and all of this stuff around Linux.

666
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,840
And now the kind of stuff that gets you hired.

667
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,840
That's a really good.

668
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,320
That's another really nice thing about Linux Academy.

669
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,680
I would use this for ongoing training as well as getting hired.

670
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,120
Think of it as whatever you need to get done if you need to learn more about a nitty gritty

671
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,800
thing around Linux or if you need to learn about AWS and OpenStack and Azure and all

672
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,080
of these things.

673
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,960
This is also perhaps the best solution for you.

674
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:49,200
They have some really, really great and they're frequently adding new content to the AWS stuff.

675
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,440
I'm really impressed with like their maniacs over there with the content and the way they

676
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,120
get that is they hire full time instructors, people that are really familiar with this

677
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,600
stuff and they just sit there and they churn out this stuff in a way that I don't know.

678
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,000
They got the system like they build a process where they come up with something that's really

679
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,800
applicable to people, that's really going to add value for something to learn about.

680
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,600
Then they build out the best way to do it.

681
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,480
They build into the system where you can choose the distribution you want to learn from.

682
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,640
They keep testing it out at each point then they start testing it more to get like kind

683
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,080
of feedback and they've reached out to me a few times on this to see if like I want

684
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,980
to try out a new system and then they roll it out and iterate on it in a way that keeps

685
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:30,760
your subscription valuable and then they add new content and they go back and they keep

686
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,800
the old stuff fresh and then they're ready to help you whenever you get stuck because

687
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,100
those instructors are full time.

688
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:40,560
Like this is a machine now and it's just been getting them a ton of industry credibility

689
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,040
and you can get hands on scenario based labs, a course scheduler for when you're busy and

690
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,560
they have all kinds of content that really is great for when you're like just want to

691
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:54,520
hone in on one single thing or you're ready to take on a whole certification course.

692
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,880
And so that means when you've got a really busy life or when you've got time to take

693
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,000
your career to the next level, they've got content to serve you.

694
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,420
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

695
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,640
Go there, sign up for a free seven day trial and a big thank you to Linux Academy.

696
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
Seven day trial free.

697
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,440
So great I hit my mic because my hands are dancing around.

698
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
You're so excited.

699
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,440
I really was.

700
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,200
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

701
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,640
All right you crazy sons of bitches, I can't be dragged around like this anymore.

702
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,920
Oh we're going to talk about this.

703
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,040
So I asked this really stupid question last week, well actually it started when I asked

704
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,640
the question would you like to switch to Discord and everybody said yes.

705
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,040
And now here we are, what, three, four months into this thing?

706
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,040
Maybe a little more than that?

707
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,040
Six months?

708
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,040
I don't know.

709
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,040
I don't know.

710
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,040
It feels like ages.

711
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,040
It feels like it's been 25 years.

712
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,480
And I actually don't mind Discord.

713
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,920
I've been hanging out in other communities and you know what I like is the communities

714
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,480
that don't have to waffle like this.

715
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,480
That's what I like.

716
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,280
It's just you don't waffle, you don't move it, you just invest and you build.

717
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,600
And every time I feel like we change direction, you spill off some people, you also gain new

718
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,600
people.

719
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,040
So it's got its pros and its cons.

720
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:06,600
But we went out to a vote and we said should we switch from Discord back to IRC or just

721
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,820
hang tight, stick it out with Discord for the long haul.

722
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:16,120
And each has its pros and cons, IRC's, well it's like plumbing at this point.

723
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:21,360
It's pretty universal and it's a classic.

724
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,940
It's just like amongst our community, it's got a bit of a barrier of entry to people

725
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,440
outside the open source community but it's a staple in the open source community.

726
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,180
Now Discord has the advantage of a network effect.

727
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:37,960
It also has a bunch of other fancy features that are more modern like they just have their

728
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:43,640
own mobile client and they support emojis and embedded imagery and Twitter previews

729
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,640
and all this stuff.

730
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,640
All the fanciness.

731
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,640
Yeah.

732
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,820
That if you were to say drop down on the planet today in 2018 and try to join a community,

733
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,960
you would just kind of expect that they might just be able to do this.

734
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,300
They might just have this.

735
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,560
So I wasn't really sure what to do.

736
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,920
We were thinking behind the scenes, dramatically, that it would be easier for some of the things

737
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,480
we want to automate if it was IRC because we're still trying to come up with this perfect

738
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,140
cloud OBS setup where we would ingest an IRC stream and automatically generate a video

739
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,580
and send that out on the video stream and all of that.

740
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,320
But it just doesn't seem like that would be super easy to do with Discord.

741
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,100
It would be pretty easy to do with IRC.

742
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:33,880
So the vote went out and it was pretty clear IRC by a 79% vote and Discord had a 21% vote.

743
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:39,660
We're not talking hundreds of numbers here, but that's a, you know, usually that's how

744
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,660
it sticks.

745
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,800
Those are usually pretty indicative, representative I believe would be the term.

746
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,360
So that's a 79% win, right?

747
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,360
That's huge.

748
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,720
That's a big margin of win for IRC.

749
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,720
That's big.

750
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,400
People have spoken, I suppose.

751
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,480
The thing is, is we go back to IRC, we go back and we just...

752
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,200
Right, like does Discord just die?

753
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,200
Is it left to wither?

754
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,200
What?

755
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,840
Well, I don't think you got to shut it down.

756
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:10,500
I mean, the main thing I'm thinking about is like, if you want to, it's like the primary

757
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,500
chat room.

758
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,720
So it's what's on the live stream.

759
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,240
It's where people idle the most or they're having an active conversation.

760
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,240
I don't know.

761
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,240
I don't know.

762
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,240
I don't have answers to that.

763
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,880
I don't like any of this, but I want to do what the audience likes in this regard because

764
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,000
it's a tool for them.

765
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,640
So Virtual Lug, you guys get first say since you're here, you're in the voice chat.

766
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,640
You get first say.

767
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,400
Does anybody have a strong opinion on this one way or the other?

768
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,520
I'd love to hear some input on this because I'm really, I just want to use whatever people

769
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,520
like.

770
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:56,080
Yeah, well, well, to me, I would see the Discord is like the, I would say the Reddit chat versus

771
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,240
the RC being the live stream.

772
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,640
And also, since there are very few, since there are very few people who go to the live

773
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,080
stream to participate, I mean, there are more people that are coming in a day, we got months

774
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,280
and years to come, such as myself that came in recently.

775
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,520
But it's, I would say IRC would fill that niche pretty well with the live stream.

776
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,960
And plus, there are some clients that do support some of the newer features that you mentioned,

777
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,960
so.

778
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,960
Hmm.

779
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,960
Yeah.

780
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,960
All right.

781
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,480
Well, I'm going to leave the vote up for a little bit longer while I think about it.

782
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,880
I'm not in a huge rush to do anything, and I got to go to scale.

783
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,880
But it's on my mind.

784
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,360
I want to do what people like.

785
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,840
So and you know, meanwhile, the Telegram group's going solid.

786
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
So yeah.

787
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,840
They're up in their own universe.

788
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,000
That is good, really.

789
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
That's kind of a nice thing.

790
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,800
That's just like, well, we don't care.

791
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,800
Yeah.

792
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,960
If you want to get on that, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash telegram to join our telegram group.

793
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,200
There's my quarterly plug for that.

794
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,200
All right, Wes.

795
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,200
Well, that's not actually what we're.

796
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
No, it's not.

797
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,000
I guess that's on my mind.

798
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Like I said, this is a meandering episode.

799
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,960
I think it's on everyone's mind.

800
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,800
Let's talk about Crankshaft.

801
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,880
This is pretty, pretty great.

802
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,120
Now I'm going to, I'll play a little bit of the demo for you.

803
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,040
Just I'm going to do a couple of bits of it because it's a little rough.

804
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,400
But just to give you an idea of what it's like.

805
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,440
So you download this image.

806
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,200
You write it to the SD card.

807
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,040
You toss it in your Raspberry Pi.

808
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,400
You hook up the $60 touch screen.

809
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:24,280
And okay, so in this video, I just want to talk real quick about the capability of open

810
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:33,320
auto and how it's working in the alpha version of Crankshaft right now.

811
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,320
And let's start.

812
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,480
This is just a Raspberry Pi 3B.

813
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,080
And so he goes through and demos the functionality of this thing in it.

814
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:47,560
Once he gets it up and running, it just looks like Android auto completely with your playback

815
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,600
controls, your Google Now cards.

816
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:54,000
It's communicating with his Android device.

817
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,120
He just makes a phone call through it.

818
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,180
He can see the battery life of his phone.

819
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,680
He can use navigation.

820
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,300
That looks pretty handy.

821
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:06,320
But actually, there he's using Pocket Cast to listen to Radiolab.

822
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,880
I kind of want to do this in my truck.

823
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,560
You know what I'm talking about because my screen's all screwed up.

824
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,560
Yeah.

825
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,560
I mean, you're a perfect candidate for it.

826
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,560
I know.

827
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,560
I know.

828
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,760
If somebody has any experience with this, you got to let me know because I'm tempted

829
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,760
to do this.

830
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,760
We just need the touch screen.

831
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,760
I need the screen.

832
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,760
Yeah.

833
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,760
I need to pick up the screen.

834
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,840
And then you'd have to figure out a way to install the dash, which is not my strength,

835
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
I got to say.

836
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,920
But it's called Crankshaft.

837
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,380
And that was a developer there who you heard in the video.

838
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,240
It's just a project just by him.

839
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,880
It's just his thing.

840
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,920
And it's admittedly alpha.

841
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,440
But come on, it's going to be pretty cool.

842
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:45,800
I think Android Auto is fairly baked and it's using, I think, Raspbian for the distribution.

843
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,840
And there's a pretty active amount of people on the GitHub talking about it.

844
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,840
It's nice to be able to play in that space at all and maybe even have a system that actually

845
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,480
works and could be useful.

846
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,560
Yeah, and the main thing that I wanted to avoid with something like this was, and I

847
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,680
was thinking like a Carputer, I've been thinking about that for a couple of months.

848
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,960
I haven't really, really, the only reason I didn't go with a Carputer is in the couple

849
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,160
of months that I've been sort of debating what to do, I have found that I am perfectly

850
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:20,200
happy just doing everything on my phone and having it go through the Bluetooth audio.

851
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:27,200
And I don't really need my radio because I'm not listening to radio and I don't listen

852
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,520
to anything through the radio other than my phone now.

853
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,120
So I thought, well, could I just get by with the phone?

854
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,600
But the thing that this offers is A, your phone's still usable, but B, it puts it up

855
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:42,200
on a bigger screen with more limited functionality that's focused for when you're driving and

856
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,000
for like the navigation and the messages and stuff like that.

857
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,120
I think I would prefer that and the ability to do search and stuff.

858
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,360
So hello there.

859
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,360
Who was that?

860
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,360
Who was that?

861
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,360
Dang.

862
00:51:53,360 --> 00:52:01,400
Now, would you prefer a Carputer with a touch screen or would you prefer one of those laptop

863
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,400
mounts?

864
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,000
That would be the way that would be the way Noah would go.

865
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,640
Noah's got one of those in his Jeep, like one of those cop laptop mounts.

866
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,840
Noah is such a gearhead, man.

867
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,840
You know what?

868
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,840
I tell you what, I don't know.

869
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,840
I feel like that's too fiddly.

870
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,520
See, that's what I'm liking about the Android Auto here on the Raspberry Pi.

871
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,400
If you could get it mounted well, it could be out of the way, in the dash.

872
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,120
It's like a distilled user interface that's simplified for while you're driving.

873
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,120
It's less cluttered.

874
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,160
And going to laptops, kind of like the opposite direction of that.

875
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,160
Go ahead.

876
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,800
I mean, you can use the Android Auto app to simulate this in order to get a feel for the

877
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,360
Android Auto interface.

878
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,760
Oh, yeah.

879
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,760
That's another thing.

880
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,760
Really, I already have the Raspberry Pi 3, I think.

881
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,480
Isn't there one around here somewhere?

882
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,480
There is one around here.

883
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,040
Unless I've got to put it into use somewhere.

884
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,040
So I already have that part.

885
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,360
I just need the screen, and then it's sort of a low-cost test.

886
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,880
It's pretty great that this guy is...

887
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,840
Oh, by the way, that is getcrankshaft.com.

888
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,240
I should have said the URL sooner.

889
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,240
Sorry about that.

890
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,400
Getcrankshaft.com is where you go.

891
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,480
If anybody is going to scale, scale 16X, let me know if you've got something like that

892
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,560
down there, because I want to see it.

893
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,880
If you bring your car, let me see it.

894
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,880
I want to see that.

895
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,880
That'd be pretty cool.

896
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,280
I want to give a quick mention, too, speaking of scale, I've been talking about scale in

897
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,920
the new relaunched Tech Talk today, mentioned that last week.

898
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,560
We've now posted two fricking episodes since last week's Linux Unplugged.

899
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,560
What?

900
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,560
Wow.

901
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,560
Yeah.

902
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:28,120
And there's some nostalgia, goodness, if you're a Linux action show former listener, there's

903
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:35,580
some nostalgia, goodness, in episode 262, techtalk.today was where you find those, techtalk.today.

904
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:39,520
And I'll be covering my journey to scale in that crap, up in that S, as they say.

905
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,240
I'm really happy with the way those two episodes have turned out.

906
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,720
It's been a bit of a creative endeavor, but I've enjoyed it.

907
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,280
And it's gotten an itch, I had that rash right there I wanted to scratch, so I've been able

908
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,280
to scratch that.

909
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,280
It always feels good.

910
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,280
Yeah.

911
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,160
And it gives me a spot to put a bunch of content in scale, like the trip there and meeting

912
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,160
people and all that stuff.

913
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,400
And we get Tech Talk back for a brief little minute here.

914
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,400
Yeah.

915
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,400
For at least 10 episodes.

916
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,160
So, season one, and we were two episodes in, so if you haven't gotten on board yet, they're

917
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,160
shorter, too.

918
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,160
They're about 20 minutes, so go to techtalk.today.

919
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,160
Really easy, yeah.

920
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,160
Ride this hype train with us.

921
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,160
Easy peasy.

922
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,240
If you want to catch up on two, it's a 40-minute podcast, and it's nice and tight.

923
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,240
I hope people like it.

924
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,680
I hope people like it, because I'm going to put all I can into it for the 10 episodes

925
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,640
I'm going to do, and then I'm going to take a break, and I'm going to be done, and that's

926
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,480
going to be wonderful.

927
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,480
Wimpy has inspired me.

928
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,480
You've taught me well, Wimpy.

929
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,480
And the value of this is negative.

930
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,480
You're welcome.

931
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,480
No, it's not.

932
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,480
I appreciate it.

933
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,480
I appreciate it.

934
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,480
That's season idea.

935
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,480
Only, I may never come back, I think.

936
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,480
Right, yeah.

937
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,360
That might be the... My twist might be, last time I put the show on hold, it was on hold

938
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,440
for two years, so.

939
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,440
You never can tell.

940
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,440
You never know.

941
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,440
You never know.

942
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,440
All right.

943
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,440
Well, guess what?

944
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,440
We're just about done here.

945
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,800
We've been screwing around here, but this is just our low-key episode before I go to

946
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,800
scale.

947
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,840
So next week, I will be at scale with Noah, and I'm pretty sure we'll just do the show

948
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
live from there.

949
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,640
We'll just do a regular episode, but we'll happen to be at scale.

950
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,000
I don't know if we'll... We might have a few interviews or something.

951
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,320
If we get something good, we'll put it in the show.

952
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,320
So you'll be here?

953
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,320
Yeah.

954
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,440
Wes is going to come into studio and try to run all this crap on your own.

955
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,440
Good luck with that.

956
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,440
Jeez, Louise.

957
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,000
We'll probably have an episode.

958
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Let's just say that.

959
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,480
We'll be down there throwing our crap together while you're in here trying to remember how

960
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,720
to turn all this stuff back on, and one way or another, we should end up with a show next

961
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,720
week.

962
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,720
Oh, yeah.

963
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,520
Speaking of shows coming back, rumor has it the Ubuntu podcast is coming back, so go get

964
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,720
more wimpy.

965
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,720
That's exciting.

966
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,720
Yup.

967
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,720
The Ubuntu podcast is on the return.

968
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,720
The rumor is true.

969
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,720
Ah.

970
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,560
And if you want more Wes Payne, why not a little TechSnap?

971
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:39,160
Dot Systems for the TechSnap program, which is back and better than ever.

972
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,680
If I don't say so myself, TechSnap.Systems, and at Wes Payne on Twitter.

973
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,400
I'm at Chris LAS.

974
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,680
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

975
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,320
Stick around for Ask Noah if you're on the live stream.

976
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,320
Noah's coming up.

977
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,320
Yeah, definitely.

978
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,320
He's got a pretty special guest.

979
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,320
Pretty, pretty special.

980
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,400
I won't say anymore, but that's coming up soon.

981
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,000
You show up on Tuesdays, and you stick around for Linux Unplugged, you join the virtual

982
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,360
plug, hang out in our chat room, and then sit back and enjoy the Ask Noah show.

983
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,120
You could even call in and ask him a question.

984
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,120
That's how that kind of thing works.

985
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:12,320
It's a Tuesday Linux sandwich, and you can get the times at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash

986
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,320
calendar.

987
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,320
Also, our Reddit's at linuxunpluggedatreddit.com.

988
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,320
Thanks for being here.

989
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,320
See you next week.

990
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:34,840
I'm Chris LAS, and I'll see you next week.

991
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:58,920
All right, let's get a title, Noah.

992
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,920
Let's get out of here.

993
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,920
Oh, a title.

994
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,920
Great idea.

995
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:02,920
Yeah, we got to get a title.

996
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,920
We gots to get some titles.

997
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,920
We got to get a title today, huh?

998
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,920
Good title.

999
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,920
Hello, Eric.

1000
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,920
That's awesome.

1001
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,160
Is your weed extraction process done over there?

1002
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,800
Did it all work out?

1003
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,840
Dude, seriously, once you guys started talking about the Carputer stuff, I totally could

1004
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,720
jump in because I have one.

1005
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,400
I have an Android one, but then a leaf blower came by.

1006
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,400
You had a windstorm over there.

1007
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,400
Yeah, nice.

1008
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,400
Well, you know, that's what happens.

1009
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,400
That's what happens.

1010
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,400
Oh, the windstorm.

1011
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,960
That's my furnace.

1012
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:33,000
The smell of Free Breeze, that's pretty good tech, Mav, but probably a little too esoteric.

1013
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,640
What do you got?

1014
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,640
Anybody else got a title?

1015
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:36,640
What else do we got?

1016
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,640
KDE Freedom?

1017
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,640
No.

1018
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,640
Scanning.

1019
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,640
Indications negative.

1020
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,640
Accessing.

1021
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,640
Crankshaft.

1022
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,640
Accessing.

1023
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,640
Scanning.

1024
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,640
Scanning.

1025
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,640
Crankshaft.

1026
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,640
I have a Tech Talk Today question.

1027
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,760
Yes, sir.

1028
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,520
The feeds that I found in Pocket Cast for Tech Talk Today aren't being updated.

1029
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,520
Have you checked them recently?

1030
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,960
Because they had a bug on their server side thing with the feed.

1031
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,960
Oh, okay.

1032
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,960
Let me try again.

1033
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,440
Yeah, that would be no good.

1034
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:11,520
I just Googled the... I just Googled for Tech Talk Today and went to the one that's

1035
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,520
listed on the website.

1036
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:18,520
Yeah, if you want to just put it in, it's just techtalk.today slash RSS, if you want

1037
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,520
to just put it in.

1038
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,920
By the way, nice new logo.

1039
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,920
With the feet?

1040
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,800
Well, I mean, it's different than the one you had last time.

1041
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
Yeah.

1042
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,800
Little tweaked, yeah.

1043
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,800
Fascinating.

1044
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,800
Mmm.

1045
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,800
Yep.

1046
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,360
Yay, B-titles, yay, B-titles.

1047
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,400
You've got to constantly iterate.

1048
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,800
Not much there on J.B. Titles.

1049
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,800
Oh, there's a little bore.

1050
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,600
There's a little more.

1051
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,640
Crank that Foss shaft.

1052
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,080
Crankshaft on the move.

1053
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,880
Can we GTK all live together?

1054
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,520
I have the power.

1055
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,300
People are reaching deep this week.

1056
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,300
People are reaching deep.

1057
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,300
I appreciate it.

1058
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,300
Auto freedom.

1059
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,300
I appreciate it.

1060
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,300
People are reaching deep.

1061
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,300
Easy Linux.

1062
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,300
Small and cool.

1063
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,300
Bad news, Chris.

1064
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,300
What's that?

1065
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:03,440
Pocket Cast says it's from September years ago.

1066
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,000
I don't know what's going on with that.

1067
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,040
Now what if you put in techtalk.today slash RSS?

1068
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:18,880
Does it pull down a new, does the old RSS still show the old logo, Wimpy?

1069
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,440
Yeah.

1070
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,240
Okay.

1071
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:28,760
Usually Pocket Cast is very up to date when it comes to logos and all that.

1072
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,760
Pocket Cast.

1073
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,760
I'm going to go get Chris.

1074
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,760
Whoa.

1075
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,760
Colonel, you have a hot day.

1076
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,760
Holy shit.

1077
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,760
Maybe that's what he was going for.

1078
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,760
Is that Noah?

1079
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,760
Is that Noah?

1080
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,760
Yeah.

1081
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,760
Noah sounds terrible.

1082
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,760
Yo, Noah.

1083
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,760
Yeah.

1084
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,760
I can barely hear you.

1085
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,760
I thought my audio was bad.

1086
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,760
Yeah.

1087
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,760
He's also operating a wood chipper at the moment.

1088
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,760
He's probably just got too much for me.

1089
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,760
Yeah.

1090
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:58,520
So the updated RSS is just fine, but the old feed in it, I got to talk to him.

1091
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,520
We actually, we talked, we had it.

1092
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,520
So that was an issue.

1093
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,520
We talked to him.

1094
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,520
I said, okay, we got it fixed now.

1095
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,200
And then the person that we were working with said it was working, but I don't actually

1096
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,200
use Pocket Cast myself.

1097
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,600
So I'm installing it right now.

1098
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,200
Although by the way, there's actually a newer app that I would recommend to people who are

1099
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,040
not on Pocket Cast yet.

1100
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,740
It's called Cast Box.

1101
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,740
It seems to be-

1102
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:18,740
Jesus, Noah.

1103
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,740
I don't know.

1104
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:20,740
Is this-

1105
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,740
Noah, you stop.

1106
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:22,740
You're ruining my post-show.

1107
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:23,740
Here, let me hit stop on the recording.

1108
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:46,880
You just destroyed my post-show.
