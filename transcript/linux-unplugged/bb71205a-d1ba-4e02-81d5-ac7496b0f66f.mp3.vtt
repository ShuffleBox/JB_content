WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
No one can fully replace the Fedora Project.

00:02.480 --> 00:03.840
Absolutely not, exactly.

00:03.840 --> 00:06.800
Don't worry, Ian, it'll be just a pale comparison,

00:06.800 --> 00:08.360
but you know what?

00:08.360 --> 00:10.880
Rumor has it you have some experience with Fedora Atomic,

00:10.880 --> 00:13.840
which is kind of topic irrelevant right now.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.920
Relevant, not irrelevant, so I think it's gonna slide.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.240
Absolutely, and Dusty does even more than I do,

00:19.240 --> 00:20.080
so that'll be great.

00:20.080 --> 00:20.920
All right, there we go.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.800
All right, gentlemen, well, let's start the show.

00:23.800 --> 00:40.560
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 255 for June 26, 2018.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.280
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

00:43.280 --> 00:47.160
that's deploying containers with cockpit like a madman.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.080
My name is Chris.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.000
And my name is Brent.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.520
Hello, Brent.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.880
Yeah, Wes is out on vacay this week.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.920
I think he's on some kind of road trip.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.000
Who even knows, but we'll get into that.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.740
Coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged program,

00:59.740 --> 01:02.240
we have many community announcements to make for you,

01:02.240 --> 01:05.180
including some great news for the Blender Project,

01:05.180 --> 01:08.240
a little bit of a background Skunk Works project

01:08.240 --> 01:10.960
that I'm working on, a Flatpak history,

01:10.960 --> 01:14.640
and then a couple, perhaps three, maybe two gentlemen

01:14.640 --> 01:16.080
from the Fedora Project.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.600
It's all still getting ironed out.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.600
We'll be joining us to talk about Fedora Core OS

01:20.600 --> 01:22.200
and many other things that are happening

01:22.200 --> 01:23.680
in the Fedora community.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.960
Plus, GTK 3's got a big update.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.920
Neon's going for the 1804 push and looking for testing.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.040
But be careful before you make the plunge.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.520
Firefox is back.

01:33.520 --> 01:35.320
And they've got a lot of attention.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.880
And they think, perhaps, local processing, not

01:37.880 --> 01:41.160
cloud processing, might be the future of their success.

01:41.160 --> 01:45.320
And are you ready to replace MP3 at least for your podcasts?

01:45.320 --> 01:48.920
We'll tell you about a new, yes, a new open source codec.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.020
It's not Opus.

01:50.020 --> 01:51.160
It's not Theora.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.040
It's a brand.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.040
It's not Vorbis.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.920
It's a brand new codec called Codec 2.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.760
And it's designed to fit an entire,

01:57.760 --> 02:01.880
a long arse podcast on a floppy disk.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.160
Yeah, I said a floppy disk.

02:03.160 --> 02:03.880
I'll tell you about that.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.920
Plus, we've got a new release of GitLab.

02:05.920 --> 02:10.280
And I got a small, sweet, but really kind of to the point

02:10.280 --> 02:13.240
interview with the GitLab CEO about what the hell

02:13.240 --> 02:18.320
auto DevOps is and why it's landing in GitLab.11.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.840
But Brent, let's not go any further

02:20.840 --> 02:22.680
without addressing the elephant in the room.

02:22.680 --> 02:23.600
You're not Wes.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.680
I think I sound a little different.

02:25.680 --> 02:29.160
He's probably the Seattle version of me.

02:29.160 --> 02:29.880
I wasn't going to.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.200
Or maybe I'm the Northern Ontario version of him.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.360
I wasn't going to say it.

02:33.360 --> 02:33.880
I wasn't.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.000
But that is so true.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.440
So I'm really glad you said it.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.980
Because you guys are like, if I ever travel to Ontario,

02:39.980 --> 02:40.920
you're my guy, Brent.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.040
You're like my guy.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.200
And if anybody ever travels to Seattle,

02:44.200 --> 02:46.680
Wes should be their guy, not me, but Wes.

02:46.680 --> 02:50.720
But he's out driving around the Pacific Northwest right now.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.520
And you hit me up and you said, hey, I'd

02:52.520 --> 02:53.720
love to join you on the show.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.520
And it was just the timing worked out perfectly.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.100
And the audience might remember Brent

02:57.100 --> 03:00.880
because he was on the show ages ago during Linux Fest Northwest

03:00.880 --> 03:04.520
talking about his photography workflow on Linux.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.640
And Brent, since you've done that episode,

03:06.640 --> 03:09.040
I've probably gotten an email a week asking,

03:09.040 --> 03:11.360
how can I make that switch?

03:11.360 --> 03:14.280
So it seems to be an area, pro photography,

03:14.280 --> 03:17.880
where we're picking up a lot of users on the Linux side.

03:17.880 --> 03:18.600
Is that all still?

03:18.600 --> 03:20.920
You're still rocking Linux to do all your pro photography,

03:20.920 --> 03:22.760
still using Darktable and all that goodness?

03:22.760 --> 03:23.280
Absolutely.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.400
I don't see that changing anytime soon.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.280
And the software is just getting better and better and better.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.480
So no looking back.

03:28.480 --> 03:31.560
Yeah, I'm surprised that so many people are giving it a go.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.920
I'd really love to get more insights into that.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.960
In fact, if you're a pro photographer,

03:35.960 --> 03:40.480
photographer that has switched, I'd love to hear why.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.520
Go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.160
But before we go any further, Brent,

03:44.160 --> 03:46.760
we've got to bring in that virtual lug.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.480
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.160
Hello.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.000
What's up?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.400
Hello.

03:52.400 --> 03:57.920
So in the Mumble Room right now, we have Dusty joining us.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.840
Dusty, are you with technically Red Hat,

03:59.840 --> 04:02.040
or do you consider yourself with the Fedora project?

04:02.040 --> 04:03.680
What's your delineation there?

04:03.680 --> 04:04.480
Both.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.120
Oh, well, that's not confusing.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.600
No, I work for Red Hat, but a lot of what I do

04:10.600 --> 04:12.200
is related to the Fedora project.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.560
And if I were to leave Red Hat, I

04:14.560 --> 04:16.760
imagine I would try to still stay involved.

04:16.760 --> 04:21.080
So nothing that I do there is really tied or specific

04:21.080 --> 04:21.760
to Red Hat.

04:21.760 --> 04:26.360
Specifically, I mean, I could do that job for another company

04:26.360 --> 04:27.160
if I wanted to.

04:27.160 --> 04:27.760
Fascinating.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.520
And Ian was going to be joining us too,

04:29.520 --> 04:31.000
but it looks like he just stepped out for a moment.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.080
He might come back.

04:32.080 --> 04:33.640
I'll keep an eye out for him.

04:33.640 --> 04:34.200
Where are you, Ian?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.040
Where are you?

04:35.040 --> 04:35.640
Oh, yeah, there you are.

04:35.640 --> 04:36.320
Jeez, I'm sorry.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.720
I'm sorry.

04:37.720 --> 04:38.800
The screen's across.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.880
Ian, you're also over, again, same question to you.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.440
Do you consider yourself Red Hat?

04:43.440 --> 04:46.000
Do you consider yourself primarily Fedora?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.080
Explain that to me.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.600
I thought Dusty gave a great answer.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.240
All right.

04:49.240 --> 04:52.000
I think a lot of people in Red Hat would say the same thing.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.760
We can shift hats, sometimes strategically,

04:54.760 --> 04:56.680
depending on what we're trying to argue for.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.180
Nice.

04:57.180 --> 05:00.520
So you can chew and walk at the same time of that bubble gum.

05:00.520 --> 05:01.520
I like it.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.000
Well, guys, we're going to get to the big news surrounding

05:04.000 --> 05:06.120
the Fedora project here in just a little bit.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.320
But I wanted to start with an update around Blender,

05:09.320 --> 05:11.800
because this is personally extremely interesting to me.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.200
As you recall from last week's episode,

05:14.200 --> 05:17.240
YouTube had blocked all of the Blender videos, the Blender

05:17.240 --> 05:19.520
Projects videos, the open source Blender Projects

05:19.520 --> 05:21.640
videos worldwide.

05:21.640 --> 05:25.200
Now, on Thursday after the show, YouTube

05:25.200 --> 05:28.440
turned their channel back on, with the exception of one

05:28.440 --> 05:31.560
video from Andrew Price, which is still blocked in the USA.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.280
And apparently, they are requesting

05:34.280 --> 05:37.400
that the Blender Project signs a new monetization

05:37.400 --> 05:43.800
agreement, which sounds really bad just in general.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.200
I mean, Brent, is there no longer a space just

05:46.200 --> 05:47.800
for uploading your stuff for free

05:47.800 --> 05:49.160
and sharing it with people?

05:49.160 --> 05:51.440
Isn't that still something that's worth pursuing?

05:51.440 --> 05:55.480
Well, maybe it just means you don't do it on these platforms.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.200
Yeah.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.720
Yeah, maybe it does, doesn't it?

05:57.720 --> 06:00.080
Maybe it means we need things like PeerTube.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.160
PeerTube is what Blender turned to when

06:02.160 --> 06:03.840
YouTube shut down their channel.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.480
And we covered it a little bit last week,

06:05.480 --> 06:07.920
and I'm really happy to say this week,

06:07.920 --> 06:10.160
that they were undergoing a fundraiser

06:10.160 --> 06:11.840
and they reached their goal.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.920
In fact, they've exceeded their goal by just a bit.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.720
They still have nine days left to go,

06:15.720 --> 06:18.720
and I think maybe it'd be worth kind of pushing this

06:18.720 --> 06:20.120
just a little bit further.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.480
Right now, they've raised 23,000 euros,

06:23.480 --> 06:25.160
and their goal was 20,000.

06:25.160 --> 06:28.920
With nine days left to go, they've reached 118% of funding.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.480
But there's still work to be done.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.740
They talk about their next milestone.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.280
They say there are important features

06:34.280 --> 06:36.000
that they want to get in version 1,

06:36.000 --> 06:37.760
and those are video redundancies.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.500
You can share bandwidth between instances

06:39.500 --> 06:42.400
or as a fallback of the original instance if it goes down,

06:42.400 --> 06:45.920
and the ability to subscribe to users and channels

06:45.920 --> 06:48.360
throughout the entire federation of PeerTube.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.760
So for those of you that maybe aren't familiar with PeerTube,

06:50.760 --> 06:52.400
I did a little deep dive this week.

06:52.400 --> 06:57.400
I loaded up on a Fedora 28 cloud instance using Cockpit,

06:57.880 --> 06:59.200
and as you know, I love it.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.720
And you just go right into Cockpit

07:00.720 --> 07:02.000
when you have all the Docker stuff installed,

07:02.000 --> 07:04.220
and you go to containers, and you just search in there,

07:04.220 --> 07:06.240
and it will search the entire Docker hub,

07:06.240 --> 07:07.680
and it will pull down PeerTube.

07:07.680 --> 07:10.240
And you can get started with PeerTube in five minutes

07:10.240 --> 07:11.940
using Fedora 28 and Cockpit.

07:11.940 --> 07:15.080
It's great, and I have that running on top of a DO droplet.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.520
And I gave it a go, and it's a little rough at this point,

07:18.520 --> 07:20.780
but holy crap, if this doesn't have some potential.

07:20.780 --> 07:23.000
As you probably guessed, it's using BitTorrent

07:23.000 --> 07:25.320
as the backend with a web seed.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.020
So when you're the first person to watch it,

07:27.020 --> 07:30.040
you get a web seed, and it plays pretty fast.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.840
But when you're the second person to watch it,

07:31.840 --> 07:34.280
you get the web seed, and you start streaming it

07:34.280 --> 07:35.540
from the other person watching it.

07:35.540 --> 07:37.600
And I think this has massive potential

07:37.600 --> 07:39.160
for Jupyter broadcasting content.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.560
So I wanted to load it up and give it a go.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.420
And you know, it's early days, it's early days.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.560
But like, when do you decide to make a jump

07:46.560 --> 07:47.400
to something like this?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.720
Like, take you, Brent.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.880
When did you say, all right, I can make a jump

07:52.880 --> 07:54.500
to a totally different technology stack,

07:54.500 --> 07:57.040
even if it doesn't have 100% everything I need?

07:57.040 --> 07:58.640
How do you make that decision,

07:58.640 --> 08:01.440
especially when it's like a creative endeavor?

08:01.440 --> 08:04.440
Yeah, I mean, it's most certainly gonna be a personal choice

08:04.440 --> 08:06.360
as far as how much risk you're willing to take.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.240
Yeah, exactly.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.000
But for me personally, at least in the photography sphere,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.360
it was keeping an eye on the tools

08:13.360 --> 08:15.540
and knowing that, okay, they're in their infancy.

08:15.540 --> 08:18.040
Maybe six months from now, they're gonna have

08:18.040 --> 08:21.420
the very basic of the tool set that I need.

08:21.420 --> 08:23.600
So for my transition, it was like, okay,

08:23.600 --> 08:27.000
this has 70% of what I use on a daily basis.

08:27.000 --> 08:27.840
Is that enough?

08:27.840 --> 08:30.660
And for me at the time, yeah, okay, 70% is enough.

08:30.660 --> 08:33.540
And maybe I can fill in with that extra, you know,

08:33.540 --> 08:36.120
that remainder with some of the other proprietary tools

08:36.120 --> 08:38.720
for the moment as the open source

08:38.720 --> 08:42.340
or the alternative tools develop further.

08:42.340 --> 08:44.840
Yeah, so what I like about PeerTube right now

08:44.840 --> 08:46.720
is that I could self-host it.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.800
And then when I upload a video

08:49.800 --> 08:53.260
to my own little lonely self-hosted instance,

08:53.260 --> 08:56.760
it's in development, it's kind of working now.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.920
It has an announcement feature where it can announce it

08:59.920 --> 09:01.920
to the rest of the PeerTube network,

09:01.920 --> 09:03.860
which are a bunch of federated servers.

09:03.860 --> 09:06.560
And so you could be a member of one server

09:06.560 --> 09:08.080
and if you have everything turned on right

09:08.080 --> 09:09.920
and that server has everything enabled,

09:09.920 --> 09:13.360
you can cross-pollinate the content options,

09:13.360 --> 09:15.800
which sort of addresses this issue

09:15.800 --> 09:18.240
when you go self-hosted about discoverability.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.720
That's one of the things that's really driven GitHub

09:20.720 --> 09:22.800
is that when you move to GitHub,

09:22.800 --> 09:24.660
you automatically get discoverability.

09:24.660 --> 09:28.120
People can search and find you in one central location.

09:28.120 --> 09:32.160
And when you switch to GitLab or your own self-hosted repo,

09:32.160 --> 09:34.320
you kind of go off the grid a little bit.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.800
And that's why Jupyter Broadcasting

09:35.800 --> 09:39.280
has always published to YouTube and to Google Play

09:39.280 --> 09:42.760
and to iTunes and Stitcher and all of the other ones,

09:42.760 --> 09:44.720
because you gotta go where the audience is.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.960
But this sort of squares those two things.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.280
PeerTube is letting you self-host

09:51.200 --> 09:53.580
while also spreading the word

09:53.580 --> 09:55.380
when you have new content available.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.080
And I'm kind of all in.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.000
I kind of, I'm thinking about ways

10:00.000 --> 10:02.360
maybe I can contribute to the project financially.

10:02.360 --> 10:05.480
Jupyter Broadcasting is a company, I mean, not me personally.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.860
And I've played around on a container

10:07.860 --> 10:10.920
and it is at a stage right now

10:10.920 --> 10:13.120
where it needs more of my attention

10:13.120 --> 10:14.560
than I have time to give it.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.920
It's a little rough and it's gonna have more updates.

10:17.920 --> 10:18.960
But I will say this,

10:18.960 --> 10:21.000
if somebody in the community wants to reach out

10:21.000 --> 10:24.780
and work with me to set up a PeerTube hosted solution,

10:24.780 --> 10:26.160
I would be more than on board

10:26.160 --> 10:28.600
with importing all of our YouTube catalog

10:28.600 --> 10:30.680
and setting up PeerTube as an option

10:30.680 --> 10:33.080
for the Jupyter Broadcasting audience to consume our content.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.880
100% would be on board with that.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.840
I would even consider starting doing the main embeds

10:37.840 --> 10:39.620
on the JB website using PeerTube

10:39.620 --> 10:42.540
if the experience is 70% there,

10:42.540 --> 10:44.720
because I think the audience would be with me too.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.440
So if this sounds appealing to you,

10:46.440 --> 10:48.800
setting up a PeerTube server on a DigitalOcean Droplet

10:48.800 --> 10:51.740
or something like that and working with me over Telegram,

10:51.740 --> 10:54.840
I put this out there to the community right here right now.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.480
Let's be early adopters, Jupyter Broadcasting.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.440
Let's be early adopters of PeerTube.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.960
Let's push this forward.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.460
Let's help collapse the YouTube monopoly on online video.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.680
And let's do it with, in my opinion,

11:06.680 --> 11:09.560
some of the best Linux and open source content out there.

11:09.560 --> 11:10.860
And if you wanna work with me,

11:10.860 --> 11:13.260
contact me on Telegram at ChrisLAS.

11:13.260 --> 11:14.100
Let's set it up,

11:14.100 --> 11:15.680
because I think this could be a great opportunity.

11:15.680 --> 11:18.040
It's so close, I would almost do it all myself.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.560
It just needs a bit more babysitting

11:19.560 --> 11:21.640
than I have time to give and I recognize that fact

11:21.640 --> 11:22.900
and I want it to be successful.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.800
So I want somebody in the community to work with me,

11:24.800 --> 11:28.820
but this is the solution.

11:28.820 --> 11:30.580
It'll be this and a million other things.

11:30.580 --> 11:33.600
Instagram has just recently launched IGTV.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.920
Facebook has their YouTube competitor,

11:35.920 --> 11:39.040
but I feel like PeerTube, for our audience,

11:39.040 --> 11:40.120
could be the future.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.020
It won't necessarily replace YouTube,

11:42.020 --> 11:44.020
but it could be, one day,

11:44.020 --> 11:45.320
the predominant way people watch

11:45.320 --> 11:46.640
Jupyter Broadcasting videos.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.240
I'm pretty excited about it, Brent.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.880
Do you think it would isolate anyone at all?

11:50.880 --> 11:51.720
I don't know.

11:51.720 --> 11:55.080
I mean, I like their federation spreading the information.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.880
It definitely is not gonna reach people

11:56.880 --> 11:59.320
on the proprietary commercial platforms.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.280
And so I feel like, for a period of time,

12:01.280 --> 12:03.240
I'm gonna have to publish in both locations.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.160
You know what I mean?

12:04.160 --> 12:05.160
Like a transition period?

12:05.160 --> 12:07.120
Yeah, yeah, like a transition period

12:07.120 --> 12:09.980
and then once people know about it

12:09.980 --> 12:11.960
and the word of mouth is starting to spread,

12:11.960 --> 12:14.000
kind of make it our primary platform.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.360
And how awesome would it be if I could self-host that stuff

12:16.360 --> 12:19.080
and use BitTorrent to absorb the primary bulk

12:19.080 --> 12:19.920
of the bandwidth?

12:19.920 --> 12:20.740
Isn't that great?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.200
Fabulous, yeah, yeah, fabulous.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.920
It makes me wanna do all the things over torrent.

12:23.920 --> 12:24.960
I've always wanted to.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.520
I was ready to use BitTorrent Sync

12:27.520 --> 12:28.560
as a way to distribute shows,

12:28.560 --> 12:30.080
but that didn't work out either.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.200
So we'll see.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.040
We'll see where that goes.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.040
Do you think torrent can handle the bandwidth?

12:34.040 --> 12:36.040
You know, if we get like, you know,

12:36.040 --> 12:37.520
thousands of these servers going,

12:37.520 --> 12:38.720
can it do all that?

12:38.720 --> 12:40.020
I think it gets even better.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.640
That's the thing.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.980
You know, have you ever used any of those apps

12:43.980 --> 12:45.640
like Popcorn Hour or whatever it was

12:45.640 --> 12:47.900
that would live stream torrent files?

12:48.780 --> 12:49.620
No.

12:49.620 --> 12:52.240
It works because if you think about it,

12:52.240 --> 12:54.080
you do segmented downloads.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.520
And if you synchronize the download with the player,

12:57.520 --> 13:01.520
like if the download mechanism is aware

13:01.520 --> 13:03.620
of the player position in the video,

13:03.620 --> 13:05.820
it can start trying to chunk up the section

13:05.820 --> 13:07.280
of the video you're watching.

13:07.280 --> 13:11.080
And so it actually lends itself pretty well

13:11.080 --> 13:11.960
to video streaming.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.640
It's a little bit slower in some cases,

13:14.640 --> 13:18.160
but the nature of BitTorrent where it can download

13:18.160 --> 13:20.120
different chunks of the file at different times

13:20.120 --> 13:23.240
from different locations happens to fit pretty well

13:23.240 --> 13:25.560
with the nature of video streaming.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.820
So I actually think it could be a pretty good experience.

13:27.820 --> 13:29.040
I guess we'll have to wait and see.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.680
In some ways it seems like a meant to be transition, right?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.960
It's just about time that this comes along, isn't it?

13:33.960 --> 13:34.880
I hope so.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.140
I really hope so because I've had many concerns

13:37.140 --> 13:38.960
about YouTube now for quite a while.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.520
Let's shift gears for a moment.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.120
And there was some great progress that came out of London.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.200
Over on the Ubuntu blog, there is a report from Will Cook

13:47.200 --> 13:49.360
about the GNOME software design sprint.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.940
And he writes, a couple of weeks ago,

13:50.940 --> 13:53.720
representatives from across Canonical met in London

13:53.720 --> 13:56.200
to talk about ideas to improve the user experience

13:56.200 --> 13:57.380
of GNOME software.

13:57.380 --> 14:00.440
We had people from the store team, Snap Advocacy,

14:00.440 --> 14:03.240
Snap D, design, and the desktop team.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.880
But we also were fortunate enough to be joined

14:05.880 --> 14:09.440
by Richard Hughes, representing Upstream GNOME software.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.960
Now Richard's name may ring a bell

14:10.960 --> 14:14.160
when we've talked about the Upstream firmware project

14:14.160 --> 14:15.400
that I'm a huge fan of.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.680
And Will writes, we started off this week

14:17.680 --> 14:21.280
by making a very quick, a.k.a. long, list of features

14:21.280 --> 14:24.120
or improvements we'd like to see in GNOME software.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.500
They broke it all down, did a big whiteboard session.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.240
And some of the things they talked about

14:28.240 --> 14:30.360
were adding a verified publisher's identity

14:30.360 --> 14:33.280
to GNOME software to show where a publisher has undergone

14:33.280 --> 14:36.280
some kind of formal checking so you can be assured that they

14:36.280 --> 14:37.920
are who they say they are.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.680
Also, they thought about adding a way

14:39.680 --> 14:41.480
to report problems within applications

14:41.480 --> 14:43.060
right there in GNOME software.

14:43.060 --> 14:45.100
Maybe it's a link to submit a bug to their bug tracker,

14:45.100 --> 14:46.160
something like that.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.160
Or maybe it goes back to some central repository

14:48.160 --> 14:49.660
and then gets sorted out from there.

14:49.660 --> 14:53.680
They also had whiteboarded some better layouts and the ability

14:53.680 --> 14:57.360
for publishers to add extra theming and artwork

14:57.360 --> 14:58.540
to their application page.

14:58.540 --> 15:01.240
So you could have, for example, FileZilla

15:01.240 --> 15:03.880
could have some slick branding when you click on the FileZilla

15:03.880 --> 15:04.640
icon.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.140
Also, they worked on a refreshed home screen for GNOME software

15:07.140 --> 15:10.660
to surface new applications, application add-ons that

15:10.660 --> 15:12.960
are related to things you already have installed,

15:12.960 --> 15:16.440
and news and updates for your favorite applications

15:16.440 --> 15:17.820
from the software developers.

15:17.820 --> 15:19.400
Their initial designs are going to be

15:19.400 --> 15:22.720
added to GNOME's community design pages on the GitLab

15:22.720 --> 15:24.560
just to get feedback and things like that.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.440
And then hopefully, they'll begin engineering work,

15:27.440 --> 15:29.320
and it'll be done to a branch that's

15:29.320 --> 15:32.520
upstream of GNOME software and be proposed

15:32.520 --> 15:34.140
for upstream and general inclusion

15:34.140 --> 15:37.000
if all agreed seem to like it.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.280
Interesting that these sprints are still going on now

15:39.280 --> 15:42.760
that we're done with 17.10 and 18.04.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.320
It's an interesting thing that happens is different commercial

15:45.320 --> 15:47.440
interests, in this case, Canonical,

15:47.440 --> 15:49.960
who has a pretty wide interest in GNOME software,

15:49.960 --> 15:52.240
will bring folks in to sort of forward the things

15:52.240 --> 15:54.060
that they see are critical.

15:54.060 --> 15:56.440
And then it's kind of up to the rest of the community

15:56.440 --> 15:57.800
to adopt their changes.

15:57.800 --> 16:02.200
And this is sort of the groundwork where forks begin.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.200
Not necessarily where forks happen,

16:04.200 --> 16:05.720
but this is sort of the groundwork

16:05.720 --> 16:08.160
where forks could begin.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.360
Say Canonical really gets invested

16:10.360 --> 16:15.000
in some of these changes, like publisher verification, which

16:15.000 --> 16:17.600
is a pretty good one, especially after the Snap Store

16:17.600 --> 16:20.520
stuff and the Docker Hub stuff we've talked about recently.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.240
That's a pretty good one.

16:22.240 --> 16:23.680
But maybe for some reason, let's say

16:23.680 --> 16:25.600
GNOME upstream doesn't like it.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.640
Now Canonical will have a decision on their hands.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.400
Do we fork our version of GNOME software,

16:29.400 --> 16:31.440
which will be superior?

16:31.440 --> 16:35.080
Or do we go with upstream, stay upstream, keep it simple,

16:35.080 --> 16:37.320
but lack the features we want?

16:37.320 --> 16:44.120
It's kind of a interesting semi-uncomfortable situation

16:44.120 --> 16:45.880
that crops up in open source development.

16:45.880 --> 16:46.680
You agree, Brent?

16:46.680 --> 16:47.200
I do.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.640
But in a way, it also allows us a whole bunch

16:50.640 --> 16:51.720
of different options, right?

16:51.720 --> 16:55.200
If there's two camps that are in this stuff every single day

16:55.200 --> 16:56.840
who feel differently about a project,

16:56.840 --> 16:59.640
certainly there are other users out in the world who do as well.

16:59.640 --> 17:03.320
So to have two options sometimes is the best.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.560
It is sort of an organic way to let things work out,

17:05.560 --> 17:09.680
sort of an evolution versus intelligent design, if you will.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.680
And whichever one's stronger in the marketplace

17:11.680 --> 17:12.720
sort of wins out.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.360
I know myself, I want to see continued improvements

17:15.360 --> 17:17.560
in the way I can ingest flat packs and flat pack

17:17.560 --> 17:19.840
repositories and snaps.

17:19.840 --> 17:21.920
They've done a lot of work there.

17:21.920 --> 17:25.920
But just recently, I was trying to add,

17:25.920 --> 17:28.040
I can't remember if it was Atom or Visual Studio code,

17:28.040 --> 17:29.840
but there was a flat pack repo for it.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.000
And within step two, I'm at the command line.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.240
I'm adding repos.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.920
I'm then installing software.

17:36.920 --> 17:42.280
And honestly, I just wish I could click a link in my browser

17:42.280 --> 17:43.840
and have it launch GNOME software

17:43.840 --> 17:45.280
and do all of the work for me, maybe

17:45.280 --> 17:46.360
prompt for my password once.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.520
And we're just not there yet.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.400
So that's what I'd like to see is improvements

17:49.400 --> 17:52.520
with these universal package formats.

17:52.520 --> 17:57.840
Speaking of flat pack, it's been almost four years

17:57.840 --> 17:59.960
since we started talking about it.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.080
Can you believe that?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.320
You might not actually think that's true,

18:02.320 --> 18:04.880
because when we first started talking about flat pack,

18:04.880 --> 18:08.200
we were talking about XdgApp.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.240
You might remember your humble host here talking about XggApp

18:11.240 --> 18:14.800
and how I was excited about it being a universal installation

18:14.800 --> 18:15.600
format.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.160
It used osstree, XggApp, and used the osstree

18:19.160 --> 18:21.560
to store and deduplicate applications.

18:21.560 --> 18:25.880
It used kernel namespaces via a helper called XggAppHelper

18:25.880 --> 18:27.520
to do unprivileged containers.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.060
It had a split between applications and runtimes.

18:30.060 --> 18:33.800
It was very much like what we see flat pack today.

18:33.800 --> 18:37.000
But there was a great renaming for flat pack

18:37.000 --> 18:39.040
from XggApp to flat pack.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.320
And that's when, in this show, we

18:41.320 --> 18:44.720
could tell things were going to the next level.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.680
And flat pack, the name itself, has a great history

18:47.680 --> 18:50.560
that goes back way, way, way, way, way back

18:50.560 --> 18:52.680
to the ancient Egyptians.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.480
I'll link to the post in the show notes

18:54.480 --> 18:59.240
that explains that at linuxunplug.com slash 255.

18:59.240 --> 19:00.440
Go check that out.

19:00.440 --> 19:05.080
So in 2016, we got the new name of flat pack.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.600
That was version 0.6.0.

19:07.600 --> 19:11.680
Version 0.80 was released in December of 2016.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.840
And that was the first long-term stable edition

19:13.840 --> 19:16.940
that landed in Debian Stretch and RHEL 7.

19:16.940 --> 19:20.580
And we've had another stable release since then, version 0.10x.

19:20.580 --> 19:22.240
It's always been a decentralized system

19:22.240 --> 19:25.000
that anyone could host their own applications.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.840
But since then, they've realized it is kind of beneficial

19:28.840 --> 19:31.840
to have a centralized hub called Flathub.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.840
So the Flathub project was launched

19:33.840 --> 19:36.440
where you can find most applications these days that

19:36.440 --> 19:40.040
are available in Flathub and flat pack.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.480
But it's not finished.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.440
And it's not necessarily bug-free either.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.540
In fact, Alexander writes in his blog

19:45.540 --> 19:48.920
that they have a lot of things on the list for flat pack 1.0.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.780
And there's a few core things they

19:50.780 --> 19:54.240
want to have done before they announce flat pack.1.0.

19:54.240 --> 19:57.800
So if you keep your eye out, in this next week,

19:57.800 --> 20:01.200
you'll probably see the first release candidate

20:01.200 --> 20:07.040
for flat pack 1.0 called 0.99.1.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.920
It'll probably be later on, as you're

20:08.920 --> 20:11.160
hearing this episode, a couple of days afterwards.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.600
And then later this summer, we're

20:13.600 --> 20:19.280
going to finally get version 1.0 of flat pack.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.720
So we've got Snap and flat pack 1.0's.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.280
And actually, Snap is further along.

20:24.280 --> 20:27.640
And they did a little bit, I won't say much faster,

20:27.640 --> 20:30.160
but noticeably faster development pace there.

20:30.160 --> 20:33.640
But flat pack, since XGD app, since 2016,

20:33.640 --> 20:35.640
has been really kind of progressing

20:35.640 --> 20:39.760
in this nice, orderly fashion.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.740
And the summer is going to be the summer of flat pack.

20:42.740 --> 20:46.000
This is going to be a big summer for both of these formats.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.400
And it's just a couple of months away.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.840
And soon, some of your favorite applications

20:50.840 --> 20:52.960
will be packaged up, if they haven't already.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.800
As I wrote these notes for the show,

20:55.800 --> 21:01.200
I realized I was using a Snap of Telegram.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.840
I'm using a flat pack of my editor.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.820
I can't remember when I even installed that.

21:06.820 --> 21:09.120
I'm using an app image of Etcher.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.040
Like, I have all of these different applications

21:11.040 --> 21:15.740
I use on a daily basis that are installed using

21:15.740 --> 21:18.500
these universal package formats.

21:18.500 --> 21:23.200
And what we've ended up with is like three instead of one.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.400
Really, it's three, because you've got to include app image

21:25.400 --> 21:27.080
in this conversation.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.160
Is three manageable, Brent?

21:29.160 --> 21:30.280
What do you think?

21:30.280 --> 21:31.320
Is that too much?

21:31.320 --> 21:34.120
Or is three, if we just landed on three solids

21:34.120 --> 21:37.400
for application delivery, is that good enough?

21:37.400 --> 21:39.080
I guess let me throw a question right back at you.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.560
Do you see anyone pulling ahead?

21:40.560 --> 21:43.480
Or is it kind of everyone's keeping the same?

21:43.480 --> 21:45.240
I kind of feel like it's different use cases

21:45.240 --> 21:46.400
are emerging.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.900
So you're answering your own question.

21:47.900 --> 21:51.640
Like, snaps are emerging as a great solution

21:51.640 --> 21:55.760
for complicated commercial applications,

21:55.760 --> 21:57.480
or applications where you really want

21:57.480 --> 22:00.080
to have a high availability of discovery.

22:00.080 --> 22:04.120
Flat packs have been extremely useful for, like, for example,

22:04.120 --> 22:07.980
I run, on some systems, a development build of GKedit.

22:07.980 --> 22:09.840
And I use a flat pack to do that.

22:09.840 --> 22:10.720
That's really nice.

22:10.720 --> 22:14.960
It's like flat packs, to me, are in a way what

22:14.960 --> 22:16.840
PPA should have been all along.

22:16.840 --> 22:20.140
Like, Canonical tried out PPAs, and it kind of sucked,

22:20.140 --> 22:21.480
as far as I was concerned.

22:21.480 --> 22:22.600
It was great for a lot of users.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.640
I didn't like it a lot.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.840
Whereas flat pack is, like, the perfect PPA.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.120
If I could have had PPA as this, I'd

22:28.120 --> 22:29.720
have been a lot happier with it.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.440
Whereas snaps feel like XYZ vendor

22:33.440 --> 22:35.720
has just released an application for Linux,

22:35.720 --> 22:37.160
and now it's available.

22:37.160 --> 22:39.060
And JJ, you're pointing out, like, a lot of these,

22:39.060 --> 22:41.440
both flat pack and snaps, also have, like, this wine

22:41.440 --> 22:42.720
compatibility layer now.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.560
Yeah, and it's pretty interesting.

22:44.560 --> 22:50.240
I actually got to test out the GOG Galaxy app on my system,

22:50.240 --> 22:51.920
and it works relatively well, although there

22:51.920 --> 22:55.360
seems to be some focus issues online, particular system

22:55.360 --> 22:57.800
that I don't know if anybody else is having with regards

22:57.800 --> 23:01.320
to if I go away from the game that's currently playing,

23:01.320 --> 23:05.920
I cannot put my mouse inside of the game again.

23:05.920 --> 23:08.840
So that's a bug that I might need to report.

23:08.840 --> 23:11.000
But it sort of is interesting, because I

23:11.000 --> 23:16.080
wouldn't need to have any sort of complicated setup of wine

23:16.080 --> 23:18.000
in order to run all these applications.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.280
And it sort of gives me a little bit of hope for Linux,

23:23.280 --> 23:27.560
for users such as myself who have infrastructure

23:27.560 --> 23:31.760
slash universities that refuse to, quote unquote,

23:31.760 --> 23:33.760
officially support Linux.

23:33.760 --> 23:34.760
I agree.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.200
Yeah, it's been nice.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.800
And the bundling of, like, a compatibility layer,

23:39.800 --> 23:41.680
in the case of Skype, one day it's

23:41.680 --> 23:43.200
going to be to fix audio issues.

23:43.200 --> 23:47.520
In the case of some others, it's to load a wine library.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.400
It's very useful.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.720
And I've also seen CM2 in the chat room

23:51.720 --> 23:53.520
is saying that it's a good way to have

23:53.520 --> 23:56.840
GNOME stuff, the newest GNOME stuff, in CentOS 7.

23:56.840 --> 23:59.720
So you can have, like, a rel stable base,

23:59.720 --> 24:02.640
but you can have the newest user land applications.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.280
That obviously appeals to me too.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.560
Maybe beta software as well.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.560
I think Firefox beta is also available in these package

24:08.560 --> 24:09.320
formats.

24:09.320 --> 24:09.840
Yes.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.480
And Tenbit, you're pointing out that it

24:11.480 --> 24:13.960
is getting easier for folks that like to use these GUI

24:13.960 --> 24:16.600
installers, like the GNOME Software Center or KD Discover.

24:16.600 --> 24:17.080
Yeah?

24:17.080 --> 24:19.440
Yeah, it seems to me like if you're on the desktop anyway,

24:19.440 --> 24:22.120
you've got some options for not really caring

24:22.120 --> 24:23.320
which one you're using.

24:23.320 --> 24:24.800
It makes it way simpler, doesn't it,

24:24.800 --> 24:26.080
when you don't do it by the command line

24:26.080 --> 24:28.880
and you just use, like, Discover or GNOME software?

24:28.880 --> 24:29.840
Yeah, I think so.

24:29.840 --> 24:30.680
Yeah.

24:30.680 --> 24:34.520
Now, I want to talk about Fedora Core OS.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.000
Yeah, I said Fedora Core OS.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.600
Matthew Miller on June 20 posted over at fedoramagazine.org,

24:40.600 --> 24:42.880
welcome to Fedora Core OS.

24:42.880 --> 24:44.360
Everything you know is changing.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.760
Now it's time for us to figure out

24:45.760 --> 24:48.120
how we can welcome and include container Linux

24:48.120 --> 24:50.400
into the circle of Fedora friends.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.240
The Fedora editions strategy intentionally

24:53.240 --> 24:56.640
makes space for exploring emerging areas in operating

24:56.640 --> 24:57.920
system distributions.

24:57.920 --> 25:00.440
Core OS will help us push even further

25:00.440 --> 25:04.240
and bring new ways of doing things as a project.

25:04.240 --> 25:08.040
Now, Fedora Core OS is going to be built from Fedora content

25:08.040 --> 25:10.320
rather than the way it's made now.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.280
It won't necessarily be made the same way

25:12.280 --> 25:14.640
we make Fedora OS deliverables today, though.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.360
No matter what, we absolutely want

25:16.360 --> 25:20.120
Core OS's user experience of container cluster host OS

25:20.120 --> 25:22.280
that keeps itself up to date and you just

25:22.280 --> 25:23.520
don't have to worry about it.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.320
That's the experience they're going for.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.080
Fedora being a community-driven project,

25:27.080 --> 25:29.400
community-driven project, though obviously this

25:29.400 --> 25:31.120
is your chance to get involved.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.400
Now, I read that.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.720
I just quoted you word for word.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.360
I just read it from Matt's post.

25:35.360 --> 25:39.480
And it barely makes any sense to me, barely, barely

25:39.480 --> 25:40.160
makes any sense.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.600
From what I grok, Fedora is becoming

25:42.600 --> 25:44.880
something completely different, but it

25:44.880 --> 25:47.520
sounds like it's something that's even more awesome

25:47.520 --> 25:48.680
than it currently is.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.480
So I've invited Dusty and Ian on the show

25:51.480 --> 25:53.160
here to help me sort this out.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.960
They're both involved in the Fedora project,

25:55.960 --> 25:59.120
involved with Red Hat, and they have a better insight into this

25:59.120 --> 26:00.920
than your humble host here does.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.600
So guys, welcome into the show.

26:02.600 --> 26:06.520
And Dusty, because you were here first, I'll start with you.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.560
Where do you want to begin the conversation

26:08.560 --> 26:10.240
around Fedora Core OS?

26:10.240 --> 26:13.160
Are we talking about sort of a refactoring of Fedora here?

26:13.160 --> 26:15.440
Are we talking about a new Fedora in a sense?

26:15.440 --> 26:17.480
I think what we're talking about here

26:17.480 --> 26:21.720
is kind of taking the use cases that Container Linux

26:21.720 --> 26:24.120
and Atomic Host have been targeting

26:24.120 --> 26:29.200
and trying to bring the best of both of those worlds,

26:29.200 --> 26:31.200
so the best from Container Linux and the best

26:31.200 --> 26:33.400
from Atomic Host, and to also try

26:33.400 --> 26:35.560
to bring those two communities.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.840
Obviously, Container Linux has a large user base,

26:37.840 --> 26:42.200
and Atomic Host has a very engaged community.

26:42.200 --> 26:46.840
Trying to bring those two together and make something

26:46.840 --> 26:50.400
better, more focused, if we combine our efforts,

26:50.400 --> 26:53.920
hopefully it'll be better and it'll be more rock solid.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.320
Now, Ian, you kind of come at this

26:56.320 --> 26:58.440
from the atomic side of the house.

26:58.440 --> 27:01.800
And I got to ask you, is this kind

27:01.800 --> 27:04.160
of where the puck was going to skate regardless

27:04.160 --> 27:05.640
of the Core OS merger?

27:05.640 --> 27:07.360
Because to me, I've always kind of wanted

27:07.360 --> 27:08.840
Fedora to go more atomic.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.880
Yeah, well, I think it's funny to me

27:10.880 --> 27:13.640
to hear you say that that almost makes sense to you.

27:13.640 --> 27:16.600
Because I saw Matt shared that announcement with me,

27:16.600 --> 27:17.400
and I saw it go out.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.400
And I thought, oh, yes, this is exactly what I wanted to say.

27:20.400 --> 27:24.160
There's something that occurs to me when you did say that.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.000
I think a realization that we came to,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.560
if you've been in the Fedora project for a long time,

27:28.560 --> 27:30.040
I've always thought of it as something

27:30.040 --> 27:31.760
that was very nimble and very quick.

27:31.760 --> 27:34.280
And certainly, as someone in Red Hat who's also

27:34.280 --> 27:37.800
trying to manage an OS that we want to have a 3, 5, 10-year

27:37.800 --> 27:40.080
lifecycle, it seems extremely nimble.

27:40.080 --> 27:43.480
But some of what Fedora does now seems a little bit less nimble

27:43.480 --> 27:46.400
than, for example, something like Container Linux

27:46.400 --> 27:47.160
was able to do.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.120
So I think a big element of what Matt was trying to get across

27:50.120 --> 27:51.760
in that announcement is that we're

27:51.760 --> 27:54.200
going to be open to slightly different ways of perhaps

27:54.200 --> 27:59.040
constructing this subset or this sub-distribution of Fedora

27:59.040 --> 28:00.520
that maybe we weren't necessarily

28:00.520 --> 28:02.800
before we actually talked about marrying up

28:02.800 --> 28:04.480
with the Container Linux community.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.800
Because looking at some of the ways that they do things,

28:06.800 --> 28:09.920
how they put stuff together, the rolling update model

28:09.920 --> 28:12.240
and things like that, it is really quite nimble.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.880
And it's something that I think we aspire to do more of as we

28:15.880 --> 28:17.560
merge those two upstreams.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.060
I see.

28:18.060 --> 28:18.560
I see.

28:18.560 --> 28:22.160
So in your perspective, this isn't necessarily

28:22.160 --> 28:25.360
a huge shift for Fedora, the main project itself,

28:25.360 --> 28:28.520
but maybe for one of the additions of Fedora.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.320
Am I tracking?

28:29.320 --> 28:31.360
Yeah, and I think Matthew also used this concept.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.760
We've had a concept in Fedora called Spins, which

28:33.760 --> 28:35.800
is meant to be another place where people perhaps

28:35.800 --> 28:37.800
experimented a little bit more with the way

28:37.800 --> 28:39.640
that the distribution was composed.

28:39.640 --> 28:40.880
Again, it doesn't mean that we're

28:40.880 --> 28:45.240
going to go completely off piste, as it were,

28:45.240 --> 28:47.840
and start pulling in content that comes from nowhere else.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.680
But we do have a fairly, and Fedora's very,

28:49.680 --> 28:51.920
this is one of the things that makes Fedora great,

28:51.920 --> 28:53.600
as a full-fledged distribution that's

28:53.600 --> 28:56.680
released every six months or so, have a very rigorous process

28:56.680 --> 28:59.400
for composing the entire thing together at something

28:59.400 --> 29:01.840
like 20,000 source RPMs.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.080
They experiment with all sorts of different ways

29:04.080 --> 29:05.880
to do interactive installs, all sorts

29:05.880 --> 29:09.840
of different combinations of install configurations.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.040
And they do that quite well.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.440
But we don't necessarily need to be constrained by that

29:13.440 --> 29:16.600
when we release an update of our minimal container host that's

29:16.600 --> 29:19.200
meant to support an entirely different use case, right?

29:19.200 --> 29:20.960
So these are the kind of things that we're

29:20.960 --> 29:23.520
hoping to create a little bit more space for now

29:23.520 --> 29:25.600
that we've created Fedora Core OS

29:25.600 --> 29:27.880
and have sort of announced some of the guardrails

29:27.880 --> 29:29.000
for that community.

29:29.000 --> 29:29.600
I see.

29:29.600 --> 29:34.120
So if I today am a Fedora Atomic user,

29:34.120 --> 29:36.440
and I'm just a minimal installation,

29:36.440 --> 29:39.680
but I found it to be a pretty competitive, pretty great

29:39.680 --> 29:44.800
server OS, what should I expect now as a Fedora Atomic user?

29:44.800 --> 29:47.360
Long term, what kind of shift should I expect here?

29:47.360 --> 29:50.340
Because it sounds like Core OS and Fedora Atomic

29:50.340 --> 29:52.200
had a lot of the same goals in mind.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.960
So as a user, essentially what I'm

29:53.960 --> 29:55.380
trying to get out of the project sounds

29:55.380 --> 29:56.460
like it's staying the same.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.200
Some of the technical implementations might be shifting.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.760
This is where I get to sign Dusty up for whatever I want,

30:01.760 --> 30:03.640
since I told you what to expect on that one.

30:03.640 --> 30:04.120
I love it.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.200
Dusty will give him.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.240
I'm going to give him a second to try and compose

30:07.240 --> 30:11.760
an answer to that, too, before I write my wish list.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.720
Yeah, what do you think?

30:13.720 --> 30:17.520
As a Fedora Atomic user, should I be a little concerned

30:17.520 --> 30:20.280
that the thing I've just started to fall in love with

30:20.280 --> 30:24.480
is about to change from what I come to expect?

30:24.480 --> 30:26.280
I don't think so.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.940
I guess it depends on how you look at it.

30:27.940 --> 30:29.920
But like I said earlier, we're trying

30:29.920 --> 30:32.600
to take some of the best technology from both.

30:32.600 --> 30:36.600
So one thing that Container Linux users really liked

30:36.600 --> 30:40.760
is Ignition, which is kind of like an early bootstrapping

30:40.760 --> 30:43.400
tool that runs in the init remfs.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.600
So if you've ever tried to add a new system d

30:46.600 --> 30:50.480
unit to your cloud instance using CloudInit,

30:50.480 --> 30:55.600
you realize that adding a system d unit via another system d

30:55.600 --> 31:00.480
unit is actually pretty, it gets pretty hairy pretty quick.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.360
So running and modifying the system in the init remfs

31:03.360 --> 31:07.600
before you switch the root is actually pretty powerful.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.480
So that's one thing that we're kind of carrying forward.

31:10.480 --> 31:13.880
Another thing is some of the update technology

31:13.880 --> 31:19.680
behind Container Linux was forked off of Chrome OS.

31:19.680 --> 31:25.840
And it's something that had not been maintained very well.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.160
And it was kind of something that

31:27.160 --> 31:30.240
was a little more scary for some of the Container Linux

31:30.240 --> 31:31.160
maintainers.

31:31.160 --> 31:34.760
However, RPM OS3 and OS3, we have

31:34.760 --> 31:37.320
some of the core developers for that technology

31:37.320 --> 31:38.800
in-house at Red Hat.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.280
So if there are things that we need from those technologies

31:42.280 --> 31:44.000
and the future new features or whatnot,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.840
we can easily add them because we have the people,

31:46.840 --> 31:48.560
the expertise there.

31:48.560 --> 31:52.520
So as far as Fedora Atomic goes, it will actually continue.

31:52.520 --> 31:56.360
There will be a Fedora 29 release of Fedora Atomic.

31:56.360 --> 31:59.440
After that, Fedora Core OS will take over.

31:59.440 --> 32:03.680
But in the long run, it's not going

32:03.680 --> 32:09.200
to be much, much different than what you have today

32:09.200 --> 32:12.880
as far as if you know RPM OS3 already.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.160
I'm going to put Dusty on the spot here and say,

32:15.160 --> 32:17.040
Dusty, would you anticipate that there's

32:17.040 --> 32:19.920
going to be a continuous upgrade path between, say,

32:19.920 --> 32:22.680
Fedora 29 Atomic Host and whatever

32:22.680 --> 32:24.120
comes out of Fedora Core OS?

32:24.120 --> 32:26.680
Is that already something we're thinking of as a goal?

32:26.680 --> 32:28.880
I think it might be possible.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.680
I just don't want to commit to that.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.720
Interesting.

32:31.720 --> 32:32.400
Very clever.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.520
Yeah.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.160
Probably a good move.

32:35.160 --> 32:35.960
Yeah.

32:35.960 --> 32:40.520
What we're doing as part of this merging of the two communities

32:40.520 --> 32:43.840
as well is looking at it as an opportunity

32:43.840 --> 32:46.040
to get rid of bad design decisions

32:46.040 --> 32:48.480
that we may have had early on.

32:48.480 --> 32:50.920
And if we get to a point where we decide,

32:50.920 --> 32:53.800
hey, there's this change that we want

32:53.800 --> 32:56.480
to make that means that we couldn't in place

32:56.480 --> 32:59.960
upgrade Fedora Atomic Host to Fedora Core OS,

32:59.960 --> 33:02.200
now's the best time to do it.

33:02.200 --> 33:07.080
So it's very early days in the development of Fedora Core OS.

33:07.080 --> 33:10.880
But we're building off of pretty stable technologies.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.360
Obviously, there's a community behind Container Linux

33:13.360 --> 33:17.120
and a community behind Fedora Atomic Host today.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.680
Those technologies work.

33:19.680 --> 33:22.600
So we're starting from a good position.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.240
We're kind of throwing everything in the middle there

33:25.240 --> 33:27.440
and then coming out with something better, I believe.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.400
Yeah, you get to pick from the best, really,

33:29.400 --> 33:30.400
in this situation.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.800
It's sort of you have more good things to pick from

33:33.800 --> 33:35.520
than you can really kind of make sense of.

33:35.520 --> 33:37.720
It kind of sounds like an ideal situation in a way.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.640
Now, all right, so that's all fine and good.

33:40.640 --> 33:44.360
But as a Fedora user, I've got to wonder,

33:44.360 --> 33:48.000
eventually, does this become main Fedora?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.680
Is it too soon to even say that?

33:49.680 --> 33:53.800
But it seems like, to me, this would really

33:53.800 --> 33:56.560
be a standout differentiator for Fedora

33:56.560 --> 34:00.360
if this wasn't just like one of the additions of Fedora,

34:00.360 --> 34:02.640
if this was Fedora.

34:02.640 --> 34:07.000
Right, so I think, at least the way I think about it.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.560
So for example, we have Fedora Atomic Host, right?

34:10.560 --> 34:12.160
We have Fedora Workstation.

34:12.160 --> 34:14.400
We have a new Fedora IoT edition.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.520
We have Fedora Server.

34:17.520 --> 34:20.280
The technology behind Atomic Host

34:20.280 --> 34:24.680
and the technology behind upcoming Fedora Core OS

34:24.680 --> 34:26.800
is already starting to branch out

34:26.800 --> 34:29.080
into some of those other additions, right?

34:29.080 --> 34:32.080
So for example, Atomic Workstation,

34:32.080 --> 34:35.840
which was rebranded as Fedora Silverblue,

34:35.840 --> 34:38.920
uses RPMOS tree and OS tree in the background.

34:38.920 --> 34:42.200
So you've got your get for your operating system

34:42.200 --> 34:46.080
like approach with the transactional updates.

34:46.080 --> 34:49.520
But it's just a different package set, right?

34:49.520 --> 34:54.600
So to answer your question, is Fedora Core OS

34:54.600 --> 34:56.920
the future of Fedora?

34:56.920 --> 34:59.720
I mean, I think Fedora Core OS is more or less

34:59.720 --> 35:01.720
an addition of Fedora.

35:01.720 --> 35:04.720
But the tooling behind it, the tooling behind it,

35:04.720 --> 35:07.360
the tooling behind it, what we were doing with Atomic Host

35:07.360 --> 35:09.520
and what we're doing with Silverblue today

35:09.520 --> 35:12.400
is possibly the answer to your question,

35:12.400 --> 35:14.080
is that the future of Fedora, right?

35:14.080 --> 35:17.480
Because it could Fedora Core OS be the future of Fedora?

35:17.480 --> 35:20.400
Well, there's a lot of users that use Fedora

35:20.400 --> 35:22.360
as a workstation and Fedora Core OS,

35:22.360 --> 35:24.480
we're not including GNOME, right?

35:24.480 --> 35:27.080
So that's kind of hard to answer that question,

35:27.080 --> 35:28.040
unless you look at it,

35:28.040 --> 35:30.560
is the underlying technology the future?

35:30.560 --> 35:33.440
I think that is an open question and that is,

35:33.440 --> 35:35.280
it will be interesting to see what happens there.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.480
Yeah, that's kind of where I was going, exactly,

35:37.480 --> 35:39.800
is it seems like that fundamental technology

35:39.800 --> 35:42.480
that's making this such a great option

35:42.480 --> 35:46.080
would be just as useful on the workstation.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.560
Because I guess I think about this and I think,

35:48.560 --> 35:51.200
this is kind of confusing to the average user,

35:51.200 --> 35:53.360
there's a lot going on here.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.080
It's not like open SUSE levels of confusing yet,

35:56.080 --> 35:57.800
but we're like getting there.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.960
And I wonder, this is kind of a nebulous question,

36:00.960 --> 36:02.760
I don't know if it's better for Ian or for Dusty,

36:02.760 --> 36:06.840
but how much do you guys give thinking

36:06.840 --> 36:08.600
to the messaging around all of this

36:08.600 --> 36:12.720
and the end user's ability to track this?

36:12.720 --> 36:15.320
Seems like it's pushing it.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.160
You know what I mean?

36:17.160 --> 36:20.080
Well, so I think the messaging initially on this

36:20.080 --> 36:22.880
is that this is a continuation of the interest groups

36:22.880 --> 36:25.080
that grew around Container Linux

36:25.080 --> 36:26.880
and the Fedora Atomic Host, right?

36:26.880 --> 36:30.520
So the focus of this is very much that use case.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.280
I would reiterate Dusty's point,

36:32.280 --> 36:35.600
is that the idea of having a largely immutable host

36:35.600 --> 36:37.480
with this sort of atomic update

36:37.480 --> 36:39.840
has at least two other major applications

36:39.840 --> 36:43.080
that people are able to experiment with within Fedora,

36:43.080 --> 36:47.040
what's now called Silverblue and some initial work on IoT.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.680
And I think that's a very natural way

36:48.680 --> 36:52.440
for it to be allowed to develop sort of in parallel

36:52.440 --> 36:55.480
with contributions coming across where there's commonality,

36:55.480 --> 36:58.480
like again, at the OS tree or our PMOS tree level.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.800
But if you're a Fedora user and you're confused by this,

37:00.800 --> 37:03.320
but you haven't been involved in the Atomic Host project

37:03.320 --> 37:05.880
and are not interested in containers,

37:05.880 --> 37:07.440
it's probably not an area

37:07.440 --> 37:09.880
that you need to be looking at right now.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.240
But if you were part of the communities

37:11.240 --> 37:13.160
that were interested in container technologies,

37:13.160 --> 37:15.280
if you're interested in container orchestration,

37:15.280 --> 37:18.000
or if you were actually part of the Atomic Host community

37:18.000 --> 37:21.200
or Container Linux on the CoreOS side,

37:21.200 --> 37:23.600
then I hope you're not confused by Matthew's announcement.

37:23.600 --> 37:24.800
And get involved, right?

37:24.800 --> 37:26.160
Yes, yes, please.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.520
Yeah, that's what I like the most

37:27.520 --> 37:28.960
about what you guys are doing really,

37:28.960 --> 37:31.880
is because in a way, and my co-host on Linux Action

37:31.880 --> 37:33.280
has pointed this out to me, it was obvious,

37:33.280 --> 37:35.400
but I hadn't thought about it.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.320
This could trickle upstream to RHEL eventually,

37:39.320 --> 37:40.480
what you guys do here, yeah?

37:40.480 --> 37:42.600
So it's in a way, it's a way for the community

37:42.600 --> 37:46.560
to impact RHEL, which is one of the largest commercial

37:46.560 --> 37:48.880
and open source products in the world.

37:48.880 --> 37:51.400
Yeah, and we'd like, I mean, I would say that that's true

37:51.400 --> 37:54.400
of many things in Fedora, and that's quite explicit, so.

37:54.400 --> 37:55.560
Yeah, fair enough.

37:55.560 --> 37:58.480
Okay, so I don't know if this is a Dustin or Ian question.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.280
Dusty, maybe this is more towards you,

38:00.280 --> 38:03.120
but can somebody explain to me what the difference

38:03.120 --> 38:05.900
between a Fedora project leader is

38:05.900 --> 38:07.760
and a Fedora program manager?

38:07.760 --> 38:09.160
Because you guys just got yourself

38:09.160 --> 38:11.280
a program manager over at Fedora.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.960
It looks like it's Ben Cotton,

38:12.960 --> 38:16.040
and he is pretty excited to take the new role on,

38:16.040 --> 38:19.520
but what is a program manager, and what's that all about?

38:19.520 --> 38:20.560
I'm not sure exactly.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.920
I imagine the Fedora project leader

38:22.920 --> 38:25.440
is more of a community facing, you know,

38:25.440 --> 38:27.840
let's kind of organize and get people inspired

38:27.840 --> 38:31.640
to, you know, contribute and collaborate.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.240
And the program manager is probably more, you know,

38:34.240 --> 38:36.060
looking at what's coming down the pipeline.

38:36.060 --> 38:38.480
Do we have people working on these things?

38:38.480 --> 38:40.740
Are we gonna be able to, you know,

38:40.740 --> 38:44.000
get this feature into Fedora 29, that type of thing.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.840
Yeah, so very much sort of like a,

38:45.840 --> 38:47.480
sort of herding the cats role,

38:47.480 --> 38:50.480
which can be a absolutely full-time position.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.600
In fact, it can be one of the most arduous positions, so.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.500
Herding cats in the community, fun.

38:55.500 --> 38:58.200
Oh, I can imagine, let me tell you, Dusty.

38:58.200 --> 39:03.200
I can imagine, and it is a pain in the arse, let me tell you.

39:03.400 --> 39:07.500
It is the hardest thing I do for 12 years,

39:07.500 --> 39:09.480
maybe 13 years now of podcasting.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.200
It is the hardest thing I do.

39:11.200 --> 39:14.160
So it does take some serious dedication.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.640
Well, guys, is there anything else around this

39:16.640 --> 39:17.680
that we should talk about?

39:17.680 --> 39:18.960
Anything else you think the audience

39:18.960 --> 39:20.840
would probably walk away with knowing

39:20.840 --> 39:22.200
about the recent announcements,

39:22.200 --> 39:24.400
the merger of Fedora and CoreOS?

39:24.400 --> 39:25.720
Is there kind of like a takeaway

39:25.720 --> 39:26.960
that you want to make sure you hit on?

39:26.960 --> 39:28.640
I would say that we're deadly serious

39:28.640 --> 39:29.920
about the ability for people

39:29.920 --> 39:31.760
who want to get involved in the community

39:31.760 --> 39:34.680
or are already involved in either of these two communities

39:34.680 --> 39:37.420
to come on board in the sort of early requirements

39:37.420 --> 39:38.480
gathering phase of this.

39:38.480 --> 39:41.120
We're absolutely, we have a number of, I think,

39:41.120 --> 39:43.240
interesting avenues of exploration right now

39:43.240 --> 39:44.080
that we're going down,

39:44.080 --> 39:45.960
and we would love to have people come on board.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.760
Yep, and I believe we'll have

39:47.760 --> 39:49.860
our first community meeting tomorrow.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.680
I think we're going to try to have the same time slot

39:53.680 --> 39:56.320
as what we were doing for the Atomic Community Meeting,

39:56.320 --> 40:00.320
which is Wednesdays at 1630 UTC,

40:00.320 --> 40:02.080
but we'll see.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.040
We should have our first one tomorrow.

40:04.040 --> 40:07.080
So if I wanted to get kind of in the ground floor level,

40:07.080 --> 40:09.120
wanted to maybe influence some of the decisions,

40:09.120 --> 40:11.840
is that sort of the first thing I should start attending,

40:11.840 --> 40:15.620
is that Wednesday meeting and start contributing there?

40:15.620 --> 40:16.920
Yep, that's a good place to start,

40:16.920 --> 40:19.880
but if you're not able to come there,

40:19.880 --> 40:20.960
we have a mailing list,

40:20.960 --> 40:24.880
we have a discourse set up for discussions.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.140
Really, there's a lot of different ways to get involved.

40:27.140 --> 40:28.640
We have an IRC channel.

40:28.640 --> 40:31.420
If you have any questions and want to get involved,

40:31.420 --> 40:32.900
drop by our IRC channel,

40:32.900 --> 40:34.840
and we can point you in the right direction too.

40:34.840 --> 40:35.680
Awesome.

40:35.680 --> 40:38.360
Guys, here's what I love about what's going on.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.880
First of all, it really is something where

40:41.880 --> 40:45.400
Joe, sysadmin, or Joe developer can get involved

40:45.400 --> 40:47.360
and push the direction of this thing,

40:47.360 --> 40:49.280
which eventually will trickle upstream

40:49.280 --> 40:50.400
to Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

40:50.400 --> 40:53.760
which is, that's remarkable, if you think about it.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.140
That right there itself is remarkable,

40:55.140 --> 40:57.320
but the other thing I really like about it is

40:57.320 --> 40:59.820
this is about as transparent as it can get.

40:59.820 --> 41:01.720
I mean, I appreciate and understand

41:01.720 --> 41:04.120
there was some business sales and behind the scenes stuff

41:04.120 --> 41:04.960
that had to happen,

41:04.960 --> 41:08.520
but really, even before this thing is completely formed,

41:09.360 --> 41:12.840
you guys, two of you, Ian and Dusty, are on the show.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.280
Matt was gonna make it, but he couldn't.

41:15.280 --> 41:18.920
Three of you were gonna be on the show to talk about this.

41:18.920 --> 41:21.160
The blog posts are out there.

41:21.160 --> 41:24.720
The weekly community meetings are happening.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.680
This is about as transparent as it gets

41:26.680 --> 41:27.520
with something like this,

41:27.520 --> 41:29.320
and the reason why I think it's worth underscoring

41:29.320 --> 41:30.960
that a couple of times is

41:30.960 --> 41:33.560
this really will affect the industry.

41:33.560 --> 41:37.340
It goes from Fedora and it trickles down

41:37.340 --> 41:41.840
to so many systems, so many enterprise-grade systems,

41:41.840 --> 41:43.240
the things that people in our audience

41:43.240 --> 41:44.400
make their living off of.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.920
So I really appreciate you guys taking the time

41:46.920 --> 41:49.560
to come on the show and helping me wrap my brain around it

41:49.560 --> 41:51.960
because it's part of that transparency.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.200
So thank you, Ian and Dusty.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.080
You guys are totally welcome to hang out with us.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.040
We're gonna keep going.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.120
All right, thanks for having us.

41:57.120 --> 41:58.040
Thank you, Chris.

41:58.040 --> 42:01.180
Yeah, so let's talk about GTK 3 for a moment

42:01.180 --> 42:04.320
because it hasn't gotten a lot of attention for a while.

42:04.320 --> 42:07.440
GTK 4 has sort of been the new big promise,

42:07.440 --> 42:09.720
and we've all kind of been holding our breath,

42:09.720 --> 42:13.440
but it's taking a little bit longer than initially thought.

42:13.440 --> 42:16.700
So over on the GTK Plus development blog,

42:16.700 --> 42:20.280
we have ourselves a post from Mr. MC Lason,

42:20.280 --> 42:23.240
and he talks about GTK 4 being just a little bit out.

42:23.240 --> 42:28.120
So in the meantime, we're gonna see ourselves a GTK 3.24,

42:28.120 --> 42:29.800
and it's gonna be a maintenance release

42:29.800 --> 42:31.620
that has some nice new features,

42:31.620 --> 42:34.000
including, Brent, I know your favorite feature,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.240
new emoji support, yeah?

42:36.240 --> 42:37.240
I mean, that's gotta feel good.

42:37.240 --> 42:38.080
How did you know?

42:38.080 --> 42:41.360
I don't know, because I feel like you and I

42:41.360 --> 42:44.200
could have a conversation in emojis, you and I.

42:44.200 --> 42:47.040
You had this very special emoji that you sent me.

42:47.040 --> 42:48.840
It might have been someone with a beard.

42:48.840 --> 42:52.160
Those are stickers.

42:52.160 --> 42:55.400
Do not confuse the emojis with the stickers.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.000
I do love my Putin stickers.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.520
Yeah, I got Kim Jong-un stickers,

42:59.520 --> 43:01.040
and I got Vladimir Putin stickers,

43:01.040 --> 43:03.640
and I'll use them all the time.

43:03.640 --> 43:08.200
So the long and short of this is really

43:08.200 --> 43:10.480
kind of a practical acknowledgment

43:10.480 --> 43:15.480
by the GTK community that GTK 4 is taking a little bit longer.

43:16.040 --> 43:18.460
So we're gonna, I know we've been telling you

43:18.460 --> 43:21.880
that you could just plan on GTK 3.22 being final,

43:21.880 --> 43:23.320
and it was just gonna stick around,

43:23.320 --> 43:25.900
but we're gonna make some changes.

43:25.900 --> 43:28.760
But it's not just emojis that they're including.

43:28.760 --> 43:31.680
There's gonna be support for new open type font features

43:31.680 --> 43:35.500
and other nice things and bug fixes, so keep an eye out.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.280
The GTK 3 cycle is still alive,

43:37.280 --> 43:39.240
and I wanted to give you just a heads up about that.

43:39.240 --> 43:41.980
Another bit of community news for those of you

43:41.980 --> 43:44.680
that are running KDE Neon.

43:44.680 --> 43:48.480
If you are crazy, you can now update to 18.04.

43:48.480 --> 43:53.220
KDE Neon is sort of this promise of an LTS Ubuntu release

43:53.220 --> 43:55.960
with a rolling KDE release.

43:55.960 --> 43:58.440
They can come within hours of the new hotness

43:58.440 --> 44:00.560
because the developers are using Neon themselves.

44:00.560 --> 44:02.900
And this, since the project's inception,

44:02.900 --> 44:05.480
is the first time they're hopping LTSs.

44:05.480 --> 44:09.940
They're going from 16.04 to 18.04,

44:09.940 --> 44:12.520
but it hasn't been done before.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.600
So they're looking for your help to test,

44:14.600 --> 44:17.380
and I underscore test.

44:17.380 --> 44:21.200
It is not recommended for production systems.

44:21.200 --> 44:24.240
But if you are a lunatic and a masochist,

44:24.240 --> 44:25.360
you can go try it out.

44:25.360 --> 44:27.760
I'll have a link in the show notes and help them test it.

44:27.760 --> 44:30.780
I myself will be doing this upgrade

44:30.780 --> 44:32.840
after enough of you throw yourselves on the sword

44:32.840 --> 44:33.680
testing this.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.480
I'm not going to try this one myself.

44:36.480 --> 44:40.400
I don't need to break the last remaining Neon systems I have.

44:40.400 --> 44:43.520
And in their post on community.kd.org,

44:43.520 --> 44:47.660
they say it's likely to break your system right now.

44:47.660 --> 44:49.760
And it's gotten better over the last few days.

44:49.760 --> 44:52.920
I've been following the Telegram conversation around this.

44:52.920 --> 44:54.940
It's a full-fledged upgrade.

44:54.940 --> 44:58.680
And I advise caution.

44:58.680 --> 45:01.640
But if you're willing to try it so that way I don't have to,

45:01.640 --> 45:03.360
it's available for you.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.640
Brian, what desktop environment are you on over there?

45:05.640 --> 45:06.960
Are you a gnome guy?

45:06.960 --> 45:08.200
Oh, no.

45:08.200 --> 45:08.840
KDE.

45:08.840 --> 45:09.800
Really?

45:09.800 --> 45:12.480
And that's actually a recent thing for me.

45:12.480 --> 45:16.400
I was on, and don't hold me against this

45:16.400 --> 45:18.240
if you feel strongly about it, but I

45:18.240 --> 45:19.600
was doing Cinnamon for a long time

45:19.600 --> 45:22.280
and suggesting that to a lot of people.

45:22.280 --> 45:28.880
But I've had my eye on KDE since forever, maybe 10 years,

45:28.880 --> 45:31.560
and just sort of tracking what they were doing.

45:31.560 --> 45:33.480
And I felt like, OK, I'm going to jump.

45:33.480 --> 45:36.040
So about a year ago, sure enough, did that.

45:36.040 --> 45:39.400
And like you are discovering now, there's no looking back.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.160
I'm really enjoying it.

45:41.160 --> 45:42.300
It's just super slick.

45:42.300 --> 45:43.880
It does exactly what I need.

45:43.880 --> 45:47.040
It does a lot more, but it just gets out of the way.

45:47.040 --> 45:48.360
And so that's me.

45:48.360 --> 45:51.120
I, for some reason, did not know that.

45:51.120 --> 45:53.160
Last time I talked, I don't know if that came up.

45:53.160 --> 45:54.960
But that's interesting to hear.

45:54.960 --> 45:59.000
Because you were using, let's see, when you were here at JB,

45:59.000 --> 46:03.680
you did use a KDE desktop to do the photo stuff, as I recall.

46:03.680 --> 46:04.280
Right at home.

46:04.280 --> 46:05.320
Yeah.

46:05.320 --> 46:06.640
I hadn't even thought about it.

46:06.640 --> 46:08.560
That's why I didn't complain about it.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.720
Yeah, it's funny you didn't.

46:09.720 --> 46:11.960
You just got right to work, actually.

46:11.960 --> 46:14.480
I got a link in the show notes for you guys to check out.

46:14.480 --> 46:17.160
It's just worth mentioning.

46:17.160 --> 46:20.160
There's not really a lot to it, but Google

46:20.160 --> 46:24.320
has completely ignored Windows in their release of a VR video

46:24.320 --> 46:27.160
editor, a virtual reality video editor.

46:27.160 --> 46:30.920
It's mostly for 180 perspective video.

46:30.920 --> 46:35.920
But they released it for Linux and Mac, but not

46:35.920 --> 46:38.880
Windows for a VR video editor.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.360
Now, what does that mean?

46:40.360 --> 46:41.360
Maybe nothing.

46:41.360 --> 46:41.960
Maybe nothing.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.560
But I thought it was worth mentioning.

46:43.560 --> 46:46.480
And if you're interested in grabbing a VR editor,

46:46.480 --> 46:49.200
maybe like Wimpy might be, go check the show notes.

46:49.200 --> 46:50.680
I'll have a link there.

46:50.680 --> 46:54.160
But Brent, you sent me this link to DigitalOcean's post

46:54.160 --> 46:58.760
about cracking the Enigma encryption in 13 minutes

46:58.760 --> 47:00.580
using 2,000 droplets.

47:00.580 --> 47:02.640
How great is this post?

47:02.640 --> 47:05.040
How great is this post, Brent?

47:05.040 --> 47:10.600
This entire post, and I have to say I came to it

47:10.600 --> 47:12.920
not directly from DigitalOcean, but a roundabout way.

47:12.920 --> 47:14.920
And when I saw that it was a DigitalOcean post,

47:14.920 --> 47:16.920
I thought, jeez, it's even better.

47:16.920 --> 47:21.920
And so this is an article that is wonderfully placed

47:21.920 --> 47:25.800
between the tech lover and everything DigitalOcean

47:25.800 --> 47:27.560
is capable of and more.

47:27.560 --> 47:29.480
It sounds like they pushed the boundaries here,

47:29.480 --> 47:33.080
but also some really neat historical challenges.

47:33.080 --> 47:34.400
Yeah.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.520
Of course, you guys are, when I say the Enigma machine,

47:36.520 --> 47:38.080
I bet you that everybody in the audience

47:38.080 --> 47:39.280
knows what I'm talking about.

47:39.280 --> 47:44.440
It was a complicated encryption system during World War II.

47:44.440 --> 47:48.200
The apparatus consisted of a keyboard, a set of rotors,

47:48.200 --> 47:51.240
an alphabet ring, and plug connections,

47:51.240 --> 47:53.240
all configurable by the operator.

47:53.240 --> 47:55.400
For the message to be both encrypted and decrypted,

47:55.400 --> 47:58.880
both operators had to know the two sets of codes.

47:58.880 --> 48:02.080
A daily base code changed every 24 hours,

48:02.080 --> 48:04.440
which was published monthly by the Germans.

48:04.440 --> 48:07.400
Then each operator created an individual setting

48:07.400 --> 48:10.240
used only for that message.

48:10.240 --> 48:12.360
The key to the individual code was

48:12.360 --> 48:16.040
sent in the first character of the message in a coded,

48:16.040 --> 48:18.080
and it was coded in the base.

48:18.080 --> 48:22.520
That then created over 53 billion possible combinations

48:22.520 --> 48:25.360
that changed every 24 hours.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.600
Because of this, the machine was widely

48:27.600 --> 48:29.160
considered unbreakable.

48:29.160 --> 48:33.040
Now, as you know, we did eventually crack it.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.600
Now, it still makes for a great challenge,

48:35.600 --> 48:39.640
especially when you're trying to get AI to crack it.

48:39.640 --> 48:42.240
So Lucas Kunzowicz, which I'm not sure

48:42.240 --> 48:43.780
on the pronunciation there, but he

48:43.780 --> 48:46.380
is the head of a data science division.

48:46.380 --> 48:49.400
He's Polish, and he was working on this problem.

48:49.400 --> 48:55.360
And he decided to recreate the most complicated version

48:55.360 --> 48:58.280
of the Enigma machine, the Nazi's Navy

48:58.280 --> 49:01.360
version of the machine, which was the most sophisticated

49:01.360 --> 49:02.340
iteration.

49:02.340 --> 49:06.720
His team started by recreating the machine's rotors and plugs

49:06.720 --> 49:09.080
in Python.

49:09.080 --> 49:11.440
In Python.

49:11.440 --> 49:13.840
Let's just take a moment and appreciate now

49:13.840 --> 49:17.560
that one of the most famous encryption machines

49:17.560 --> 49:20.400
from World War II has been recreated in Python.

49:20.400 --> 49:21.840
A moment here, if we will.

49:21.840 --> 49:24.400
And he recreated all of these functionalities in Python.

49:24.400 --> 49:26.160
Initially, they tried to teach their AI

49:26.160 --> 49:28.160
to decode the Enigma code itself,

49:28.160 --> 49:29.800
but it just didn't work.

49:29.800 --> 49:33.240
And they also tried to spin up lambda functions from Amazon

49:33.240 --> 49:34.400
to do the computation.

49:34.400 --> 49:40.080
But the problem was, lambda functions were not very quick.

49:40.080 --> 49:42.840
And some of the limits around execution time

49:42.840 --> 49:44.680
bit them in the arse.

49:44.680 --> 49:47.280
So they decided to keep pushing forward.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.040
They started blogging about this.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.800
And somebody at DigitalOcean noticed that this was a thing,

49:51.800 --> 49:54.000
contacted them, and quickly agreed

49:54.000 --> 49:56.400
to provide what they call their ML one-click droplets,

49:56.400 --> 49:59.200
their machine learning one-click droplets.

49:59.200 --> 50:02.400
It's like, you know, this is by one of their R&D engineers

50:02.400 --> 50:03.240
who noticed this.

50:03.240 --> 50:04.520
It's like, this is kind of what we do, guys.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.800
We're kind of like super focused on developers.

50:06.800 --> 50:08.380
You guys are developing code to do this.

50:08.380 --> 50:09.920
Just come over here.

50:09.920 --> 50:11.720
We'll consider this a marketing thing.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.760
So they worked with their R&D engineer.

50:13.760 --> 50:16.640
He set up these machine learning droplets.

50:16.640 --> 50:19.920
And they contacted DigitalOcean's help desk

50:19.920 --> 50:23.840
and said, hey, can you spin us up 1,000 droplets,

50:23.840 --> 50:28.960
1,000 droplets, 1,000 droplets.

50:28.960 --> 50:30.680
And they did it.

50:30.680 --> 50:33.420
They spun up 1,000 droplets for them in a day.

50:33.420 --> 50:35.380
And they call it, they have a cute name for it.

50:35.380 --> 50:36.600
They call it, they hydrated.

50:36.600 --> 50:39.760
They hydrated these droplets in one day.

50:39.760 --> 50:42.040
They hydrated 1,000 droplets.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.280
So it took the team about two weeks

50:44.280 --> 50:47.240
to train the machines to create the Python code.

50:47.240 --> 50:48.860
And then it took another couple of weeks

50:48.860 --> 50:51.560
before they had their first success.

50:51.560 --> 50:54.980
The way they train the machine learning, though, to read

50:54.980 --> 50:58.680
German is kind of weird.

50:58.680 --> 51:02.640
They fed the machine learning children's stories

51:02.640 --> 51:06.560
and a few military telegraphs and things like that.

51:06.560 --> 51:09.840
But fairy tales written in simple language,

51:09.840 --> 51:14.040
like Rumpelstiltskin, Cinderella, Grimm's Fairy

51:14.040 --> 51:19.320
Tales, Hansel and Gretzel, those plus 200 others

51:19.320 --> 51:20.540
were the data set.

51:20.540 --> 51:23.080
They fed the machine learning algorithms

51:23.080 --> 51:25.840
to pattern match German language.

51:25.840 --> 51:28.540
Really, it came down to simple language.

51:28.540 --> 51:32.520
Because these messages were generally short and very simple,

51:32.520 --> 51:37.000
it actually worked to train them on children's books.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.560
And really interestingly, at the end of the day,

51:39.560 --> 51:43.320
the German language wasn't understandable by the AI

51:43.320 --> 51:47.220
in any shape or form, but it could pattern match.

51:47.220 --> 51:48.280
It could pattern match.

51:48.280 --> 51:50.480
And so it didn't need to learn to speak German.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.120
It could pattern match.

51:52.120 --> 51:54.960
So they did that for two weeks.

51:54.960 --> 51:59.360
And they ran the Enigma code through 1,000 droplets.

51:59.360 --> 52:02.120
And after they trained it how to read German, or pattern match,

52:02.120 --> 52:03.800
I guess.

52:03.800 --> 52:06.200
And they threw 1,000 droplets at it.

52:06.200 --> 52:08.720
After 24 hours, they broke the Enigma code.

52:08.720 --> 52:10.960
And they were able to read the message.

52:10.960 --> 52:12.520
And that was interesting.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.160
That's not bad.

52:14.160 --> 52:17.120
But what if we threw another 1,000 droplets at it?

52:17.120 --> 52:22.520
What if we had 2,000 droplets to break this code?

52:22.520 --> 52:25.960
Once they threw 2,000 droplets, they

52:25.960 --> 52:31.520
were able to crack the code in 13 minutes, 13 minutes.

52:31.520 --> 52:34.800
But if you think about it, and this is the author.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.880
He says, you really have to accept the fact

52:36.880 --> 52:39.200
that even if you have 2,000 droplets,

52:39.200 --> 52:42.040
you still have billions of combinations to be checked.

52:42.040 --> 52:44.720
And the neural network that we used

52:44.720 --> 52:47.600
is really only good at spotting German language patterns.

52:47.600 --> 52:49.200
It's not a speed demon.

52:49.200 --> 52:51.440
And because it uses recurrence, which

52:51.440 --> 52:54.160
gives us a boost when dealing with languages,

52:54.160 --> 52:57.120
but you pay with calculation time.

52:57.120 --> 53:01.960
So for the AI to shine, we actually had to use 2,000

53:01.960 --> 53:04.000
droplets to do all the tedious work.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.240
Everybody praises AI.

53:06.240 --> 53:10.560
But it was actually the droplets that did 99% of the work.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.120
Like, right?

53:12.120 --> 53:14.840
We wrote one minion in Python.

53:14.840 --> 53:18.000
And then DigitalOcean has a very nice API for storing images.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.280
So you create one minion.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.600
And then you tell DigitalOcean, create this as an image.

53:21.600 --> 53:24.420
And then please, go create 2,000 copies of this image.

53:24.420 --> 53:25.560
And it's off.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.320
The code simply just runs.

53:27.320 --> 53:29.380
But because we could add more systems,

53:29.380 --> 53:31.040
it meant there was no state.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.840
They were not coordinated in any way.

53:32.840 --> 53:35.620
Each minion doesn't know anything about the others.

53:35.620 --> 53:37.980
They're fully autonomous.

53:37.980 --> 53:39.240
And that's great.

53:39.240 --> 53:41.600
Because it means we can have 200.

53:41.600 --> 53:43.200
We can have 2,000.

53:43.200 --> 53:46.680
We can even have 20,000 of them.

53:46.680 --> 53:48.800
The more we have, the less time that it

53:48.800 --> 53:51.600
takes to break the Enigma code.

53:51.600 --> 53:52.360
Wow.

53:52.360 --> 53:53.720
And the hard numbers here?

53:53.720 --> 53:57.600
The 2,000 virtual servers ran through 41 million combinations

53:57.600 --> 53:58.560
per second.

53:58.560 --> 54:04.000
It took them 13 minutes for the minions to do the work.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.240
That's a lot of Python.

54:07.240 --> 54:08.280
That's a good one, Brent.

54:08.280 --> 54:10.520
I love how they call the servers minions.

54:10.520 --> 54:11.640
Yeah, that's good.

54:11.640 --> 54:12.280
That's good.

54:12.280 --> 54:14.600
And it really shows you how easily

54:14.600 --> 54:17.120
that these things are going to be cracked in the future.

54:17.120 --> 54:20.120
When you can just deploy 2,000 droplets,

54:20.120 --> 54:22.560
it's just a whole other game.

54:22.560 --> 54:23.920
It's really a whole other game.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.920
Why don't we mention DigitalOcean right here,

54:25.920 --> 54:26.440

54:38.440 --> 54:43.120
It's a way to get infrastructure on demand.

54:43.120 --> 54:44.280
Now, I could tell you that.

54:44.280 --> 54:46.560
But why not have the professionals

54:46.560 --> 54:49.760
with great voices tell you?

54:49.760 --> 54:52.040

55:58.360 --> 56:02.120
They have a great setup with a fantastic dashboard.

56:02.120 --> 56:05.160
Also, a big thank you to DigitalOcean

56:05.160 --> 56:08.200
for sponsoring the Unplugged program now for years.

56:08.200 --> 56:10.960
And while I'm giving out thanks, let me thank Linux Academy,

56:10.960 --> 56:13.860
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

56:13.860 --> 56:16.160
That's where you go to learn more about their platform

56:16.160 --> 56:18.620
and sign up for a free seven-day trial.

56:18.620 --> 56:19.960
It's everything you need to learn

56:19.960 --> 56:22.560
about Linux and all of the stuff that runs Linux.

56:22.560 --> 56:24.360
And if you've been a subscriber for a while,

56:24.360 --> 56:26.400
buckle up, because your membership

56:26.400 --> 56:29.080
is going to get way more valuable.

56:29.080 --> 56:33.020
In July, they're launching 150 new challenges and content

56:33.020 --> 56:34.120
and courses.

56:34.120 --> 56:36.120
And some of the new topics they're launching

56:36.120 --> 56:37.520
are going to get your attention.

56:37.520 --> 56:39.800
I know you've been thinking about security a lot lately.

56:39.800 --> 56:42.080
So have I, and so has Linux Academy.

56:42.080 --> 56:43.000
And they're stepping up.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.040
They're also helping you get a salt stack certification

56:46.040 --> 56:48.360
and the Red Hat certification of expertise

56:48.360 --> 56:51.480
in virtualization and architect full support.

56:51.480 --> 56:54.560
They also have an AWS security specialist certification

56:54.560 --> 56:59.480
courseware now and, speaking of Lambda, a Lambda deep dive.

56:59.480 --> 57:04.800
And that's like four things out of over 150 new things

57:04.800 --> 57:06.880
that are launching at Linux Academy.

57:06.880 --> 57:07.760
They're going crazy.

57:07.760 --> 57:08.440
They're going nuts.

57:08.440 --> 57:09.840
Linux Academy is blowing out the doors.

57:09.840 --> 57:12.680
Crazy Linux Academy is going to give away a seven-day free trial

57:12.680 --> 57:15.560
when you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

57:15.560 --> 57:18.520
Now, they're doing a live stream to celebrate the big giveaway.

57:18.520 --> 57:23.280
And I just am super nervous about this.

57:23.280 --> 57:26.080
In fact, I'm going to fly down to Linux Academy.

57:26.080 --> 57:27.320
They're going to pay for it.

57:27.320 --> 57:28.780
But I'm going to fly down there to help

57:28.780 --> 57:31.820
make sure the stream goes well because it's all on Linux.

57:31.820 --> 57:33.960
It's the whole new OBS setup that I did for them.

57:33.960 --> 57:36.460
And now they're going to do this big content

57:36.460 --> 57:38.960
launch on the OBS system.

57:38.960 --> 57:42.380
I'm a little nervous, but I'm also crazy, crazy excited

57:42.380 --> 57:44.700
because I've heard what they're working on.

57:44.700 --> 57:46.200
I saw the effort.

57:46.200 --> 57:49.440
And I'm going to go down there because they're not

57:49.440 --> 57:51.520
paying me to do it other than paying for my flight

57:51.520 --> 57:54.200
because I just really am excited about what they're doing.

57:54.200 --> 57:55.660
I think it's great.

57:55.660 --> 57:57.440
And it's going to bring even more people

57:57.440 --> 57:58.940
into Linux and open source.

57:58.940 --> 58:00.840
So linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

58:00.840 --> 58:02.320
where you go to get started.

58:02.320 --> 58:04.160
And then you can also read over on their blog

58:04.160 --> 58:06.240
about all of the new stuff that's coming.

58:06.240 --> 58:07.760
It's a big, big deal.

58:07.760 --> 58:09.880
And I'm going to be there to help them announce it all

58:09.880 --> 58:11.440
and grok it all.

58:11.440 --> 58:13.920
So if you're in the Texas area, I'm

58:13.920 --> 58:16.920
going to be there again in about a week or two, about two weeks.

58:16.920 --> 58:18.920
Because the big announcement, the big live stream

58:18.920 --> 58:19.720
is on July 10.

58:19.720 --> 58:23.800
And I'm going to get down there around the 8th or so

58:23.800 --> 58:24.880
in the Dallas area.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.880
And I'm going to need to have dinner on the 9th.

58:26.880 --> 58:30.680
So if you're in the area and want to get dinner July 9th,

58:30.680 --> 58:31.280
let me know.

58:31.280 --> 58:36.820
I'll be in the Dallas Keller area, Fort Worth, really.

58:36.820 --> 58:37.400
Let's do it.

58:37.400 --> 58:38.800
Because I'm going down there again

58:38.800 --> 58:39.920
to make sure this thing's a success.

58:39.920 --> 58:42.600
Because damn if I'm not going to switch a company to Linux

58:42.600 --> 58:43.680
and then not back it up.

58:43.680 --> 58:46.380
So I hope you tune in live to watch how it all goes.

58:46.380 --> 58:48.800
And if you're a Linux Academy subscriber or if you're not one

58:48.800 --> 58:50.480
yet, go check it out, linuxacademy.com

58:50.480 --> 58:51.640
slash unplugged.

58:51.640 --> 58:55.800
Also, a huge thank you to Ting for making my entire road trip

58:55.800 --> 58:57.640
to Texas and back possible.

58:57.640 --> 58:58.960
I'm in Seattle again.

58:58.960 --> 59:02.100
And the month that I was away doing shows on the road

59:02.100 --> 59:03.280
was powered by Ting.

59:03.280 --> 59:05.220
They have a CDMA and a GSM network.

59:05.220 --> 59:07.800
And damn if I didn't leverage the hell out of that.

59:07.800 --> 59:11.040
It's $6 a month for what you want, just one line.

59:11.040 --> 59:12.640
Boom, $6 a month.

59:12.640 --> 59:15.680
Then you just pay for your usage on top

59:15.680 --> 59:18.720
of that, your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

59:18.720 --> 59:21.320
However much you talk, text, and data you use, you pay for.

59:21.320 --> 59:22.700
It's a fair price regardless.

59:22.700 --> 59:24.160
And they have nationwide coverage.

59:24.160 --> 59:25.860
And like I said, they've got two networks.

59:25.860 --> 59:28.320
So there's a lot of devices you can bring.

59:28.320 --> 59:30.020
Check their BYOD page.

59:30.020 --> 59:32.720
There's no contracts, no service agreements,

59:32.720 --> 59:35.160
or no weird loopholes where they try to get you

59:35.160 --> 59:36.400
for a couple of years.

59:36.400 --> 59:38.200
And they've got the best control panel

59:38.200 --> 59:40.040
in the business for mobile.

59:40.040 --> 59:42.520
So check it out by going to linux.ting.com.

59:42.520 --> 59:44.880
That'll take $25 off your first device.

59:44.880 --> 59:47.800
Oh, and it'll give you $25 in service credit

59:47.800 --> 59:48.760
if you bring a device.

59:48.760 --> 59:51.280
And they've got a lot of compatible devices.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.800
I'm just saying.

59:52.800 --> 59:56.420
Now every now and then, Crazy Ting has a crazy deal.

59:56.420 --> 59:59.000
And they're blowing out the doors right now with $1 SIM

59:59.000 --> 59:59.720
cards.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.480
I'm serious.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.040
This is it.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.280
This is what no one I tell you about all the time.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.200
Go buy 10 of them.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.280
Seriously, go buy 10 of them.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.560
Why not?

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.680
They're a dollar a SIM card.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.880
And they don't even charge you until you activate them.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.200
And then when you do activate them, they're $6.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:19.280
So both Noah and I load up on these suckers.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.680
I just bought five of them.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:21.720
Go buy 10 of them.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.600
Seriously.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.360
I bought five of them because I'm poor.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:27.940
But if you can afford 10 bucks, go buy 10 of them.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.480
Because you can put them in your bag.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.520
You can hand them out to people.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.400
You're in an event.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:34.100
Nothing says a baller like you're handing out data.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.540
So go get the GSM SIM.

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.480
Go get the CDMA SIM, whatever you're about.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.320
I don't care.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.760
But the $1 deal on the Ting SIMs is about once a year.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.520
And hallelujah, it is here.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.720
So go grab it.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.040
But first, start by going to linux.ting.com.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.280
linux.ting.com.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.000
So a big thank you to DigitalOcean,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.760
a big thank you to Linux Academy,

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.920
and a big thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com,

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:03.280
for sponsoring this here episode of your unplugged program,

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.120
linux.ting.com.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.080
All right, back to the news we go.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.440
Brent, have you noticed the uptick in positive coverage

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.960
around Firefox OS?

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.200
I have in the show notes a link to a New York Times article.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.960
Headline, Firefox is back.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.560
It's time to give it a try.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.520
In the freaking New York Times, Brent.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.680
How about that?

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.040
You sent me this article, and I didn't think it was real.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:29.640
But I love it.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.120
I love it.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:30.960
It's great.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.320
That's a funny way to put it.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.120
Yeah, when I first saw it, too, I was like,

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.640
that's not the New York Times.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.160
That's something else.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.120
Yeah, and they make the case.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.480
They talk about how the web has become a dumpster fire.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.920
Of course, they have a bit of an interest

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.760
there as an advertising-based company.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.780
But they say Mozilla recently hit the reset button

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.200
on Firefox about two years ago.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.800
Again, this is the freaking gray lady here.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.440
About two years ago, six Mozilla employees

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.940
were huddled around a bonfire one night

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.280
in Santa Cruz, California, when they

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.800
begun discussing the state of web browsers.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.560
Eventually, they concluded there was a crisis of confidence

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.880
in the web.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.040
They write, if they don't trust the web,

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.360
they won't use the web.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.780
That was Mozilla's chief product officer.

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.120
They just felt to us like, actually, it

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.080
might be the direction we're going, that people

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.280
might stop using the web.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.040
So we started to think about tools and architectures that

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.280
brought a different approach.

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.960
Now Firefox is back there, right?

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.760
Mozilla released a new version late last year,

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.840
codenamed Quantum.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.080
It's sleekly designed and fast.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.120
Mozilla said the revamped Firefox

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.840
consumes less memory than the competition,

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.440
meaning you can fire up lots of tabs,

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.160
and browsing will still feel butterly smooth.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.680
That's about as positive as it could possibly

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.440
get when you got the old gray lady writing about a web

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.760
browser, don't you think, Brent?

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.840
That doesn't get any better.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.080
It feels to me like it's not actually the New York

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.200
Times that wrote that.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.200
And they just write it.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.480
It feels like, oh, yeah, oh, this is easy content,

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.480
feels really good.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.200
And we're getting an audience that we don't typically get.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.040
So maybe it's a win for everyone.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.680
The Verge has got a podcast.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.400
And in their podcast, they had an interview

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.720
with the Pocket CEO.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:16.360
Pocket, as everybody knows, is baked into Firefox now.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.360
So Nate Wiener went on the new Verge podcast, the Converge

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.600
podcast, and he said that they're

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.720
going to try something radical, something new, something

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.760
unheard of in the industry.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.000
They're going to process your local data

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.760
to figure out what you like.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.680
What?

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.720
By analyzing the articles and videos people save into Pocket,

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.720
Wiener believes the company can show people

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:42.080
the best of the web in a personalized way

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.120
without building an all-knowing Facebook-style profile

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.200
of the user.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.980
They call it a personalization system within Firefox.

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:53.380
And I grabbed a clip from that interview in the Verge

01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:54.200
podcast.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.120
Yeah, we're testing this really cool personalization system

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.480
within Firefox, where it uses your browser history

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.760
to target, like, personalize, but none of that data

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:07.280
actually comes back to Pocket or Mozilla.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:10.440
It all happens on the client inside the browser itself.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.440
Because there is this notion today, I feel like, that,

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.960
and I feel like you saw it in the Zuckerberg hearings.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.760
It was like, oh, users, they will give us

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.960
their data in return for a better experience.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.040
And there's like, that's the premise, right?

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.440
But I feel like, yes, you could do that,

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.720
but we don't feel like that is the required premise,

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.640
that there are ways to build these things where

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.240
you don't have to trade your life profile in order

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.760
to actually get a good experience.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.360
Oh, if that isn't music to my ears.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.640
So they can use what people are saving

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.600
to Pocket and your local browsing history

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.760
and do the computation on device, which he goes on

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.920
to say later in the interview is how they're doing it.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.880
They're looking at your web browsing history

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.560
on your device, all local.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.400
None of it's being sent to Mozilla and comparing that

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.240
with what people are sharing in Pocket,

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.200
or saving, I should say, in Pocket.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:05.760
And without ever having to build a huge online profile of you,

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.240
they're able to determine what you might be interested in.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.320
I love this.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.320
I know Pocket is controversial, Brent, but I love this.

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:17.360
It sounds almost like they're pushing in the right directions.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.760
It's a nice mix of features that they're offering the user,

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.680
but also some privacy consciousness that

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.240
is refreshing, really.

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.040
Yeah.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.680
Yeah.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.640
It shouldn't be.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.880
You know what I mean?

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:31.600
At this point.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.600
It should be the standard, right?

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.120
Yeah.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:33.720
It should be.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.520
But it does feel refreshing.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.040
That's a good way to put it.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.200
Speaking of refreshing, Debian has been refreshed.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.320
There is an update out there for those of you

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.640
still using Debian 8, Jesse.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.440
Now, this is the last release.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.040
It's the end of the line for Jesse.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.320
So this is your public service announcement right here

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.200
on the show.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.440
I know.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.320
I know it's working fine for you, and you love it.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.160
But look, your buddy Chris is just the messenger.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.640
It's time to move on.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.720
Why not upgrade to Debian 9, perhaps?

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.440
Now, the 8.11 release has a number

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.680
of bug fixes and security issues,

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.160
and it's shipping a new Nvidia graphics driver.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.520
So you get some life out of it, but it's the end of the line.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.720
It's really time for those of you still running Debian Jesse

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.280
to upgrade to version 9.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.680
Because really, in terms of Debian,

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.880
10 is just around the corner.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.480
Buster is kind of tentatively scheduled for a release

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.920
from a year from now.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:31.120
So it's time to upgrade on the Debian scale of things.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.620
Now, I don't think there's much wrong with MP3 these days.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:35.760
Now that the patents have expired,

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.280
I'm more of a fan of MP3 than I ever have been.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.840
You combine that with the crazy industry support from services

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.440
to hardware that MP3 seems to enjoy,

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.920
it's never going to be replaced.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.600
Even when something better comes along, perhaps like Opus.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:56.240
However, there is still a gap in the market for audiobooks

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:01.120
or really long podcasts, two, three, four-hour podcasts,

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.420
or longer.

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.920
There's not a good codec for that.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.760
Opus isn't great for it either.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.800
And our friends over at Alphonic,

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.040
which I'm going to tell you more about here in a moment,

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.800
you can find it at A-U-P-H-O-N-I-C.com.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.120
Alphonic, it's German.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.560
They have an idea called Codec 2.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:24.840
Codec 2 is an open source designed for speech,

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:29.640
and it aims for compression rates between 700 bits

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:34.400
per second all the way up to 3,200 bits per second.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.160
So it's really, really low bandwidth.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.700
The man behind it is David Rowe.

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.600
He's an electronics engineer currently

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.280
living in South Australia.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.060
He started the project in September of 2009,

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:50.120
with the main aim of improving low cost radio

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:54.040
communications for people living in remote areas of the world.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.520
With this in mind, he set out to develop

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.840
a codec that would significantly reduce

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.440
file sizes and bandwidth required when streaming.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.080
Let's check in some boxes.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.740
Rowe's perceived applications included VoIP trunking,

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:14.280
voiceover low bandwidth, HF and VHF digital radios,

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:17.880
as well as worldwide remote area communications,

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.040
including military, police, and emergency services.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.480
But Alphonic believes that it could

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.920
be used for long podcasts, presentations,

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.440
like talks at events, and audio books,

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.480
allowing for low storage and minimizing the effect

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.680
of bad network connections.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.120
I think this is great, and I want

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.120
to tell you why I'm giving this so much credence.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.120
It's from Alphonic.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:46.080
And these guys, they really know audio.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.960
They know audio so well that at the beginning of this year,

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.680
I switched out the entire Jupiter broadcasting backend

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.900
encoding system to Alphonic.

01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:59.240
You probably noticed this maybe if you have a really tuned ear.

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.320
Our compression has sounded better recently

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.840
in the last three or four months.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:04.760
You've also probably noticed chapter markers

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.040
in our podcasts, like this very here podcast.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.520
Chapter markers and those features.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.720
Also, the new YouTube videos that YouTubers don't really

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.720
like, but the ones that are automatically generated

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.980
with our album art that get published to YouTube

01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:20.160
automatically from the main edited podcast file.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:23.200
All of that is powered by Alphonic,

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.400
the service we are using now.

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:29.280
And that was the final piece that made us 100% Linux, too,

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.140
by the way.

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.640
I do plan to document all of this

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.840
at some point for the studio.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.640
But the last bit, when we converted the entire studio

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.680
over to Linux, was we still had a Mac in the role of editing

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.600
and encoding for commercial software purposes for editing

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.280
and encoding purposes for software

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.480
that could add chapter markers.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.520
We were able to convert the editing,

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.760
and now we have been able to convert

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.480
the encoding using Alphonic.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.640
And I can tell you, as somebody who's been encoding podcasts

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:03.000
for 13 years, these guys have a great algorithm.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.360
They have a great sound.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:05.680
They have a great system.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.320
It's a super good service that does way more than just

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.760
encode and upload video.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.240
It does way more than that.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.960
And if you're a podcaster, and you're

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.160
struggling with chapter markers, and you're

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.180
struggling with audio encoding, and you

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:23.320
want to publish to YouTube and SFTP and other services

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:28.520
like Libsyn, check out Alphonic, A-U-P-H-O-N-I-C.com.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.560
Not open source, but the back end runs on Linux,

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.840
and they make it possible for us Linux podcasters

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.600
to do a complete 100% Linux solution.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.520
And now they're throwing their weight

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.480
behind Codec 2, the podcast on a floppy disk codec.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:43.560
I'm all about it.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.000
I love Opus.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.380
I love MP3.

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:47.960
I even think AAC is great.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.760
But there is room for that audio book length

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.360
podcast or audio book that is just super long, four

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.600
plus hours.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.320
That's where our current codecs just kind of fall down.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:10:59.920
What do you think, Brent?

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.040
Am I crazy, or is this something you've run into yourself?

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.800
Well, some thoughts I had around that

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.440
was building giant libraries for ourselves.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.720
If we're collecting content, especially audio books

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.920
are getting everywhere these days.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:14.400
And sometimes that's the limit on some of these devices

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.840
that we own is space.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:18.680
And so if you're able to hold, let's say,

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.120
a whole year's library worth of books,

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.320
audio books, on the devices that you take on a plane

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.720
or something like that, then all of a sudden you

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.400
don't need to buy devices as often,

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.120
perhaps, if that's your main limitation.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.840
I know a lot of standard everyday users.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.320
Fair enough, fair enough, yeah.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:37.640
Yeah, you just want to have your own big library of,

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.280
I probably own 300 Audible books.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.880
And it's not lost on me that they're all wrapped up

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.800
in the Audible DRM.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.560
If there was a solution that wasn't Windows based

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.960
to rip that DRM out, I'd probably rip it out and just

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.880
store them somewhere.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.320
And if I had a codec that was better for keeping them

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.520
long term, I absolutely would use it.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.840
So that's a great point.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.680
We're almost done.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.600
Just one last story for the day.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:04.440
I wanted to talk about GitLab because after Microsoft's

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.520
purchase of GitHub, it's been a huge, huge topic

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.840
of conversation.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.160
And without missing a beat this week,

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.800
GitLab announced that they're moving off of Azure

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.320
and they're switching to Google Cloud, which

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.280
I think makes a lot of sense.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:25.280
But they've also released their auto DevOps management system.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.680
Now, that sounds fancy, right?

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.560
Auto DevOps?

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.920
I didn't know what it meant.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.080
So I had an opportunity in last week's Coda Radio,

01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.360
episode 313, to ask the GitLab CEO what

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.080
is auto DevOps in our interview with him.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.360
And here's what he had to say.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.920
Now, a little birdie tells me, speaking

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.800
of some of those features, that there's

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.840
something called auto DevOps that's coming along.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:49.240
And I was wondering if you could share little details

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:50.960
about auto DevOps.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.960
Yeah, so we're really, really bullish on auto DevOps.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:00.560
On a week from now, June 22, we'll release GitLab 11.0.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:03.800
And auto DevOps will be generally available.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.160
And what you do is you just push your code

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.720
and GitLab does the rest.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:12.880
It will build your code, run your tests, check the quality,

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.640
do static application security testing, dependency scanning,

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.040
license management, container scanning.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:20.560
It will boot up a review app, kind

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.440
of like a staging environment, per merge request,

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:27.240
dynamic application security testing, and deploy it.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.120
It will do browser performance testing,

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.840
and it will do monitoring of all the vital metrics.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.480
So all of that just by pushing your code,

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.280
nothing to configure.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.120
We think that is the future, and we're

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:41.360
really excited about having it out to the world.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.800
Doesn't that sound fascinating?

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.400
They're just hustling.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.120
It was a great interview we had with the GitLab CEO.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.720
Go check out coder.show slash 313

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.360
if you'd like to get the entire thing.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.760
Sid is really sharp.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.000
He talks about how 100% of the GitLab staff are remote.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.400
And of course, because it would be negligent if I didn't,

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.560
I asked him what his thoughts were on the whole Microsoft

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.860
purchasing GitHub thing and how that is going

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:10.760
to affect GitLab long term.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:14.080
So again, go check that out, coder.show slash 313

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.520
if you want to hear that full interview.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.600
Brent, man, thank you for making it today.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.740
I don't know what your availability looks like,

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:22.360
but if you are around next Tuesday,

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.720
I would more than be happy to have you join us again.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.000
I don't see any reason not to hang out

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:26.920
with everybody on Tuesdays.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:27.420
Atta boy.

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:27.920
You know what?

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.080
Everybody, everybody, everybody should have that philosophy.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.400
In fact, you could.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.080
If you go over to our IRC room, you can get the secret details.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.560
But if you just Google Jupiter colony mumble,

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.800
you'll probably find it.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.560
But if you're in our IRC room, irc.geekshed.net pound

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.960
hashtag Jupiter broadcasting, you can chat during the show,

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.240
and you can also do bang mumble and get the mumble info.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.040
And then you can join our virtual lug,

01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.760
just like many folks did, like Ian and Dusty and many others.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.040
You can find out all of that at the Jupiter colony site

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.280
or in our IRC chat room.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.480
We do this show live on a Tuesday.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.280
You're more than welcome to join us.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.840
Get it converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.720
slash calendar.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.600
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.640
Links to everything we talked about at linuxunplug.com,

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.920
as well as our subscribe links.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.880
Thanks for being here.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.680
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:49.040
Bye.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:56.480
Oh, there we go, Brent.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:01.000
We're officially in over, or not overtime, in post-show.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Overtime's for something else.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.840
Thank you, sir, for making it.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.840
Appreciate it.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.440
Now we need everybody to go to JBtitles.com and vote their heart out, because there's

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:12.680
a lot of good titles, 36 titles over there.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:13.680
There's some good ones.

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:18.480
Fedora to the core, at a drop of a hat, contained in a pocket.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.000
Get your pocket, quantum is a sign of the times.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.320
Oh, get it?

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.320
Do you get it?

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.320
That's good, right?

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:28.880
That's so good.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:34.840
I got to make good, I want to do on the show, because there's so many web apps we use these

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:40.640
days that I never, ever, ever have talked about Netafire, and it is a wrong that I must

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.240
write right now.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.740
It's NPM, so you got to have all the NPM stuff installed, which is pretty straightforward

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:49.300
these days, on any given Linux distro.

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:53.720
But it's called Netafire, and it does exactly what you're probably guessing, is it takes

01:16:53.720 --> 01:17:01.520
like a web application and makes it a standalone, like Node.js style, Electron app.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.520
Catch your breath.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:08.380
So take for example, you want to take Google Docs, or in my case, IRC Cloud, or something

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:13.440
else that you always have to use in the damn browser, and you'd like to just have it as

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.560
a standalone application on your desktop that gets its own taskbar entry.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:22.560
That's where Netafire comes in, and it's just NPM installed, Netafire-G, I'll have a link

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.200
in the show notes, it's solid.

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.160
I've been using it now for months to run IRC Cloud, to run Source Connect, to run a whole

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.440
bunch of other stuff.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:36.760
I just want to give it a plug right now, Netafire, if you're stuck using web applications that

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.320
you really would rather have their own damn desktop entry, check out Netafire.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:43.640
I think it's pretty good stuff.
