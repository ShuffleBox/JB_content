WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
Well, now that we're streaming video versions over on Jupiter.Tube, we clearly got up our

00:04.480 --> 00:11.620
fashion game and Microsoft, well, they're stepping up with $150 tech pants.

00:11.620 --> 00:14.160
You have to see this link in the show notes.

00:14.160 --> 00:20.060
It's the hardware designed just for the Xbox Gear Shop and they're really leaning hard

00:20.060 --> 00:29.480
into the Windows XP retro look with big comfy sweatpants and sweatshirts and even $150 pants.

00:29.480 --> 00:30.480
Sweatpants?

00:30.480 --> 00:32.320
I think these are screaming your name.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.720
Well, I mean, they are.

00:33.720 --> 00:40.520
Let me just quote here, cargo pants are my go-to item as a creative, said creative director

00:40.520 --> 00:41.960
Gavin Matthew.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.420
And who can argue with that, right?

00:43.420 --> 00:48.780
Like as a creative myself here making the show, I got to have a spot for all my gadgets

00:48.780 --> 01:04.080
and I really like to pay a premium to Microsoft while I'm at it.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.280
Hello friends and welcome back to your fashionable weekly talk show.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.280
My name is Chris.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.640
My name is Wes.

01:11.640 --> 01:12.840
My name is Fred.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.240
Hello gentlemen.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.880
We have a great show today.

01:15.880 --> 01:19.200
We're comfortable in our pants and we're going to bust a myth.

01:19.200 --> 01:24.760
Conventional wisdom tells us KDE neon just doesn't make for a great stable workstation.

01:24.760 --> 01:27.160
You shouldn't use it as your daily driver, they say.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.960
Well, this week we're going to see if we can debunk that myth.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.280
We're going to put it to the test.

01:32.280 --> 01:35.280
Maybe we do debunk it, but maybe we don't.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.960
So you'll have to stay tuned for that.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.680
Plus, I got my hands on the Steam Deck.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.600
It's here and I've dug into it.

01:42.600 --> 01:45.560
Does it make the ultimate portable Linux PC?

01:45.560 --> 01:49.840
Will I be broadcasting from the road using my Steam Deck?

01:49.840 --> 01:50.840
I'll share my thoughts on that.

01:50.840 --> 01:55.200
And of course, we'll round out the show with some great boosts, our picks, and a lot more.

01:55.200 --> 01:59.760
So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

01:59.760 --> 02:00.760
Hello Mumble Room.

02:00.760 --> 02:01.760
Hello friends.

02:01.760 --> 02:02.760
Hey, howdy.

02:02.760 --> 02:03.760
Hello Wes.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.760
Hello Fred.

02:04.760 --> 02:05.760
Wow.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.760
Listen to that amazing crew we've got today.

02:08.760 --> 02:12.440
We like to mention that we have the Mumble Room open with details at linuxunplug.com

02:12.440 --> 02:13.440
slash mumble.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.440
If you'd ever like to join.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.480
We've got a quiet listening room if you just would like a high quality Opus low latency

02:18.480 --> 02:21.080
stream and we have the on air.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.760
We just do a quick mic check with you.

02:22.760 --> 02:26.560
And then if everything passes, you can get on there and tag me in the chat room and get

02:26.560 --> 02:28.560
your voice in the show.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.300
Plus, it's a great time to hang out before and after the show too.

02:31.300 --> 02:34.040
We're usually yucking it up with our Mumble Room.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.320
Hey, I want to say good morning to Tail Scale.

02:36.320 --> 02:41.260
Tail Scale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

02:41.260 --> 02:43.640
This is what I always wanted to see happen with WireGuard.

02:43.640 --> 02:44.640
We love it.

02:44.640 --> 02:45.640
We use it.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.300
It's going to change your game.

02:47.300 --> 02:52.520
Go say good morning and try out Tail Scale for 20 devices for free.

02:52.520 --> 02:55.560
Go to TailScale.com and if they ask, tell them we sent you.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.000
Get it for free for 20 devices.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
It'll change your game.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
TailScale.com.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.760
Now, I want to just get a couple of items out of the way on the show skis before we

03:04.760 --> 03:08.880
get into all the content because there's some big things that are coming up in the show.

03:08.880 --> 03:12.480
I guess you could technically call this some housekeeping, but we wanted to get in front

03:12.480 --> 03:20.080
of you that the London meetup is just around the corner, August 5th at 6 PM GMT local time.

03:20.080 --> 03:25.160
We're so excited about it that Brent broke into Alex's house just to kind of, I don't

03:25.160 --> 03:27.160
know, ride on the coattails of the meetup.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.160
What?

03:28.160 --> 03:29.160
It's true.

03:29.160 --> 03:33.840
All his devices were going to be so lonely, so I thought I would have to keep them company.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.240
Someone's got to keep Archie well fed.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.240
Come on.

03:37.240 --> 03:40.680
I think he's just there to drink all the fancy imported gin.

03:40.680 --> 03:44.480
There may still be some donuts and whatnot from our last meetup, so you got to finish

03:44.480 --> 03:47.480
those off too.

03:47.480 --> 03:53.560
Then also coming up just around the corner, July 28th and the 31st is Scale 19X at the

03:53.560 --> 03:58.640
Hilton Las Vegas Airport in Los Angeles, California.

03:58.640 --> 04:04.260
You can get 50% off the already super cheap tickets by using the promo code LAS50, one

04:04.260 --> 04:07.880
word when you get your tickets and you get 50% off.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.280
Hilton Los Angeles, so it's real simple because it's at the airport.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.640
It's July 28th through the 31st at scale.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.560
I will not be going this year because I have a family trip at that time, but I will be

04:17.560 --> 04:22.240
in California just a little bit after that, so if you're in the area and you would like

04:22.240 --> 04:27.920
to say hi, you're going to have an opportunity because our West Coast tour dates have been

04:27.920 --> 04:28.920
announced.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.800
Of course, Linode is making it possible for us to go out and see the West Coast.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.800
It's just time to do it, guys.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.000
We've been to Denver.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.240
We've been to Raleigh.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.240
We're going to be in London.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.200
It's time to go to the West Coast.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.200
Here are the dates.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.280
The meetup pages are rough.

04:43.280 --> 04:48.240
They're minimum viable meetup pages, but we have a meetup scheduled in Southern Oregon

04:48.240 --> 04:49.720
around the Grants Pass area.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.080
Again, we don't have exact locations yet.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.480
That'll be September 20th.

04:54.480 --> 05:02.320
Sacramento in California on September 23rd at 6 PM, and then Southern California probably

05:02.320 --> 05:09.000
in the Pasadena area near JPL after the JPL meetup, but that'll be a separate thing.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.200
So there'll be an open to everybody meetup in the Pasadena area in Southern California

05:14.200 --> 05:16.680
September 30th at 6 PM.

05:16.680 --> 05:22.920
Then on our way north, we're going to stop by Portland, and that'll be on Friday, October

05:22.920 --> 05:23.920
7th.

05:23.920 --> 05:24.920
We'll be in Portland.

05:24.920 --> 05:32.400
Grants Pass area, Southern Oregon, September 20th, Sacramento, September 23rd, Pasadena,

05:32.400 --> 05:35.840
September 30th, Portland, October 7th.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.440
What's not on here is Spokane or Boise.

05:39.440 --> 05:43.680
We're going to attempt to make a trip out to that area at a separate time when I'm getting

05:43.680 --> 05:47.440
some work done on the rig, at least to the Spokane area, so I'll have another meetup.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.160
I'll announce for that.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.920
Also not announced in this batch is the actual JPL tour.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.320
We're going to do a lottery for that.

05:54.320 --> 05:58.520
We'll have a way for you to fill out something that we can then run through and pull out

05:58.520 --> 06:02.800
names for, and we'll probably pick a batch of people so we can have a few backups.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.120
And I'll have that hopefully ready for you next week.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.120
How about that?

06:07.120 --> 06:08.120
Did I get everything out, guys?

06:08.120 --> 06:09.120
Does that all seem clear?

06:09.120 --> 06:13.440
It sounds like it's a real good time to just sign up for our general meetup page so you

06:13.440 --> 06:15.820
don't miss any of this mayhem.

06:15.820 --> 06:16.820
You got it.

06:16.820 --> 06:19.720
And we also have that matrix room, and we'll put a link to that in there too, but we have

06:19.720 --> 06:23.760
a West Coast crew where we're organizing the details on all of this.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.520
We'll have a link hopefully in the show notes for that, and then you can get in there and

06:26.520 --> 06:27.720
interact with us directly.

06:27.720 --> 06:32.040
And then as these dates get closer, we'll become more and more active in that room.

06:32.040 --> 06:35.080
We'll start coordinating more in there and getting specific.

06:35.080 --> 06:40.120
As for the crew, guys, we're going to have an Airbnb down in Pasadena that'll fit about

06:40.120 --> 06:44.720
six of us, so that's where we're going to stay when we get near JPLs.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.080
We'll have another crew Airbnb.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.080
It's got a hot tub.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.120
It's got an outdoor seating area.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.120
Can we have breakfast?

06:51.120 --> 06:53.000
It's got an outdoor cooking area too, Brent.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.080
The first thing I said is we're going to be doing brunch.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.120
Live brunches for everyone.

06:58.120 --> 07:01.160
Can we manage mics around the hot tub without any incidents?

07:01.160 --> 07:02.160
Yeah, shotgun mics.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.160
There you go.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.160
Right?

07:04.160 --> 07:05.160
You mount them a safe distance, shotgun in.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.720
We've got a couple of those.

07:06.720 --> 07:07.840
We could totally make it work.

07:07.840 --> 07:12.360
So details will be up at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for the London meetup

07:12.360 --> 07:17.000
and the West Coast tour, and then later date for the Spokane area meetup, which will be

07:17.000 --> 07:20.160
announced in a separate batch.

07:20.160 --> 07:21.160
That's a lot.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.960
And some actual Linux stuff.

07:23.960 --> 07:29.000
We were going to come on the show today and talk about a really cool project that essentially

07:29.000 --> 07:34.240
turns a Raspberry Pi into a remote video broadcast streamer, and you could use this for all kinds

07:34.240 --> 07:35.240
of things.

07:35.240 --> 07:42.060
Presentations, meetings, podcasting, a way to do video calls, semi-permanent video links

07:42.060 --> 07:43.060
between two locations.

07:43.060 --> 07:44.640
I mean, the list goes on and on.

07:44.640 --> 07:53.120
The idea is a custom Raspberry Pi image and some plumbing under the hood using Gstreamer

07:53.120 --> 07:58.040
and Python that automatically spins up GPU accelerated video streams.

07:58.040 --> 08:03.240
And this was going to be Brent's remote connection this week, and it just didn't quite work out.

08:03.240 --> 08:07.120
We spent some time last night troubleshooting and decided to scratch it.

08:07.120 --> 08:12.760
And so instead, Brent had to spend the night and the early morning setting up a completely

08:12.760 --> 08:21.000
different system, and we decided to take this opportunity to get Brent's renewed experiences

08:21.000 --> 08:26.720
with KDE Neon, because I've been running it here on my system for years.

08:26.720 --> 08:34.800
So I have a very long term look at KDE Neon, and Brent has a very early kind of first impressions

08:34.800 --> 08:36.600
of KDE Neon.

08:36.600 --> 08:41.180
And I think these are going to be two very interesting viewpoints to look at this distro

08:41.180 --> 08:42.220
as a daily driver.

08:42.220 --> 08:49.920
If you're not familiar with KDE Neon, its real primary feature is that it's super current

08:49.920 --> 08:52.340
KDE Plasma desktop.

08:52.340 --> 08:54.000
The dev team is on Neon.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.880
They're releasing on Neon the day that a Plasma desktop update comes out.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.960
When they announce it, it's out in the Neon repos.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.320
It's based on a stable version of Ubuntu that they upgrade over time as major LTS has come

09:07.320 --> 09:15.480
out, so you get a stable Ubuntu base, an LTS Ubuntu base, with a rolling Plasma desktop.

09:15.480 --> 09:19.080
That's kind of like the special value pitch for Neon, and you can probably understand

09:19.080 --> 09:21.340
why I like it for a studio machine.

09:21.340 --> 09:25.000
So when Brent needed to build a system quick at Alex's house last night, and it was a desktop

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
tower, we said, well, let's talk about Neon on the show, because they're about to release

09:30.000 --> 09:35.400
a brand new super fresh and polished version of KDE, and the best way to get your hands

09:35.400 --> 09:38.200
on that kind of stuff is to use Neon.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.400
Yeah, I'm also a huge KDE Plasma fan.

09:41.400 --> 09:47.080
I have been for quite a while now, and I did try Neon, I think it's about three years ago

09:47.080 --> 09:50.560
now when I was considering what to throw in my laptop.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.200
It kind of back then just didn't quite work for me.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.760
I was in a hurry, of course, and so I gave it a quick look.

09:56.760 --> 10:01.800
Some of the updating was different, you know, they suggest you use not apt.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.720
There's some other command that Chris, you might be more familiar with, and that just

10:04.720 --> 10:05.720
like...

10:05.720 --> 10:06.720
TKCon, yeah.

10:06.720 --> 10:07.720
Right.

10:07.720 --> 10:11.800
I would imagine there are some advantages to it that I'm not very experienced with,

10:11.800 --> 10:16.000
but that just like was enough to just turn me off in that hurried state back then.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.720
I'm not a huge fan of it either.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.000
It rides on top of PackageKit.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.520
They prefer you use it.

10:20.520 --> 10:25.000
I think the general feeling there is that apt is starting to have some shortcomings,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.040
but when you relayed that to me, I'm like, I totally know what you mean, man.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.040
Here's what I do, right?

10:29.040 --> 10:31.560
Because of course, of course I found a workaround, right?

10:31.560 --> 10:34.720
Here's what I do is I do apt update, because you can still do that just to update your

10:34.720 --> 10:36.640
package list.

10:36.640 --> 10:41.080
And then when you do apt upgrade, it yells at you, tells you not to do it, and it actually

10:41.080 --> 10:43.040
cancels, it cancels the command on you.

10:43.040 --> 10:47.440
Yeah, that's a bad first user experience from someone who's used to Ubuntu, right?

10:47.440 --> 10:48.440
Nobody wants that.

10:48.440 --> 10:53.360
To be clear, to be clear, not meant for first user or anyone who's not ready for a system

10:53.360 --> 10:54.400
like this.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.400
I'll take that back.

10:55.400 --> 10:59.140
I don't think I'm a new user, but I'm a new user to KDE Neon.

10:59.140 --> 11:03.000
And so there was a nice message there, but I played with it for like 15 minutes trying

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
to get it going.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
And I just couldn't.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.520
And I was like, nah, I'm gonna look at something else.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.940
Now, I'm not saying do what Chris does.

11:08.940 --> 11:12.960
You're giving Brent advice to like get him into trouble before he's even got a chance

11:12.960 --> 11:18.020
to install it the real way, or deal with like any of reading the docs or...

11:18.020 --> 11:20.120
Job one, always log in as root.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.120
That's what I do.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.120
It's fine.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.120
Just fine.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.280
You don't need to be on a private IP either.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.920
Just go and get yourself a public IP.

11:26.920 --> 11:27.920
It's fine.

11:27.920 --> 11:32.040
If you can, sort of rejigger your system so X is running as root as well, and get rid

11:32.040 --> 11:34.280
of Wayland if at all possible.

11:34.280 --> 11:38.320
And I think the best case scenario for performance, always run your Docker daemon as root.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.640
Make sure it's always good to go.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.960
No, actually, what I really think you should try, because it's been fine for me, even though

11:42.960 --> 11:45.720
don't do this, but this is what I would do.

11:45.720 --> 11:50.400
You do an apt update, but then do apt dist upgrade.

11:50.400 --> 11:55.480
And if you're doing a dist upgrade, then it doesn't yell at you about using PKCon.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.480
And it does everything you need anyways.

11:57.480 --> 12:03.440
I mean, it does mean you'll upgrade your distro on accident, maybe, but that's fine.

12:03.440 --> 12:07.600
You know, I bet you the wonderful folks at KD Neon are now thinking, oh, geez, we got

12:07.600 --> 12:08.600
to fix that.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.600
So that comes up with the message now.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.600
Yeah, I know, right?

12:10.600 --> 12:13.160
They're going to write a note, be like, no, guys, you really don't want to do that.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.240
I was going to say, or, dang it, they're talking about us again.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.880
Yeah, that too.

12:17.880 --> 12:22.640
But when I told you that, that gave you the peace of mind to proceed and try it.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.760
I'm assuming it went flawless after that.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.480
As all things do, right?

12:26.480 --> 12:31.480
Yeah, just to give a little background for those who don't know that I'm actually at

12:31.480 --> 12:32.480
Alex's place.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.880
Alex is not here.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.200
That presents a few interesting challenges.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.120
One of them being I don't have all of my normal setup.

12:39.120 --> 12:43.480
The other being an advantage, which is I have all these gadgets to use that I can, you know,

12:43.480 --> 12:45.440
add to my new workflow for the next month.

12:45.440 --> 12:49.100
However, I quickly learned that even if I'm surrounded by a bunch of gadgets doesn't mean

12:49.100 --> 12:52.960
necessarily that I know how they're all connected and even where the power buttons are on some

12:52.960 --> 12:54.160
of these things.

12:54.160 --> 12:59.200
And so it was interesting, but he's got this lovely tower over here that I thought surely

12:59.200 --> 13:02.900
it should do something more useful than only running Windows.

13:02.900 --> 13:07.200
And so he was kind enough to tell me that there was an SSD in there, totally blank,

13:07.200 --> 13:09.520
that I could just throw neon onto.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.940
So I thought we should do that.

13:11.940 --> 13:17.840
One of the, I think, hesitations I had, and you both made me feel better about this, was

13:17.840 --> 13:24.480
the last few times I've installed Linux Ubuntu specifically aside a Windows installation,

13:24.480 --> 13:28.360
it's kind of messed with some of the bootloader stuff and was problematic.

13:28.360 --> 13:31.960
Now I have no evidence whether or not I did screw it up.

13:31.960 --> 13:35.360
We're going to find that out later, but that was one of my hesitations.

13:35.360 --> 13:39.720
So at first I was thinking, you know, I took the case apart, opened it up and I was like,

13:39.720 --> 13:41.920
I'm just going to unplug the serial ATA cable.

13:41.920 --> 13:47.680
But that I think is a, an indication of the type of hardware I'm used to, which is not

13:47.680 --> 13:51.880
exactly super modern hardware, because I had the case open and I was like, there's no cables.

13:51.880 --> 13:56.060
It's all just M.2 drives and stuff.

13:56.060 --> 14:02.000
So I figured I had to do it some other way, which is perhaps more risky.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.120
So I gave it a shot.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.920
So I'm just in the BIOS now.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.160
Thankfully I figured out how to use this keyboard.

14:10.160 --> 14:16.200
It's got like a bunch of modes to switch to different, I guess, Bluetooth devices or whatever.

14:16.200 --> 14:20.600
So I finally got the keyboard working after figuring out how to get the monitor working.

14:20.600 --> 14:24.720
How it is when you're not with your own things.

14:24.720 --> 14:28.240
And now I'm seeing a Linux boot manager being reported here.

14:28.240 --> 14:34.560
So I'm wondering if that SanDisk, that extra SSD, oh, it's a Samsung SSD.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.560
Okay.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.560
So the SanDisk is obviously my USB drive.

14:37.560 --> 14:38.560
Interesting.

14:38.560 --> 14:44.760
So I'm only seeing one of the SanDisk's listed here, but there's two entries for the Linux

14:44.760 --> 14:46.800
boot manager, which is very interesting.

14:46.800 --> 14:53.160
So I wonder if there's already a Linux on there anyways, investigations.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.920
I wonder, are you seeing in there maybe an entry from a previous install that Alex had

14:56.920 --> 14:57.920
on that machine?

14:57.920 --> 15:03.200
I was thinking it might've been that, but the partition manager didn't like show anything.

15:03.200 --> 15:07.040
It showed just like no file system at all on that SSD.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.960
I would assume he wouldn't do that.

15:09.960 --> 15:10.960
He's Alex.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.000
So he would fill a drive as soon as he bought it, but could be, could be.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.640
That has since vanished because of course I've made some progress.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.780
But when you're on a new system, you got to kind of poke around and hopefully not screw

15:19.780 --> 15:20.780
things up.

15:20.780 --> 15:22.060
Ghost in the firmware.

15:22.060 --> 15:26.280
But I was able to eventually, you know, get things set up properly in the BIOS and make

15:26.280 --> 15:28.080
a little bit of progress.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.080
Okay.

15:29.080 --> 15:34.080
I was able to figure out the boot priority, which is great.

15:34.080 --> 15:40.720
So I'm booting off my little USB drive that has the neon image loaded onto it.

15:40.720 --> 15:49.160
And UEFI, it complained that the system was shut down many times unsuccessfully.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.160
I don't know what that's about.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.000
And this is the first time I gave it a try.

15:52.000 --> 15:59.420
And so I got the neon boot menu, which is great, a grub menu, which is great.

15:59.420 --> 16:04.740
So just selected, you know, let's go for it.

16:04.740 --> 16:09.920
And now I was hoping this would figure itself out while I was recording this, but now it

16:09.920 --> 16:13.680
is just a blank screen.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.120
This is not feeling very good.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.200
So more work to do.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.560
Oh, that doesn't seem like it went well.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.080
Blanks green.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.520
I'm sure some of you are like, Oh yeah, of course.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.720
It's like, this is probably exactly what happened.

16:25.720 --> 16:29.580
But it kind of made me realize that I've been working with mostly laptops for the last like

16:29.580 --> 16:32.280
five years and not very fancy ones.

16:32.280 --> 16:38.240
So I knew, okay, well that's obviously I can just give it a shot in safe graphics mode.

16:38.240 --> 16:42.480
But then I had quite a blank on where to go from there.

16:42.480 --> 16:47.200
So anyways, I tried the safe graphics mode.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.560
I think we have some partial success.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.380
I suspected it might be a display issue.

16:52.380 --> 16:56.120
This display is one of those big, massive, fancy curved ones.

16:56.120 --> 17:00.480
And so I'm currently booted into the safe graphics grub option.

17:00.480 --> 17:04.520
It doesn't look great on this monitor, but it's working.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.160
So hello neon.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.160
All right.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.640
I mean, at least you got a desktop, I suppose.

17:09.640 --> 17:13.960
But it's like got to be super, super tight on that safe graphics mode.

17:13.960 --> 17:20.860
It was like 1024 by 768 totally stretched into this like why super wide landscape mode.

17:20.860 --> 17:25.440
It was, it still made me feel good because I was at least, you know, able to do some

17:25.440 --> 17:26.440
things.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.960
But man, after a little bit of just watching them, my eyes were getting a little squirrely.

17:29.960 --> 17:33.400
I like the idea to you install, you go to the trouble of installing a distro to get

17:33.400 --> 17:38.680
like the latest and greatest that KDE Plasma has to offer just to also experience it in

17:38.680 --> 17:41.320
the lowest possible resolution in 2020.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.360
Well, yeah, that's a thing, though.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.960
That's not a great experience.

17:44.960 --> 17:50.520
And I wonder, is it a combination of just maybe monitoring graphics card where just

17:50.520 --> 17:53.300
needed more advanced feature sets than what the free stuff offered?

17:53.300 --> 17:55.940
That's just not a great experience for you out of the box.

17:55.940 --> 17:57.240
I would say it wasn't.

17:57.240 --> 18:03.240
Thankfully, I am not new to running into sort of issues at first, right, especially on hardware

18:03.240 --> 18:05.200
I don't know very well.

18:05.200 --> 18:10.560
So it's a bit of a Matlock situation, you know, trying to ask, okay, well, what part

18:10.560 --> 18:13.320
could it be started level one, you know, is it a is it plugged in?

18:13.320 --> 18:14.880
That's pretty important.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.780
So not new to kind of troubleshooting in that way.

18:17.780 --> 18:24.280
But it was a little disconcerting because I was on a deadline, was feeling a little

18:24.280 --> 18:26.400
bit of stress to get this thing going.

18:26.400 --> 18:30.280
Considering I was gonna, you know, this, this machine is primarily its use case is going

18:30.280 --> 18:34.520
to be recording the podcasts and streaming some of the video that we do on the stream.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.920
So it's gonna be pretty important.

18:36.920 --> 18:41.820
I finally at least got that video going, but I did start running into other problems.

18:41.820 --> 18:46.880
And of course, just as I get things booted up, the mouse dies.

18:46.880 --> 18:50.200
And I need to figure out a way to recharge the battery.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.800
It's got I think a USB C port on it.

18:52.800 --> 18:59.240
And I'm looking here and there's a desk full of a great many cables.

18:59.240 --> 19:07.800
We have pies plugged in and audio interfaces and hard drives and so many things.

19:07.800 --> 19:15.520
I can't seem to find a USB C cable and now I'm starting to feel pretty stressed.

19:15.520 --> 19:19.200
Oh, man, that's frustrating when it's like, I'm just trying to get this thing online.

19:19.200 --> 19:23.640
I got a live stream to do and I can't now my mouse has died that that actually happened

19:23.640 --> 19:28.440
to me yesterday when we were going to jump on our call my mouse died.

19:28.440 --> 19:32.120
So I now have just a little cord that hangs off my launch keyboard right here that I just

19:32.120 --> 19:33.200
plug the mouse into.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.480
But you know, off to your I think it's your left there.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.480
Alex has a USB.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.720
No, your other left.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.880
Alex Alex has a USB C cable run along the side of the desk there.

19:43.880 --> 19:45.580
Oh, where you're sitting.

19:45.580 --> 19:47.100
So there's a cable over there.

19:47.100 --> 19:49.840
I pulled a lot of cables in trying to get all this working.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.340
So I don't know what's happening.

19:51.340 --> 19:55.880
I know because I had my devices plugged in there when I was there when we were in Raleigh.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.560
So I have the same problem.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.720
He's gonna get back and everything's gonna be so different.

20:00.720 --> 20:04.680
It's gonna take you the rest of the trip just to like, put everything back in working order

20:04.680 --> 20:05.680
for Alex.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.760
Oh, don't put it back.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.080
You know, I will say he's got a great setup.

20:10.080 --> 20:13.480
There's a lot of cables like neatly tucked and just poking out a little bit so that you

20:13.480 --> 20:15.880
could plug them in for this kind of use.

20:15.880 --> 20:22.440
However, like this one over here is a USB B. This one over here is a Thunderbolt one.

20:22.440 --> 20:26.240
And so I just anyways, I was I eventually found one way over there.

20:26.240 --> 20:31.480
And so it had like, two or three dongle like connectors to make it work.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.480
But I figured it out.

20:32.480 --> 20:36.200
I got the mouse charging.

20:36.200 --> 20:42.640
But then I ran into you know, that risky part of like how not to wipe all of Alex's stuff.

20:42.640 --> 20:49.600
Okay, I think I'm just gonna try and install from this safe graphics mode.

20:49.600 --> 20:54.600
That feels a little risky, but I'm starting to run out of time here.

20:54.600 --> 21:03.980
So I'm gonna try that in the installer, I can see there is an SSD 970 Evo plus two terabyte,

21:03.980 --> 21:08.460
and there's an SSD 970 Evo Pro 512.

21:08.460 --> 21:16.480
And from what the installer is suggesting, the 512 says just free space, that seems exactly

21:16.480 --> 21:24.160
like what Alex described, and the two terabyte, or nearly suggests that there's an NTFS partition

21:24.160 --> 21:25.160
on there.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.960
So that seems fine.

21:26.960 --> 21:27.960
Still feels risky.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.360
I don't want to screw up this machine.

21:29.360 --> 21:31.480
It's not mine.

21:31.480 --> 21:37.640
And I'm sure I don't know what Alex's backup state is like.

21:37.640 --> 21:42.800
So I'm gonna do a little bit of extra investigating, see what I can find out.

21:42.800 --> 21:43.800
You're very generous.

21:43.800 --> 21:47.120
I just assumed, oh, he left this drive for me, I just want to go on to town.

21:47.120 --> 21:50.660
I have a great story about one time I was trying to fix someone's computer and they

21:50.660 --> 21:56.080
were running Outlook and Outlook was like maxed out because back then...

21:56.080 --> 21:59.600
No, the PST file could only hold like two gigs or something like that.

21:59.600 --> 22:02.120
Yeah, you know exactly this one.

22:02.120 --> 22:06.320
So it was a boss of mine at the time and I was young, I was like 16, and I was like,

22:06.320 --> 22:07.740
oh, that's an easy solution.

22:07.740 --> 22:12.360
You have like two gigs, well, it wasn't two gigs, you have like, you know, 500 bags worth

22:12.360 --> 22:15.560
of stuff in your trash, so I just deleted his trash.

22:15.560 --> 22:20.240
And then, so this was my boss at my very first job at a gas station and he said, you didn't

22:20.240 --> 22:22.240
delete my trash, did you?

22:22.240 --> 22:26.820
And my heart sunk, I said, well, I did, I just figured that would be an easy way to

22:26.820 --> 22:27.820
clear some space.

22:27.820 --> 22:30.160
He said, that's where I keep all my stuff.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.160
Wow.

22:31.160 --> 22:37.240
So then I spent several hours trying to get it back and I didn't, thankfully.

22:37.240 --> 22:38.240
Wow.

22:38.240 --> 22:46.800
So what he taught me, don't just trust that a standard workflow is okay, so, you know,

22:46.800 --> 22:50.800
be extra cautious with other people's things because you never know how they use their

22:50.800 --> 22:51.800
computers.

22:51.800 --> 22:52.800
Just didn't trust folders?

22:52.800 --> 22:58.800
That's why I keep, you know, I keep my fresh produce in the compost because the fridge,

22:58.800 --> 23:00.280
it just doesn't work.

23:00.280 --> 23:05.200
Well, there's a nice quick like shortcut key for the trash, you know, to move things to

23:05.200 --> 23:11.320
that folder quickly, so it seems convenient, but anyways, I did a little bit more poking

23:11.320 --> 23:13.800
around and things seemed fine.

23:13.800 --> 23:18.440
So in my hard drive investigations, I've discovered some things.

23:18.440 --> 23:28.160
There is, I guess, a boot partition and the OS, I believe on this Toshiba 1.75 terabyte,

23:28.160 --> 23:33.920
which is not any of the SSDs I just mentioned, I suppose that's fine.

23:33.920 --> 23:39.480
The other thing is upon looking at the smart properties for this guy, it reports a temperature

23:39.480 --> 23:48.000
of a minus 273 degrees Celsius, which, if I'm not mistaken, is just about zero Kelvin.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.920
So he's got some pretty amazing cooling in this thing, I think.

23:51.920 --> 23:52.920
Wow.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.240
Yeah, that's some great cooling.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.800
It's this modern technology, right?

23:55.800 --> 23:58.680
All right, so maybe the smart data is a little off.

23:58.680 --> 23:59.680
I'm sure it's fine.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.680
It's fine.

24:00.680 --> 24:05.320
I was at least happy to find, you know, the boot partitions and stuff that I was expecting

24:05.320 --> 24:06.320
previously.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.320
I wasn't finding that.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.320
So then I was like, I'm just going to go for it.

24:08.320 --> 24:11.120
I'm really, really running out of time now.

24:11.120 --> 24:16.640
And so I did some installing, but then I realized I got to solve this graphics thing.

24:16.640 --> 24:21.320
There's no way we're going to be able to do some streaming with this crazy graphic situation.

24:21.320 --> 24:24.720
So I had to call you both up.

24:24.720 --> 24:25.720
Call a friend style.

24:25.720 --> 24:30.720
Okay, well, I've called in the team.

24:30.720 --> 24:39.000
I have zero experience with, let's call it premium hardware, or at least getting some

24:39.000 --> 24:40.280
Nvidia graphics to work.

24:40.280 --> 24:45.200
So I've called in, I'm calling a friend, Chris and Wes.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.080
And so far, they have many suggestions.

24:47.080 --> 24:50.200
So I'm going to try a whole bunch of those.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.200
Stay tuned.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.640
Millionaire style, call a friend.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.600
And then we began to pepper you with suggestions.

24:57.600 --> 25:01.000
It's true too many and so many and they were all great.

25:01.000 --> 25:07.720
However, I did discover that there was some disparity between the tutorials you were sending

25:07.720 --> 25:12.640
me and KDE neon, which turned out to be interesting.

25:12.640 --> 25:13.640
Right.

25:13.640 --> 25:14.640
All right.

25:14.640 --> 25:21.360
Well, you know, it's Ubuntu base, but it doesn't have all the same KDE neon, right?

25:21.360 --> 25:27.920
And thus, some of the tutorials that Chris is sending me don't apply that easily.

25:27.920 --> 25:32.200
But Wes did suggest running Ubuntu drivers auto install, and that might just kind of

25:32.200 --> 25:33.200
take care of it.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.360
But we were worried that it wouldn't install the non free driver.

25:36.360 --> 25:42.760
So I was able to run Ubuntu drivers auto, no, sorry, Ubuntu drivers devices, which lists

25:42.760 --> 25:46.120
the what it's going to do.

25:46.120 --> 25:51.440
And it's suggesting the Nvidia driver 515 distro non free recommended.

25:51.440 --> 25:55.480
So I'm assuming that will install the non free one when we run auto install.

25:55.480 --> 25:56.480
I'm hoping it's going to work.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.840
So I'm going to try this now.

25:58.840 --> 26:02.240
I'm glad you were able to catch that and didn't just end up installing the free driver, which

26:02.240 --> 26:03.720
is probably what you already had.

26:03.720 --> 26:07.680
Yeah, that was your suggestion, which was a good one, because I think not knowing that

26:07.680 --> 26:09.300
I wouldn't have known what to look for.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.400
So that was a good tip on your hip.

26:11.400 --> 26:16.160
But the key thing there, it sounds like, is to realize that neon doesn't ship with the

26:16.160 --> 26:17.860
Ubuntu drivers tool.

26:17.860 --> 26:18.860
That's it.

26:18.860 --> 26:19.860
Yeah.

26:19.860 --> 26:23.440
And so I suppose I could have found the graphical drivers tool and installed it.

26:23.440 --> 26:26.800
But it seemed, you know, just as easy to go the west route.

26:26.800 --> 26:31.680
This is I just I like to just kind of zoom in on that, because, A, it's nice to know

26:31.680 --> 26:35.180
there is a command line way you can do it and you don't need the graphical tool.

26:35.180 --> 26:42.320
But B, that's exactly the kind of thing like exactly that I would have missed in my review

26:42.320 --> 26:47.080
of neon, because I installed that two years ago, three years ago.

26:47.080 --> 26:50.520
I don't know how long it's been, and I just completely forgot that it doesn't come with

26:50.520 --> 26:54.620
neon anymore because I just sort of solved that problem.

26:54.620 --> 26:59.640
That's really kind of the interesting difference between a new eyes review and a longtime review,

26:59.640 --> 27:02.320
because I can tell you, oh, yeah, there's ways to fix that.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.320
And it won't be a problem long term anymore.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.360
Like once you've solved it once, it's done right.

27:06.360 --> 27:10.480
But it's good to know that some of those things you depend on, even though it is an Ubuntu

27:10.480 --> 27:13.040
base, doesn't necessarily have by default.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.040
Yeah.

27:14.040 --> 27:17.080
And that's one place where you can get caught is, you know, if you if you know enough to

27:17.080 --> 27:19.320
know it's an Ubuntu base, which is fine.

27:19.320 --> 27:23.760
Going out and looking for a bunch of tutorials might not necessarily give you the solution.

27:23.760 --> 27:28.980
So I mean, that's kind of what you get with using a distro that's a little bit niche and

27:28.980 --> 27:30.240
that's fine.

27:30.240 --> 27:36.040
But for me, I think playing with some more high end graphics, you know, NVIDIA stuff

27:36.040 --> 27:37.280
was new to me.

27:37.280 --> 27:40.600
So thankfully, I had, you know, two mentors to guide me through that.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.040
And it was relatively painless.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.200
Without that, I think I would have struggled a little bit more.

27:45.200 --> 27:51.760
So but anyways, after that, I was able to get first boot going and found some success

27:51.760 --> 27:52.760
trending again.

27:52.760 --> 27:56.960
Okay, we have first boot, which is really great.

27:56.960 --> 28:04.360
Now I am just running that driver as a pseudo Ubuntu drivers and stuff.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.240
Let's see how that goes.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.240
Command not found.

28:07.240 --> 28:13.720
Oh, oh, I mistyped it.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.480
I'll report back in a sec.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.480
Oh, look at you.

28:16.480 --> 28:17.880
Oh, I can hear a little Archie in the background, too.

28:17.880 --> 28:18.880
Hey, Archie.

28:18.880 --> 28:19.880
Oh, yeah.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.920
He's, you know, a companion and keep the spirits high.

28:22.920 --> 28:24.960
You need someone to give you good advice.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.360
This means all three of us are podcasting with dogs.

28:27.360 --> 28:30.640
We should change the name of the show.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.800
And change our video shots to probably right, they should be the dogs.

28:33.800 --> 28:34.800
Right.

28:34.800 --> 28:40.040
So after installing the graphics drivers and doing a quick reboot, everything was perfect,

28:40.040 --> 28:41.560
turned out really great.

28:41.560 --> 28:48.120
But I did start to run into a few other issues that seemed maybe less software based, maybe

28:48.120 --> 28:49.760
a bit more hardware based.

28:49.760 --> 28:56.800
You know, this is mildly embarrassing, because it seems obvious now, but we have lovely graphics.

28:56.800 --> 29:00.680
And then I was thinking, oh, no, all I see is background.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.760
But it's extending to the left.

29:02.760 --> 29:08.680
And so obviously, this other monitor is also connected to this computer.

29:08.680 --> 29:13.800
So I just need to figure out how to turn that one on.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.600
We'll get there.

29:15.600 --> 29:20.440
But anyways, yeah, welcome to a modern brand.

29:20.440 --> 29:21.440
You're set up now.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.960
You got a big, powerful workstation.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.720
You got your fancy screens.

29:24.720 --> 29:27.640
You know, I thought it was going to be obvious because I have one monitor here in front of

29:27.640 --> 29:28.640
me and another one to the right.

29:28.640 --> 29:33.320
And I was like, oh, yeah, OK, well, you know, it's just not quite, you know, the default

29:33.320 --> 29:37.760
setup is not quite so instead of being on the left, it's on the right.

29:37.760 --> 29:41.800
But it wasn't that obvious because I brought up the, you know, the display manager.

29:41.800 --> 29:43.280
You could drag them around and stuff like that.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.500
And it wasn't even this monitor.

29:44.500 --> 29:48.560
It was the TV over there in the other side of the room that was plugged in.

29:48.560 --> 29:49.560
Oh, Alex.

29:49.560 --> 29:53.040
And it was set default as my primary monitor.

29:53.040 --> 29:54.560
So all my toolbars and stuff.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.560
I love it.

29:55.560 --> 29:59.080
You could be podcasting from the couch right now and you're not.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.080
Missed opportunity.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.800
Put the chat room on the TV.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.800
That's what you do.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.800
Right.

30:03.800 --> 30:07.640
So anyways, I traced a few cables and got this other one plugged in and unplugged that

30:07.640 --> 30:09.640
TV and everything was just fine.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.440
Oh, good.

30:11.440 --> 30:16.440
And now you're going to, I guess, probably get to know neon a little bit, really.

30:16.440 --> 30:17.720
It's just get to know plasma.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.480
It's just it's the latest plasma.

30:19.480 --> 30:20.480
That's it.

30:20.480 --> 30:25.840
Yeah, I did find a bug or two, as I may, that were pretty minor, but we'll see if we can

30:25.840 --> 30:27.640
report on those in a bit.

30:27.640 --> 30:29.720
But I'm excited to give this a tour for the next month.

30:29.720 --> 30:33.020
I think so far it's quite performant, really working nicely.

30:33.020 --> 30:36.760
And I mean, as a plasma fan, having modern plasma is just a treat.

30:36.760 --> 30:43.720
And I'll point out, if you were on an AMD hardware stack with a GPU or an Intel hardware

30:43.720 --> 30:48.120
stack, especially for graphics, right now, you wouldn't have had that that reduced graphics

30:48.120 --> 30:49.120
mode.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.120
You wouldn't have had that GPU issue.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.480
It's also not your hardware, right?

30:52.480 --> 30:56.240
So probably if you had like, oh, I bought a new graphics card and I'm going you would

30:56.240 --> 30:59.520
have had like a period where you expected that you were going to go through this troubleshooting

30:59.520 --> 31:02.520
where you just kind of just jumping in with like, I don't know what I have or how to make

31:02.520 --> 31:03.520
it work.

31:03.520 --> 31:07.480
Yeah, it was kind of all of the mystery all at once, for sure.

31:07.480 --> 31:12.360
So I'm going to be interested to hear your thoughts in a few days, even not to mention

31:12.360 --> 31:18.280
a few weeks on what it's like using it ongoing, because you're on the precipice of 526 getting

31:18.280 --> 31:19.280
released.

31:19.280 --> 31:23.200
It's a pretty significant update, lots of nice things in there, at least.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.240
They've been crazy smooth for me.

31:25.240 --> 31:29.560
The biggest problem I've had in the last few years using KDE neon on this machine that

31:29.560 --> 31:33.480
I use practically daily, I use it six days a week is like, you know, every now and then

31:33.480 --> 31:35.520
after an update, my background wouldn't load.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.360
That seems minor, but it works great.

31:37.360 --> 31:42.400
And I keep it up to date fairly routinely, but I'm not super religious about it.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.720
I fall behind sometimes and it still does just fine.

31:45.720 --> 31:49.800
The experience of using KDE neon is the experience of using plasma.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.600
It doesn't feel like a distro with a brand.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.380
It doesn't, it's not, I mean, it almost doesn't even feel like a distro.

31:55.380 --> 31:59.360
It feels like a, it's a meta desktop in a way.

31:59.360 --> 32:02.680
It's, it's Ubuntu with a, with a rolling plasma environment.

32:02.680 --> 32:04.920
I don't think it's even fully a distro necessarily.

32:04.920 --> 32:05.920
Yeah.

32:05.920 --> 32:09.200
And you get that because like tutorials and stuff now, Brent, you ran into some, some

32:09.200 --> 32:14.080
issues there, but to Chris's point, at least with like a longer live system, usually once

32:14.080 --> 32:18.220
you've kind of got a little more of the, your base system built out, like it, it, you forget

32:18.220 --> 32:21.600
that you're not on a standard Ubuntu release for the most part.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.600
Totally.

32:22.600 --> 32:23.600
That's exactly, that's a good way to put it.

32:23.600 --> 32:27.320
It's like, once you get that stuff figured out, it's just going to run like, like an

32:27.320 --> 32:32.240
Ubuntu LTS would, only eventually they'll also roll it to the newer LTS.

32:32.240 --> 32:36.600
I've gone even crazier and I've done things like now I have that Ubuntu tool that lets

32:36.600 --> 32:37.960
me install my own kernel.

32:37.960 --> 32:41.520
So I have like the absolute latest Linux kernel too, and that kind of helped with performance

32:41.520 --> 32:42.520
on my machine.

32:42.520 --> 32:46.640
But I think you're really going to enjoy it, at least I hope because I know you like plasma.

32:46.640 --> 32:51.720
And so I think you're really going to like this because it's, I think it's a really good

32:51.720 --> 32:54.360
presentation of where the plasma desktop is going.

32:54.360 --> 32:58.720
And what's nice about this is you can see where they're at right now today.

32:58.720 --> 33:03.100
Like when I talk about my Steam Deck in a little bit, well, the version of plasma that's

33:03.100 --> 33:07.880
on my Steam Deck was technically released in October of last year, had a security patch

33:07.880 --> 33:08.880
in January.

33:08.880 --> 33:13.560
So it's been updated as of January, but the major release came out in October.

33:13.560 --> 33:21.320
And so there's just stuff missing in their plasma image that my desktop has right now.

33:21.320 --> 33:24.600
And it's nice to see where they're going because there's so much work being done on the plasma

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
desktop.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.760
And it's such an awesome workstation OS.

33:27.760 --> 33:31.320
I'm almost positive it's what we're going to use as our desktop environment when we

33:31.320 --> 33:35.400
redo all the studio machines now, all our production machines, I think will be plasma

33:35.400 --> 33:39.280
in part because I just love Kwin and I love the Kwin rules.

33:39.280 --> 33:43.240
That's very true.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.480
Linode.com slash unplugged.

33:45.480 --> 33:49.320
Go there to get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit on a new account and you can go

33:49.320 --> 33:51.200
there to support the show.

33:51.200 --> 33:54.480
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting, the Linux Geeks Cloud.

33:54.480 --> 33:58.840
We've been using it for, oh my gosh, can I almost start saying three years now?

33:58.840 --> 34:00.480
I got to do the math on that.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.320
I love Linode and I think you will, too.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.920
I have had friends who've been using it for a decade.

34:04.920 --> 34:07.240
They've been around for nearly 19 years.

34:07.240 --> 34:13.320
They are fast, reliable cloud hosting with 11 data centers around the world.

34:13.320 --> 34:16.240
Linode is great for performance hounds, for those of you that want a great value, for

34:16.240 --> 34:21.640
people that want a back end infrastructure for their business or just an individual's

34:21.640 --> 34:26.920
website, a portfolio, a blog with pricing 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the hyperscalers

34:26.920 --> 34:29.720
out there that want to lock into their crazy platforms.

34:29.720 --> 34:30.720
You're going to love it.

34:30.720 --> 34:33.040
And with that hundred dollars, you can really try it.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.920
And that's the difference.

34:34.920 --> 34:38.320
Linode recently rolled out Kali Linux support so that way you can test your security.

34:38.320 --> 34:42.360
And of course, they always have the absolute up to date distributions, including the latest

34:42.360 --> 34:44.880
Alma, Rocky and others.

34:44.880 --> 34:47.280
They'll even let you do a custom install a couple of times now.

34:47.280 --> 34:52.000
I've had to just take it down to the metal and install a custom distro once for a crazy

34:52.000 --> 34:58.240
VPN solution and once to install NixOS, which I mean, doesn't feel so crazy.

34:58.240 --> 35:01.320
And if you ever run into any troubles, you ever have any problems getting set up, they

35:01.320 --> 35:07.380
have tons of guides, tons of tutorials, but also Linode comes with amazing 24 seven customer

35:07.380 --> 35:09.560
support by phone or by ticket.

35:09.560 --> 35:11.040
You're going to get the help you need.

35:11.040 --> 35:15.160
And they also have a really large community, including lots of members in our community.

35:15.160 --> 35:20.320
In fact, Linode is invested in the Jupiter Broadcasting community multiple times over

35:20.320 --> 35:23.760
and they're doing it once again this year by making it possible for us to go down and

35:23.760 --> 35:25.920
visit JPL.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.160
And we're not the only ones they support.

35:28.160 --> 35:31.520
Media and free software Linode support runs deep in the community.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.780
In fact, that's how I first discovered them.

35:33.780 --> 35:37.160
They were making it possible for Texas Linux Fest to go.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.320
Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

35:40.320 --> 35:43.640
If it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode.

35:43.640 --> 35:44.920
Go see why we love it.

35:44.920 --> 35:49.400
Go see why so many in our community love it and go get that one hundred dollars.

35:57.360 --> 36:01.320

36:01.320 --> 36:09.360
Chris, I was wondering if you have done one of those LTS updates on that install yet and

36:09.360 --> 36:10.360
how that went.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.360
Yeah, it went fine.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.360
Really.

36:12.360 --> 36:17.280
I don't recall any significant issues twice or so.

36:17.280 --> 36:22.720
I have had problems with like bootloaders getting messed up from an update like the

36:22.720 --> 36:26.680
update failed during the bootloader image generation process or something like that

36:26.680 --> 36:30.560
where I have had to go in and repair that.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.280
And I don't actually think that's a neon problem.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.680
I think that was an apt issue.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.680
And the machine itself is so old.

36:38.680 --> 36:42.680
So yeah, I've had a few package updates break on me and I don't really think it's neon so

36:42.680 --> 36:43.680
much.

36:43.680 --> 36:48.000
I was just checking and I just did an L.S. on Varlog installer, which is a directory

36:48.000 --> 36:50.760
that the Ubuntu installer leaves on your hard drive.

36:50.760 --> 36:55.380
And the files in there were created January 29th, 2018.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.440
That's when I installed this machine.

36:57.440 --> 37:03.160
So the fact that twice I've had to like go fix my boot manager after an upgrade failed,

37:03.160 --> 37:04.160
that's not so bad.

37:04.160 --> 37:07.840
I've almost always universally done them from the command line, too.

37:07.840 --> 37:10.800
I may have done one upgrade from the GUI.

37:10.800 --> 37:14.320
There was one update where they added new upgrade notifications.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.920
And so that time I upgraded using the GUI, but otherwise all other times I've just upgraded

37:17.920 --> 37:19.440
from the command line.

37:19.440 --> 37:22.880
And you complain about a lot of broken stuff in the studio, but it's not it's not usually

37:22.880 --> 37:23.880
that machine.

37:23.880 --> 37:24.880
Right.

37:24.880 --> 37:28.920
And of all the things that are breaking, it is generally not the neon machine.

37:28.920 --> 37:33.440
I will say, Brent, probably you probably will find more bugs than maybe you used to on a

37:33.440 --> 37:36.040
more, you know, like on a more static release.

37:36.040 --> 37:38.040
Oh, I'm used to finding quite a bit.

37:38.040 --> 37:41.480
But the difference with neon is that instead of it being like, I've suffered with this

37:41.480 --> 37:45.320
bug for the past six, nine, three years or whatever.

37:45.320 --> 37:48.840
In a few weeks, you'll notice like, oh, if it got patched in the latest point release,

37:48.840 --> 37:49.840
then it's gone.

37:49.840 --> 37:53.060
You might have a new bug to replace it, but it feels fresh in that way.

37:53.060 --> 37:58.800
Or put another way, Brent could actually file a bug against an issue he found and he could

37:58.800 --> 38:01.120
see the results of that more immediately, right?

38:01.120 --> 38:06.920
It's an opportunity for QA in chief to actually contribute a little bit to the plasma desktop

38:06.920 --> 38:10.920
if you have time, because that's actually the team that's fixing these problems.

38:10.920 --> 38:14.960
Yeah, that feedback loop is actually really helpful because I've certainly filed a few

38:14.960 --> 38:19.160
bugs in the past and, you know, made sure I was as up to date as I possibly could be

38:19.160 --> 38:20.160
on that system.

38:20.160 --> 38:24.240
And then the developers just being like, oh, yeah, we fixed that weeks ago.

38:24.240 --> 38:25.640
You just got to wait.

38:25.640 --> 38:31.800
So I'm looking actually quite a bit forward to this to continue my journey of being more

38:31.800 --> 38:33.240
involved in open source projects.

38:33.240 --> 38:37.120
I think this is actually a perfect way to continue those contributions.

38:37.120 --> 38:41.480
Well, that's enough of Brent's hardware struggles.

38:41.480 --> 38:45.120
I think we need something of maybe a hardware success story.

38:45.120 --> 38:50.000
And you, Chris, you, my friend, you've been waiting patiently for something I thought

38:50.000 --> 38:52.320
might never arrive.

38:52.320 --> 38:53.880
I was bracing for November.

38:53.880 --> 38:54.880
You know what I mean?

38:54.880 --> 38:58.680
I told myself mentally that my Steam Deck wasn't going to arrive until like November.

38:58.680 --> 39:05.020
What is so crazy about the timing, Wes, is the night that the Steam Deck arrived, another

39:05.020 --> 39:08.360
device just showed up that's been missing.

39:08.360 --> 39:14.240
The original Nvidia Shield portable here, which was essentially a controller with a

39:14.240 --> 39:18.760
clamshell screen that ran Android.

39:18.760 --> 39:23.400
Actually an awesome device, pretty powerful for the time, came out in 2013, almost nine

39:23.400 --> 39:25.080
years ago.

39:25.080 --> 39:29.320
And they last updated Android on this in 2016, which the servers are still online.

39:29.320 --> 39:30.400
You can still get the latest update.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.480
I had to do it because the thing sat in a box for five years.

39:33.480 --> 39:38.160
This was my favorite portable machine at the time because it could sideload your favorite

39:38.160 --> 39:39.160
emulators.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.240
You had access to the Play Store.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.920
You had access to Nvidia Shield streaming.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.160
And it's legitimately a pretty fast Android device.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.400
I mean, at the time, right?

39:46.400 --> 39:51.000
I mean, that's about the closest thing you get to a portable Linux gaming device for

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
a long time.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Totally.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.200
It absolutely was.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.040
And it was great for what it was.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.040
I loved it.

39:57.040 --> 40:01.120
And my son and I, we'd love to play this, you know, retro games on this and all this.

40:01.120 --> 40:05.760
This was by far one of my favorite portable gaming devices of all time, this Nvidia Shield

40:05.760 --> 40:06.760
portable.

40:06.760 --> 40:10.600
I'll put a link in the show notes if you're not familiar with it.

40:10.600 --> 40:17.680
What are the chances that the same day I get my Steam Deck, a device that's a 2022 take

40:17.680 --> 40:22.660
on kind of the same idea, what are the chances I get that at the same time I rediscover after

40:22.660 --> 40:26.840
five, six years, we find the Nvidia Shield in a box?

40:26.840 --> 40:31.800
And what a unique opportunity to look at two ends of this spectrum at the same time.

40:31.800 --> 40:36.720
And I'm going to tell you, there is a couple of things that the Nvidia Shield still does

40:36.720 --> 40:37.720
better.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.280
I'll tell you what they are in a moment.

40:39.280 --> 40:43.000
And of course, there's things that obviously the Steam Deck does better.

40:43.000 --> 40:49.640
That's kind of a given since the Steam Deck has essentially an HP Dev1 crammed inside

40:49.640 --> 40:50.640
of it.

40:50.640 --> 40:51.640
So it's not surprising.

40:51.640 --> 40:52.640
Sure does.

40:52.640 --> 40:58.760
Yeah, it's got a 1280 by 800 IPS screen with 400 nit brightness, gorgeous screen, four

40:58.760 --> 41:07.140
core eight thread AMD Zen 2 CPU, which has an eight core AMD RDNA graphics card with

41:07.140 --> 41:09.040
one gigabyte of dedicated memory.

41:09.040 --> 41:14.640
It's got 16 gigs of system RAM, and you can either get it with 64 gigs of eMMC storage,

41:14.640 --> 41:20.240
256 of MVME, 512 of MVME, which is the one that I have.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.240
Oh, baby.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.240
I had to go big, right?

41:22.240 --> 41:23.240
I got a lot of games.

41:23.240 --> 41:26.040
And then 40 watt hours of battery life.

41:26.040 --> 41:31.000
I'll put a link to the iFixit teardown in the show notes if you're interested on like

41:31.000 --> 41:34.920
the, you know, the guts of this thing.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.840
Out of the box, feels really high end.

41:37.840 --> 41:41.600
It's lighter than I expected, but I have held one before, but it still actually surprised

41:41.600 --> 41:42.600
me when I took it out of the box.

41:42.600 --> 41:45.560
It comes with a nice carrying case.

41:45.560 --> 41:51.760
Overall just it feels like like if you bought a Nintendo Switch, I'd say it's even a nicer

41:51.760 --> 41:54.320
experience than buying a Nintendo Switch.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.940
Device setup is super smooth.

41:56.940 --> 41:58.480
They've nailed it.

41:58.480 --> 42:02.000
I had a little bit of a software update I had to do right away, but it updated quick.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
It rebooted.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.440
I was in the new OS pretty quickly, and then it took me only a moment to switch it to the

42:07.440 --> 42:11.880
beta channel because, of course, I did and did another update, rebooted.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.880
I have to say, I really like the UI that they've come up with.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.120
It is not big picture mode.

42:16.120 --> 42:19.680
It's something different, and I really I think it's pretty great.

42:19.680 --> 42:24.840
It is super easy in that UI to determine what games work good on the deck and which ones

42:24.840 --> 42:25.840
are a little sketch.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.880
So you're going to have a good time.

42:27.880 --> 42:32.760
Undoubtedly, one of the nicest things about it, while I'm talking about positive stuff,

42:32.760 --> 42:38.200
is that if you've bought a Steam game before, you've already got games that work on it.

42:38.200 --> 42:41.880
When you buy a Switch, there's no games on it.

42:41.880 --> 42:45.800
When you buy another console, there's no games on it.

42:45.800 --> 42:49.600
When you buy a Steam Deck, you got your entire effing Steam library.

42:49.600 --> 42:50.600
That's pretty great.

42:50.600 --> 42:54.480
Plus, it even has your save points if your games support Steam Cloud.

42:54.480 --> 42:59.920
So I launched a game on here, and it was right where I left off when I played on the PC like

42:59.920 --> 43:00.920
three months ago.

43:00.920 --> 43:03.720
I mean, that's a great experience.

43:03.720 --> 43:06.600
That really, especially, you know, you've already paid a bunch of money for these games.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.960
Now you've invested in a brand new hardware thing.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.640
You're kind of wanting to make sure you get your value out of it.

43:11.640 --> 43:12.640
And I think you do.

43:12.640 --> 43:17.320
They also have, in Steam, in the Steam big picture mode, whatever that's called.

43:17.320 --> 43:20.960
I know they have a name for it, but you know, their new big picture mode.

43:20.960 --> 43:24.060
They also have Chrome that you can install.

43:24.060 --> 43:27.680
So even if you don't want to drop to desktop mode, you could just use Chrome in the big

43:27.680 --> 43:29.120
picture mode, which is kind of neat.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.120
It's full Chrome.

43:30.120 --> 43:34.100
Like I went to Linux unplugged and everything, and it worked.

43:34.100 --> 43:35.120
So that's the big picture mode.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.080
I think you could probably find lots of people to talk about it.

43:37.080 --> 43:39.080
You've probably heard the game reviews.

43:39.080 --> 43:40.920
Of course, it plays games fine.

43:40.920 --> 43:41.920
It's a 720p screen.

43:41.920 --> 43:46.440
I mean, I put almost all my games on ultra mode, and they played just fine.

43:46.440 --> 43:51.240
Some of my impressed, though, at some of the nicest, fanciest Windows games are actually

43:51.240 --> 43:53.920
running just fine on the deck.

43:53.920 --> 44:00.080
And then like old games, like I just played Age of Empires on this thing, and it did great.

44:00.080 --> 44:02.040
It worked great for playing Age of Empires.

44:02.040 --> 44:03.560
The trackpads, you get used to it.

44:03.560 --> 44:06.000
They're not so bad when you're gaming.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
You have lots of options.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.600
You have every input option under the sun, including the touchscreen, which you end up

44:09.600 --> 44:10.600
using a lot.

44:10.600 --> 44:11.600
Oh, really?

44:11.600 --> 44:12.600
Yeah.

44:12.600 --> 44:13.600
Yeah.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.760
Especially when you go to desktop mode.

44:14.760 --> 44:18.400
So let's talk about desktop mode, because I think that's what we care about.

44:18.400 --> 44:25.680
So like I mentioned, Plasma 5.23.5, last updated January 4th of 2022.

44:25.680 --> 44:30.600
Linux 5.13 with Valve 21-1 patch set.

44:30.600 --> 44:31.600
X11 desktop.

44:31.600 --> 44:32.600
Not Wayland.

44:32.600 --> 44:33.600
Did we know that?

44:33.600 --> 44:34.640
I think so.

44:34.640 --> 44:37.360
But just confirming, it is X11 when you switch to Plasma.

44:37.360 --> 44:42.200
In fact, the way you switch to desktop mode is you hold down the power button for a few

44:42.200 --> 44:43.200
seconds.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.320
If you tap the power button, it goes to sleep right away.

44:45.320 --> 44:50.160
If you hold down the power button, you get a menu, you know, typical stuff.

44:50.160 --> 44:52.360
And one of them is switch to desktop mode.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.640
There's really no other place in the UI to do that.

44:54.640 --> 44:58.640
So you got to know to hit that power button.

44:58.640 --> 45:05.080
When you choose desktop mode, it's the sensation of switching into like another X environment.

45:05.080 --> 45:10.440
You get like a whole moment where it's like loading up a Windows session.

45:10.440 --> 45:15.040
So it's I think when they're in their big game mode or whatever, it's in its own X environment.

45:15.040 --> 45:18.760
So it does take a few seconds to activate the desktop and it takes a few seconds for

45:18.760 --> 45:21.280
some of the hardware to come available.

45:21.280 --> 45:25.720
I've had to wait up to a minute before the mouse becomes available, the trackpads.

45:25.720 --> 45:29.840
And as Plasma is loading, you see like audio device notifications like this audio device

45:29.840 --> 45:30.840
is just connected.

45:30.840 --> 45:33.920
So it's interesting how it's doing that.

45:33.920 --> 45:36.720
But once you're there, it's a Plasma desktop.

45:36.720 --> 45:38.600
It's a minimal Plasma desktop.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.640
You can install anything that's a flat pack.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.720
And that's pretty nice.

45:43.720 --> 45:45.480
Where it goes south.

45:45.480 --> 45:48.000
And I hate to say this because I'm sure the developer team actually worked pretty hard

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
on it.

45:49.000 --> 45:53.360
Oh, my God, the virtual keyboard is so bad under Plasma.

45:53.360 --> 45:57.200
It's so bad.

45:57.200 --> 46:03.120
So they clearly want you to use your thumbs on both trackpads of the right and left trackpad.

46:03.120 --> 46:08.280
And then they want you to like aim in on the keys and then like tap, tap, tap, tap on them

46:08.280 --> 46:11.560
and they want you to use your right thumb for the right side of the keyboard.

46:11.560 --> 46:14.720
They want you to use your left thumb for the left side of the keyboard.

46:14.720 --> 46:17.480
And you're kind of supposed to sit there and whiz through the keyboard with you with the

46:17.480 --> 46:18.880
thumb pads.

46:18.880 --> 46:23.280
But because the thumb pads are only really just maybe slightly larger than the size of

46:23.280 --> 46:24.840
my thumb.

46:24.840 --> 46:29.160
I have to constantly raise my thumb to reset and get more trackpad.

46:29.160 --> 46:33.000
When you raise your thumb, it resets the focus point.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Oh, no.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Back to the bottom of the keyboard.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Oh, man.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.520
So you lose your distance like a funny one is like, say, you know, you're saying yes

46:40.520 --> 46:42.240
to a command prompt.

46:42.240 --> 46:43.760
So you go to use the right thumb pad.

46:43.760 --> 46:46.200
But before I can get to the Y, I run out of trackpad.

46:46.200 --> 46:50.000
So then I lift my thumb to get a little more trackpad and then it resets the focus point

46:50.000 --> 46:51.920
all the way to the bottom of the keyboard again.

46:51.920 --> 46:56.280
And I sit there and I keep trying to get to Y, but I never have enough distance.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.280
Oh, no.

46:57.280 --> 47:01.440
So then like an animal, I go to peck at him because you can touch it, but you really got

47:01.440 --> 47:03.960
to push it like it's like almost like it's a capacitive screen.

47:03.960 --> 47:08.840
Remember those old touch screens before smartphones industrial style, but it's not a capacitive

47:08.840 --> 47:09.840
screen.

47:09.840 --> 47:14.280
I don't know why you got to press that hard and it still sometimes doesn't register.

47:14.280 --> 47:16.200
It's awful.

47:16.200 --> 47:21.960
And the combo of the various different input limitations using touchpad or touch screen

47:21.960 --> 47:27.400
or whatever you're doing, the combination of their various limitations makes inputting

47:27.400 --> 47:31.920
complicated passwords unbelievably frustrating.

47:31.920 --> 47:37.040
Like wow, unbelievably frustrating, so painful, so painful that you'll either just give up

47:37.040 --> 47:41.320
on the desktop mode altogether or you'll like pair a Bluetooth keyboard or hook up a USB

47:41.320 --> 47:45.000
keyboard and just use a physical keyboard because it's excruciating.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.320
And I don't really understand why it's so bad.

47:48.320 --> 47:54.040
And then to make things worse, if you don't have steam running, it doesn't seem like the

47:54.040 --> 47:55.900
virtual keyboard works at all.

47:55.900 --> 47:59.200
And if steam can't connect to the internet because maybe you're not on Wi-Fi, keyboard

47:59.200 --> 48:00.440
doesn't work at all.

48:00.440 --> 48:04.240
So I had no keyboard if I didn't have internet because I couldn't be signed into steam.

48:04.240 --> 48:07.740
So therefore the keyboard wouldn't launch because it seems like the keyboard's a steam

48:07.740 --> 48:08.740
app or something like that.

48:08.740 --> 48:09.740
I don't know.

48:09.740 --> 48:11.520
I don't know.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.180
But it was, that was very beta.

48:13.180 --> 48:14.180
You know what I mean?

48:14.180 --> 48:15.900
Like I suppose that makes sense.

48:15.900 --> 48:19.720
You know, if you want, if you're going to have polish in one area, you want it in, in

48:19.720 --> 48:24.620
the gaming experience, I guess, but it's interesting as a Linux enthusiast sort of in the field

48:24.620 --> 48:29.680
report that I guess, yeah, this is where the rough edges are at the moment.

48:29.680 --> 48:30.680
Yeah.

48:30.680 --> 48:33.760
And I don't really know, maybe they could have just shipped any free software virtual

48:33.760 --> 48:34.760
keyboard.

48:34.760 --> 48:38.040
It may have been a lot better because the other thing it totally screws up is it's trying

48:38.040 --> 48:43.160
to figure out where the content is in a terminal, but it doesn't know where it's going to be.

48:43.160 --> 48:46.780
So say you want to try out Pac-Man because you want to see what it's like to do a Pac-Man

48:46.780 --> 48:47.780
update.

48:47.780 --> 48:50.640
And so you're doing your Pac-Man, S-Y-U.

48:50.640 --> 48:56.520
Well first of all, it took you about six minutes to type out Pac-Man dash capital S lowercase

48:56.520 --> 49:00.560
Y U and then you hit enter.

49:00.560 --> 49:04.000
But now you can't see it because the output is now under the keyboard.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.360
So you clear the keyboard, keyboard comes back.

49:07.360 --> 49:11.760
Next time you need to like say yes to the prompt and it wants to help you out.

49:11.760 --> 49:14.960
So the keyboard now pops up at the top screen because now the content of the terminals at

49:14.960 --> 49:15.960
the bottom of the screen.

49:15.960 --> 49:19.800
So then when I hit yes, of course the terminal then scrolls up with new information like

49:19.800 --> 49:23.880
the packages that are going to be updated, which is now covered by the keyboard.

49:23.880 --> 49:28.400
So then I have to turn the keyboard off and after we invoke the keyboard, but this time,

49:28.400 --> 49:32.520
this time, because the prompts at the bottom of the terminal, it's still not quite guessing

49:32.520 --> 49:33.520
it right.

49:33.520 --> 49:35.180
So it covers up the content I need to read.

49:35.180 --> 49:38.440
So I got to then turn the keyboard off, read the content, remember what I got to say yes

49:38.440 --> 49:41.320
to then turn it back on and try to guess the right prompts of yes.

49:41.320 --> 49:44.480
So what I usually would do is like, okay, I think it's asking for my pseudo passwords.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.880
I'll type that in now.

49:45.880 --> 49:47.680
And now it's asking if I want to update these packages.

49:47.680 --> 49:51.400
So I'll just hit yes now and then I'll clear the keyboard and see if I guessed it all right.

49:51.400 --> 49:56.280
And that's the actual process of using the virtual keyboard on the Steam Deck.

49:56.280 --> 49:59.520
And by the way, when you try to update with Pac-Man, it just yells at you that everything's

49:59.520 --> 50:01.640
read only and you can't all that for nothing.

50:01.640 --> 50:07.360
You thought about just SSHing in at this point, cause that might be easier.

50:07.360 --> 50:10.880
I actually was trying to get Pac-Man working because I was going to install SSH for you

50:10.880 --> 50:14.040
so you could play around and I was going to invite, right.

50:14.040 --> 50:17.280
I was thinking about you, but the thing is, is I couldn't get that far.

50:17.280 --> 50:21.360
If you want to install flat pack app, no problem at all, but you want to use Pac-Man, you're

50:21.360 --> 50:22.440
getting read only errors.

50:22.440 --> 50:27.000
It's not, I wasn't sure if maybe they'd have like a user area you could write to or something

50:27.000 --> 50:33.080
like that, but although I wonder about Nix in my home directory, right?

50:33.080 --> 50:35.320
Running the Nix package manager out of my home directory might work.

50:35.320 --> 50:37.880
I knew that was going to come up at some point.

50:37.880 --> 50:38.880
It had to.

50:38.880 --> 50:39.880
I got to try that.

50:39.880 --> 50:46.120
I do have to try that, but as far as actual desktop performance as a desktop machine,

50:46.120 --> 50:47.120
it's fine.

50:47.120 --> 50:48.120
It's like a laptop.

50:48.120 --> 50:50.040
You'll hear it kick up, but the fans are pretty pleasant.

50:50.040 --> 50:53.360
It does get pretty warm to the touch, but it's not impossible to hold.

50:53.360 --> 50:54.360
It's still fine.

50:54.360 --> 50:57.140
And on the edges where you grip, you don't really have heat.

50:57.140 --> 51:01.320
It's really in the center where all of the parts are and it does have a fan right here

51:01.320 --> 51:02.320
on the back.

51:02.320 --> 51:05.880
So if I turn it towards me, I get a little bit of, you know, I get a little bit of a

51:05.880 --> 51:12.020
hairdryer effect going from it, but you could absolutely, because I've done bits and pieces

51:12.020 --> 51:17.840
of this, hook it up to a USB-C dock and have an external monitor, external keyboard, external

51:17.840 --> 51:20.360
mouse, peripherals.

51:20.360 --> 51:24.560
You could have an audio interface, everything, because I've used my launch keyboard right

51:24.560 --> 51:30.000
here as a bit of a USB hub because it has USB-A and C ports and it's USB-C cable.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.720
I hook it into the deck.

51:31.720 --> 51:33.640
I can keep connecting devices.

51:33.640 --> 51:34.640
Everything works.

51:34.640 --> 51:38.360
And in the show notes, I will link to a known good USB-C hub.

51:38.360 --> 51:40.160
I have one on order myself.

51:40.160 --> 51:45.120
It has ethernet, it has DisplayPort or HDMI, I can't remember, but it has everything you

51:45.120 --> 51:50.200
need because the deck only has one USB-C port, but you could plug all that in and you've

51:50.200 --> 51:52.560
essentially created yourself a docking station.

51:52.560 --> 51:56.040
And this thing is a full-fledged PC with a second monitor.

51:56.040 --> 52:01.840
You can actually use the Steam Deck's internal screen as your second display, so you could

52:01.840 --> 52:07.440
have an external monitor as your primary display, and then the deck is your secondary monitor.

52:07.440 --> 52:11.120
Then you disconnect that USB-C dock and it's just all on the deck.

52:11.120 --> 52:12.760
And that is pretty compelling.

52:12.760 --> 52:20.240
The downside is it's a read-only file system, which is tricky to work with, and if you reboot

52:20.240 --> 52:29.080
when you're in the desktop mode, it reboots back into the game mode, not the desktop.

52:29.080 --> 52:30.600
Makes sense, right?

52:30.600 --> 52:31.600
You can see why they do that.

52:31.600 --> 52:34.000
For average users, you're going to want to get back.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.120
You think, okay, if I reboot, I'll get back to the gaming mode.

52:36.120 --> 52:38.280
That's exactly what they'd want to have happen.

52:38.280 --> 52:42.360
But if you're using it as a desktop and you're in the desktop mode and you reboot, it goes

52:42.360 --> 52:43.680
back into a gaming device.

52:43.680 --> 52:45.200
It might not be what you want.

52:45.200 --> 52:50.280
So you negligently decide that you're going to try to do a live stream from the deck.

52:50.280 --> 52:53.620
You're like, real quick, I'm going to reboot, get ready, and then you have to set everything

52:53.620 --> 52:54.620
up again.

52:54.620 --> 52:56.360
I mean, that seems like a pretty fair limitation.

52:56.360 --> 52:58.200
The battery life could be better as well.

52:58.200 --> 53:00.200
I mean, as a desktop, it's fine.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.240
But when you're using it to play video games, I mean, what do you expect, right?

53:03.240 --> 53:04.880
It gets about three to four hours.

53:04.880 --> 53:05.880
It's going to get warm.

53:05.880 --> 53:06.880
I don't know, man.

53:06.880 --> 53:09.840
I mean, that's just kind of what the technology's at right now.

53:09.840 --> 53:13.440
They could put a better, bigger battery in here, but it's going to cost more.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.440
It's going to be thicker.

53:14.440 --> 53:15.440
It's going to be heavier.

53:15.440 --> 53:17.520
After three hours, you might want to go outside.

53:17.520 --> 53:18.520
Who knows?

53:18.520 --> 53:19.520
Maybe.

53:19.520 --> 53:20.520
Maybe.

53:20.520 --> 53:25.880
But the overall user experience for just gaming, taking out the desktop stuff, is perfect.

53:25.880 --> 53:26.880
They nailed it.

53:26.880 --> 53:28.640
They nailed it more than I thought they would.

53:28.640 --> 53:30.040
And I'm really happy I have it now.

53:30.040 --> 53:35.920
It's going to be, I think I am going to see a significant uptick in my home PC gaming.

53:35.920 --> 53:41.900
Because in my unique tiny living situation, I didn't have room for a gaming PC.

53:41.900 --> 53:46.120
So I was kind of gravitating towards things like the Nintendo Switch already.

53:46.120 --> 53:47.960
Because I have it hooked from a TV.

53:47.960 --> 53:50.520
We could do a little family game play.

53:50.520 --> 53:53.200
This is personal, like portability.

53:53.200 --> 53:54.200
But it's for PC games.

53:54.200 --> 53:57.320
And I have to keep reminding myself, it's not an ARM device, guys.

53:57.320 --> 53:58.320
No.

53:58.320 --> 53:59.320
It's not an ARM device.

53:59.320 --> 54:02.920
I like, I sit here, and I'm like, I was looking at the kernel, I'm like, but that's not an

54:02.920 --> 54:03.920
ARM.

54:03.920 --> 54:04.920
Oh, right.

54:04.920 --> 54:05.920
Yeah.

54:05.920 --> 54:10.720
So I'm excited in that sense, like, oh, right, I'm going to play some games.

54:10.720 --> 54:15.160
The other thing that's kind of nice is because the screen is 720, you install some of these

54:15.160 --> 54:20.640
older games I have, like, I have some of the Batman games and some of the Alien games.

54:20.640 --> 54:22.000
Some of them were made years ago, right?

54:22.000 --> 54:26.760
But you could put them on Mac settings now, and they just play fantastic on this thing.

54:26.760 --> 54:31.760
I'm curious, Chris, you probably went into this with a particular vision of, yeah, OK,

54:31.760 --> 54:34.200
it's going to play games great, and it does.

54:34.200 --> 54:40.000
But a particular vision of, like, the Linux desktop part of it, and maybe a use case that

54:40.000 --> 54:44.440
you had in mind, is that vision now a little different now that you've had these experiences?

54:44.440 --> 54:46.120
And where do you think that's going?

54:46.120 --> 54:47.120
Yeah.

54:47.120 --> 54:51.360
I thought it'd be a great, I mean, surprise, I was picturing this as a perfect portable

54:51.360 --> 54:52.880
podcasting machine, right?

54:52.880 --> 54:59.280
USB-C dock, it has my audio interface, and then you just run Audacity on the screen.

54:59.280 --> 55:03.300
And you know, maybe, like, when we're in a hotel room or something, this is all I need

55:03.300 --> 55:05.240
to record a podcast.

55:05.240 --> 55:08.980
And I definitely could do that, but it's big, guys.

55:08.980 --> 55:09.980
It's big.

55:09.980 --> 55:12.200
Like, it's a big device.

55:12.200 --> 55:13.360
It's huge.

55:13.360 --> 55:19.440
And it's, like, at this size, I would just rather have the Dev 1.

55:19.440 --> 55:20.840
I'd just rather have a laptop.

55:20.840 --> 55:24.120
That was going to be my next question, because you were kind of like, you know, a few weeks

55:24.120 --> 55:26.040
ago, you were waffling a bit.

55:26.040 --> 55:28.220
You didn't know this was about to show up.

55:28.220 --> 55:31.600
You were a little less enchanted with the idea after the Dev 1 came out.

55:31.600 --> 55:35.400
This is where I think the Shield does a couple of things better.

55:35.400 --> 55:39.440
The Shield is more portable because of its fold-up clamshell design.

55:39.440 --> 55:42.800
The portability of this is, frankly, a lot nicer.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.480
It is easier to move this around.

55:44.480 --> 55:48.280
I actually kind of think this is a superior design built around a game controller.

55:48.280 --> 55:51.680
Kind of the size of that original Xbox Chunky controller.

55:51.680 --> 55:54.560
Yeah, just a little bit bigger.

55:54.560 --> 56:01.800
The other thing this does, I'm sad to say, a little bit better than the Steam Deck is

56:01.800 --> 56:03.600
battery life.

56:03.600 --> 56:10.880
And I am kind of appalled to say that, because this is nearly a 10-year-old device.

56:10.880 --> 56:18.480
And it sat in a box, dead, for like five years, six years, I don't know, a long time.

56:18.480 --> 56:19.980
And it just got charged up.

56:19.980 --> 56:23.200
And now here I am, and the battery life lasts longer.

56:23.200 --> 56:25.120
Now the games are not as nice.

56:25.120 --> 56:31.840
The capabilities of Android, especially this genre of 2016 Android, are really limiting.

56:31.840 --> 56:34.640
Like Google Play services crashes constantly.

56:34.640 --> 56:37.280
The Play Store is always asking me to re-authenticate.

56:37.280 --> 56:39.600
Android was such a hot mess back then.

56:39.600 --> 56:46.120
And ultimately, it really, really stands out when you have an Android gaming device and

56:46.120 --> 56:47.800
a pure Linux play.

56:47.800 --> 56:49.880
The pure Linux play is so much better.

56:49.880 --> 56:50.880
It's so much simpler.

56:50.880 --> 56:53.600
I don't have to deal with crappy Google services.

56:53.600 --> 56:56.960
I don't have weird services that are just airing out in the background, and then I'm

56:56.960 --> 56:58.880
getting error messages and stuff.

56:58.880 --> 57:01.080
The whole setup process is so smooth.

57:01.080 --> 57:05.480
When you launch a Proton game on this thing, they've got custom splash screens for that

57:05.480 --> 57:10.320
game that tell you, I'm installing the.NET redistributables, and I'm taking care of this

57:10.320 --> 57:14.420
in this really nice way, where it's also, at the same time, showing you all the controls.

57:14.420 --> 57:16.880
By the way, the controls, they're always just a button away.

57:16.880 --> 57:20.080
On any game, you can hit a button, and there's a little slide over that tells you what all

57:20.080 --> 57:22.320
the controls are for that game at any point.

57:22.320 --> 57:23.320
Oh, nice.

57:23.320 --> 57:24.320
Yeah.

57:24.320 --> 57:25.320
There's all that kind of stuff.

57:25.320 --> 57:29.480
You can hold down the Steam button and the X button, or B, or I don't know, one of the

57:29.480 --> 57:30.480
buttons.

57:30.480 --> 57:31.680
You can force terminate games.

57:31.680 --> 57:32.680
You can just tap the Steam button.

57:32.680 --> 57:33.680
You get a nice overlay.

57:33.680 --> 57:39.280
The experience on this is so much better than the experience on the Shield ever was, so

57:39.280 --> 57:43.760
much better than any of these Android devices that it makes these things look like silly

57:43.760 --> 57:44.760
toys.

57:44.760 --> 57:48.520
And this is like the premium polished product, the Steam Deck.

57:48.520 --> 57:51.520
So in that regard, it kicks the Shield's butt.

57:51.520 --> 57:56.520
But in terms of total portability, like I can put in my bag and like would be an awesome

57:56.520 --> 58:01.000
like podcast machine, I mean, it's like night and day difference in size between these two

58:01.000 --> 58:02.080
things.

58:02.080 --> 58:06.560
And it's kind of crazy that the Shield seems to be getting like two or three more hours

58:06.560 --> 58:07.560
of battery life.

58:07.560 --> 58:11.600
I mean, it's an old ARM device, but I mean, those differences stand out to me.

58:11.600 --> 58:14.400
But otherwise, I think the Deck's a fantastic piece of hardware.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.400
They nailed it.

58:15.400 --> 58:20.800
And version two, if they get there, is really going to be something to see.

58:20.800 --> 58:23.040
This is version one.

58:23.040 --> 58:27.080
And I think they pretty much they hit every mark they were trying to hit with version

58:27.080 --> 58:28.080
one.

58:28.080 --> 58:33.520
You've been looking at reviews of this thing for months now, so you probably weren't surprised

58:33.520 --> 58:34.560
by a lot of things.

58:34.560 --> 58:39.400
But was there anything that you were surprised by actually having it in your hands then?

58:39.400 --> 58:42.280
I think a lot of things that I wasn't sure about, I'm still a little unsure about, is

58:42.280 --> 58:44.320
the trackpads for moving around.

58:44.320 --> 58:46.080
I think I get it.

58:46.080 --> 58:51.380
It definitely worked in Age of Empires, seemed a little bit iffy on the desktop, so I wasn't

58:51.380 --> 58:52.380
sure how that was.

58:52.380 --> 58:53.380
I'm still not quite sure.

58:53.380 --> 58:55.780
I feel like it's just going to take time.

58:55.780 --> 58:59.880
But no, I mean, in particular, I got lucky because at a meetup, I got a chance to play

58:59.880 --> 59:01.320
with one and see one.

59:01.320 --> 59:03.960
The desktop mode has been my favorite part of it.

59:03.960 --> 59:06.000
I've really enjoyed that.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.720
I like just abused the hell out of my Starlink over the weekend and just like installed terabytes

59:10.720 --> 59:11.720
of games.

59:11.720 --> 59:13.080
I really did.

59:13.080 --> 59:15.640
Sorry, Elon, that was me.

59:15.640 --> 59:16.640
And that was fine, right?

59:16.640 --> 59:20.200
And I just went about using the system and what's kind of neat, and I didn't know this

59:20.200 --> 59:21.200
before I got it.

59:21.200 --> 59:23.040
So you're in that big game mode, right?

59:23.040 --> 59:26.600
And then you drop to desktop, Steam's still running in the background, so you can still

59:26.600 --> 59:27.680
keep downloads going.

59:27.680 --> 59:29.680
It's just the desktop Steam app now.

59:29.680 --> 59:32.720
And it just transforms to the desktop app and there's your downloads and I can see where

59:32.720 --> 59:36.680
the queue's at and I can still use the chat app if I was mid chat with somebody.

59:36.680 --> 59:37.680
That is very slick.

59:37.680 --> 59:38.680
Very, very slick.

59:38.680 --> 59:39.680
Yeah, it's great.

59:39.680 --> 59:45.680
And then you go back to game mode, boom, you're all in the other interface.

59:45.680 --> 59:47.640
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

59:47.640 --> 59:52.320
Get started with a free trial of teams or enterprise today at Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

59:52.320 --> 59:54.480
Of course, try it as an individual user.

59:54.480 --> 59:56.840
Everyone should have a password manager.

59:56.840 --> 59:57.840
Everyone.

59:57.840 --> 01:00:02.640
I really think that's probably job number one when you're signing up for services and

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.640
websites online.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.360
And I think Bitwarden's the one to go with.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:08.220
It's easy to get started.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.220
It's open source.

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.760
It's trusted by millions of individuals in their communities.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.860
You have team support, organization support.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.720
It's what we use to manage our passwords here on the show.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.960
It has nice features like account switching, auto username generation along with password

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.960
generation.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:28.400
And one of my favorite features, it can help keep track of my two factor login.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.440
Bitwarden also gives me the confidence to use strong passwords with all of the applications

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.160
I self host.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.400
All of our web front ends that we log into.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:41.400
I mean, I probably have 15, 30 different apps that we self host now.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.900
And if it wasn't for Bitwarden, I wouldn't feel comfortable as a team using really secure

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:45.900
complex passwords.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.960
And you just have to do it these days.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.060
And Bitwarden is always adding features to make it better and better.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:54.240
And the experience on mobile is absolutely the best.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.320
I have the most experience with iOS, some on Android, but the most with iOS.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.940
And the integration with the password filling on iOS and Face ID makes getting your passwords

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.920
on mobile so simple.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.280
And on Android, they're just as smooth.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:13.080
It's really an impressive set of dev teams they have for both the iOS and their Android

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.080
side.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.000
And of course, they have a Linux desktop app as well.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.120
Really easy to get started too.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:21.960
You can just go to bitwarden.com slash Linux and try it out for yourself and get a free

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:22.960
account.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.860
And they're always adding new features.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.600
Their job is security and privacy.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.260
It's what they're focused on.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.320
It gives you a little bit of peace of mind.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:34.280
And maybe you have a password manager already, but maybe someone you know, a friend or family

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:39.600
or maybe your workplace isn't using the best password practices and isn't using the best

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.600
password manager.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.680
Send them to Bitwarden.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.840
You'll know they'll be taken care of.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.840
You know they'll be safe.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.800
You know they're going to be way better off.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.000
Just tell them it's easy.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.400
And if you haven't done it yourself, try it out for yourself too.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.440
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.200
Our first boost today comes from Marcel.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:09.480
Six days ago, one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven sets.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.440
For those who like Vim and Reples, I can't recommend Vim.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.680
I Python sell highly enough.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.480
It works for more than just Python.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.120
And by the way, does West Coast Canada count as West Coast?

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.960
When is the Canada meetup?

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.680
Fran, did you get him to boost this in?

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.680
That's a really great question.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.720
I've been thinking about this for a few years, actually.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.280
You can't just have a Canada meetup.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.280
Have you seen a map?

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.880
This is a relatively large piece of land over here.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.880
You're all spread out up there.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:47.080
I think West Coast does include Western Canada, but I don't think it does on this particular

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.200
West Coast trip, mostly because we're leaving from the studio and headed south.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.840
But I don't see why we can't have a Vancouver meetup or something in the near future.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.760
Yeah, I would love that.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:01.560
The only problem is we'll probably have to take the anti-vaxx wrap off of JOOPS.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.400
I don't think they'll let us across the border with that.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.400
Right, and that flag is a little obnoxious, too.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.440
And you're going to have to learn VIM because this, honestly, thanks Marcel, this looks

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.440
like a great pick.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.320
I've never played with it before, but we'll have it linked in the show notes because I

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.800
definitely will be.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.440
Okay, one more boost from me right now.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:24.600
Ricky Kressling, six days ago, 1,111 Satoshis.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.600
Boost.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:30.480
Hey guys, I'm a long time listener, but first time booster.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.600
Would love it if you guys could check out my relatively new app, Furtherance, for a

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.800
potential pick while you're sneaking in with the boost, so I like it.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:43.560
The time tracking app that stores all data locally, no potential for snooping.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:49.960
And of course, it's written in Rust.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.640
And available on Flathub to keep things easy.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:57.480
Thanks for everything you do, Ricky.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:04.080
And written with GTK4, so this is really taking like the most modern GNOME desktop technologies

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.520
and bringing them together, and it looks like a freaking fantastic app.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.560
Beautiful UI, tasks are saved in that local database with unlimited capacity, they're

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:18.760
grouped by name and date, tasks can be edited after they're created, settings to customize

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:22.160
the view and defaults to your liking, and more features are coming.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.720
And he says, just open an issue if you'd like to see something.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.480
So we'll put a link to the Flathub into the GitHub.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.480
That looks really great.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.360
Yeah, sorry for butchering your name there, Ricky.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.760
This looks like a fantastic pick, and you know, when we need to keep track of how long

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:40.560
Brent takes to install things in the future, I think this is what we'll be using.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.080
We got a wonderful boost from Tim Apple.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.280
I wonder if that's the Tim from Apple, but who knows?

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.280
Oh, it must be, right?

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.600
Sure, I would assume.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:56.160
Five days ago with 2,222 SATs.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.720
And Tim simply says, happy Linuxing.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.880
Well, happy Linuxing to you, Tim Apple.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.880
Thank you.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:03.880
One of my favorite usernames.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:09.040
The Golden Dragon also wrote in five days ago with 2,222 SATs.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.120
Yeah, road ducks.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.480
Thank you very much, and here's something for your trouble.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:18.160
Wichita Kays check in for meetup, thanks for the show.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.960
You know, Wichita Kays is 2,000 miles from the studio, Brent.

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.840
I don't know if we're going to be doing a meetup over there anytime too soon, Golden

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.840
Dragon.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:33.760
Yeah, someone asked me recently if we were going to head to Toronto, which is 3,000 kilometers

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.760
away.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:38.440
So maybe someday we will, but not just this time.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:43.240
I don't know why we give our resident Canadian the boost with the tricky state names also.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.320
So I think that's Kansas for Brent's wisdom.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.680
Oh, right, right.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.680
Thank you.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.680
Wichita!

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.680
Wichita!

01:05:50.680 --> 01:06:07.600
The Golden Dragon sent in a double boost with, as you may have predicted, 2,222 SATs.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.480
Double boost for missing last episode's boost.

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.880
Wes, do you have any learning tips for learning Pythons?

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.960
I mean, I don't know if I have any specific tips.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.280
It kind of depends on what you want to do, right?

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.080
You and I have talked about this in detail.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.840
Yeah, it's a big topic.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:24.760
Maybe just go listen to Coder Radio because there's been some good conversation about

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:29.680
Mike's adventures down the road of Python in the past year or so as well.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.280
But come up with something that means something to you, whether that's scraping stuff from

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.600
a website, automating something, just playing around in a terminal.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.600
There's a lot of ways to get started.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.160
I think last episode we touched on Jupyter Notebooks can be a nice way to make things

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.780
a little more concrete.

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:48.840
You can use the pick we just mentioned earlier today if you want to try that from Vim, if

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.840
you're already a Vim user.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.620
Yeah, you got to make it mean something to you so you're incentivized to get over the

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:58.180
hurdles when things inevitably break or don't go your way the first time.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:10.080
Optimus Gray also boosted in four days ago with 22,222 SATs.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.800
That seems like a grandpa duck, right?

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.800
That's a big duck.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.800
That's what that is.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.800
I'm a duck.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800
D-U-K duck.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.160
Loaded with talent.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.160
Thank you, Optimus.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:23.560
Optimus writes, Brent, please enjoy playing with Alex's chair when he's out of town.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:28.520
Now, I happen to know that before Alex left, he made sure there's a sign directly in front

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.560
of Brent's face that says, do not touch the chair.

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.120
It's there, isn't it?

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.280
Actually, it clearly says, no touchy the chair.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280
Have you touched the chair?

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.800
I mean, rules are there to be broken, right?

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.720
Yeah, or at least to be bent, right?

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.720
I agree.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.720
Good.

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.840
I mean, I want you comfortable.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:48.840
Thank you.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.840
Thank you.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.760
I think Alex might forgive me for keeping it to my own economics for a month.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.800
You know, don't want to strain my back.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.800
That's right.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.800
Yeah.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:06.120
Eric, the one boosted in five days ago with 50 SATs, B-O-O-S-T.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:10.840
It wants to know if we've tried the Nebula relay system that was released in 1.6.0.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:15.920
We haven't tried it, but we did mention it because it was a highly requested feature

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.160
and Nebula is a fantastic project.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:25.400
It is a great solution for building your own custom mesh VPN network.

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:30.440
Could be fantastic if you have VPSs across multiple providers or something like that.

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.840
So yeah, I definitely am a big fan.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:37.500
I haven't needed it yet because I don't have any ridiculous double net scenarios like a

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.680
certain Mr. Fisher.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.800
So in my Nebula usage was fine before, but you're right.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.140
It's a very nice feature to have.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:49.400
And for me, the type of devices I use, my mobile devices and different architectures,

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.680
set up time with tailscales like so quick.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.060
It was just the right way for me to go, especially on my iOS devices and on my Android devices.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:00.440
But I could totally see a scenario where Nebula would be the right choice.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:08.040
Neural P boosted in four days ago with a hot boost, 8,192 SATs.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.960
He says, Manjaro with plasma.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.920
That's the only way to fly.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.720
Thanks for the many years of Linux coverage.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.480
Did that cross your mind at all, Brent, Manjaro?

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.380
I'm embarrassed to say that it didn't.

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.440
And I'll put a little bit of that blame on you as well because we should have thought

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.560
of this.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.080
Maybe that's the next foray.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:29.120
I feel like I haven't touched Manjaro in too long.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.960
So maybe time to give it a spin again.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.960
Yeah, I'll take it.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.520
I'll take it because I wanted to get your spin on Neon for this episode.

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.520
I wanted to hear what you thought about it, but you're right.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.580
I think you just want to see if it's actually well suited for the studio.

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.960
Give it some some paces.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:42.960
Let Brent fail.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.860
I think we got to get Brent trying out that new Arch installer, you know, if anyone's

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:48.360
going to break it, it's Brent.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.560
Better get him on the next installer, too, right?

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.920
I mean, might as well spread it around.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.960
GeneBean boosted in four days ago with a thousand SATs.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.480
I'm a Georgia boy, but I'll be in Portland July 24th through August 2nd, just in case

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.360
that lines up with your meetup plans.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:06.960
It doesn't, GeneBean, but you is welcome up to the studio if you wanted to make the four

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.120
and a half, five hour trek.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.120
A nice drive.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.120
It is a nice drive.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:14.440
You'd be welcome to join us on a Sunday up here at the studio and crack open the grill.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:19.520
And then Gene double boosted in four days ago with five thousand SATs.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.520
Heck yeah.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:25.760
He says, so, guys, do you not have monitorings on your disk spaces and your CPUs and your

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.760
memories?

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.620
How come you didn't catch the matrix server disk being full?

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.160
If not, hit me up.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.720
I'll help you build one.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.720
It doesn't have to be hard.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:41.520
It's not because it's hard and to be clear, we do.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.200
We do have monitoring on there to to a pretty large degree.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.720
And also Linode comes with default monitoring that also is just there by default.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.100
The problem is when you're at ninety five percent and you don't think you have anything

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.640
more available, it doesn't monitor it doesn't really get you anything right.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.720
Like we knew this was going to happen.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.840
It was more of a when was it going to happen?

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:09.400
Also, I mean, there is the reality that my inbox is heavily filtered, like, like a lot

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:13.160
of the automated stuff doesn't even make it to the first page of my inbox.

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.480
So I kind of take that responsibility on to that sort of my bad.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.940
But we do have some monitoring on there.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:18.940
Could we have more?

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:19.940
I don't know.

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.840
Actually, I mean, I mean, maybe.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.160
But would I see the alerts if I had a dashboard?

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.240
Maybe I would.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.720
And then Gene Bean comes in with the rare triple boost with a set of SATs, thirteen

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.720
thirty seven.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:37.840
Side note, I love being able to stream SATs and do boost so much that I am dealing with

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:43.400
podcast apps that are notably subpar on iOS when compared to overcast.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.880
I know exactly what you mean, Gene Bean, although the trend has been my friend fountain has

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.960
been getting better and all the other apps have been getting better.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.020
They've added new features as time has gone on.

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:56.180
But there are things I miss from overcast.

01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:01.840
The number one for me is the whole overcast voice boost system and smart speed system.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.400
Obviously, Marco knew what he was doing there, but I love boosting.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.920
So I, like you, have switched to a different app.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:14.740
Oh, here we've got a theme gas money boosts.

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:15.740
First one's from P.L.

01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:22.640
Trent three days ago, 5000 SATs, just some gas money for Brent and another from Michael

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:28.640
B. Yesterday, 30 K SATs for Brent's travel pocket.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.640
Happy project time for you.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.640
What?

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:32.640
Oh.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.640
Yeah, that's great.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:43.120
That'll be great, Brent.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.120
That'll be great.

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.120
Impressive.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.760
I need to come down to the studio, hopefully before the trip, a to get that dear laptop

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.720
that's sitting there waiting for me.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.440
And B to see your friendly faces.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.800
Oh, we're going to have projects to do before the trip.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.480
So, yeah, you're going to have to get here because we're going to have to you know, that'll

01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.480
be great.

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.480
Thank you, Michael.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.720
Yeah, thank you very much.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:07.920
CB wrote in with a nice amount of elite sets as well.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:11.560
I'd like to contribute in some way to the show or even participate, but I just can't

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:13.960
make this Sunday time slot.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:14.960
That's OK.

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:17.680
We record this thing so you don't have to be here.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.720
Plus with ADHD.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:20.720
It's bad.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.840
I've had 80 of them ADHD.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:27.560
I can never remember to write in about a specific topic that was discussed.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.480
So I figured I'd boost in a Linux joke every once in a while.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.480
All right.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.480
Let's let's see.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.480
You ready?

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.480
I'm ready.

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.480
Yeah.

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.800
What's the only way to generate a truly random string?

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.800
Hmm.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:44.760
Well, I mean, the technical answer is to ask us to pronounce something.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.760
Yeah.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.760
Oh, that's good.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.760
Let's go.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.760
That is pretty good.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:49.760
Is it a crisp pronunciation jab?

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.760
Yeah.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.040
Put a Windows user in front of Vim and tell them to quit.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:58.960
Oh, OK, fair.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.240
By the way, Linux Unplugged is my favorite LTS.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.480
Love the show.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.380
Well, thank you very much, CB.

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:07.380
That's great.

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.380
You know what?

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:09.440
I'll take a Linux joke from time to time.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.760
That's actually a lot of fun.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:17.200
We got a nice batch of thank you boosts too.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.600
We got five hundred sats from Bronswig, who is coming in with a Boise check in user sixty

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:25.680
five nine streamed a hundred sats while listening.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.200
Nineteen thousand sats streamed from user five oh seven twelve hundred sats from L.T.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:34.880
Guy zero zero five five hundred sats from Eric the one saying go break go.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:35.880
I love it.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.100
You got some support.

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:44.520
And then the value for value legend, one of a club of legends on value for value.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.560
Three thousand six hundred and ninety sats from Mr.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.320
Cosby Lend.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.680
Thank you, everybody, very much for your support and your notes.

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.680
One of the things we're discovering that we love about the boosts is that it brings up

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:58.440
random conversations that we never planned on having.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.760
So we love a good thought provoking boost.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.720
Also I put my node link in the notes again.

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:07.000
We could use some nice large inbound capacity because we're getting lots of boost these

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.480
days so we could use some big capacity channels.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.320
If you don't have a podcasting two to no compatible app, go grab one.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:18.120
They've got tons of features like the booster grams, chapters, host info, sat streaming,

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:24.240
advanced search, value for value, transcripts, clips, I could go live streaming and it could

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.720
go on and on.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.120
Lots of options at new podcast apps dot com.

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:34.000
Or if you just want to go the hard core route, boost CLI or breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.160
If you don't want to switch your app, nice to see antenna pod getting some podcasting

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.160
to the features.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:44.800
They may have breeze integration in the future.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.680
Now we have a pic that we're using right now to do the show.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.680
So this will be fun.

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:55.520
Yeah, the pic is droid cam, something I'd played with years ago, but had never really

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:59.480
used in anger until this week.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.160
Full disclosure, I caught COVID.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.240
Not going to go bring that up to the studio.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:10.140
So for the first time in quite a long time, I'm broadcasting from home today.

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:14.920
And well, yeah, okay, I've got an audio setup figured out for LAN and you know, just for

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.800
regular old audio things.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:20.760
But since we started doing video, you know, at least for Jupiter tube, it's nice.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.960
It's nice to have I didn't want to I didn't want to bring a blank screen to the show.

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:27.320
But I didn't I didn't have any better setup.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:28.320
What did I have?

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.360
I had my pixel three handy.

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.220
And with droid cam, that was basically all I needed.

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:38.120
This is really a great idea, Wes, because probably a lot of us the best camera we have

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.520
is our smartphone camera.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.200
So does it show up as a device to the OS?

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.200
How does that part work?

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.360
Yeah, so there's a couple of options.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:47.960
By default, you get it installed.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.600
It's in the Play Store, it's in the App Store, actually, too, it looks like though I have

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:55.160
not tried the iOS version as yet.

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.080
And so you get a video stream, so you could just bring it into OBS that way, if you're

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:02.840
doing something like that, I went the USB route.

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.880
So you do at least on the Android side, you do need to enable USB debugging.

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:13.340
And then they've got a for the for Linux, they've got a V4L2 loopback driver that lets

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:17.380
you kind of customize things as well as a cute little Linux app that lets you mess with

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:23.040
the white balance, you can sort of flip things vertically or horizontal, or even zoom in

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.940
if you want to, which is pretty gosh darn handy as well.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:29.400
You can do a dramatic chipmunk zoom with droid cam.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.100
The part that I was a little worried about right away was like, well, what was the latency

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:36.520
going to be like, but it's been it's been surprisingly good.

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:42.340
The other part that's nice is when you use their app, whether you use a direct USB connection,

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:47.780
or you use the wireless connection, it still creates a virtual device for you.

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:50.380
So you don't have to worry about which way you do it, it just shows up, you can import

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:55.220
into your teams or your Skype or your, you know, whatever WebRTC app of the day that

01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:58.280
you happen to be using to connect with whoever you're talking with.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:04.980
That is such a great pick because a lot of us could use a better webcam and I'm one of

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:09.820
them and like upstairs, I don't have the right lighting situation and like my built-in webcam

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:13.880
on the laptops, they just don't do it justice, but I bet you the phone camera could handle

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.880
that just fine.

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.200
So we'll put a link to droid cam in the show notes.

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.200
That's pretty great.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.220
Now, the only trick I think you really ran into is it does take a bunch of power.

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:27.960
So you better get your phone charged or have like a way to do power delivery and USB data.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:28.960
That could be tricky.

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:29.960
I guess.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:30.960
Yeah.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.620
You know, if you're down to at 15 or 20 percent, it might not last a while.

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:37.760
I got over 50 before we started the show and it's only down to 47 percent.

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.040
It looks like the client also reports.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.180
So it is charging.

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:43.720
It's using a little more than it's charging, at least in my current setup.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.940
But I mean, at that rate, we could stream for hours.

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.500
Yeah, that's pretty great.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.240
We'll keep going.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.340
We do stream live over at Jupiter dot tube every single Sunday.

01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:57.540
I usually get the stream going around noon Pacific time.

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:00.660
I guess that'd be about three p.m. on the East Coast where Brent's at.

01:19:00.660 --> 01:19:01.660
Right.

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:02.660
Get that right there.

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:03.660
Brent.

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:04.660
The clock says yes.

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:05.660
Hey, that's nice.

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:08.740
It's nice when I get approval from father time.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:12.540
But of course, you know, I just grab the show whenever the heck you want by going to Linux

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.080
unplugged dot com.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:18.220
Links to what we talked about today will be at Linux unplugged dot com slash four, six,

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.220
seven.

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:23.300
And if you're ready to listen to something else, don't miss that gosh darn Linux action

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.580
news.

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:26.480
That's a whole additional thing.

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.740
It's like a different podcast.

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:30.280
It's a whole other RSS feed.

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.260
Way less nonsense, way more facts.

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:34.260
That's very true.

01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:37.660
There's a lot going on every week and we try to capture the stuff that matters the most

01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:38.660
over there.

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:42.100
So subscribe to Linux action news as well.

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:45.060
But for us, well, we're going to be back here at the same bat time and the same bat

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.760
channel next week.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:47.760
We'll help you join us.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.700
That Mumble room will be open for you at Linux unplugged dot com slash mumble and join our

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:52.700
matrix.

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.220
Matrix is growing like crazy.

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:58.800
Sixty million active matrix users now join the Jupiter Broadcasting Matrix.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.800
We got a general chat.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.180
We got rooms for Linux unplugged.

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:03.100
There's even a Bitcoin room over there.

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:05.340
Some of the best discussion on the Internet.

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.500
So don't miss it.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.300
Our matrix room is popping.

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.580
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of unplugged.

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:30.980
We'll see you right back here next Sunday.

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:57.340
Well, Brett, you did the hard work, you did it on a deadline, but now you got yourself

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:00.260
a podcasting machine for like the next month.

01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:01.940
It's true, but I'm going to see it.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.980
You know, if it works really well, I'm going to see if maybe I could take it home with

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:05.980
me.

01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:06.980
It's a little big, maybe.

01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:07.980
But we'll see.

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:08.980
It's carry on size.

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:10.700
I think ship it, just ship it.

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:17.140
I mean, it might it might break, but what is great is it didn't fail in the middle of

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:19.940
our recording, despite not us testing it.

01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:24.660
So that's something I mean, we haven't saved what I recorded yet.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:41.940
So there's still time.
