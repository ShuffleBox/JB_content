00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hello, friends, and welcome to a very special edition of your weekly Linux talk show.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
My name is Chris.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,200
My name is Wes.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,440
And my name is Brent.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,760
Hello, gentlemen, looking very snazzy for today's special edition.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,240
No doubt everyone out there has been waiting all year for this episode.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,860
It's the second annual taxis as voted by our community.

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,940
The votes have been coming in for weeks, and it is indeed time to reveal the results.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,040
So before we go any further, before we get into that, let's say time appropriate greetings

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
to our virtual luck.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,040
Hello, mumble room.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
Hello, everyone.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,040
Thank you for being here.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,320
I didn't want to bring down the show with a little bit of bad news, but I just want

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,760
to get this done real quick and then we'll get back to the taxis.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,920
I hate to say this, but I think we are going to postpone the January 2nd meetup.

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,640
We're still going to go ahead with the moving up.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,280
We're still going to have a big live event.

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,920
We're going to have Brent and Wes in studio.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,240
We're going to go ahead with the server thing.

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,020
But what I am going to do, just because the numbers are not looking good right now when

22
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,720
it comes to the Omicron variant, is I'm going to punt the meetup until the end of January,

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,460
which also happens to be my birthday.

24
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,140
So we'll just have a birthday party here at the studio on January 30th, unless things

25
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,400
are looking even worse.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,080
And I thought about this and I asked our get together group and, you know, everybody felt

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,600
pretty comfortable coming.

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,320
I don't I don't think anybody was really too concerned.

29
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,720
But there are elements of this that feel a little bit like end of December 2019, early

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,800
first couple of months of January 2020, where we didn't really know, but things just kept

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,280
getting worse and worse.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,840
And I thought about it.

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
And if somebody came here and they got sick while they were here, I would just feel really

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
awful about that.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,800
You know, I mean, our audience means a lot to me and I just don't want that to happen.

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,440
So we'll play it safe for a little bit longer.

37
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,040
And I feel so embarrassed about it because I've already punted this once.

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,800
But I think it's just the way we have to just kind of be a little extra careful these last

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
couple of years.

40
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,920
So what we're going to do is we're going to have a big live event on January 2nd for the

41
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,860
first LUP on a Sunday.

42
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,320
We're going to launch the new server and then on January 30th, which I believe is a Sunday

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,640
at the end of the month, which will be just around the old birthday where if I'm doing

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,360
my math right, I think that's the big four oh for me.

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,240
So it's going to be it's going to be a special event.

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,200
So hopefully, hopefully we'll have fun.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,520
Hopefully things will be looking better and it'll be safe.

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,720
And you know, just to make things a little less down, birthday presents are no longer

49
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,720
strictly required for entry.

50
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Yeah, right.

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,760
Yeah, there you go.

52
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,240
Suggested, encouraged, but not required.

53
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
No, no, no.

54
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,420
Now everyone's off the hook.

55
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,360
That's a great point.

56
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,040
And we, I think we'll still have a good event.

57
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,240
We'll still be a lot of fun.

58
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,400
We'll have things ready to go.

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,280
In fact, in some ways, because we won't be launching the server, it means we actually

60
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,160
have, when I thought about it, it means, okay, well, then that means we'll have more time

61
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,520
to focus on like, socializing and making food.

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,200
You don't want to see like stressed out LUP crew instead of the happy go lucky LUP crew.

63
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,480
They're very different.

64
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,520
But first, we must thank our sponsor Linode, linode.com slash unplugged.

65
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,240
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,760
And you go there to support the show.

67
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,920
Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting.

68
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,800
I tell you that all the time.

69
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,960
But a listener wrote into the show who's been listening for a while he's been using Linux

70
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,280
since 2014.

71
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,920
And he wrote, I recently moved two of my brother's business websites from a large shared hosting

72
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,360
provider to a Linode VPS in my region.

73
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,860
My initial load page times for his WordPress site went from 10 to 11 seconds to three to

74
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,280
maybe 500 milliseconds.

75
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,440
After that, I moved my personal and work websites.

76
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,760
Website performance got better, but the big difference in speed was when I went to mount

77
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,360
the web directories or SSH into them.

78
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,260
Before it was taking me three to four seconds on my previous provider.

79
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,960
But now with Linode, it's like I'm connecting locally.

80
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,100
I know, right?

81
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,440
What I love about Linode is when you jump on there and you go do an update, you know,

82
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,640
you go do the old app, get update or DNF update.

83
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:34,200
It pulls down those updates faster than your SSH screen can really give you the information.

84
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,800
And the nice thing too is like I know Linode is all over this log for J vulnerability.

85
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
They've been tweeting about it.

86
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
They've been updating their post.

87
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,400
Their security team has been watching it from day one.

88
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
And they're keeping people apprised.

89
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,760
So if that's something you're concerned about right now with your infrastructure, Linode's

90
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
on it.

91
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,180
They have fantastic customer service.

92
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,400
They have the best customer service.

93
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,800
They don't do that escalation thing.

94
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,240
You call in, you got a problem, you got an email, a ticket, a social or a call.

95
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,280
They're going to stick with you until it's solved.

96
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,680
And they're rolling out MVME PCI storage to a lot of their systems.

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,440
So like the IOPS per gigabyte are just mind blowing now because on their high end CPU

98
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,600
systems, they've also got AMD EPYC processors with 11 data centers around the world, you're

99
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,720
going to find something close to you, a dashboard that's so straightforward, you're going to

100
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,920
be impressed that somebody managed to engineer something so simple yet powerful and API and

101
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,800
a command line tool that really helps you take it to the next level in one click deployments

102
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,320
that can get you working on a project in just seconds.

103
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,000
That's Linode in a nutshell.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So go try it out.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,940
I've been telling you for a while, so why not take advantage of that hundred dollars?

106
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,800
That's Linode saying, give it a real go.

107
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,360
They're confident you're going to like it.

108
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,600
And I am too.

109
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
So go try it out.

110
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Linode.com slash unplugged.

111
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,640
Get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

112
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:50,320
And of course you support the show, Linode.com slash unplugged.

113
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,760
It's the second annual Linux Unplugged Tuxies, and this year we've had a tremendous response

114
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,040
with over 1500 unique respondents, helping us determine the best of the best, your favorite

115
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,840
Linux distro, the best desktop environment, the newcomer that impressed you and the server

116
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,520
distro that beat them all, and yes, the best open source service as voted by you.

117
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:17,280
It is the 2021 Tuxies from the world's largest Linux podcast as voted by our community.

118
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,960
Grace yourselves.

119
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,920
Year two begins now.

120
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,760
And we're going to start with our best newcomer project.

121
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,800
This is probably the most controversial one, so we're going to get it out of the way right

122
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,160
now.

123
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,080
The best newcomer open source project or the projects became well known in 2021.

124
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,480
Last year it was WireGuard.

125
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,760
Third place this year is going to Garuda Linux.

126
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
How about that?

127
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,080
Oh, you know, it definitely had some good time on the show this year.

128
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,640
I mean, you sort of sneakily dove in and revealed it to the world, and I just had to follow

129
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,160
suit and I've still got it running here on at least one machine at home.

130
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,400
And I would say we have heard from a pretty solid trickle of people after that episode

131
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,800
that have been trying.

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,320
What's funny about it is it's like everything's turned up to 11 with Garuda.

133
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,880
The theme, the pre-config, like the patches.

134
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,360
It's like Arch turned up to like full mode, like crazy mode, right?

135
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,560
It's ultimate Arch really.

136
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,280
Yeah, it's funny because in some sense it's like it's like too much.

137
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,000
It's not really the customize everything stage of the Linux desktop that I'm really in right

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
now.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,720
But at the same time, it did rekindle a lot of that spirit and it's really pleasant to

140
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
use.

141
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Yeah, it's fun.

142
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,080
It's like when you just, you know, realize every now and then it's OK to have fun.

143
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,080
You know, I have it set up on a machine and it's fun and that's totally OK.

144
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,740
OK, the second place winner for the best newcomer project.

145
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,440
This was the only free form submission.

146
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,520
So we got a lot of submissions to this category, a lot.

147
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,960
And what we did, we extracted all of them, Wes did.

148
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,160
He extracted all of them to a CSV file, parsed it all, got all of it, and then we did another

149
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,560
refresh this morning to make sure we have the absolute latest numbers.

150
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,860
And I am really impressed by our second place because I don't remember the timeline exactly,

151
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,140
but I'm pretty sure it came in around midpoint in the year at best.

152
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:18,760
And our second place winner for the best newcomer project of 2021 is Quick MU from our buddy

153
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Wimpy.

154
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Can you believe it?

155
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,240
Quick MU second place.

156
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
It makes a lot of sense.

157
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,260
I find this super impressive and I got to say, it brings a smile to me, I think because,

158
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,340
you know, he's a friend and he always works hard and it's nice to see him get some recognition.

159
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,920
But also on a personal level, I've been using this so slick and it just makes me all fuzzy.

160
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,960
I don't know if you guys have spent much time with it, but it's just darn nice.

161
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
That's true.

162
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,040
It's come together really quick.

163
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,320
You've seen a lot of support for the graphic environments being created under Flutter.

164
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,040
It took off on Hacker News.

165
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,380
So congratulations to Quick MU.

166
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,040
But the first place project.

167
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,800
This is this is impressive because we had, like I said, a lot of free form submissions.

168
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,600
NTFS 3 from Paragon Software made it in the honorable mentions for this category.

169
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,080
Silverblue and KinoKnight also got a lot of submissions.

170
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,400
Yeah, really just a lot of Fedora in that regard.

171
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,120
I mean, regular Fedora, some specific Fedora 35, but those immutable variants, a lot of

172
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,340
love out there this year.

173
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,280
Some love too for Asahi Linux and Alma Linux in there.

174
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,100
A lot of people trying out Alma Linux this year.

175
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,540
And Podman, Podman got a lot of mentions and some people in the comments said they felt

176
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,500
like Podman really came into its own this year.

177
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:40,740
But none of them, none of them received as many votes as our first place winner for the

178
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:47,080
best newcomer project of 2021 or the one that changed things for you in 2021.

179
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,440
It goes to PipeWire.

180
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,640
PipeWire is the best newcomer project of 2021 by a by a big number, right?

181
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,240
I think, Chris, maybe you were just like late at night voting on this one while people were

182
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
sleeping.

183
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,560
It impresses me that such a, I don't know, seemingly specific tool like an audio subsystem

184
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,160
is at the top of the list.

185
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,120
Tell me, why is this possible?

186
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,300
You know, maybe in part because pulse audio issues were always a bit of a meme and PipeWire

187
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,280
is the solution to those problems for a lot of people.

188
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,300
It seems to me like the PipeWire project doesn't really expect average Linux users to really

189
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,320
know what's happening or care what's going on.

190
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Like I don't think they realize the broad recognition the project is getting.

191
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,720
These votes, they show people recognize the work being done.

192
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Okay.

193
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,800
I mean, part of it has got to be the fact that we're a little obsessed, right?

194
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,640
I mean, we talk about the thing just about every chance we can get.

195
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,900
But but no, I mean, just, you know, in our matrix chat in Telegram, I feel like we've

196
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,280
definitely seen folks who've who have solved issues that they had with pulse audio just

197
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
by adding PipeWire.

198
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,000
Plus, okay, we've been following the PipeWire story.

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We've built it up.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,940
Everyone knows the complicated background of audio on Linux, right?

201
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,040
So I think there's just a lot of community hope around PipeWire and this year, well,

202
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,080
with Fedora's help, like PipeWire is in the hands of a lot more people.

203
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,740
Well, thank you PipeWire for making our shows even better.

204
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,680
And now we go from probably the most controversial category because a lot of people, there was

205
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:20,000
a broad spread there, to probably the category people are the most passionate about.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,160
And that, of course, believe it or not, is the text editor of the year.

207
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,680
This is the one people always feel strongly about.

208
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,640
And last year, Vim1, we'll start with third place this year.

209
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,720
Nano came in at third place.

210
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,520
Oh, hiss, oh, bias.

211
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
What?

212
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,640
Nano, my Nano peeps are repping a second year in a row.

213
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
I got you.

214
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,540
I mean, I think, okay, the noteworthy thing there are, all props to Nano, I'm glad it's

215
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,480
useful for folks, Emacs has seriously fallen this year.

216
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,080
I mean, like Nano did not beat Emacs last time around, but Emacs was down at seven or

217
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
eight, I think.

218
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Mm-hmm.

219
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
Mm-hmm.

220
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,640
Well, Vim has fallen to second place.

221
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,720
How about that?

222
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Did you ever think we'd see this?

223
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
So here's the deal.

224
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,080
Here's the way it works on the show.

225
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,180
If a project wins two years in a row in a category, they go into the Hall of Fame.

226
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:20,820
So if Vim had won best text editor of the year, it would be in the Hall of Fame.

227
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,000
And it's essentially enshrined forever as a two-time winner.

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,200
And then we vote on the remainers.

229
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
It was a close one this year, that's for sure.

230
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,640
It was, it was.

231
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,720
So in a way, though, by Vim getting second place, it stays in the game for a little bit

232
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
longer.

233
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,760
So it does have a chance to be first place next year.

234
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,820
But our first place winner for your favorite text editor of the year, I bet a lot of you

235
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:49,880
are guessing it, it's VSCode.

236
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,640
It's been a good year for VSCode.

237
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,060
It's wild to me that this is a Microsoft project that's at the top of our list.

238
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:03,500
It was a very, very close, it was by just like a couple of votes between Vim and VSCode.

239
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,200
But it's, I think it's official.

240
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,480
And I just got to sit with that for a moment.

241
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,540
I've contributed to this.

242
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,240
I didn't actually vote this year on the tuxes.

243
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,080
But I have been using VSCode all year long.

244
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Oh, dang it.

245
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
I didn't vote either.

246
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
I meant to.

247
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,360
But I didn't vote at all.

248
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
We did not impact the results.

249
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
But you're right.

250
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,320
I mean, yeah, you've been using it.

251
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,280
VSCode is my day-to-day editor, writing Python at work.

252
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,320
I mean, I know Alex is using it.

253
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,640
Brent, are you using it?

254
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,200
I'm using it via Alex.

255
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,400
He's teaching me some things, and he said, you must use VSCode.

256
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,960
You can't use anything else for playing around.

257
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:43,160
So I've gotten to maybe have it as an appetizer.

258
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
OK.

259
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,920
I would say keep an eye out for the tuxes next year if you disagree with these results.

260
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,560
But in a way, Vim not winning this year does keep it in the game.

261
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,480
Of course, the spread here is huge and wide.

262
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,800
My K-Write and K-Editors did not get the representation I thought they should this year, unfortunately.

263
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
I agree with you.

264
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Kate is my daily everything.

265
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,200
So I don't know where it is.

266
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,420
Come on, Kate folks.

267
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,480
I think it's just the people who have adopted VSCode are just really passionate about VSCode.

268
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,020
If you're curious, though, take a look at those Hector Martin live streams working on

269
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,400
Asahi Linux, because, boy, he pushes Kate to the limit, I think.

270
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,380
Hector Martin, the guy that's supporting, well, him and the Asahi Linux team that's

271
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,240
supporting Linux to the M1, he makes, is it K-Write or Kate that he uses, Wes?

272
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,080
People will have to double check.

274
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,360
But it's definitely a KDE text editor.

275
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,760
Well, it's basically unrecognizable when you see it, because he's essentially turned it

276
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
into an IDE.

277
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,380
That's what he's done.

278
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,400
It's very impressive.

279
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,240
So I don't think that I don't think those projects get enough attention.

280
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,080
But I think right now, VSCode is solving problems for people is what it is.

281
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
And people are, you know, they're still adopting it.

282
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
All right.

283
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,040
Let's move to one of my favorite categories.

284
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,600
This is one I always look forward to the best desktop distro for 2021.

285
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,320
Last year, Fedora came in strong as after a good, strong year of releases.

286
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,200
So let's start with third place this year.

287
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Is anybody surprised?

288
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,620
I think this sounds pretty reasonable.

289
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,620
It's Pop!

290
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,620
OS.

291
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,620
Congratulations to Pop!

292
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,620
OS.

293
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,620
You guys got third place.

294
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,620
And they've done a lot.

295
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,680
You know, this was even after that Linus video.

296
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
So hey, good work.

297
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
True.

298
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,720
It didn't did not hurt them in the numbers when they had when they had the steam issues.

299
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,240
Now our second place goes to OpenSUSE.

300
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,800
What's interesting about that is that has shot way up in the charts.

301
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,920
Wes, you might double check.

302
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,080
But if I seem to recall, it performed fairly poorly, like it was way down in the charts

303
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
last year.

304
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,760
And now OpenSUSE is in the number two position.

305
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
Wow.

306
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Even above Ubuntu.

307
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,560
After we gave it a somewhat not so nice review earlier in the year.

308
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,680
I was wondering if there's a correlation between how our opinion of OpenSUSE has changed throughout

309
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,320
the year and the voting near the end of the year, just saying there might be maybe some

310
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
influence there.

311
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
I wonder.

312
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
There could be.

313
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,760
But this is desktop distro.

314
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,680
And we've I've kind of all the whole time been like, I'm still not really sold on the

315
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,000
desktop for SUSE.

316
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,600
But seems the audience is.

317
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,640
I got to say for my little dive into desktop OpenSUSE, I've been really loving it.

318
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,580
And we've gotten a lot of feedback in the last few months of folks saying the exact

319
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,160
same thing and giving us tips and tricks.

320
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,440
So I could see how those who are listening would definitely throw some votes in.

321
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,440
I think there's a strong audience there.

322
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,320
And I'm glad to see this actually.

323
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,360
Something tells me that in 2022, with us using evermore OpenSUSE on the server, we'll probably

324
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,440
be drawn back in to play with the desktop a little bit here and there as well.

325
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,360
I suppose that could happen.

326
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
All right.

327
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,380
Well, then let's reveal our first place winner as voted by our audience.

328
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,900
We had 200 votes last year, and I was hoping to get to about 800 votes this year just to

329
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,220
grow the number a little bit to widen the base of selection.

330
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,500
And this year we had 1500 votes.

331
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,840
So our community, this is starting to get a pretty good representation size.

332
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:30,720
So 1500 people voted and the number one best Linux distro for 2021 is Fedora.

333
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,460
For a second year in a row, congratulations, the Fedora project.

334
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,760
This was a big win for you.

335
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,100
And it also means you are now in the Tuxes Hall of Fame.

336
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,680
We have our first Hall of Fame winner right here.

337
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,440
It is Fedora, which means next year the first place position is going to open up.

338
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,000
Suse could claim it or something else might fill that spot.

339
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,280
Arch got more votes than Ubuntu this year, though.

340
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,680
What is going on for Ubuntu on the desktop?

341
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,000
I think that's been one of our questions across the year.

342
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't know.

343
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,040
We've got, you know, got a big LTS coming up.

344
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,360
I guess we'll see what 2022 will bring.

345
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Hmm.

346
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,520
That might change things.

347
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
You're right.

348
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,120
That LTS could be a big win.

349
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,000
It does seem like Fedora had a great year.

350
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,880
I mean, we almost were talking about it every other show that they were doing something

351
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
kind of neat.

352
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,240
Wasn't Butter F.S. by default included this year or am I?

353
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
That was last year.

354
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,320
I think that's what started kicking off that, well, that's what I think kicked off the win

355
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
last year.

356
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,560
And they've held that momentum this year.

357
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,180
The notoriety they got for that, they've kind of built something into each release that

358
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,540
is building on top of that.

359
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,260
And I think they've done that really well.

360
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,160
And we should point out this was not like a squeaker win to get into the Hall of Fame.

361
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,720
Okay, second place OpenSUSE had 11% of the votes with like 162 votes.

362
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,160
Fedora had 46, that's 680 votes for Fedora.

363
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Oh my goodness.

364
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Yeah.

365
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
They won.

366
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Yeah, I know.

367
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,880
It's a strong vote of confidence from our audience.

368
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,720
And I think that's telling that, you know, there's people out there recognizing the engineering

369
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,400
work that's going into Fedora.

370
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,900
SUSE also pretty interesting.

371
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,320
And now Fedora in the Hall of Fame, that position opens up for others.

372
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
So that is the desktop.

373
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,120
And of course, we all know it's not where Linux makes its bread or its butter.

374
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,600
No, no, it does that in the server market.

375
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,320
So this is the category that really hits Linux in the pocketbook.

376
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,040
The best server distro as voted by our community for 2021.

377
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,720
A lot's changed in this space.

378
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,640
And last year, Ubuntu was our number one winner.

379
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,320
Third place this year is Debian, not too surprising.

380
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,960
But what is surprising, I feel like there's kind of an upset in the mix.

381
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,920
A newcomer comes in for best server distro of 2021.

382
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,040
First time on the list, AlmaLinux.

383
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,680
Congratulations AlmaLinux.

384
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,440
Jack, I think the community is recognizing the hard work over there coming in at second

385
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,360
place after just getting started, what really at the beginning of the year?

386
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,840
You've never seen this happen before?

387
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,680
Yeah, we're flattered.

388
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,080
Thanks so much to the community.

389
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,440
We do everything for you.

390
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,520
So I'm glad that, you know, people like what we're doing.

391
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Absolutely.

392
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
It's very impressive.

393
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,560
Now we do have the first place to give away.

394
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,000
This one I don't think is going to be too surprising because there's been a big shift

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,440
in the market.

396
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,520
People have moved around in response to the traditional CentOS release coming to an end.

397
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:38,120
CentOS Stream got a very good showing, but it didn't get first place this year.

398
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,800
But it does seem like people are really impressed with Stream.

399
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:50,080
No, our first place winner for the best server distribution for 2021 is Ubuntu.

400
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,280
Congratulations Ubuntu project.

401
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,820
This is your second year in a row that you win.

402
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,600
But I think Ubuntu had an even better showing this year because the feedback was, I thought

403
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,440
about switching to CentOS Stream, I thought about switching to this or that, and I just

404
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,920
decided to go to Ubuntu.

405
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,160
And I, when Red Hat announced the transition for CentOS, I came on the air and I said nobody's

406
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,880
going to go from a RHEL base to an Ubuntu base because of this change.

407
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,120
It's just too much work.

408
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,360
Well, apparently there's a lot of stubborn bastards out there in the audience because

409
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,680
they've been making the switch this year and they showed up in the voting and it gave Ubuntu

410
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,800
the win for the second year in a row for best server distro.

411
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,080
It's interesting that maybe it's a different track that has been followed on the desktop,

412
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,200
you know, I'm not surprised that Ubuntu remains dominant here, but it seems like that's one

413
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,800
area that Canonical has continued to invest in, right?

414
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,400
Like it feels much less stale on the server side than some of us might feel on the desktop.

415
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,060
Yeah, I think that's it, Wes.

416
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,800
The Alma initial release, Alma Linux initial release was eight months ago.

417
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,920
How about that?

418
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:00,000
To get second place in eight months in the server distro market vote?

419
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,140
Wow, that's super impressive.

420
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:07,240
And to see Ubuntu capitalize on the situation as well, double down on what they do best

421
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,160
and have it represented in our vote, I think is, it's also, you're right, Wes, it kind

422
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,920
of underscores their focus, doesn't it?

423
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
This is where they're putting their attention.

424
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:21,080
Well, it's that or people just run stuff in containers now and the server OS doesn't matter.

425
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,960
Maybe also that, I'm not sure.

426
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
All right.

427
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,200
So we talked about distros, but what about desktop environments?

428
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,000
So it's the best desktop environment of 2021.

429
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,480
I don't care what distro you're running on.

430
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,120
What desktop was the MVP for you, our audience this year?

431
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,060
This is always interesting to watch the transitions.

432
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,020
Last year, GNOME Shell won this category.

433
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,020
Pretty interesting.

434
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,840
I mean, I think you hear a lot of anti-gnome sentiment in the general, like a chattering

435
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,960
social layer of the Linux community, but when it comes down to people actually getting their

436
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,680
work done last year, they said, well, at the end of the day, it's GNOME Shell.

437
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,300
And that does represent in the default desktop environment for a lot of distros.

438
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:10,100
The upset this year is the third place position coming out of nowhere.

439
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:16,440
Like a rocket, it's cosmic, cosmic, not even a full fledged desktop environment yet this

440
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
year.

441
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Whoa.

442
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
Isn't that something?

443
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,960
Is that some of the excitement for what's going to come, I wonder?

444
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Yeah.

445
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,320
Like people sort of a vote of, we like this direction, I guess.

446
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
Yeah.

447
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,980
It's sort of closest in the runnings with XFCE, but are those, those are opposites,

448
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,980
I think.

449
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
Yeah.

450
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,400
So isn't that something too, when you look at the numbers, XFCE and MATE are basically

451
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,700
slugging it out in the numbers.

452
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,340
And it's been that way for a little bit.

453
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,440
It seems to be that sort of an area where people are kind of split.

454
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,920
There's an XFCE camp and there's a MATE camp.

455
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,020
And so the numbers really get split between those two desktop environments.

456
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,500
So the traditional desktop paradigm sort of has a split vote there and that does change

457
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
things a little bit.

458
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,240
So that brings cosmic up to third place.

459
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,160
But I wonder too, if there's not a split between GNOME Shell and cosmic, one is born of the

460
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
other.

461
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,840
And so I'm curious if we have the numbers from last year's GNOME Shell ranking versus

462
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,840
this year's.

463
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,600
I mean, we've lost a little despite still getting probably, I would imagine good votes.

464
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Sure.

465
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Yeah.

466
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
It was, it was GNOME 40 this year, right?

467
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,720
It was a big transition year for GNOME.

468
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,080
I could see that reaction in some of the votes a little bit.

469
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,160
And I would imagine too, like you could see it change next year as people settle into

470
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,280
the changes.

471
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,900
That's going to be really interesting to watch.

472
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,200
So plasma came in at second place again this year, and I really thought it was going to

473
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
win it this year.

474
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,920
I thought plasma would have it for sure because of these changes in the GTK GNOME ecosystem.

475
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,960
I thought it was really going to be plasma.

476
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,720
And it does have a solid contingent that shows up and votes for it each year.

477
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,280
And I do think that gap has closed a bit in 2021.

478
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Oh yeah.

479
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Yeah.

480
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Good point.

481
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,860
It's getting, see, that's interesting.

482
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,880
Let's talk about that because I think plasma has been getting recognized in that chattering

483
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,640
class a lot more.

484
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,900
And if you look at the trends, it's possible plasma could take first place, especially

485
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,720
when you consider what our first place winner was this year.

486
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:22,600
So the best desktop environment of 2021, the MVP for our audience as voted is GNOME Shell.

487
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,760
GNOME Shell wins it and enters the hall of fame.

488
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,600
We've got a few hall of fame enters, enterers here.

489
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,760
Congratulations GNOME Shell for entering the hall of fame.

490
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:38,600
We acknowledge your popularity and thank you for a fantastic year from the team.

491
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:45,520
And it opens up the possibilities for next year's Tuxes as well.

492
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,680
That's really something GNOME Shell, you guys did it again.

493
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,160
I thought plasma would catch up to you this year, but the GNOME heads, they still showed

494
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
up for you.

495
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,960
See, pressure's off now for 2022.

496
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,280
So you can fix all the stuff, maybe a multi-threaded, I don't know.

497
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,040
And then, you know, in a few years you can come back for another shot.

498
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Oh my God.

499
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,040
No, I'm kidding.

500
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Brutal.

501
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Brutal.

502
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
All right.

503
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Okay.

504
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:14,660
We got to, we got to move along, maybe get a little more meta here.

505
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,760
What was the largest impact in open source this year?

506
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,640
What project changed the universe for open source?

507
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,560
There was a wide range here to pick from, a lot's going on in our community.

508
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,800
And last year our audience voted the Linux kernel.

509
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,780
Now looking at the very, very, very fresh numbers, we have an interesting situation.

510
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,880
So I'll tell you what got third place this year, WireGuard.

511
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,400
WireGuard got third place this year.

512
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,360
People are still very excited about WireGuard, came out last year, but this was the year

513
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,880
people implemented it.

514
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,200
And I think this is the year it started changing people's workflow.

515
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,680
And that showed up in the numbers and gave WireGuard a good showing into its second year.

516
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,680
Yeah.

517
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,840
I mean, like not only can you just use it by itself, but there's projects that build

518
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,560
on it like tail scale and even a whole bunch of commercial VPN services now offer it just

519
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,560
right along with open VPN.

520
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,440
Now we got a situation you guys, because we've got a tie at the first place.

521
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,520
Just of course we had to go get the most current numbers and screw this up because we did have

522
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,080
a clear winner, but I actually like it.

523
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,480
So initially our first place winner for the open source project that had the biggest impact

524
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,280
this year was PipeWire.

525
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,520
Initially our audience is very hyped about PipeWire because it's already won a category,

526
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,520
right?

527
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,400
It got the best newcomer already.

528
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Yeah.

529
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,760
In the most competitive category with a whole bunch of different entrants.

530
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Right.

531
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,480
Where things like the Linux kernel won last year, right?

532
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,220
So we're talking, this is a category.

533
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,120
And so PipeWire was our winner, but when we check the votes right now as we go live, it

534
00:27:50,120 --> 00:28:01,240
is tied neck and neck, 26% between PipeWire and the winner for this category, Proton.

535
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,360
383 votes, 26% of the votes for Proton.

536
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,240
Since we have a tie here and PipeWire won the last category, I say we give it to Proton

537
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,960
in this category because this was a big year for Proton.

538
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,440
Pretty much no question about that.

539
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,800
It's really nice to see WireGuard and PipeWire on this list.

540
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,080
That's great.

541
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,440
But no doubt Proton should be somewhere on this.

542
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,840
And right before we went live, G-Hacks Tech News ran an article that says now 75% of the

543
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,960
top 100 games on Steam now run on Linux.

544
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,720
In fact, that's the top 1000 games.

545
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,200
If you zoom in at the top 100 games, it's actually 80%.

546
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,000
Ironically, if you go to the top 10, it actually gets a little bit worse, it's down to 40%.

547
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,600
But looking at the top 100 games, it's an 80% coverage now.

548
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,920
And that is in big part because of Proton.

549
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,140
That's today, right?

550
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,560
That's right now as we record.

551
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,100
The deck launches in just a few months.

552
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,400
And I think Proton is an absolute linchpin for the deck, right?

553
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,920
The deck wouldn't exist without Proton and this could open up a whole new category for

554
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,120
Valve.

555
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,120
So unless you guys disagree, I think we give it to Proton this year.

556
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,520
No, it seems fitting, right?

557
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,840
Like this sets things up as a category to watch for 2022 because, well, one, it's deserved

558
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,300
now but the next year, that's going to be the test and it could either be an amazing

559
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,240
Hall of Fame entry if things go well, or a dramatic shakeup.

560
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Yeah.

561
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,680
Or it may show up in the numbers next year as the deck because I would imagine the Steam

562
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,380
deck is going to be one of the entries that's going to be possible.

563
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,160
So congratulations to Proton.

564
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,200
You get the tiebreaker this year as voted by our hosts.

565
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,520
And I think it's going to be, I think it's going to be a good year for Proton next year

566
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
as well.

567
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:59,020
We have two more categories left, so let's do the second to last category now.

568
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,960
This is a new one for the Tuxes.

569
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,240
There is no last year winner because we decided to kick it off this year.

570
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:14,640
It is the best hosted or self-hosted open source service of the year.

571
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,380
Third place went to GitLab, which makes a lot of sense.

572
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,160
That is an absolute winner of a tool.

573
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,280
So third place goes to GitLab.

574
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Second place.

575
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,320
Now this doesn't have to be something you self-host.

576
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,280
This could be something that you go subscribe to but is powered by open source software.

577
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:36,000
So second place went to the Matrix ecosystem and the Element chat app, which I totally

578
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
agree with.

579
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,120
First time they've showed up here.

580
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Congratulations to them.

581
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,400
We've got a thriving Matrix community right now.

582
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,520
Yeah, we sure do.

583
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,560
And I mean, there's just a lot of developments and updates.

584
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,700
And I'm sure if we went back a year, the Element and Matrix ecosystem experience would have

585
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,420
been fairly different.

586
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,100
And I'm sure a year from now that will remain the same, you know, like it's going to see

587
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
more improvements.

588
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,280
It's going to be a better service, a better system.

589
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,400
And hey, maybe we'll even have some new backend servers that perform a little better.

590
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,840
Yeah, we might be on that new one.

591
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,120
We might be off Synapse by this time next year.

592
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
All right.

593
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,880
Well, we do have a first place winner.

594
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,920
It was a very close call between Matrix and the Matrix ecosystem.

595
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,800
So we did kind of make it broad.

596
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,360
And our first place winner.

597
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,760
But our first place winner did edge out just by a bit.

598
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,680
So it's a fair win.

599
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:35,240
Ladies and gentlemen, the best service of the year as voted by our audience, Flat Hub.

600
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,560
Flat Hub wins first place as one of the best services for the community.

601
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,380
And I completely agree.

602
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,120
This was the year that I started going to Flat Hub to discover what new apps are out

603
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,680
for the Linux desktop.

604
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,120
That's massive, man.

605
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,640
That's a high watermark for me because that is a job I have been doing for 15 years, right?

606
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:58,160
I've been looking for places that always give me the latest application updates.

607
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,560
And I've switched over the years to different places as like my source and Flat Hub is now

608
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
one of them.

609
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,120
And it's great to see somebody collecting and getting adoption like that, too.

610
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,600
It's just so great.

611
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,280
Well, and we've seen more and more app stores on various distributions and variants sort

612
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,200
of tie in directly or automatically with Flat Hub or just make it simpler to do so.

613
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,240
And I think for many of us, it's now, if not the default, one of the default ways that

614
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
you're acquiring software.

615
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,800
You know, I load a new machine, I get Flat Pack set up, I go over to Flat Hub and install

616
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,480
some of the apps that I know that I just need by default.

617
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,440
And it's always there like, okay, I don't have stats on this, but it works whenever

618
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
I need it there.

619
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,080
And I think it's nice to be a little grateful that there's, you know, this is a service

620
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,000
being provided to us for free.

621
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,880
I wonder if we'll see them monetize.

622
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,800
That may be a hint at one of my future predictions, which is next week.

623
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:53,840
But I think also for a lot of us, not obviously in Linux, there's never consensus 100%.

624
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,000
But for a lot of us, it feels like Flat Packs really just kind of became the go to solution

625
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,640
for desktop software.

626
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,840
I mean, maybe that kind of correlates with the Fedora adoption and Fedora trend.

627
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,280
It just becomes so simple to install so many things like a lot of the crap stuff I have

628
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,160
to have to interact with humans and do work stuff is just in Flat Packs now.

629
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,600
And I'd actually prefer for some of those things to be in a Flat Pack, if you know what

630
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
I mean.

631
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,520
Like Zoom, I'm looking at you.

632
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,880
So I think it's good to have Flat Pack and Flat Hub, you know, as connected to Flat Hub.

633
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,520
I think it's nice to see that represented on this list.

634
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,000
So I'm actually really glad they got this win.

635
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,160
Which brings us to our last category.

636
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,360
This is a special category.

637
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,160
This is something we open up to the audience.

638
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:47,580
You send in your recommendation to Uncle Brent's mailbag at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

639
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:52,240
He reaches in that mailbag and rifles through and gets a few honorable mentions for us.

640
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,480
So Brent, what do you got in your honorable mentions bag?

641
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,700
Yeah, we got a whole bunch of stuff.

642
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,240
And we may not have been able to mention all of them.

643
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,440
But I gotta say, most of what we got in there were text editors, which maybe you're not

644
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
surprised by.

645
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,120
But it just shows to me that there's such a love for where we spend our time writing

646
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,320
maybe the simplest stuff that ends up being quite strong for us.

647
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,920
So one of the mentions was fertility, which I hadn't heard of, but it's a terminal text

648
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,280
editor that tries to be super intuitive.

649
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,960
It says on their website, the main audience fertility is users who normally work in GUI

650
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,440
environments, but sometimes require an editor for a console or terminal environment.

651
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,440
So I thought of you right away, Chris, and myself, actually, I'm a huge nano fan like

652
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,260
you, only because I don't spend that much more time in any of the other ones than and

653
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,860
I don't necessarily want to.

654
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:50,020
And you're a gentleman who recognizes quality and elegance makes sense.

655
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:55,440
So that was Philip that wrote in and he suggested the following when he wrote in, I just love

656
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,400
it, he says not because it is the most efficient or anything, but till the looks and functions

657
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,900
a lot like the old dos edit.com, and it transports me back to when I was a kid and all our computers

658
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,780
at home ran dos somehow that makes me happy, he writes.

659
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:15,200
And so I love using Tildy just because it makes me nostalgic and has become one of the

660
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,000
first programs I always install when setting up a new Linux machine.

661
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,480
I thought that was a really nice anecdote.

662
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,040
That's a good angle to like if you connect with a piece of software that you like using

663
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,000
you there's something about it that just like clicks with your monkey brain and just go

664
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
with it.

665
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,240
You know, just roll with that because then you're going to open that thing up, you're

666
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,120
going to be more inclined to take notes, it just reduces friction a little bit.

667
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,320
So I love it.

668
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,980
So that was Tildy, T-I-L-D-E, right?

669
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
Which is a terminal text editor.

670
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,520
We've got a couple others though.

671
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,800
A couple other text editors, that is.

672
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,800
We had Aiko and Robin write in suggesting micro text editor, supposed to be a modern

673
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,440
and intuitive terminal text editor.

674
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,720
And I got to say the screenshots that I saw look super nice.

675
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,000
So I have not used it.

676
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,200
Wes, have you given this a try at all?

677
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,880
No, you know, I've seen it floating around.

678
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,360
I've not tried this one, but it does look pretty nice and I'm glad to see support out

679
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,640
there in the audience for it.

680
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
Heck yeah.

681
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,960
Perhaps I'll give it a try over the holidays.

682
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,400
Glenn wrote in about CUDA text.

683
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,120
So you got to give that one a try if you're a cross platform person who likes to have

684
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,000
a code editor written in an object Pascal.

685
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Okay.

686
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,280
And then, you know what, Sway, if this wasn't on our list, probably should have been.

687
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,560
Joseph and Robin wrote that in, they're right.

688
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,240
Sway should have been on there.

689
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,720
That we should probably make sure that gets on there next year.

690
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,640
A bit of a miss on our part, I think.

691
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,960
Also we got some text in suggesting that for best distro, we missed something as well.

692
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,240
We missed listing NixOS.

693
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,640
Robin said it should be on the list.

694
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,880
They seem to have had a year of growth.

695
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,280
Oh, you know what?

696
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,480
Let's give them an honorable mention right now because that's true.

697
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,360
NixOS gets an honorable mention in the tuxes this year because they have had a great year.

698
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,480
I've heard more people talking about them than ever.

699
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,400
I feel like this is a, I don't know, greatest hits of 2021, you know, it's a double album

700
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,600
and we just get to sit back and enjoy the whole thing.

701
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,280
This is, I'm loving this.

702
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,960
I mean, we used to like do recaps of the year and stuff, but then I realized this is way

703
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
more fun.

704
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Isn't it?

705
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
Yeah.

706
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,240
And NixOS is going to have to be on the list next year.

707
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,000
So Tim wrote in to let us know that Nextcloud wasn't on there, even though we were doing

708
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,800
the entire survey in Nextcloud, which actually turned out to work really good.

709
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,760
Yeah, that's kind of embarrassing.

710
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,040
And one of the great things about Nextcloud is we hemmed and hawed about this because

711
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,760
like, well, we don't really want to make our Nextcloud instance public.

712
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,880
Then Wes was like, well, I could just go spin one up in like 30 seconds and we just could

713
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,320
do it because it's free software, right?

714
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,840
And it takes no time on Linode.

715
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,320
So we did just that.

716
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,880
We just spun up a Nextcloud for the tuxes and it was something that was safe and on

717
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
its own island.

718
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,000
And it's really nice for that kind of stuff.

719
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,040
And now we've been using it for over two years as our way of syncing our editing stuff and

720
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,520
all of our clips and stuff between the hosts and the editors and all that kind of stuff.

721
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,600
So honorable mention to the Nextcloud project as well, I say.

722
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
What do you guys think?

723
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
No.

724
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Yeah, I think that's definitely true.

725
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,160
Look, we've complained about it a fair amount and there are things that it could definitely

726
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,360
still improve on.

727
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,960
But at the same time, it really has kind of become this background infrastructure.

728
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,720
It doesn't take a huge cost to keep it up to date or maintain it or any issues on that

729
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,760
side.

730
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,400
And it has enabled the team to collaborate in many real ways.

731
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Yeah.

732
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,240
I kind of feel like the magic bullet there was using object storage on the back end.

733
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,880
So that way we're not running out of disk space on the regular.

734
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
Well done.

735
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,880
Good choice.

736
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,520
I got to say for myself personally, it's like the underpinning of my whole digital existence

737
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,760
that keeps me organized and keeps me connected to people, especially if you're trying to

738
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,960
do the de-Google thing.

739
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:55,400
It feels maybe like Nextcloud has become a bit boring in the last year or two, only because

740
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,160
they become stable and everything just works as expected.

741
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,440
And I think that's actually a really good thing.

742
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,200
They've come out certainly with some features.

743
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,960
But for me, it's just like, it just works these days.

744
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,440
And I was thinking about it.

745
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,300
I think that's maybe one of the pieces of software that's the most important for me

746
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,040
in an everyday lifestyle, if I can put it that way.

747
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,040
Wow.

748
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,040
Well, then let's make it official.

749
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,720
Honorable mention locked in.

750
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Nextcloud.

751
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Thank you, guys.

752
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
That's really...

753
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
I agree.

754
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
I'm glad we got those in.

755
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,720
LinuxUnplugged.com.

756
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,960
Contact if you have feedback about the Tuxes.

757
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
We'll start collecting them.

758
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,600
And really what we should do, and I meant to do it this year, but time always gets the

759
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
better of me.

760
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Yeah.

761
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,760
It's a gradual process to improve this.

762
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
Yeah.

763
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
Yeah.

764
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
We're going to do it.

765
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
We're going to continue to refine it.

766
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
We appreciate it.

767
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,840
And then one of the things I'd love to do is put an early version of the list out and

768
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,640
maybe get some feedback on it.

769
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,040
We did workshop the list a little bit with the virtual logs, so we did run some passes

770
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,040
over.

771
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,340
But I'd like to do one with a general audience, too.

772
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,080
That requires that we're way ahead of the game, right?

773
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,760
Because you think you got to start thinking about that kind of thing a solid couple of

774
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,040
months before.

775
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
But we're going to try.

776
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Yeah.

777
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
End of summer, maybe, we get started.

778
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Yeah.

779
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
Probably, right?

780
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,580
It actually also feels like a good problem to have that there are so many projects that

781
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,040
we're sort of losing track of even some of the best ones.

782
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,400
So I think that speaks volumes for the open source community.

783
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
It's pretty great.

784
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,520
Also, I want to say thank you to our members, UnpluggedCore.com.

785
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,400
Some of the best bits are the stuff that we stream live that don't make it in the final

786
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
edit.

787
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
It's just the way it goes.

788
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,780
It's human nature.

789
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,200
If I could do one thing, it would be capture those things just natively in a show.

790
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,680
But what happens is when you stop recording, people relax.

791
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,200
And they know we're streaming.

792
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,060
But it's just different when the disk space isn't being burned.

793
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,160
And that's what goes into the member feed.

794
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,200
It's pretty great.

795
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,760
You can support the show directly at UnpluggedCore.com.

796
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,960
Or you can get a totally ad free.

797
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,720
It's still got all the great Joe production on it.

798
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,760
But it's just 100% ad free now.

799
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,920
That's new.

800
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,040
And we've also launched a network wide membership.

801
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,820
So if you're already listening to a couple of shows, why not just get the membership?

802
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:04,480
Because for right now, until the end of this year, for less than the cost of two show memberships,

803
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,320
when you go to Jupiter.party, you can sign up, support all the shows and get access to

804
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,820
all the special feeds from every single show, including this one.

805
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,420
And it's the only way to get Linux action news totally ad free.

806
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,660
So that is Jupiter.party for that one.

807
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,300
And thank you everybody who's been signing up.

808
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,600
That's been really nice to see.

809
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,280
And I hope that as we add more content down the road, you'll just get more and more value

810
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,280
out of that.

811
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,880
But that does wrap up the 2021 Tuxies.

812
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,360
Don't forget our Luplug is every Sunday.

813
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,560
And we'll be going on Tuesdays.

814
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,200
Details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

815
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,240
We have one more live Tuesday.

816
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,440
It's our predictions and our results from this year.

817
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,360
Join us for the last Tuesday, then we're moving to Sunday, 12pm Pacific, 3pm Eastern.

818
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,440
Linuxunplug.com for our links.

819
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
Thanks so much for joining this week.

820
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:08,440
And for one last time, we'll see you next Tuesday.
