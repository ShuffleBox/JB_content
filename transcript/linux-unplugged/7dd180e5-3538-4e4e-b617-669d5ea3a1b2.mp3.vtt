WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.440
Okay, I had a pre-show topic. I just thought since it's not directly Linux related, we

00:04.440 --> 00:09.280
probably shouldn't do it in the main show, but I want to talk to you guys about it because

00:09.280 --> 00:12.860
you got to wonder if there's going to be anything that changes for Linux. You have to hope not,

00:12.860 --> 00:18.460
but everybody saw the news that Microsoft purchased Mojang for 2.5 billion and Notch

00:18.460 --> 00:23.720
is on his way out the door already. And you know, you guys probably also saw because it

00:23.720 --> 00:29.320
was grabbed in the last subreddit comments that Microsoft explicitly said they don't

00:29.320 --> 00:38.440
have any plans to change Minecraft, to change where they deliver to Mac, PC, Xbox, PlayStation

00:38.440 --> 00:41.800
and mobile. They didn't actually say Linux. Do you think I'm being paranoid?

00:41.800 --> 00:44.960
Oh, it's definitely an elephant in the room.

00:44.960 --> 00:45.960
They didn't thought about it.

00:45.960 --> 00:51.040
I think that's the fuck Mark is going to write now.

00:51.040 --> 00:57.440
But to be fair, I think Microsoft is trying to become what they were before, a software

00:57.440 --> 01:02.440
company that means producing software for whatever it's selling.

01:02.440 --> 01:06.320
So you think you think it would be silly for them to pull it up?

01:06.320 --> 01:09.640
Yeah, I think so. Right. I hope so.

01:09.640 --> 01:15.180
So the whole thing is if their goal and the only way to make what they're doing right

01:15.180 --> 01:21.720
now totally Microsoft centric so that it can't run that on other operating systems would

01:21.720 --> 01:30.680
be to actually undo what they've done that's good and what is to Java standard and to murder

01:30.680 --> 01:39.200
it and do stupid things like instead of doing it from a canonical URL to something or canonical

01:39.200 --> 01:43.760
connection to something, which is just assuming and going backwards from where you are and

01:43.760 --> 01:48.760
then finding something else in the file system, they'd have to go and state some kind of awful

01:48.760 --> 01:53.160
way to say, oh, look for the C drive.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.720
So before we go like way down in the weeds, that's way down there.

01:55.720 --> 02:00.260
Don't you think it's more likely that what would happen is Microsoft will continue to

02:00.260 --> 02:04.640
deliver Minecraft as we know it today to all the places that Minecraft is shipped, but

02:04.640 --> 02:10.360
then maybe in the future there could be like themed versions of Minecraft or specifically

02:10.360 --> 02:14.880
Minecraft, I don't want to call them spin offs, but I can't think of a better term that

02:14.880 --> 02:20.120
maybe would be exclusive to the Xbox platform or windows mobile first.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.880
This is all about windows mobile.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.440
This is all about windows mobile.

02:23.440 --> 02:24.440
Nothing else.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.260
They need a great game for windows mobile.

02:26.260 --> 02:27.920
They need the killer app for windows.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.300
They need the number one seller on iOS.

02:30.300 --> 02:34.760
And when, when like the kid goes into the phone shop with the parents and the parents

02:34.760 --> 02:37.400
have got the money and they say, right, which phone do you want?

02:37.400 --> 02:39.200
The question is, does it run Minecraft?

02:39.200 --> 02:44.200
And you know, every kid in my kid's school, all the kids play Minecraft, all of them without

02:44.200 --> 02:45.200
fail.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.720
And when they go to like have a party over at someone's house, they sit there and pull

02:48.720 --> 02:52.840
out their phones and do peer to peer playing Minecraft together.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.320
I've seen the same thing.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.920
And if you're the guy with the windows phone, you're like a loser.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.920
You can't join in.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.120
It's horrible peer pressure.

03:02.120 --> 03:06.120
And it's the thing we teach our kids not to succumb to, but you know.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.480
Yeah, I think it is.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.380
So but how do you, it's okay.

03:09.380 --> 03:14.700
So obviously outside of, I mean, do you really think they'd spend 2.5 Bill and buy something

03:14.700 --> 03:16.880
that is so counter to the Microsoft culture, right?

03:16.880 --> 03:20.280
Because Minecraft's all about how the community has embraced and extended it and built their

03:20.280 --> 03:21.280
own servers.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.680
It's a huge freaking Java app, right?

03:23.680 --> 03:29.160
This is so counter to anything that is normally in the Microsoft realm of expertise.

03:29.160 --> 03:33.480
So there's no way they're, they're doing all of this just to make a windows mobile port.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.560
It has to be much bigger than that.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.940
I mean, outside of even merchandising and things like that, I think, I think they've

03:38.940 --> 03:41.240
got to make exclusives out of this property.

03:41.240 --> 03:45.920
Well, it's like I've been saying, I think we're going to start seeing a new Microsoft.

03:45.920 --> 03:46.920
I mean, this is the same.

03:46.920 --> 03:47.920
I don't think it's new.

03:47.920 --> 03:52.760
I think it's just the old Microsoft, the actual old Microsoft, the original one.

03:52.760 --> 03:58.040
The original one was endorsing Apple like hell when it made sense for them.

03:58.040 --> 04:01.440
They just grew too much and decided to take to their own hands.

04:01.440 --> 04:05.160
Come on, they were planning to backstab them the entire time.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.240
Yeah, I think so too.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.800
I think, I mean, I see what your point is.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.120
This would be a much more mature Microsoft, one that really is truly more interested in

04:14.120 --> 04:16.480
just creating software for all platforms.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.480
And maybe it'll be that.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.480
Okay.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.220
So let's, let's shift gears from this.

04:20.220 --> 04:23.900
Doesn't this also kind of guarantee like more support's going to be going towards like mind

04:23.900 --> 04:27.620
test and other open source Minecraft alternatives?

04:27.620 --> 04:28.620
I hope so.

04:28.620 --> 04:33.560
It could do, but it would, they would, they need to step up their game.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.560
Yeah.

04:34.560 --> 04:38.880
I mean, there's already other different like glowstone projects, all of this came out of

04:38.880 --> 04:44.160
the big craft's bucket fiasco and it's already started and I think this has only improved

04:44.160 --> 04:45.720
it and sped it up.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.120
Yeah, I think so.

04:47.120 --> 04:52.040
I mean, I think, I think like a Pope said, it's going to be, there's a long time to go.

04:52.040 --> 04:55.920
And now if Microsoft does it right, they're going to have more money behind Minecraft.

04:55.920 --> 04:59.640
Perhaps they could be, maybe they could make that even a better product even faster.

04:59.640 --> 05:03.320
So there could be more competition for mind test to keep up with.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.320
We'll see.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.320
We'll see.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.320
We'll see.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.320
Stay tuned and find out.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.320
Hopefully it doesn't mean anything bad for Linux users.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.320
I don't think it will.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.320
All right.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.320
Yeah.

05:11.320 --> 05:16.200
See, I didn't really think that was the main show topic, but I thought it was worth chatting

05:16.200 --> 05:20.040
about just cause I know it's a popular game on Linux, you know, that's what my son plays

05:20.040 --> 05:21.040
it on.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.600
He has a, uh, well now I'm going to put it, I don't know if it'll play on the Chromebook.

05:24.600 --> 05:29.040
I'm going to, I guess I could try get it so that my son can see it and see what he thinks.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.040
Yeah.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.040
I've got it.

05:31.040 --> 05:35.760
No, it's the C seven 20, uh, yeah, that's Intel.

05:35.760 --> 05:41.840
Uh, it's got, um, it's got an elementary OS on it right now, but he's got a HP laptop

05:41.840 --> 05:45.640
at home that has enter gross on it that has Minecraft installed.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.280
And that works really well for him.

05:48.280 --> 05:55.080
And interestingly too, I didn't expect this, but he's taken much better to the track pads

05:55.080 --> 06:00.920
on a laptop than a mouse because he started with touchscreen devices and then moved to

06:00.920 --> 06:01.920
the computer.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.300
He kind of graduated up to the computer.

06:03.300 --> 06:07.240
And so the touch on the pad, on the touch pad, on the click pad made much more sense

06:07.240 --> 06:08.400
to him than the mouse.

06:08.400 --> 06:13.760
Now he's learned the mouse too, but I, he just almost immediately was able to translate

06:13.760 --> 06:17.680
touchscreen to track pad, which I didn't quite expect cause it's not really a one-to-one

06:17.680 --> 06:18.960
thing, but.

06:18.960 --> 06:19.960
How old is he?

06:19.960 --> 06:20.960
Five.

06:20.960 --> 06:28.040
So Sam started off with a mouse and a keyboard, Minecraft, and then eventually I bought it

06:28.040 --> 06:31.880
on the Xbox 360 and he now favors the controller.

06:31.880 --> 06:32.880
He's no son of mine.

06:32.880 --> 06:39.320
I mean, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a mouse and keyboard kind of guy, but he, yeah, he's, he's big,

06:39.320 --> 06:45.520
you know, him and Sophie as well, who's 11, she's much prefers the controller now finds

06:45.520 --> 06:46.520
it a lot more accurate.

06:46.520 --> 06:50.360
And do they use the controller on the PC or are they sticking to the console?

06:50.360 --> 06:55.800
They generally only use the console because they, they use the multiplayer thing with

06:55.800 --> 06:56.800
the, what's the camera thing?

06:56.800 --> 06:57.800
Connect.

06:57.800 --> 06:58.800
Yeah.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.800
And they, they chat to their friends.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.720
So does that mean no custom servers?

07:02.720 --> 07:03.920
Like how does that work on the console?

07:03.920 --> 07:04.920
Are there.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.040
They make their own servers and their friends, they invite their friends, they call parties.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.040
And they're persistent worlds.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.040
Yeah.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.040
Yeah.

07:11.040 --> 07:14.040
They come back to, there's like a hundred of them saved on the Xbox.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.040
I don't know where they are.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.040
They're in the cloud probably.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.040
Yeah.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.520
So they're hosted like on the Xbox live servers.

07:18.520 --> 07:19.520
I guess so.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.520
Yeah.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.520
Huh.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.520
So it's way easier than PC servers.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.520
Yeah.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.000
You don't have to worry about, you know, spinning up a VDS.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.680
But you can only play with other, it's only other console custom worlds.

07:28.680 --> 07:29.680
Yes.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.680
Like you can't go console to PC.

07:30.680 --> 07:31.680
Correct.

07:31.680 --> 07:36.000
But there's a ton of people who have Xbox and Minecraft.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
No, I think it's like a huge game on there.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.040
I think, I think they looked at it as a huge game on iOS.

07:41.040 --> 07:44.520
It's a huge game on, on the Xbox and they went, huh, you know what we should do?

07:44.520 --> 07:45.760
We should probably own that.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.080
And plus you see, you got Notch there.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.880
He's like, yeah, I don't want to be part of a big company.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.480
I don't want to do this anymore.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.960
I mean, it was just sort of, I mean, wow.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.240
I think it was the time was right.

07:56.240 --> 08:01.320
He, I think he, I think it's pretty accurate what he was saying that he, you know, I don't

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
think that was a cop out.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.240
And I think it was fair to say that he's not CEO material.

08:05.240 --> 08:09.860
You can tell from his tweets and stuff, he likes just hacking around on stupid games

08:09.860 --> 08:14.360
and stuff and playing Ludum Dare and, and, you know, entering competitions.

08:14.360 --> 08:18.300
And that's not CEO material, CEOs don't do that.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.320
So I can see why he wanted to sell it.

08:20.320 --> 08:24.440
You know, two years ago or whatever he said, billion is my price and the only company who's

08:24.440 --> 08:26.960
going to pay two billion for Minecraft is Microsoft.

08:26.960 --> 08:27.960
Yeah.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.400
With their nice overseas cash pile.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.920
Blaster, are you a Minecraft player?

08:31.920 --> 08:32.920
Yes.

08:32.920 --> 08:33.920
I didn't know that.

08:33.920 --> 08:40.040
And actually the, the server on the servers on Xbox live actually don't, they're not spun

08:40.040 --> 08:41.400
up on Microsoft servers.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.440
You actually host it on your console and then the party connects to you.

08:44.440 --> 08:50.280
So your friends can't, you have to spin up your save and then some people have to come

08:50.280 --> 08:51.880
and connect to you while you're online.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.120
And then once you close Minecraft, it's offline.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.320
Wow.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.560
That's interesting.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.560
That makes sense.

08:58.560 --> 09:01.400
It works almost exactly like the mobile version.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.400
Okay.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.240
I like, see, I like the idea of a persistent world that people can be visiting all the

09:05.240 --> 09:06.240
time.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.400
That's, I think one of the coolest things when we had active, I don't know if they still

09:08.400 --> 09:09.400
are active or not.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.400
The Minecraft servers for Jupiter broadcast.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.400
You just go in there.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.400
Oh God, yeah.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.400
They are totally active.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.400
Yeah.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.720
So you can go in there and there's just tons of people working on stuff.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.720
So that's really cool.

09:17.720 --> 09:23.360
My kids play on that as well and that's, that's another thing is having a game that your kids

09:23.360 --> 09:25.400
can play, which is a safe environment.

09:25.400 --> 09:30.440
Like if it's a curated server like Jupiter is where you know that the people aren't going

09:30.440 --> 09:35.320
to mess about with your kids and you're not going to get dangerous people talking to them.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.840
You can leave them playing on the PC for a while.

09:37.840 --> 09:38.840
Yeah.

09:38.840 --> 09:42.880
You know, it's cool when my kids come in and they say, Hey dad, do you want to play on

09:42.880 --> 09:43.880
the JB server?

09:43.880 --> 09:44.880
That's quite cool.

09:44.880 --> 09:45.880
You know?

09:45.880 --> 09:46.880
Yeah, it is really cool.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.320
And I like the idea too that, I mean, I think sure you could make the argument that, you

09:50.320 --> 09:54.120
know, it has to be maybe try to be balanced with, with other things, but at the same time

09:54.120 --> 09:58.820
it's like, out of all the video games you could play for kids, Minecraft really seems

09:58.820 --> 10:03.500
like it's gotta be not like, like super like healthier educational or something, but it

10:03.500 --> 10:08.220
seems like it's, it's cultivating something like a creativity and building and problem

10:08.220 --> 10:12.760
solving and, and, and, and resource management and all of these things that are actually

10:12.760 --> 10:14.400
really good life skills.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.400
Yeah.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.400
Okay.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.400
Yeah.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.520
You know, you can try and make an argument for it in the same way that when I had a Sinclair

10:19.520 --> 10:23.520
Spectrum back in 1980, I would try and make the argument that I was doing my homework.

10:23.520 --> 10:24.520
Yeah.

10:24.520 --> 10:25.520
Yeah.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.520
Yeah.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.520
Yeah.

10:27.520 --> 10:28.520
Same thing goes with Minecraft.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.520
Yeah.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.520
It's educational mom.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.520
Really.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.520
Yeah.

10:32.520 --> 10:33.520
But it's also, yeah.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.520
Yeah.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.520
Minecraft has a really cool server too.

10:36.520 --> 10:37.520
Yeah.

10:37.520 --> 10:38.520
Yeah.

10:38.520 --> 10:39.520
Some of the stuff they have on there.

10:39.520 --> 10:40.520
Yeah.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.520
Yeah.

10:41.520 --> 10:42.520
They have a really great server.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.440
I love that my son learned about smelting and different types of trees from Minecraft.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.440
That's quite cool.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.440
That is really cool.

10:47.440 --> 10:48.440
Hmm.

10:48.440 --> 10:54.840
Well, the only thing I was thinking that maybe would change like the game, like I, I would,

10:54.840 --> 10:57.000
if I was gonna look at my crystal ball, it seems like they're still going to ship to

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
all the same platforms.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.720
They're probably not going to remove any features.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.320
They'll probably make some things better and maybe make it more developer accessible.

11:03.320 --> 11:09.200
But then you got to wonder if like years down the road, if there's just like really hard

11:09.200 --> 11:11.200
things to measure that just never pan out.

11:11.200 --> 11:15.040
Like this is a bad example, I think, but I'm working on the idea still like say like, say

11:15.040 --> 11:19.920
like on Mojang's like five year roadmap, they have like this really awesome Twitch slash

11:19.920 --> 11:21.840
YouTube live streaming integration.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.200
I made the argument in tech talk today that potentially like maybe it was even going to

11:25.200 --> 11:29.240
be server side where on the Linux server you'd have like this virtual camera that could live

11:29.240 --> 11:32.020
stream multiple angles to different streaming services, right?

11:32.020 --> 11:36.000
Well now that, now that Microsoft owns it, you know, they're not going to, they're not

11:36.000 --> 11:39.100
going to integrate a feature that connects directly into Google's live streaming platform

11:39.100 --> 11:41.220
or their, or Amazon's now either.

11:41.220 --> 11:44.720
So there could be some things like that that would have been cross pollination because

11:44.720 --> 11:48.520
Mojang was independent and didn't have any entrenched market interest that would influence

11:48.520 --> 11:50.440
those types of decisions.

11:50.440 --> 11:54.800
Now that freedom has been removed from them and there's going to be those types of biases

11:54.800 --> 11:59.200
that will sort of form the future direction of what the game can and cannot do.

11:59.200 --> 12:07.000
That's already happened once in the Twitch TV integration is Windows only.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
Hmm.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Wow.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
That sucks.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Yeah.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Yeah.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
I mean, screw those guys, right?

12:13.000 --> 12:16.260
I think that's more, I think that's more that they're using a third party library.

12:16.260 --> 12:19.240
So whenever you bring in third party stuff that you haven't written, you're dependent

12:19.240 --> 12:23.720
upon whatever platforms they support and the, whatever library they've used for Twitch

12:23.720 --> 12:26.560
TV doesn't support anything other than Windows, I believe.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.560
Yeah.

12:27.560 --> 12:28.960
It's, it's because it's not Java at all.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.120
I actually believe it's a DLL file.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.120
Like it's brought down.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.120
Oh sweet.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.120
I love DLLs.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.120
I know.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.120
Sweet.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.120
Isn't it a beautiful thing?

12:37.120 --> 12:39.720
You know how I like, you know how I like my libraries?

12:39.720 --> 12:47.200
Dynamic and lean.

12:47.200 --> 12:51.200
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's prepared to finally just

12:51.200 --> 12:55.000
break down and invest in a caffeine IV.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.800
My name is Chris.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.800
My name is Matt.

12:57.800 --> 12:58.800
Hey Matt.

12:58.800 --> 12:59.800
Oh man.

12:59.800 --> 13:03.060
I did one of these things where I, I had a couple of rough nights and then I was dumb

13:03.060 --> 13:06.840
last night and I had too much to drink, Matt.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.280
I had too much to drink and I woke up in the middle of the night with a hangover, like

13:09.280 --> 13:11.840
in the middle of the night and I couldn't go back to sleep.

13:11.840 --> 13:12.840
And it wasn't even that much.

13:12.840 --> 13:13.840
I'm just a lightweight now, Matt.

13:13.840 --> 13:14.840
What's that mean?

13:14.840 --> 13:15.840
Does that mean I'm getting too old to drink?

13:15.840 --> 13:18.860
I got to just stick to my prune juice.

13:18.860 --> 13:21.600
You need the chat room there to like tell you all the things that you should have done

13:21.600 --> 13:23.280
beforehand because that usually really helps.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.280
That's true.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.280
Especially like, you know, hey Chris, you need to drink more water.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.280
Right.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.280
You need HTML5.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.280
Right.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.280
You know, you need some other stuff.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.280
Yeah.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.680
You know, I do like to get, I do like the hindsight 2020 advice that the chat room is

13:32.680 --> 13:34.880
so good at providing.

13:34.880 --> 13:35.880
And they're doing it out of love.

13:35.880 --> 13:36.880
I mean, it's a great thing.

13:36.880 --> 13:37.880
It is.

13:37.880 --> 13:41.760
All right, so we're going to do a show today out of love.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.040
We got a lot of your feedback to get through this week.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.040
Some really good stuff.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.780
I've picked the best of the best.

13:46.780 --> 13:51.580
And then Aaron Saigo took to Google Plus early one morning and said the community manager

13:51.580 --> 13:54.960
role is a fraud and a farce.

13:54.960 --> 13:55.960
And we'll break it down.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.960
We'll talk about it.

13:56.960 --> 14:01.040
I have a feeling that there may be some disagreements in the show today on that topic and we'll

14:01.040 --> 14:02.680
bring in our mumble room.

14:02.680 --> 14:07.680
And then after that, we're going to get into a few other topics time remaining and pertaining,

14:07.680 --> 14:12.480
including potentially a little bit of info about some future changes coming to some Linux

14:12.480 --> 14:13.480
distributions near you.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.920
So we'll talk about all of that stuff as well as some additional links towards the end of

14:16.920 --> 14:17.920
the show.

14:17.920 --> 14:18.920
Got a lot of stuff to cover today.

14:18.920 --> 14:19.920
I'm just going through it right now.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.680
I'm looking at the papers and I'm thinking, dang, this is looking like a pretty busy week.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.160
I think our news cycle has come back.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.560
I think the news is starting to pick back up again.

14:27.560 --> 14:31.480
In fact, we've seen some really big things go down this week.

14:31.480 --> 14:35.240
So I think we're going to have a huge news segment on the Linux Action Show on Sunday.

14:35.240 --> 14:40.680
But today, our duty is to focus on the feedback, to focus on the people.

14:40.680 --> 14:44.800
And so Stefan writes in and he says, hey, Chris and Matt, I don't know if you have already

14:44.800 --> 14:50.640
seen the leaked preview of Windows 9, but in case you didn't know, there's quite some,

14:50.640 --> 14:54.920
let's call it progress in this hell of a stagnation that Microsoft calls Windows.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.920
Anyways, to keep it short, they integrated multiple workspaces.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.420
Oh, nice.

14:59.420 --> 15:03.200
And when they finally developed something usable, however, you might think it looks

15:03.200 --> 15:04.320
a little familiar.

15:04.320 --> 15:09.600
My biggest concern is that I almost hear these F-ers at Microsoft, fanboys claim that Microsoft

15:09.600 --> 15:13.320
opened up a whole new perspective of user experiences.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.600
And I can predict that if you tell them multiple workspaces isn't something new because Apple

15:16.600 --> 15:20.440
and Linux had this for years, they'll respond with, but Microsoft made it awesome and usable.

15:20.440 --> 15:25.680
So have you seen this implementation of virtual desktops on Windows 9?

15:25.680 --> 15:26.680
I have.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.440
And just the interface as a whole, not just the implementation, but the interface as a

15:30.440 --> 15:34.560
whole is the best box of Crayola crayons I've ever seen.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.320
Yeah, it is very, yeah.

15:36.320 --> 15:39.000
It looks like iOS 7 smacked Windows.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Absolutely.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.160
We throw enough color at it, people are going to think it looks great.

15:42.160 --> 15:46.720
And that, and just, I'm so blown away at how they come up with concepts.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.400
I can't even wrap my brain around it.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.240
I don't even, I don't even know.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.240
I don't even know.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.200
So I have it in the video version here.

15:53.200 --> 15:59.460
You can see their dynamic workspaces, all a gnome and, or, and, and of course other desktops

15:59.460 --> 16:00.460
as well.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.200
I guess actually Mac OS 10 has dynamic workspaces as well.

16:03.200 --> 16:06.000
And then you can see, you can drag the windows around and move them.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.840
I, you know, I mean, I'm not going to use this because I don't use Windows.

16:09.840 --> 16:12.200
I guess it's nice to have it for Windows users finally.

16:12.200 --> 16:18.480
It is, I think what is interesting is like, remember how like Windows 8 came out and Microsoft's

16:18.480 --> 16:20.480
all like, yeah, so the desktop's dead.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.800
We have that classic interface, quote unquote, when you need it, but you should do everything

16:24.800 --> 16:26.200
in the new modern UI.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.200
That's the future.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.400
And now this version of Windows is coming out and they're like, hey, so we know you

16:30.400 --> 16:31.400
like the desktops.

16:31.400 --> 16:32.400
We're going to give you more desktops.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.440
You can in fact have unlimited desktops.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.480
How about some desktops, everybody?

16:36.480 --> 16:37.480
Exactly.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.000
And it's like, and not only that, but we're going to borrow it.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.120
We're going to, we're going to travel back in time and basically provide an implementation

16:42.120 --> 16:43.920
that quite honestly looks a bit dated.

16:43.920 --> 16:44.920
Yeah.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.160
It looks actually a little clunky to me.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.160
It's not very smooth.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.160
It does.

16:48.160 --> 16:52.520
It feels a little bit like a, a little bit like an early KDE, maybe two point something

16:52.520 --> 16:56.280
kind of, you know, thrust up some cookies on top of something.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.280
I don't know.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.440
They need to add a little, a little, a little, a little animation factor in there.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.440
Give it some, give it some jazz.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.440
Right.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.440
Put a little jazz in that desktop.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.440
Microsoft Biz.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.440
Microsoft Biz.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.440
There you go.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.440
Yeah.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.440
Cause that's what makes it usable.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.440
A spinning cube.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.440
Yeah.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.440
We'll add a spinning cube.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.440
It is funny though.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.680
So when they decide to reinvest in the desktop and sort of double down on it, what do they

17:13.680 --> 17:14.680
do?

17:14.680 --> 17:16.720
They go rip off features from Unix desktops.

17:16.720 --> 17:17.720
Absolutely.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.720
So there you go.

17:18.720 --> 17:19.720
One stop shopping.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.800
Redmond has indeed restarted their copy machines.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.960
So yeah, I thought we'd just, it's always fun to kind of, you know, poke at my, poke

17:25.960 --> 17:26.960
at Microsoft.

17:26.960 --> 17:27.960
I mean, come on.

17:27.960 --> 17:28.960
We had to.

17:28.960 --> 17:29.960
It's so easy.

17:29.960 --> 17:30.960
So Eric, you're here, right?

17:30.960 --> 17:31.960
You're still here, Eric.

17:31.960 --> 17:32.960
Good.

17:32.960 --> 17:33.960
We have a question that is right up your alley.

17:33.960 --> 17:39.120
So Scotty ZA writes in, he says, hello, I'm loving, with a U, all the JB awesomeness.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.800
I have a new Dell PC on the way.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.920
The first thing I'm going to do is drop kick Windows 8 and install some Ubuntu goodness

17:44.920 --> 17:45.920
on there.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.400
It's going to be the gnome variety of it.

17:47.400 --> 17:52.280
The Dell came with, comes with a touch screen and I was wondering how the gnome touch, touch

17:52.280 --> 17:56.320
gestures are and if there's anything I need to watch out for or things that could improve

17:56.320 --> 17:57.320
the experience.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.600
Pseudo thanks, Scotty ZA.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.600
So Eric, I know you got a touch screen laptop.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.800
You've been trying out gnome, KDE and Unity with it.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.360
What are your thoughts with regards to gnome's sort of touch features that are there right

18:07.360 --> 18:08.360
now?

18:08.360 --> 18:13.160
Well, the gnome touch features that are there right now in 3.12 are not up to the par of

18:13.160 --> 18:14.160
Unity yet.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.920
So you can't resize your window.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.740
You can't, you can drag your windows, but only from the title bar.

18:19.740 --> 18:24.800
And I've noticed that gnome shell will tend to crash every now and then if you try that.

18:24.800 --> 18:25.800
Oh, really?

18:25.800 --> 18:26.800
Ouch.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.800
Yeah.

18:27.800 --> 18:28.800
So it's not up to par.

18:28.800 --> 18:34.280
Gnome 3.14 coming out later this month, if not the beginning of next month, that should

18:34.280 --> 18:36.920
solidify their touch screen.

18:36.920 --> 18:41.480
So 3.14 right now though, in your experience so far, Unity is the champion when it comes

18:41.480 --> 18:43.080
to full touch screen support.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.080
Correct.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.080
Yeah.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.040
And you also, does gnome have an onscreen keyboard?

18:47.040 --> 18:50.760
I do, but you'd have, I really don't know.

18:50.760 --> 18:51.760
It's handy.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.760
I'm sure you could get one.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.840
I mean, the one that comes with Unity is pretty nice and it's really easy to use.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.600
It's a standard one, so I think you could just load it anywhere.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.840
But anyways, so it sounds like, so what?

19:00.840 --> 19:04.120
You can close windows, maybe you could open the activities menu, but you're not going

19:04.120 --> 19:08.040
to be resizing windows or dragging windows around or, and there's no right click or anything

19:08.040 --> 19:09.040
like that?

19:09.040 --> 19:10.040
Right.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.040
There's no right click.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.600
It's just, it doesn't work very well.

19:12.600 --> 19:18.000
I mean, the best touch screen interfaces they have is the activities menu itself, but also

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Right.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
I would think so.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Yeah.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Yeah.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.480
The activities menu itself is very touch screen friendly, but also the lock screen, but beyond

19:24.480 --> 19:31.640
that the window management in 3.12 is not up to par, 3.14 is getting there, is going

19:31.640 --> 19:32.640
to start to get there.

19:32.640 --> 19:33.640
Okay.

19:33.640 --> 19:40.720
And I know I asked you, but you've been trying it out too on KDE Plasma 4?

19:40.720 --> 19:42.280
Plasma 4 and Plasma 5.

19:42.280 --> 19:43.600
It's still not up to par.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.520
They haven't done anything with multi-touch gestures or anything.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.520
Okay.

19:47.520 --> 19:54.240
And by the way, a little correction, Wikileaks pointed out in the chat room, GNOME 3.12 does

19:54.240 --> 19:58.280
not have this, but GNOME 3.14 is going to have a long presses right click.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.280
Okay.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.280
Oh, okay.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.280
Oh yes.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.280
You know what?

20:02.280 --> 20:03.280
I've read about that.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.280
Right-o.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.280
Yes.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.280
I do recalls.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.280
Do I hear music?

20:07.280 --> 20:08.280
Oh yeah.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.280
Hey, it's my daily collections call.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.280
Of course, I'm not in collections, but somebody is that gave out my number.

20:12.280 --> 20:15.800
So this is the default Sailfish OS ringtone.

20:15.800 --> 20:16.800
Nice right?

20:16.800 --> 20:17.800
I can dance to that.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.800
Doesn't that sound good?

20:18.800 --> 20:19.800
Yeah.

20:19.800 --> 20:20.800
Sounds awesome.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.800
And I've got a cool pirate ship in the background.

20:22.800 --> 20:27.120
Oh, I wasn't able to answer it in time.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.120
Darn.

20:28.120 --> 20:34.920
I really like the Sailfish OS call interface, but it's a little funky because sometimes

20:34.920 --> 20:39.200
you have to swipe in a certain direction to answer the call and if you're just late enough

20:39.200 --> 20:42.880
it's that that that animation of making the swipe is just long enough that you miss the

20:42.880 --> 20:43.880
call.

20:43.880 --> 20:44.880
It's all right.

20:44.880 --> 20:45.880
It's cool.

20:45.880 --> 20:46.880
I'm just experimenting with it.

20:46.880 --> 20:47.880
I'm just experimenting with it.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.880
All right, Matt.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.120
You know what else I'm experimenting with?

20:50.120 --> 20:56.480
My mind over at linuxacademy.com go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to get our special discount

20:56.480 --> 21:00.080
deal linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

21:00.080 --> 21:04.880
So I've told you a lot about Linux Academy, how they're always working on their courseware,

21:04.880 --> 21:06.600
new features and things like that.

21:06.600 --> 21:13.440
Today, I got an email from Anthony, the founder of linuxacademy.com and he says he's passing

21:13.440 --> 21:17.200
along some of the new exciting things they're working on and it's really something.

21:17.200 --> 21:21.280
He says, our new lab platform now allows the users to have four running Linux servers at

21:21.280 --> 21:22.320
one time.

21:22.320 --> 21:26.640
You can have any distribution you would like from a list as well as two public host names

21:26.640 --> 21:28.000
for each server.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.880
You can even assign each server a role.

21:29.880 --> 21:33.240
Let's say you want to have a DB server and another one to be a DNS server.

21:33.240 --> 21:36.040
You can now label those roles to help you remember which lab you're working with and

21:36.040 --> 21:38.520
you can have people, you can work with other people now.

21:38.520 --> 21:42.200
They have cool new learning and plans too that allow users to select daily availability

21:42.200 --> 21:46.040
and based on that availability, a study plan is automatically created for them.

21:46.040 --> 21:49.600
So you say, I have this much time available and they will generate a plan that you can

21:49.600 --> 21:51.580
go through and learn something.

21:51.580 --> 21:55.040
Learning plans will give you the lessons and quizzes and labs that are due on each day

21:55.040 --> 21:58.880
as well as even send you email reminders that you have items due on that day.

21:58.880 --> 22:03.880
Based on your availability, it will even give you a projected completion date of the course

22:03.880 --> 22:06.280
with some extra time included for studying.

22:06.280 --> 22:09.040
How freaking cool is that, right?

22:09.040 --> 22:13.160
He says, we're also really excited to announce the immediate availability of a few extra

22:13.160 --> 22:14.720
courses we've been working on.

22:14.720 --> 22:20.300
Today we've announced Chef Fundamentals, CentOS 7 Enterprise updates as well as Apache Tomcat.

22:20.300 --> 22:24.200
We've launched our deploy and manage open stack on Ubuntu and Icehouse which is 50%

22:24.200 --> 22:26.020
complete and they're working on it right now.

22:26.020 --> 22:28.960
We have a list of 14 upcoming courses throughout the remainder of the year.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.400
He's going to send me updates when they've got them.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.400
Isn't that awesome?

22:32.400 --> 22:34.120
Sure, they're doing all this stuff.

22:34.120 --> 22:38.420
You know, real servers with host names that you can have people publicly log in, these

22:38.420 --> 22:43.600
automated coursewares, these learning plans, 350 new videos and content before the end

22:43.600 --> 22:49.720
of the year, more scenario-based learning labs than ever before, all of these new additions,

22:49.720 --> 22:50.960
no price increase.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.640
You just get them as part of your Linux Academy subscription.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.160
It just comes as part of the subscription.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.520
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged right now.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.800
You'll get that 33% discount.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.580
That makes it a great deal.

23:02.580 --> 23:06.480
You can go over there and learn courses on R-Sync and OpenStack and AWS, pick from any

23:06.480 --> 23:08.040
of the seven plus Linux distributions.

23:08.040 --> 23:12.120
The courseware will automatically adjust the documentation so that way it matches the distribution

23:12.120 --> 23:15.720
you've chosen which is a really great way to also get up to speed on another distro

23:15.720 --> 23:19.380
if you've taken on a job where you have to change your distro.

23:19.380 --> 23:22.520
What a great way to get up to speed or if you know it's time to finally make that R-Sync

23:22.520 --> 23:25.120
backup script, why not go take the R-Sync courseware?

23:25.120 --> 23:28.520
And they're always adding new stuff as well as live videos and all that kind of stuff.

23:28.520 --> 23:33.080
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a really big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

23:33.080 --> 23:34.080
the Unplugged program.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.240
You guys rock and great work you guys on the new updates.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.480
That's crazy awesome.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.680
I love the automated learning courses.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.880
That's man.

23:42.880 --> 23:43.880
If I...

23:43.880 --> 23:44.880
They'll get you learning on.

23:44.880 --> 23:45.880
Well, I'm just thinking like, you know, I could go in there and say, all right, I need

23:45.880 --> 23:49.000
a learning plan and I've got, I've got, you know, this much time this week to do it.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.720
I just, I love that.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.720
I think that's a really great system.

23:51.720 --> 23:52.720
All right.

23:52.720 --> 23:58.040
So Alec writes in, we had a ton, a ton, a ton of email about our Assistant D discussion

23:58.040 --> 24:02.800
and I think a couple of people felt like it was our first time.

24:02.800 --> 24:06.320
Maybe they were kind of new to the show and they didn't realize that we've done past episodes

24:06.320 --> 24:07.320
on this.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.900
So they felt, some people wrote in and felt like we left some, some details out and sort

24:10.900 --> 24:12.680
of jumped in mid conversation.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.920
So I apologize if that is how you felt.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.640
I would suggest maybe go check the Unplugged back catalogue.

24:17.640 --> 24:20.520
We've done a couple of episodes on it with some really good discussion that does fill

24:20.520 --> 24:22.120
in some of the background details.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.600
But Alec wrote in, he says, hi Chris, Matt and chat room.

24:24.600 --> 24:29.000
And I thought Alec had one of the more interesting anti-System D concerns.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.200
Like, like he's not like opposed to System D, but he's bringing up a concern about System

24:33.200 --> 24:37.120
D that I think maybe has some merit worth discussing, discussing outside of what we

24:37.120 --> 24:40.600
normally hear about, you know, some of the other issues that we've discussed before.

24:40.600 --> 24:44.600
He says, I want to chime in with my thoughts about the recent System D discussion.

24:44.600 --> 24:48.400
As a system administrator, I like System D and its innovative new features like D-Bus

24:48.400 --> 24:49.400
and socket activation.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.400
Yeah.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.400
You know what?

24:51.400 --> 24:52.400
I agree with that.

24:52.400 --> 24:56.040
But I have some concerns about its long-term viability.

24:56.040 --> 24:59.880
From what I see, the main problem with System D is that it's a large attack surface, which

24:59.880 --> 25:02.280
could lead to security problems in the future.

25:02.280 --> 25:06.880
Also, because System D will be adopted by all Linux, I fear it could become a major

25:06.880 --> 25:07.880
target for attackers.

25:07.880 --> 25:11.560
In short, I think System D is a good thing for Linux right now.

25:11.560 --> 25:15.240
But in the future, it could become insecure and unmaintainable.

25:15.240 --> 25:19.280
And because more and more projects are starting to depend on System D, it could become a painful

25:19.280 --> 25:21.480
process to move away from System D.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.200
Thanks for all the awesome shows, Alec.

25:23.200 --> 25:29.400
And I want to add to that, even outside of security, what about just code creep where

25:29.400 --> 25:33.940
something gets to be such a massive project and it impacts so many distributions and so

25:33.940 --> 25:38.960
many users whenever you change it, that it sort of becomes like this weight, this anchor

25:38.960 --> 25:46.160
on Linux because you have this whole layer now that has to be updated and it has potentially

25:46.160 --> 25:47.800
dramatic effects across the board.

25:47.800 --> 25:52.000
Obviously, there's ways and updates that maybe would have very minimal impacts, but you have

25:52.000 --> 25:56.040
to wonder if that could become a source of stagnation.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.360
I wonder what you think, Matt.

25:57.360 --> 26:01.800
Do you think there's a potential that maybe System D is going to make a large attack surface

26:01.800 --> 26:05.280
for Linux, a common attack platform, or maybe an anchor that slows us down?

26:05.280 --> 26:10.420
Or do you think the folks at Red Hat and people working on System D can stay on top of it?

26:10.420 --> 26:12.200
I think at this point they can stay on top of it.

26:12.200 --> 26:16.800
I think it's going to be something that they need to be vigilantly aware of and proactive

26:16.800 --> 26:20.680
on because you never know, it could develop into what that concern addresses.

26:20.680 --> 26:24.040
But I think at this point it's too early to tell and I don't see any point in borrowing

26:24.040 --> 26:25.040
trouble.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.920
I'm not saying to fall asleep at the wheel, but I'm just saying let's keep our eyes open.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.160
But at the same time, let's go ahead and keep pushing forward.

26:30.160 --> 26:34.100
It hasn't created any problems yet that are really significant that I'm aware of for my

26:34.100 --> 26:35.600
personal use.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.000
Others may have other gripes, I don't know.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.480
For me personally, it's been great.

26:39.480 --> 26:40.480
Okay, Daredevil.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.880
And you think it's not about security, but something else?

26:42.880 --> 26:43.880
Yes.

26:43.880 --> 26:50.680
So we saw what happened, like Linux as the kernel is super complicated now to get in

26:50.680 --> 26:53.160
as a maintainer or to start contributing.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.320
It's famous for that.

26:54.320 --> 26:58.440
That is kind of the problem that I find.

26:58.440 --> 27:01.760
Not the security aspect, we can solve security aspects.

27:01.760 --> 27:06.400
I mean, we've been solving them in multiple fronts and now there's even a specialized

27:06.400 --> 27:07.400
group for it.

27:07.400 --> 27:12.680
But I think companies getting a hold on who maintains System D now becomes more and more

27:12.680 --> 27:15.360
parts being just company control.

27:15.360 --> 27:21.480
Even though community always have a say, that's actually more dangerous than the security

27:21.480 --> 27:22.480
aspect.

27:22.480 --> 27:23.480
Yeah.

27:23.480 --> 27:27.080
I think you have to look at the kernel and you say, yeah, the kernel is not a one to

27:27.080 --> 27:32.920
one analog, but it is an interesting way to compare it to a large bit of code that obviously

27:32.920 --> 27:37.200
impacts every Linux distribution and even mobile devices.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.780
And yet we make that work, don't we?

27:38.780 --> 27:39.780
We have that working.

27:39.780 --> 27:43.480
I think it's in part because we have the right people on the job and I feel like right now

27:43.480 --> 27:46.480
we have the right people on the job, but these things can change.

27:46.480 --> 27:51.600
I do not know if I totally buy in with Alec on the... And I think Alec's not the only

27:51.600 --> 27:55.400
one who's worried about the quote unquote System D lock in.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.840
I'm not so worried about that really.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.380
It's kind of a funny thing.

28:00.380 --> 28:05.180
One of the reasons we all want a free and open platform is because we want to avoid

28:05.180 --> 28:08.240
those problems and then we still worry about those problems even though it's open source

28:08.240 --> 28:10.480
code with documented APIs and things like that.

28:10.480 --> 28:15.520
So at some point we kind of just have to acknowledge we have to adopt a technology, but realize

28:15.520 --> 28:17.720
that we can build our way out too if we need to.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.560
I don't think it's as much lock in as people think.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.560
All right, Fred, what do you think?

28:22.560 --> 28:30.120
No, I just wanted to mention that I think there were these patches to get System D working

28:30.120 --> 28:39.040
on BSD systems early days of System D and they were not accepted because the developers

28:39.040 --> 28:45.080
thought they only wanted to target Linux and didn't accept patches for portability.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.080
Very good.

28:46.080 --> 28:50.000
And Blackout rightly points out... Sorry, I just mentioned I didn't want to lose track

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
of this.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.500
Almost 600 people contribute to System D, 200 alone in the last 12 months.

28:54.500 --> 28:58.720
So there's a lot of people that are working on System D.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.680
I think that seems like a lot of eyeballs.

29:00.680 --> 29:04.360
I mean, it seems like a lot of people have got their fingers on the pulse and are watching

29:04.360 --> 29:05.360
what's going on.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.480
To me, that's my perspective.

29:06.480 --> 29:12.080
So here's what we did, is Producer Q5 says put together a simple System D opinion survey

29:12.080 --> 29:16.080
that we put out for folks to go take advantage of and just plug through the questions and

29:16.080 --> 29:19.360
just so we can get a little data to kind of see where everybody's coming from in this

29:19.360 --> 29:22.560
... where their heads at... Jack, close your mic.

29:22.560 --> 29:27.000
And so it's a simple System D opinion survey and it's up on the subreddit right now.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.240
I'll have it linked in the show notes.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.840
We've got quite a bit of responses.

29:29.840 --> 29:33.600
Q5 is going to be releasing the results in the future.

29:33.600 --> 29:37.240
And it's not like a definitive scientific study, but I think it'll be interesting to

29:37.240 --> 29:40.080
see where people who have different opinions, where they all stand and what their experience

29:40.080 --> 29:42.840
level is and things like that.

29:42.840 --> 29:45.880
So we'll have that linked in the show notes and if you'd like to participate in the survey,

29:45.880 --> 29:48.000
we'll talk about the results in an upcoming episode.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.240
And also you can keep sending your System D feedback in if you've got something really

29:52.240 --> 29:53.240
good.

29:53.240 --> 29:55.120
We'll put it on there, but either way I'll even read it so that way we can just at least

29:55.120 --> 29:57.400
incorporate it into our opinions.

29:57.400 --> 30:02.280
Hey, speaking of producers, we just heard from Eric a little bit ago and I want to plug

30:02.280 --> 30:05.560
something for Producer Michael aka RottenCorps.

30:05.560 --> 30:12.040
YouGet Beta 2 is coming and available for beta testing and YouGet is a great downloader

30:12.040 --> 30:13.040
for Linux.

30:13.040 --> 30:16.260
We've covered it before in the Linux Action Show and RottenCorps is one of the developers

30:16.260 --> 30:17.260
for it.

30:17.260 --> 30:19.700
And they just put out a new beta for their brand new version coming out.

30:19.700 --> 30:20.700
So we'll link to that in the show notes.

30:20.700 --> 30:26.000
It's a great downloader, YouGet, and it's my preferred way if I download large ISO images

30:26.000 --> 30:28.680
and I don't want to leave my browser running and I'm doing, I like, you know, if I'm not

30:28.680 --> 30:32.800
doing the torrent, I generally do the torrent, but if for some reason I'm doing an HTTP download,

30:32.800 --> 30:33.800
boom.

30:33.800 --> 30:34.800
Boom.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.800
There you go.

30:35.800 --> 30:36.800
YouGet is where it goes, Matt, like a boss.

30:36.800 --> 30:37.800
Nice.

30:37.800 --> 30:38.800
Like a boss.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.640
Hey, speaking of like a boss, I want to tell you about something else that's like a boss

30:41.640 --> 30:42.640
and that's DigitalOcean.

30:42.640 --> 30:47.120
Go over to DigitalOcean.com right now, DigitalOcean.com.

30:47.120 --> 30:51.640
Not just walk, not just trot, but full on gallop because we've got a promo code that

30:51.640 --> 30:54.560
will get you two months for free of a DigitalOcean droplet.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.160
I know, it's crazy, if you use the promo code unplugged September, you're going to get armed

30:58.160 --> 30:59.160
with a $10 credit.

30:59.160 --> 31:00.160
Oh.

31:00.160 --> 31:05.200
So you see that value there, you get, for $10 you get two months of DigitalOcean service.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.200
Why?

31:06.200 --> 31:08.640
Because they have pricing plans that start at only $5 per month.

31:08.640 --> 31:13.920
That'll get you a 512 megabyte RAM droplet with a 20 gigabyte SSD, one blazing fast CPU,

31:13.920 --> 31:16.760
and a terabyte of transfer connected to tier one bandwidth.

31:16.760 --> 31:17.800
You don't know what DigitalOcean is?

31:17.800 --> 31:21.600
My friend DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

31:21.600 --> 31:23.280
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

31:23.280 --> 31:26.840
And they've got droplet centers everywhere, or maybe you call them data centers, I don't

31:26.840 --> 31:27.840
know.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.480
Say like, oh I don't know, New York, you heard of that?

31:29.480 --> 31:30.480
You heard of New York, right?

31:30.480 --> 31:34.240
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, and they're rolling out new features all the

31:34.240 --> 31:35.240
time.

31:35.240 --> 31:38.040
Their interface is crazy simple and intuitive.

31:38.040 --> 31:41.560
Their control panel is very powerful, but if you want to even go beyond that, they've

31:41.560 --> 31:44.680
got a straightforward API that you can take advantage of.

31:44.680 --> 31:48.480
DigitalOcean has also recently rolled out IPv6 in some of their data centers, CoreOS,

31:48.480 --> 31:51.040
private networking, it gets better and better and better.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.040
One of the things I love about the private networking is not only does that allow you

31:54.040 --> 31:59.440
to build the etcd cluster you're gonna need to configure your CoreOS rigs, but it also

31:59.440 --> 32:03.520
allows you to have say, a front end web server with a back end database server that isn't

32:03.520 --> 32:07.380
exposed to the internet, and the best part is, there's no charge for the transfer over

32:07.380 --> 32:08.560
that private link.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.240
That's how awesome DigitalOcean is.

32:10.240 --> 32:14.000
Something else that's kind of cool, and another great reason to hold on to Unplug September,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.540
you can also do hourly pricing over at DigitalOcean.

32:16.540 --> 32:20.420
This is super useful if you're doing testing, and you need to do it up somewhere that actually

32:20.420 --> 32:23.800
has decent performance, where a lot of people can get to it, and you can turn it on, turn

32:23.800 --> 32:26.440
it off, take snapshots, deploy, redeploy.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.680
This is a great use of their hourly pricing structure.

32:28.680 --> 32:33.040
It's so awesome, and their control panel makes it crazy easy to just get up and going.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.400
DigitalOcean.com.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.880
Unplug September when you check out, and a big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

32:37.880 --> 32:38.880
Linux Unplugged.

32:38.880 --> 32:42.240
I'll tell you, I keep spinning up droplets, I kind of say, oh, I really need to do that

32:42.240 --> 32:43.240
one thing.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.240
And I'll just spin up a droplet.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.240
It's great.

32:45.240 --> 32:46.240
Oh yeah.

32:46.240 --> 32:47.240
Oh yeah.

32:47.240 --> 32:52.480
Aaron Saigo lit the world on fire via Google Plus yesterday at 3.01 a.m.

32:52.480 --> 32:56.120
I don't know why he's posting at 3.01 a.m., but that's what he was.

32:56.120 --> 33:00.000
And I'm just going to read a few highlights, and then we can get into the meat and potatoes

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
of it here.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
He says, here we go.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.520
Flamethrowers on everyone.

33:03.520 --> 33:04.520
Here's what I feel.

33:04.520 --> 33:08.980
The community manager role that is increasingly common in the free software world is a fraud

33:08.980 --> 33:10.260
and a farce.

33:10.260 --> 33:13.880
The community manager role is a fraud and a farce, he says.

33:13.880 --> 33:21.080
If your community has a quote-unquote manager, then it isn't being treated as a community

33:21.080 --> 33:24.320
and probably isn't a community to begin with.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.620
Community has an actual meaning that transcends a crowd.

33:27.620 --> 33:32.480
Community is a structure derived from the self-determination of shared values.

33:32.480 --> 33:37.320
Communities don't have managers, synthetic organizations do.

33:37.320 --> 33:41.640
Nearly all community managers in free software ecosystems work for companies that own and

33:41.640 --> 33:46.900
manage products that that community they are managing are built around, and that's not

33:46.900 --> 33:47.900
a coincidence.

33:47.900 --> 33:52.840
Communities, real ones, have facilitators and leaders of various forms and stripes.

33:52.840 --> 33:57.640
It's okay if they do get paid, and if they're able to spend time and energy facilitating

33:57.640 --> 34:01.600
and leading, but they damn sure are not managers of the community.

34:01.600 --> 34:06.000
They are accountable to the community, selected by the community, and drive their influence

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
from the community consensus and can be replaced by the community at the community's behest.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.640
Does that sound like the free software community managers you know?

34:14.640 --> 34:18.600
I'd be fine in the situation if there's some honesty on the ground about this because then

34:18.600 --> 34:22.560
we wouldn't be tainting the word community for those blessed souls who have managed to

34:22.560 --> 34:25.680
actually erect the real deal.

34:25.680 --> 34:30.120
There wouldn't be quite so many diluted individuals out there who think that they're a true stakeholder

34:30.120 --> 34:33.580
with equitable rights and privileges in the actual community.

34:33.580 --> 34:38.880
In summary, a community manager is really an audience handler, as in they handle you

34:38.880 --> 34:44.000
as members of their audience, as part of their marketing program, and frankly, I've run out

34:44.000 --> 34:45.960
of patience for this deception.

34:45.960 --> 34:46.960
Get off my lawn.

34:46.960 --> 34:50.720
Matt, I'll open the floor to you.

34:50.720 --> 34:57.640
So I don't subscribe to his thoughts or his feed for obvious reasons, because personally,

34:57.640 --> 35:01.680
so let's take a step back and let's go to this thing called Wikipedia and let's look

35:01.680 --> 35:03.280
at what the term community is.

35:03.280 --> 35:07.080
A community is a social unit of any size that shares common values.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.080
Period.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.440
Okay.

35:09.440 --> 35:16.200
Why is it a problem to have a name of manager or facilitator or reach around guy or whatever

35:16.200 --> 35:22.500
you want to call them that comes in and facilitates, I don't know, something we like to call communication

35:22.500 --> 35:27.800
between a large mob of people and in some cases a company or in some cases, I don't

35:27.800 --> 35:29.320
know, the developers.

35:29.320 --> 35:33.400
Fun fact, developers and end users don't always speak the same language.

35:33.400 --> 35:39.200
Sometimes it requires a manager to come in and help facilitate that line of communication.

35:39.200 --> 35:42.640
His post was the biggest pile of drivel I've ever read in my entire life.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.640
He's a nice guy.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.640
I like him, but this pissed me off.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.120
It was absolute nonsense.

35:48.120 --> 35:49.120
Absolute crap.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.360
I couldn't even wrap my head around it.

35:50.360 --> 35:54.200
I'm hoping he was drunk because it's like, was he just up to a fight?

35:54.200 --> 35:59.060
I mean, he's such a nice guy and I mean, I like the guy I do, but he's just so negative

35:59.060 --> 36:00.640
about nothing.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.360
It's like, oh my God, relax.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.360
Take a pill.

36:03.360 --> 36:04.360
Take your own.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.360
Do something.

36:05.360 --> 36:11.520
I do wonder, I think part of the problem is the term community manager can mean a lot

36:11.520 --> 36:15.720
of different things to a lot of different groups and businesses, so you can't blanket

36:15.720 --> 36:17.120
hate on just one term.

36:17.120 --> 36:21.280
I mean, it might not be the right manager, might not be the right word.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.800
So I'll take the opposite.

36:23.800 --> 36:29.840
I'll play devil's advocate here and I don't know if it is fair to compare the community

36:29.840 --> 36:36.340
of Jupiter Broadcasting to the community of, say, a well-established open source project.

36:36.340 --> 36:37.340
I don't know if that's fair or not.

36:37.340 --> 36:44.880
I would guess the Jupiter Broadcasting community size probably dwarfs many open source projects

36:44.880 --> 36:46.560
that aren't super famous, right?

36:46.560 --> 36:47.560
Easily.

36:47.560 --> 36:48.560
Yeah.

36:48.560 --> 36:57.200
So we have a huge community, huge, and I very consciously have chosen to, whenever we start

36:57.200 --> 37:03.000
up a new aspect of the community somewhere, to generally sort of wind my involvement down.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.280
I don't know if manage is the right... curate.

37:05.280 --> 37:09.040
I'll curate the community there for a bit and then sort of wind myself down as I notice

37:09.040 --> 37:13.920
certain personalities in the community sort of stand up and take on leadership roles.

37:13.920 --> 37:19.560
Not even leadership roles so much as much as just... I don't know how to explain it.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.560
I really don't.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.880
But let's take this mumble room that we're all in right now.

37:22.880 --> 37:27.720
This is something that Blaster, on his own initiative, went out and created and now he

37:27.720 --> 37:31.160
is the operator of our mumble room.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.560
I didn't set that up.

37:32.560 --> 37:38.720
Blaster set that up and everybody knows that it's Blaster's creation here and that is,

37:38.720 --> 37:43.680
in my opinion, community taking on their own leadership in a much more organic and real

37:43.680 --> 37:48.880
way than when you have an artificial manager who really kind of more ends up playing PR

37:48.880 --> 37:54.240
guy and try to smooth things over and a lot of times kind of keeps the community at arm's

37:54.240 --> 37:55.320
length from the business.

37:55.320 --> 37:59.440
So the business is allowed to make the decisions it needs to make to be a profitable business

37:59.440 --> 38:03.400
and then the community manager ends up being the guy who tries to sell it to the community

38:03.400 --> 38:06.520
and tells everybody we're having a great time and it's really because of your participation

38:06.520 --> 38:07.520
that it's all working out.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.520
Oh absolutely.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.740
And that drives me crazy.

38:09.740 --> 38:13.640
It does and that's the mark of a poor community manager.

38:13.640 --> 38:17.200
If you're working on stuff like Operation Lightning Rod, which I've actually known people

38:17.200 --> 38:21.720
that worked on an operation called Operation Lightning Rod as a community manager, it exists.

38:21.720 --> 38:25.500
If you're in those situations, yeah, that's a bad situation to be in and that's honestly

38:25.500 --> 38:27.520
a bad role to be in.

38:27.520 --> 38:32.280
But at the end of the day, if something happens with Jupiter Broadcasting, generally speaking,

38:32.280 --> 38:37.040
you or Angela or maybe even one of the producers will reach out to the community and say, hey,

38:37.040 --> 38:40.360
by the way, we're going to do this, that and the other thing.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.280
There's some information passed.

38:42.280 --> 38:47.880
We have a more distributed system where there's producers and staff and generally speaking,

38:47.880 --> 38:50.920
you take on that role a lot of it, especially it's like, hey, by the way, this is being

38:50.920 --> 38:54.080
rescheduled or hey, we're going to be having this guest on or we're going to be doing that.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.680
You're going to be making that communication happen.

38:56.680 --> 39:01.840
You do need some kind of leadership in some fashion and sometimes it does fall to a person

39:01.840 --> 39:03.720
that is hired for such a role.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.640
It really just depends.

39:05.640 --> 39:09.920
I do agree that when you get to a certain size, it does become easier to just make it

39:09.920 --> 39:13.760
a person's responsibility because it can be one of the things that gets neglected and

39:13.760 --> 39:16.600
also that sort of fits in better with how businesses are structured.

39:16.600 --> 39:21.680
All right, well, this is your responsibility, Bob, and you're going to manage the community.

39:21.680 --> 39:25.560
But I wonder if maybe there isn't a bit of a different approach that needs to be taken

39:25.560 --> 39:30.280
when you are deriving some of your success from the fruits of labor of that community.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.880
I think there needs to be a guide.

39:31.880 --> 39:35.600
I think there needs to be like a community, like everybody gets together, including the

39:35.600 --> 39:39.680
communities themselves to say, look, here's how not to be a D-bag when you're talking

39:39.680 --> 39:40.680
to us.

39:40.680 --> 39:44.200
Here's how to actually have like a level of, because a lot of times you are talking about

39:44.200 --> 39:49.080
like let's say Red Hat and the Fedora project or whatever it may be.

39:49.080 --> 39:53.520
You do need someone in between those things to actually make that conversation happen.

39:53.520 --> 39:54.840
I've lived in this world for a long time.

39:54.840 --> 39:55.840
You just do.

39:55.840 --> 39:56.840
Let's toss it to Popey.

39:56.840 --> 39:57.840
I'd like to hear your thoughts on this, Popey.

39:57.840 --> 39:58.840
Go ahead.

39:58.840 --> 40:06.520
I read Aaron's post and I can see an argument there that's worthwhile.

40:06.520 --> 40:13.360
I can see how it could be misconstrued that someone who works for a corporate entity who

40:13.360 --> 40:19.640
tries to rally people around and basically do their bidding for them for free is not

40:19.640 --> 40:23.080
a pleasant person to be, right?

40:23.080 --> 40:31.640
And I can see how there's a good argument for that being not an appropriate person in

40:31.640 --> 40:32.640
a community.

40:32.640 --> 40:40.760
It's not a community person, but I would flip that around and say that I would say a company

40:40.760 --> 40:46.200
who is comprised of a bunch of people who aren't necessarily close to the community,

40:46.200 --> 40:51.880
who have a product that is used by a wide community of people, there needs to be an

40:51.880 --> 40:55.600
interface between them.

40:55.600 --> 41:00.400
If you hire people in the company who have never worked in an open source company, you've

41:00.400 --> 41:06.840
got to be able to interface those people to these random drive-by community contributors

41:06.840 --> 41:11.600
and say, look, this guy who just fixed a typo in your code, he's trustworthy.

41:11.600 --> 41:12.600
He's a good guy.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.560
You should accept that contribution.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.400
That person could serve as an advocate for the community.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.400
Right.

41:19.400 --> 41:23.560
Or it could be just a drive-by edit and they're gone and then you'll never see them again.

41:23.560 --> 41:27.200
They were just scratching an itch because in their language, that word didn't make sense

41:27.200 --> 41:28.200
so they fixed it, right?

41:28.200 --> 41:32.200
But I do feel like the core argument that Aaron's getting at that there has been a quote

41:32.200 --> 41:38.440
unquote perversion of what the term means and what that role does, I think for a lot

41:38.440 --> 41:47.780
of companies, a lot of times companies grow and all of a sudden the community almost becomes,

41:47.780 --> 41:52.080
their view of them changes and the community shifts from asset to liability.

41:52.080 --> 41:57.560
And now it's like this thing we need to manage so that way they don't damage our public perception.

41:57.560 --> 42:04.440
And it becomes like this distorted time of, it's not community management so much as keeping

42:04.440 --> 42:08.640
the community sort of boxed and that's not a good thing.

42:08.640 --> 42:13.580
I can see how that perception can happen because I've seen that happen and I've seen people

42:13.580 --> 42:22.320
being labeled as the PR guy or the guy who fixes when there's a problem in the community.

42:22.320 --> 42:30.120
From my perspective, that's not the role I play but I can see how that could be seen.

42:30.120 --> 42:34.280
The problem is that a lot of people outside of a particular community, and obviously I'm

42:34.280 --> 42:39.600
speaking from experience of the Ubuntu community, look in and only see someone with a public

42:39.600 --> 42:45.680
face like Jono, for example, and only see his public blog posts and his public conversations

42:45.680 --> 42:47.480
with people and think that's all he does.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.320
Right, he doesn't see the day to day.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.320
Right.

42:50.320 --> 42:58.400
And the full calendar he had talking to, I'm not talking in the past tense as if he's dead

42:58.400 --> 43:01.040
but just because he's known with the company.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.000
The late Jono Bacon.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Yeah.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.800
He had a calendar that was full of meetings with people inside the company making sure

43:09.800 --> 43:16.080
that the community's needs were addressed and that any decision that was made in the

43:16.080 --> 43:20.000
company was made with full thought and respect for what the community wanted.

43:20.000 --> 43:26.760
And whatever name you give that role, yeah, manager, he's got people under him in the

43:26.760 --> 43:27.760
company.

43:27.760 --> 43:28.760
Okay, he's a manager.

43:28.760 --> 43:29.760
He deals with the community a lot.

43:29.760 --> 43:30.760
Yeah, okay.

43:30.760 --> 43:31.760
Let's put the word community in there.

43:31.760 --> 43:32.760
Right, right, right.

43:32.760 --> 43:37.520
You can futz around with the job title but the fact is that he's a very pro community

43:37.520 --> 43:44.480
guy who is doing his best to interface a corporate entity with a community of contributors who

43:44.480 --> 43:49.600
are doing what they're doing willingly and they can walk away at any time and they do.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.600
You know?

43:50.600 --> 43:51.600
Right.

43:51.600 --> 43:58.440
I object to Aaron's post mostly because I think he has a very blinkered view of the

43:58.440 --> 44:01.080
term community manager and what a community manager is.

44:01.080 --> 44:02.080
Bingo.

44:02.080 --> 44:03.080
Yeah.

44:03.080 --> 44:07.120
I mean, I totally see it from the – when you come at it from the inside of how a business

44:07.120 --> 44:10.760
works, like it makes so much more sense versus when you look at it from the outside where

44:10.760 --> 44:14.440
you just kind of end up seeing them continually play that PR buffer zone.

44:14.440 --> 44:18.720
And I look at this and I think there is a lot of ways you can parse this.

44:18.720 --> 44:21.760
There's a lot of ways you can change around the terms but I wanted to give Daredevilin

44:21.760 --> 44:23.960
a chance to kind of get in because I know he's had a couple thoughts on this.

44:23.960 --> 44:27.960
So Daredevilin, is that – is the semantics of this something you wanted to touch on?

44:27.960 --> 44:33.840
Yes, because I don't think even the term is applied to the community.

44:33.840 --> 44:42.000
I also think that the post is actually looking at the community creating and forming itself

44:42.000 --> 44:47.160
around the company when actually a lot of times the companies go and join the communities

44:47.160 --> 44:48.760
that already exist.

44:48.760 --> 44:54.340
And it's like making the post is under the impression that the community is dependent

44:54.340 --> 44:58.880
on the company when it's most of the time the other way around.

44:58.880 --> 45:04.040
It can always go on their own and suddenly there's no point.

45:04.040 --> 45:10.960
And I see the manager to be actually a manager for the company as like Poppy pointed out.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.400
I completely agree.

45:12.400 --> 45:18.040
And I get people PM me on IRC and say, hey, I've seen this winter phone thing, I'd

45:18.040 --> 45:19.040
like to help out.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.040
What can I do?

45:20.040 --> 45:24.400
And my response, I'm the right person they should come to because I can point them in

45:24.400 --> 45:25.880
the right direction, right?

45:25.880 --> 45:26.880
Is that a community manager?

45:26.880 --> 45:33.000
Well, that's not what my business card says but that's arguably what I'm doing.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.440
People are coming to me and saying, hey, I'd like to contribute.

45:36.440 --> 45:37.440
And I say, well, what do you know?

45:37.440 --> 45:39.200
What do you want – what are you so passionate about?

45:39.200 --> 45:40.880
What do you want to contribute to?

45:40.880 --> 45:45.680
And these are people who have lives, they've got other jobs, they've got families, they've

45:45.680 --> 45:51.200
got other stuff they need to be doing, but they're willing to contribute to a product

45:51.200 --> 45:54.520
that's made by a corporation.

45:54.520 --> 45:57.360
And if they're willing to do that, yeah, they can walk away at any time.

45:57.360 --> 46:01.440
If they're willing to do that and they want to contribute, then it makes sense for the

46:01.440 --> 46:07.000
company to have someone who is a point of contact for them, someone who can facilitate

46:07.000 --> 46:13.180
that conversation and find the bugs that that person can fix or poke the right people inside

46:13.180 --> 46:18.920
the company in order to fast-track a bug through or release a piece of software or whatever

46:18.920 --> 46:19.920
it is.

46:19.920 --> 46:21.600
That's what the community manager does.

46:21.600 --> 46:26.680
It's not like running around the streets grabbing press-ganging people off the streets

46:26.680 --> 46:31.280
and putting an Emacs in front of them and saying, you code for me now, that's your

46:31.280 --> 46:33.400
job now and you work for me, bitch.

46:33.400 --> 46:35.400
That's not what a community manager is.

46:35.400 --> 46:40.160
The last time I held the position, no.

46:40.160 --> 46:43.760
I wanted to give Eric a chance to chime in because Eric, I know that you've done a lot

46:43.760 --> 46:46.800
of work with community management and taken training in it specifically.

46:46.800 --> 46:54.080
Do you agree with Aaron's point that the term community is sort of being muddy down here?

46:54.080 --> 46:59.440
It's getting sort of distorted by these corporations and it's sort of devaluing the term community

46:59.440 --> 47:00.440
and what it actually means.

47:00.440 --> 47:01.600
Do you think that's an issue?

47:01.600 --> 47:04.000
I think it depends on the corporation.

47:04.000 --> 47:09.920
Basically you've got a lot of volunteer management going on or community management as it's called.

47:09.920 --> 47:14.280
You still have to have somebody who's acting as a liaison between the community and the

47:14.280 --> 47:15.280
company.

47:15.280 --> 47:19.300
When that person becomes a PR person, that's where it's getting a little fuzzy.

47:19.300 --> 47:24.380
The person does have to inspire the community to do better things but at the same time they

47:24.380 --> 47:29.480
also need to be putting the community toward the vision of the company and saying this

47:29.480 --> 47:32.080
is kind of what we have in mind.

47:32.080 --> 47:33.720
Do you guys like this?

47:33.720 --> 47:36.840
And here's why we think this is a good idea.

47:36.840 --> 47:39.840
So there's a lot to it.

47:39.840 --> 47:42.400
There's a lot to it more than being a PR guy.

47:42.400 --> 47:45.240
A lot to it more than just talking to the community.

47:45.240 --> 47:52.440
It's a lot of trying to vision cast as I call it the vision of the company to the community

47:52.440 --> 47:54.400
at large.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.400
That's a huge part.

47:56.400 --> 48:01.320
And also getting them involved in company events as well.

48:01.320 --> 48:07.160
The community manager in the past in Ubuntu would send out all the invites and figure

48:07.160 --> 48:11.240
out who were the kind of people that you needed at an Ubuntu developer summit and would send

48:11.240 --> 48:16.800
out invites to like 100 people to get them along and get them involved in conversations

48:16.800 --> 48:19.680
and planning about what's happening in the next release.

48:19.680 --> 48:21.040
And I've just had to do this.

48:21.040 --> 48:27.200
I've invited a bunch of people to come to a sprint in Washington to help us form Ubuntu

48:27.200 --> 48:28.200
phone.

48:28.200 --> 48:33.000
And these are people, yeah, they're giving up their own time to come along and help us

48:33.000 --> 48:37.360
figure out what a free software phone should look like in the future.

48:37.360 --> 48:42.680
And you need someone to do the crappy work of figuring out what flights they can go on

48:42.680 --> 48:45.000
working out what their visa requirements.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.760
Trust me, I've had to do this.

48:46.760 --> 48:50.520
So yeah, this is exactly what a community manager does.

48:50.520 --> 48:53.440
It's nowhere near as nefarious as Aaron makes it out to be.

48:53.440 --> 48:55.640
It might be in some companies, but not in my experience.

48:55.640 --> 48:59.760
Yeah, I guess that's the difference is when you get assigned community manager as your

48:59.760 --> 49:03.080
job title, what do they have in mind for you?

49:03.080 --> 49:08.760
Is your job to, you know, mollify the community and keep them from sending hate mail to the

49:08.760 --> 49:09.760
company?

49:09.760 --> 49:14.560
Or is it to get the most out of the community that you can to, you know, get as many of

49:14.560 --> 49:19.360
those people involved in actually forwarding the project along or what?

49:19.360 --> 49:21.360
I would say the latter, Alan.

49:21.360 --> 49:26.680
I would say all the above it's different with each company, what their why they decided

49:26.680 --> 49:28.360
they needed a community manager.

49:28.360 --> 49:31.240
That's why it's not black and white, because it is literally different for every single

49:31.240 --> 49:32.240
case.

49:32.240 --> 49:33.240
It's ambiguous.

49:33.240 --> 49:38.840
It's become a buzzword for a job title that could mean anything from I remember when the

49:38.840 --> 49:43.720
first time I heard it, it was when a company hired someone to manage like a forum about

49:43.720 --> 49:44.720
something.

49:44.720 --> 49:48.560
Yeah, see, this is this is the part of Aaron's post that I the registers with me is this

49:48.560 --> 49:50.960
has actually bothered these kinds of things have bothered me for a while.

49:50.960 --> 49:55.520
Alan, since you're here, would you would you can you give us an overview of how this works

49:55.520 --> 49:57.520
for FreeBSD?

49:57.520 --> 49:58.520
You guys have assigned liaisons?

49:58.520 --> 50:00.040
Is that how it works?

50:00.040 --> 50:01.040
Not really.

50:01.040 --> 50:06.160
Like there are certain people who volunteer to try to be that matchmaker type person like

50:06.160 --> 50:08.280
Popey was describing.

50:08.280 --> 50:11.840
There's I think it's FreeBSD help and a couple of their Twitter accounts that when they see

50:11.840 --> 50:18.080
somebody tweet having this problem with FreeBSD or whatever, they'll, you know, be like, hey,

50:18.080 --> 50:19.440
well, does this help?

50:19.440 --> 50:23.560
You know, make sure you file a PR or oh, that thing you're asking about.

50:23.560 --> 50:27.240
Well, why don't you talk to this person who's the guy that worked on that most recently

50:27.240 --> 50:29.960
or whatever, kind of like Popey was describing.

50:29.960 --> 50:35.040
But you know, the FreeBSD foundation doesn't pay someone to to do that.

50:35.040 --> 50:36.040
Gotcha.

50:36.040 --> 50:37.040
All right.

50:37.040 --> 50:40.480
Well, I wanted to get I want I want to cover Mark Shuttleworth's response because I actually

50:40.480 --> 50:43.000
really liked his response to Aaron's post.

50:43.000 --> 50:47.380
And as you'd expect, I'm one of Aaron's provocative Google Plus posts.

50:47.380 --> 50:50.640
The comments were about a mile long and just as I was about to abort because I was getting

50:50.640 --> 50:54.640
a little burned out on the comments, I saw Mark Shuttleworth's dragon and I had to read

50:54.640 --> 50:55.640
his post.

50:55.640 --> 50:57.520
So we'll we'll read what Mark Shuttleworth had to say.

50:57.520 --> 51:01.520
But first, I want to thank Ting over to Linux.Ting.com.

51:01.520 --> 51:02.520
That's right.

51:02.520 --> 51:03.520
Linux.Ting.com.

51:03.520 --> 51:05.160
That'll take twenty five dollars off your first Ting device.

51:05.160 --> 51:08.800
If you already got a Ting compatible device, they'll give you a twenty five dollar credit.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.560
That's also a great option to go if you're going to get one of their dedicated data units,

51:11.560 --> 51:13.340
like a little LTE hotspot device.

51:13.340 --> 51:14.340
So what is Ting?

51:14.340 --> 51:16.880
Well, Ting is truly mobile that is different.

51:16.880 --> 51:21.040
No contract, no early termination fee, and you only pay for what you use.

51:21.040 --> 51:24.000
Flat six dollars for the line, plus the taxes the man's going to take.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.160
And then it's just your usage.

51:25.160 --> 51:27.720
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, your megabytes, they add them all up at the end

51:27.720 --> 51:29.760
of the month, whatever bucket you fall into.

51:29.760 --> 51:31.460
That's what you pay.

51:31.460 --> 51:35.520
It's so much better than paying for the amount of minutes and data and text you may or may

51:35.520 --> 51:36.520
not use.

51:36.520 --> 51:37.960
That's such a freaking rip off.

51:37.960 --> 51:41.120
And the best part is to like if you if you've been feeling what a rip off that is and you're

51:41.120 --> 51:42.920
like, OK, it's time to do something differently.

51:42.920 --> 51:46.560
You can go over to Linux.Ting.com, try out their savings calculator, get an idea of what

51:46.560 --> 51:50.000
you'll save over like the two year contract period that you'll be getting away from.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.200
And if you're ready to make the jump but you're still in the contract, well Ting has an early

51:53.200 --> 51:56.840
termination relief program, Ting.com slash ETF, where they'll help pay seventy five dollars

51:56.840 --> 51:59.480
per line that you have to get canceled.

51:59.480 --> 52:02.360
That just sort of supercharges your transition over to Ting.

52:02.360 --> 52:07.280
And if you are an Apple user and you have an iPhone 5S or 5C, Ting has launched the

52:07.280 --> 52:11.720
countdown to when you can bring the 5S or 5C over to the Ting network, which is a great

52:11.720 --> 52:15.680
option if you are on that device now because you can take it and just get even more use

52:15.680 --> 52:16.680
out of it.

52:16.680 --> 52:18.880
And if you're thinking about getting perhaps a different phone down the road, you could

52:18.880 --> 52:22.440
take this iPhone and convert it over to Ting and then just pay for what you use.

52:22.440 --> 52:23.760
What a great opportunity.

52:23.760 --> 52:24.960
What a great way to get value out of it.

52:24.960 --> 52:27.200
I've got the Nexus 5 on the Ting network, too.

52:27.200 --> 52:28.200
Matt's got the Note 2.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.680
They both absolutely rock.

52:29.680 --> 52:33.680
I love the Ting network paired with the Ting devices and you own them outright.

52:33.680 --> 52:34.680
They're yours.

52:34.680 --> 52:36.360
You never have to worry about getting screwed in a contract.

52:36.360 --> 52:38.020
They have an amazing dashboard.

52:38.020 --> 52:42.280
No hold customer service at one eight five five Ting FTW any time between 8 a.m. or

52:42.280 --> 52:46.400
8 p.m., East Coast time, and a real person answers the phone.

52:46.400 --> 52:47.400
Linux.ting.com.

52:47.400 --> 52:51.280
Linux.ting.com will give you $25 credit if you've got a compatible device like the iPhone

52:51.280 --> 52:58.280
5S, 5S or 5C or any of the devices available on the Ting store.

52:58.280 --> 53:00.280
Lots of good stuff.

53:00.280 --> 53:01.840
Linux.ting.com.

53:01.840 --> 53:02.840
Check them out.

53:02.840 --> 53:04.720
Maybe even give them a call.

53:04.720 --> 53:06.560
See just how great that customer service is.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.560
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring.

53:08.560 --> 53:09.560
Linux Unplugged.

53:09.560 --> 53:14.120
Okay, guys, let's parse Mark Shuttleworth's response to Aaron Seigo.

53:14.120 --> 53:18.480
Mark Shuttleworth wrote, from my perspective, the great people in this kind of role really

53:18.480 --> 53:23.660
love the people and the project and help unblock things which would otherwise cause a project

53:23.660 --> 53:24.720
to stagnate.

53:24.720 --> 53:29.200
It's perfectly possible to stick a fraudulent label on a job, yes, there are companies that

53:29.200 --> 53:34.880
think they can get people to work for them if they have a manager for those people.

53:34.880 --> 53:37.240
But those cases usually don't work out very well.

53:37.240 --> 53:42.840
By contrast, invest in people who love both the goals of a huge project and the opportunity

53:42.840 --> 53:48.520
to work with folks who can only participate part-time and some magic happens.

53:48.520 --> 53:50.400
That's worth investing in, in my opinion.

53:50.400 --> 53:51.400
I like that he leaves the H off.

53:51.400 --> 53:54.120
Mark's like, I'm not going to put H in that.

53:54.120 --> 53:58.080
So Jono, Michael, David, Daniel and others are wonderful to work with and I'm very proud

53:58.080 --> 54:01.120
of the things they've done and the things they've enabled to get done by others.

54:01.120 --> 54:04.560
Whatever label people might try to attach to them, those are my heroes.

54:04.560 --> 54:08.560
He said something in this post, pretty short, but something that I think is perhaps the

54:08.560 --> 54:15.320
most, the most realistic like day-to-day task that a good community advocate or manager

54:15.320 --> 54:19.400
or organizer has to do is a lot of times an open source project, there's a lot of people

54:19.400 --> 54:24.660
in your community who come and go, they can't contribute a lot of hours and if they are

54:24.660 --> 54:26.920
on a regular basis, it's very limited.

54:26.920 --> 54:31.320
And so because of their time constraints, they need an enabler to help them when they

54:31.320 --> 54:32.320
do have the time.

54:32.320 --> 54:37.720
So that is a critical role that that community manager, whatever you want to call it, could

54:37.720 --> 54:38.720
play.

54:38.720 --> 54:43.880
And at the end of the day, that is truly about enabling people in your community to help

54:43.880 --> 54:48.080
work with you and it really is a two-way street in that case and that, that kind of thing

54:48.080 --> 54:52.160
I think is a great example of a good role a community manager can have.

54:52.160 --> 54:54.600
Any closing thoughts you guys on this before we wrap up?

54:54.600 --> 54:59.280
Well that just tells me that Kynockle has a great idea of where they want to go with

54:59.280 --> 55:05.640
the community and, or at least Mark Shelworth does and since he is the dictator as it were,

55:05.640 --> 55:06.640
then sure.

55:06.640 --> 55:09.360
Well and of course Aaron did reply to Mark if you guys want to see Aaron's response to

55:09.360 --> 55:11.840
Mark it's further down in the comments, what were you going to say Matt?

55:11.840 --> 55:15.960
I was basically just going to point out, when we see things like this, two things that,

55:15.960 --> 55:20.320
you know, first of all, when you start off with just a really ugly title like that, you

55:20.320 --> 55:23.240
know, fraud and all this stuff, you've lost me already.

55:23.240 --> 55:27.420
So even if he has like relevant points throughout the article, you lost me at the title.

55:27.420 --> 55:29.960
Just ugly, ugly stuff.

55:29.960 --> 55:33.520
The end point that people need to remember with stuff like this is that, you know, it's

55:33.520 --> 55:35.720
apples and oranges with every company, every community.

55:35.720 --> 55:39.120
There are some real d-bags that are just total placeholders in certain companies and they

55:39.120 --> 55:42.800
exist and I realize this, but there's a lot of times where these people are doing this

55:42.800 --> 55:46.780
stuff because they actually started out as members of the community that were perhaps

55:46.780 --> 55:50.680
brought in to fill a void and they have a really unfortunate title.

55:50.680 --> 55:52.580
Oh no, it's got the word manager in it.

55:52.580 --> 55:56.560
Maybe we can call him the community advocate or the community hug guy or something.

55:56.560 --> 55:57.560
I don't know.

55:57.560 --> 56:01.040
But whatever makes people feel warm and fuzzy, but at the end of the day, they have a critical

56:01.040 --> 56:04.840
role if it's a company you want to do business with or if it's community that you want to

56:04.840 --> 56:05.840
be part of.

56:05.840 --> 56:06.840
If it's not, go away.

56:06.840 --> 56:07.840
Yeah.

56:07.840 --> 56:08.840
That would be my message.

56:08.840 --> 56:12.480
I walk away mostly thinking, you know, you can't make it black and white, but I still

56:12.480 --> 56:14.040
remain slightly skeptical of the position.

56:14.040 --> 56:19.360
I think in my case, it's I wait and see, actions speak louder than words, and I'll treat each

56:19.360 --> 56:20.360
case individually.

56:20.360 --> 56:21.360
There you go.

56:21.360 --> 56:22.360
Yeah.

56:22.360 --> 56:23.360
Because like I said, there are some exceptions.

56:23.360 --> 56:24.360
There's some real d-bags.

56:24.360 --> 56:25.360
I'm not debating that at all.

56:25.360 --> 56:26.360
There really are.

56:26.360 --> 56:28.560
I mean, I don't think anybody's going to debate on that topic.

56:28.560 --> 56:30.120
I think we all pretty much agree.

56:30.120 --> 56:31.680
The internet is full of d-bags.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.880
Matt, so that's going to wrap up the show today.

56:33.880 --> 56:36.120
Actually, we do have a post-show topic.

56:36.120 --> 56:38.840
So if you're going to be listening after the music, stick around for that.

56:38.840 --> 56:41.280
I'm curious to hear what you think about this next topic coming up.

56:41.280 --> 56:45.560
Matt, on Sunday, I got two different topics that I'm brewing right now to see which one

56:45.560 --> 56:46.560
completes.

56:46.560 --> 56:49.600
Whichever one finishes first will be the one we roll with on Sunday, but I like both of

56:49.600 --> 56:50.600
them as much.

56:50.600 --> 56:53.160
So we'll eventually do both of them, but I'm not sure which one we're going to do first.

56:53.160 --> 56:54.800
Tune in on Sunday and find out with us.

56:54.800 --> 56:59.360
JBLive.tv, Sunday, 10 a.m., or just come back here next Tuesday, jblive.tv.

56:59.360 --> 57:04.080
We do this show in the afternoons, jupitabroadcasting.com, slash, calendar, to get it in your local time

57:04.080 --> 57:05.080
zone.

57:05.080 --> 57:06.080
All right, Matt.

57:06.080 --> 57:07.080
Well, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

57:07.080 --> 57:08.080
All right, see you then.

57:08.080 --> 57:09.080
All right, everyone.

57:09.080 --> 57:10.800
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

57:10.800 --> 57:38.120
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

57:40.800 --> 57:49.480
You see a lot of companies out there right now that are sort of in this transition phase,

57:49.480 --> 57:52.420
like Amazon's really developing into something interesting, too.

57:52.420 --> 57:56.080
Like with the Fire Phone and the tablets, and they seem to be having some success with

57:56.080 --> 57:59.240
the Fire Tablets, and we don't really know, but they seem to be.

57:59.240 --> 58:02.600
Yeah, Fire Phone seems to be flopping, and I think part of that is because it's only

58:02.600 --> 58:03.600
available on AT&T.

58:03.600 --> 58:07.440
But then you've got the Fire TV, which, from all accounts, seems to be a pretty credible

58:07.440 --> 58:08.440
product.

58:08.440 --> 58:11.000
I wanted to pick one up one day myself.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.320
Also Android-based, right?

58:12.320 --> 58:17.440
And then you've got folks like Apple that are slowly turning up this TV stuff.

58:17.440 --> 58:21.600
It's really in this weird phase where they're entering into watches, they're entering into

58:21.600 --> 58:24.800
TVs, and they're entering into home automation stuff, which we've really just seen the very

58:24.800 --> 58:27.040
beginnings of.

58:27.040 --> 58:30.480
And I'm just kind of watching all of this because you all are kind of working against

58:30.480 --> 58:37.160
each other, and because of that, none of it really appeals to me, because I don't want

58:37.160 --> 58:41.480
to be stranded in one person's ecosystem, or one company's ecosystem.

58:41.480 --> 58:46.200
This is why the watches don't appeal to me, because I don't want to have to buy a watch

58:46.200 --> 58:50.480
that they're not going to buy a specific phone.

58:50.480 --> 58:51.480
That's no fun to me.

58:51.480 --> 58:55.200
Well, and that's why I was glad to jump ship from Apple when I did.

58:55.200 --> 58:58.880
And I think the Android wear has the advantage of you can move it between different Android

58:58.880 --> 59:04.120
devices, but I don't even like that restriction, which kind of means I'm screwed, I think,

59:04.120 --> 59:07.880
unless I'm just happy with something like the Pebble, and that's not really a compelling

59:07.880 --> 59:11.800
device to me personally, although I know Chase really likes his.

59:11.800 --> 59:19.000
But I kind of want to want this stuff, because I do want some of the convenience they offer.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.400
At the same time, I'm just so sick of the lock-in.

59:22.400 --> 59:23.400
Yeah.

59:23.400 --> 59:24.400
I can wait.

59:24.400 --> 59:25.400
Yeah.

59:25.400 --> 59:26.400
Yeah.

59:26.400 --> 59:27.400
I think so.

59:27.400 --> 59:32.320
Yeah, and a lot of people in the new world would say, why give up your freedom like

59:32.320 --> 59:33.320
that?

59:33.320 --> 59:37.680
WikiLeaks says, Google is a disgusting ad-selling hypocrite company that pretends not to be

59:37.680 --> 59:41.200
evil when their entire business is based on having and using your personal information.

59:41.200 --> 59:42.200
Ouch.

59:42.200 --> 59:43.200
I don't know if they're hypocrites.

59:43.200 --> 59:44.680
I think they're kind of upfront about that.

59:44.680 --> 59:45.680
Yeah, they are.

59:45.680 --> 59:46.680
They are.

59:46.680 --> 59:47.680
That's all you like is.

59:47.680 --> 59:49.480
I guess we're all kind of negative on the watch thing.

59:49.480 --> 59:50.480
Really?

59:50.480 --> 59:51.480
Nobody in here wants a watch?

59:51.480 --> 59:56.000
I wouldn't mind an Android one, but I mean, I'm not going to spend that much money on

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
a watch.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.880
I just want the dummy watch.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:04.640
Something that is able to receive a few instructions from something remote, and I don't think a

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:12.000
watch having processing capabilities is going to be of really any good use.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.680
I think it's kind of a device to use as a gateway to any other company or place that

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:23.960
you are in, and just maybe some very simple functionality, but mostly a receiving device.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.720
I think what I want is something I could do messaging, and the problem is that, and it

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.200
doesn't want advanced messaging, you just want something that does voice dictation or

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.200
voice notes.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.200
Where would you use that?

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.200
Seriously, where would you use voice dictation on a watch?

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.000
What do you mean?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
When I'm driving.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Right.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.560
So why would you not use your phone?

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:50.080
Well normally I have my phone in my pocket, which is just kind of like, you know, right

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.080
there anyway.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.240
So yeah, I could just grab it.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:58.440
The thing is, when I'm driving, sometimes I have like the phone in a spot where my audio

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.960
is actually connected to a Bluetooth system, and so then I'm using a different microphone

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.880
that doesn't work as well for the dictation, whereas if the mic was built into the watch

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.360
and I could speak more clearly into it, I think it would work better.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.360
Okay.

01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.360
What are you on about?

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.360
You won't be driving for too long.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.360
Yeah.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.360
Yeah.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.880
I mean, okay, so this is the other thing where I don't want to get all like Zen Master about

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.720
it, but like I think we've already crossed a threshold with our smartphones.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.720
Okay.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.720
I think, okay, all right.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.840
I don't, you guys feel like, like do you guys go to restaurants and stuff and like you look

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.520
around and everybody's got their face in their phone and maybe it's getting, it's going on,

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.020
it's gone a little too far and that, and that sometimes like, do you get the sensation that

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:43.640
maybe people are like avoiding like being alone with their thoughts for 30 seconds and

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.280
don't jumping in their phone so that way they don't have to deal with, you know, being a

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.600
human being or something like that.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:53.220
Like it, I have watched the progression over the last five years where like, I remember

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:58.080
a time where it was kind of considered inappropriate to have your phone at the dinner table in

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.520
a restaurant and that was kind of like considered bad taste.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.440
And now I go out and everybody's buried in it and it happens everywhere I go.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.440
I do it.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.440
My friends do it.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.440
My family does it.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.800
Everybody's got their faces buried in these phones and I'm thinking, geez, we already

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.360
are so distracted that we don't even look up and just like look up at the moon one day.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.840
We're always looking at our phones.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:22.260
And so I, I worry that these watches and especially things like Google Glass take it so much further

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:26.840
that it, it actually isn't maybe healthy for the way our minds process information and

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:32.520
it could leave us like, I think over sensitized or overexposed to this stuff.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.600
I don't, for example, particularly want Google Now notifications on my watch.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.660
In fact, I'm thinking about turning Google Now off.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.680
So then that sort of pretty much makes an Android wear useless.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.880
Well, when I look at it, I see two things.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:55.560
I see one that modern work environment and people have to relocate.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.200
It's kind of why those gadgets feel a gap that it's right there.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:04.760
It's like people are going to another state to, or living in another country for large

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.800
periods of time.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:11.000
And those devices do feel a gap that they have.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
That's a real gap.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
That's the real modern world.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:21.480
And that's when you find most people, but people that are just on the local, sharing

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:28.000
with people that they know and live nearby, it seems that when some time passes, they

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.760
eventually start gradually decreasing the usage, especially among friends.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:39.480
That has been my experience is like people got just bloated.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.480
It was new.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.480
It was shiny.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480
Yeah.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.480
I could see that.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:50.120
But if you're dealing with some with actual remote relationships, then it feels a gap.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:57.120
So you will find that and also like when you go to do a restaurant, you're kind of already

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:00.840
doing something that it's remote.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.860
Gradually with age, people technically, depending on the country, of course, but culturally

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:11.080
also start moving to eating at home, eating with family, eating with friends.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.280
It's not so much the restaurant thing either.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:22.120
So I wonder if these watches will, could these watches become podcast clients?

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.600
Could this be a way to listen to podcasts where you don't have to bring your phone if

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.600
you want to go on a walk?

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.600
I would be all down.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.160
Well, of course you have to have your phone with these phones, with these watches, right?

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.960
All of them require your phone.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.160
What happens if they don't, they can't operate on their own just with minimum functionality,

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.160
local functionality?

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.000
I think they would like just timekeeping and whatnot.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.560
Well, and maybe media playback.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:46.360
Like if you could, if you could, you know, put a Bluetooth headphone in or whatever and

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:50.800
listen to a podcast while you're on a walk and not need your phone, I would love that.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:58.960
I think this will actually push further for mesh networks of Wi-Fi networks.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.560
Oh man.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.480
Wouldn't that be bad-ass if everybody's watch formed a secured mesh network?

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.080
Well, why not just do that now with phones, right?

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:08.560
Again, well, we go back to that.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.080
Because you're wasting battery or something important.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080
That's true.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.080
Yeah.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.080
Yeah.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.080
Okay.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.080
All right.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080
At least your phone available for as a communications device.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.080
Yeah.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:22.800
And also like we're now at the current stage of software as a service that companies do

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:28.400
have an incentive of having you connected at all times, not just through data plans

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:35.080
of telecom because ultimately a lot of other things will start to factor in like because

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:43.280
the amount of devices is also huge and the expansion is not as quickly if you're relying

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.960
on just the telephone operators.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960
True.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960
True.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:53.560
Last time I had a watch, they were called Swatch and you know, and before that it was

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.560
a calculator watch.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.560
Yeah.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.560
I think that was the 80s.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.560
I'm just not a real watch guy.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.120
I do kind of feel like actually there's a point to that.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.760
Like I kind of feel like maybe I was, I think when the smartphone came out, I was like,

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.760
oh finally I don't have to wear a watch.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:05.760
Right?

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.760
I mean, I don't know.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.760
It's just something else for me to break.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.760
I don't know.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:09.760
Well, there's that and charge every night.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:10.760
Don't forget that.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.760
Oh gosh.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.760
No kidding.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.760
There is the problem with that as well.

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:14.760
That's it.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:15.760
I really.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:22.600
I'm back with chargers and your desk is in place, workplace being filled with those.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.080
Chargers everywhere is what you're saying.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.080
Yeah.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.080
But then it's actually not as easy.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.520
So when you take the watch off, like in the case of the Apple watch, it like doesn't,

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.680
it deauthorizes your capability for payments.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.480
It doesn't track your health stats.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.840
Like it becomes significantly less useful when you take it off your body, which you

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.320
have to do at least once a day.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.320
Yeah.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:43.680
When the hell are we going to get decent batteries?

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:46.360
What do you want to pay when you're sleeping though?

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.840
People are trying on the battery front.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.840
Yeah.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:53.640
Whatever happened to that one battery that was actually a capacitor invented by a teenager

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:56.480
that lasts like for all day, if not more.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.200
He was murdered by the oil industry and then they destroyed the, no I'm kidding.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.640
No, no, no.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:06.480
Him and water car guy went up to another point.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.860
So you know, you asked what would you, why would you want to wear your watch at night?

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.240
I track with a Fitbit, I track my quality of sleep.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.160
So I know how I'm doing with my sleep apnea.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:21.120
And so I actually, a crucial part of the Fitbit is the functionality I use for it while I'm

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.120
sleeping.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.760
It's actually, I probably would consider that more important than the step tracking for

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.820
me.

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:31.320
So you were saying that there are people who are sat in restaurants out of the house who

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.320
can't stop with the digital connectivity.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.320
Oh yeah.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.320
You don't see this?

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.320
You're doing it in your sleep.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.320
Everywhere.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.600
I'm not staring at a screen though and I'm not distracted by it.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.600
It's different.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.600
It's more actually what I like about it.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.600
Yeah, that's different.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.600
That's completely different.

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.160
Well, cause my point is like it's passive tracking and you go in and get the data when

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:52.120
you want, but these phones and these watches are active, require your attention, distract

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.560
you from the fact that something's bad in your mind that you're not paying attention

01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:01.640
to or you know, they're like these bursts of like indulgence on let me take a selfie and

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.640
make sure I get some likes.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.640
I was kind of pulling your plunker a bit.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.640
But I can see what you're saying.

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.720
I was at a wedding a couple of weeks ago and it was in the middle of nowhere and there

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.400
was no cell reception at all and there was no wifi.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.560
Nobody had their phone out other than for taking photos of the bride and groom.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.120
The rest of the time everyone was talking, dancing, drinking, having fun.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.120
Wow.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.120
Nobody had their phone out.

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.120
It was amazing.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.120
It was the best wedding.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.880
Aside from the fact it was a fabulous steak, it was the best wedding I've been to for a

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:28.880
long time.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.240
We are now reactivating the wifi.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.000
You may now turn your smartphones back on and everybody got quiet.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.720
Shouldn't have a faraday cage over places so you don't connect to anthem.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.640
No, we have trees into the countryside.

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.640
That'll work.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.640
That'll do it up here too sometimes.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.160
I was in the ER and I couldn't make a phone call out.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.160
That is a weird thing.

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:52.720
The deal is okay, I need to open a company that just sets up a signal blockers for weddings

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.720
and events.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.720
Yeah.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:55.720
No, they have those already.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.040
We have a post-show topic.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.040
This is an interesting one.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.740
In fact, I didn't put it in the main show because I've noticed almost zero discussion

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.740
online about it.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:07.760
It seems like nobody gives a crap and I care.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.760
So I just wanted to ask.

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.760
It's probably important.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.560
Usually it's the stupid crap that everybody gets all testy over.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.560
Right.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.560
Yeah.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:15.560
Like you two albums being auto-downloaded to phones and things like that.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.560
Exactly.

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.560
It's like, oh my God.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:23.560
Chris, can I just say that I personally guarantee if you buy an Ubuntu phone, we won't force

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.560
you to buy one.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.560
Yeah, thank you.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.560
All right.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.560
Deal.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.560
Deal.

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.560
All right.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.800
So speaking of buying stuff, Micro Focus has bought AttachMate for $2.3 billion.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:34.920
Of course, AttachMate is the company that owns SUSE Linux.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.840
Oh, that is kind of a big deal.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:37.840
Don't you think?

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.840
I think so.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.440
Although, SUSE Linux is what percentage of AttachMate though?

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.280
Not that much, but I suppose it's still, yes, it matters.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.640
Well, I don't know.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.640
That's what my concern is, is maybe it doesn't matter to them because they make their money

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.940
off mainframes and writing cold ball apps.

01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:51.940
That's where they make their money.

01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:52.940
Check the name.

01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:53.940
OpenSUSE has.

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:54.940
Visual cold ball.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:55.940
That's interesting.

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.940
Yeah.

01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:59.520
OpenSUSE have posted their response to say basically nothing changes.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.520
Yeah.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.520
Okay.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.520
Good.

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.520
Good.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.520
I mean, it seems like it would be complimentary to a mainframe business.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.520
I mean, they've got a good strong position there in the market.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:13.000
Well, yeah, AttachMate group owns SUSE, Novell, and AttachMate.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.120
AttachMate is based in Seattle, Novell is based in Provo, Utah, and SUSE is based in

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.120
Germany.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.360
So it's kind of an interesting thing they just picked up.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.560
So they say, yeah, no changes for SUSE are planned.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.720
The business structure and leadership remain.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.000
There's no need for any action taken.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.320
Commitment to open source remains passionately committed to open innovation.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:34.080
Commitment to open SUSE is fully committed to being a sponsor and supporter of open highly

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.080
independent.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.080
I'll just kind of boilerplate.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.080
Yeah.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:42.280
Well, it sounds like AttachMate bought Novell and then it turns out that didn't make them

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.280
any money.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.280
Right.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.600
And so then they had to sell because they had to pay back those loans.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.600
Yeah.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.600
Well, and they sold off a bunch of patents.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.600
So.

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.600
Ah, there you go.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:51.600
There you go.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.600
There you go.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.600
All right.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:54.600
Yeah.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.600
So there you go.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.600
There really was not much to say, is there?

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.240
It just seems to be really kind of a non big deal.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.240
Yeah.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.680
As long as business continues for the SUSE project, I think everybody's happy.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:07.600
Do you think the the constant sale of Novell and SUSE devalues the SUSE brand?

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.440
Yeah, I think it's weird, too.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:12.920
I think it's weird that it keeps getting shoved, you know, pushed around like a hooker.

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:17.160
It's everybody thinks that they can make money with it, but it turns out they can't.

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.160
Well, but that kind of makes it sound like SUSE is a loser.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.240
Well, she sounds more like a hooker with a PayPal swipe.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.240
I don't know.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.720
You know, at the end of the day, everybody wants to be the next Red Hat because Red Hat

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.720
made billions.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.720
Right.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.720
And.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:30.720
Yeah.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.280
You know, though, I mean, for all we know, it has nothing to do with SUSE.

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.560
Maybe SUSE is the only thing that makes any money at all.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.560
Yeah.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560
Yeah.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.200
In this case, it's it's, you know, a line item that's kind of buried in there.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.480
Well, you know, SUSE is way bigger than Red Hat over in Europe.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:43.760
I mean, way bigger.

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.760
Yeah.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.040
So if you're if you're putting a SAP ERP system in, you're either going to if you're going

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.360
to put it on Linux, you're either going to put it on Red Hat or SUSE.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.120
If you're in the US, that's probably Red Hat.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.000
If you're in Europe, possibly SUSE.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Do you.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.240
So, yeah, it could be some big iron.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.880
You asked me, but you didn't answer the question yourself.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.640
Do you think it devalues the SUSE brand?

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.440
I think it kind of does.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:07.800
It does kind of.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.960
It's like the blue headed step chart or the green headed step chart keeps getting pushed

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:12.960
around.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:13.960
It feels like sloppy seconds to me.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.960
Well, yes.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.320
And the other thing is, it's like when you're trying to pick an enterprise platform to base

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:22.800
like your entire server infrastructure on, stability of the company is a major component.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.660
In fact, some people will pick the stability of the company, IBM or Microsoft, over the

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:28.800
stability of the actual software product.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.800
Right.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.800
That's scary.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:31.800
Yeah.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:34.540
And so when you see this keep moving around, it starts to cast doubts because you never

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:37.720
know if the next time it changes hands, if that'll be the time they decide to end it.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.720
Right.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:39.720
You just never know.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.720
And maybe that would never be the case.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:41.720
I don't know.

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.320
And I actually think the enterprise products are really good product, too.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.120
So it seems like it should be a moneymaker.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.800
But I think this damn Ubuntu LTS thing came around and sort of ate their lunch in the

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.800
cloud.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800
Yeah.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:52.800
Big time.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.800
Son of a gun.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:54.800
All right.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.600
So it's interesting to look at Linux's version of long term support and see how different

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.840
it is from what companies actually look for.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.840
There's a dig.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:08.120
It turns out that companies actually want like insane levels of long term support.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.120
Yeah.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.640
Like they want to stick with one version for 10 years.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.640
Yeah.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.640
Yeah.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.640
Yeah.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.720
Well, Red Hat Enterprise, Linux, and CentOS are around for like fricking ever because

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:20.720
they have their long term support.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.200
Well, they're almost five years, I think.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.200
No, more than that.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.760
We're talking like seven or eight.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.760
Well, FreeBSD does five, but CentOS is about the same.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:33.360
But Zinus is basically making their version of FreeBSD that has 10 plus years of support.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.360
Yeah.

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.360
Which is insane.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.240
I think that's meant to compete with HPUX and all that other stuff.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:43.600
Well, it's specifically to replace the product they already have, which was scope.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.600
Yeah.

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.720
So you can actually pay for what they call extended life support on Red Hat.

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:55.840
Well, you actually get patches for 13 years, but you got to pay out the butt for it.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.960
Like $5,000 per server or something like that.

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.960
Is that actually a radio button on their web page?

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.600
The butt charge.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.400
I like GNU news is good news.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.480
I also like community D debate.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.440
I like all of the system D references.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:19.440
Man, the people who disagreed with our overall end opinion on our system D discussion, I

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.440
were really upset by that.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.440
Did you guys see what we had?

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:26.000
I haven't gone back in there, but that feedback thread is like a record setter for Linux unplugged

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
in the subreddit.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.240
Does it make me evil that I actually popped popcorn for that when I was reading it?

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:32.240
That's what I should do.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.240
I did too.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.040
I literally did, because I just found it so amusing.

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:39.160
I didn't mean to insult anybody.

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.320
Just the interesting views, I was just like, okay.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:46.320
I don't know what these people think my background is, but I've managed servers for a really

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:51.000
long time, and I think system D is a great advancement for server management.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.960
When I see these server guys that go in there like, I don't want it for my server, I'm like,

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:54.960
are you kidding?

01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:55.960
I want it for my servers.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:56.960
What are you smoking?

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.960
Yeah, I just don't get it.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.960
All right, so I'm going to refresh the vote page, and I mean, I understand, honestly,

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:04.680
I don't want to force anything on anybody.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.080
If they want to use OpenRC or whatever, have at it.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.080
I'm fine with it.

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.080
Well, here's the problem.

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.400
Everyone always gets so fired up about it.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.080
What they really need to be talking about is...
