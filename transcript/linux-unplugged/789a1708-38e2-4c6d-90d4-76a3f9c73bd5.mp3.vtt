WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
So I have something that I thought we'd share.

00:02.440 --> 00:03.800
We kind of teased this last week,

00:03.800 --> 00:05.280
but it's official this week.

00:05.280 --> 00:08.040
Fedora has turned 15.

00:08.040 --> 00:13.040
On November 6, 2003, Red Hat announced Fedora Core 1,

00:13.660 --> 00:15.480
which people are still upset about,

00:15.480 --> 00:17.480
the whole core split thing,

00:17.480 --> 00:20.980
but that's a huge milestone, 15 years.

00:20.980 --> 00:24.360
Wes and I were just down at the Portland Linux Users Group,

00:24.360 --> 00:27.880
and I kid you not, there are people that are still upset

00:27.880 --> 00:31.360
that Red Hat split Fedora off into its own thing,

00:31.360 --> 00:32.200
because they were like,

00:32.200 --> 00:34.760
they were building their own Red Hat desktop for a while.

00:34.760 --> 00:35.600
Isn't that wild?

00:35.600 --> 00:37.160
I know, I thought we'd all moved past it.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.200
I mean, Fedora's kind of become its own thing now, right?

00:40.200 --> 00:41.400
It stands alone.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.280
It's great now.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.160
It is great now.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.400
We're getting it back though, Fedora Core OS.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.240
Oh yeah.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.060
That's true.

00:47.060 --> 00:47.900
Yeah, we're getting the core back.

00:47.900 --> 00:48.940
Yeah, I like that.

00:48.940 --> 00:50.820
That makes it feel retro.

00:50.820 --> 00:53.680
But I think Noah might've been one of those guys once

00:53.680 --> 00:57.100
that was a little upset that they went the core route,

00:57.100 --> 00:58.280
they went the Fedora core route

00:58.280 --> 00:59.920
and broke it off from main Red Hat.

00:59.920 --> 01:00.960
Were you one of those guys?

01:00.960 --> 01:02.320
I don't know if I was upset about it.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.600
I didn't entirely understand it at first,

01:04.600 --> 01:06.080
after speaking with some of the folks from Red Hat,

01:06.080 --> 01:08.680
I think I got behind it pretty quickly.

01:08.680 --> 01:11.800
Yeah, you can kind of see where they were going at the time.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.720
And now you see how Fedora sort of fits into the life cycle

01:15.720 --> 01:17.000
of even Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.240
But back then it was like,

01:18.240 --> 01:19.960
are they abandoning the desktop?

01:19.960 --> 01:21.200
What's happening?

01:21.200 --> 01:22.560
And here we are 15 years later,

01:22.560 --> 01:24.080
and it kind of makes sense now.

01:24.080 --> 01:29.080
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 274.

01:30.160 --> 01:35.160
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

01:43.720 --> 01:46.240
that's live from all over the world.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.080
My name is Chris.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.040
My name is Wes.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.520
Hello, Mr. Payne.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.120
We have a great show.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.600
I want to tell everybody about a little bit

01:52.600 --> 01:54.280
about travel adventures, but then really,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.200
we're going to get into some community news,

01:56.200 --> 01:57.880
including some new software,

01:57.880 --> 02:00.560
a couple of things that have gotten a lot of attention

02:00.560 --> 02:04.120
in the community and some really great news

02:04.120 --> 02:07.480
for anyone who uses a Fuse file system.

02:07.480 --> 02:10.600
Anything that's in that user land file system category,

02:10.600 --> 02:12.400
I've got great news for you.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.960
And then we'll open it up to the virtual lug.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.720
Is the open source revolution over?

02:18.720 --> 02:21.400
And maybe we won a couple of points there

02:21.400 --> 02:23.680
and some looking forward conversations

02:23.680 --> 02:25.040
in that section of the show.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.640
And then towards the end of the show,

02:28.640 --> 02:31.560
I am so excited to talk about an open source project

02:31.560 --> 02:34.600
that we have begun using at Jupiter Broadcasting

02:34.600 --> 02:37.320
to automate many tasks.

02:37.320 --> 02:41.920
And it's very close to a, but more powerful clone

02:41.920 --> 02:44.560
of if this, then that type service

02:44.560 --> 02:47.520
that you can self-host and you can build

02:47.520 --> 02:50.400
all kinds of neat event-based things around.

02:50.400 --> 02:51.880
And we'll tell you how we're using it.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.800
Maybe give you a few ideas how you could use it

02:53.800 --> 02:55.160
and talk about the project.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.600
And then of course, maybe we'll have a few suggestions

02:57.600 --> 03:00.360
from the virtual lug on alternatives that we could try.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.840
So let's go no further, Mr. Payne.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.640
We must at this point bring in that virtual lug.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.400
Time appropriate greetings, mama room.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.240
Pip, pip, pip.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.080
Hello.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.120
Hey.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.800
Hello, hello guys.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.340
What a friendly bunch over there.

03:13.340 --> 03:14.400
We got a great crowd too.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.280
We got Brent, Charlie, Eric, and another Eric.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.480
Fun, I'm gonna say, I like fundatils,

03:20.480 --> 03:22.120
but it looks like it should be fundutils.

03:22.120 --> 03:22.960
Fundatilus.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.080
Minimex in there.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.320
New Nix is in there.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.580
Popey Rotten, Ryan, Sean, and see me.

03:28.580 --> 03:29.760
All rocking in there.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.040
Plus we got a few other stragglers hanging out

03:32.040 --> 03:33.520
in the off-air quiet listening.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.500
You know, we never really mentioned that.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.840
But you could join the mumble room.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.380
And if you're just getting used to the idea,

03:38.380 --> 03:40.720
you could just listen in the quiet listening room.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.560
You don't even have to come on air.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.400
And then if something piques your interest,

03:43.400 --> 03:44.320
you could pop in.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.680
I'm just saying, just saying, go Google Jupiter colony

03:47.680 --> 03:49.000
mumble, join us, it's an open.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.920
That's how you feel really close to us.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.240
You know, you're right there next to us.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.820
You can almost talk and when you're ready, you can.

03:54.820 --> 03:56.160
It's like being right there

03:56.160 --> 03:57.480
without having to smell our breath.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.040
That's a big bonus.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.080
I don't know why, I don't know why.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.440
Hey, so let's talk new software.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.680
Let's kick things off with the community news.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.240
Let's talk, actually, let's talk all kinds of new releases.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.880
So I guess first off, before I go too far,

04:08.880 --> 04:10.000
if I sound a little different,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.600
or if the show sounds a little different,

04:11.600 --> 04:13.480
I am, I'm on location this week.

04:13.480 --> 04:17.000
I'm down in Texas doing some meetings and conversations

04:17.000 --> 04:19.120
here at Linux Academy,

04:19.120 --> 04:22.360
touching base with the stakeholders, Wes, you know.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.200
That's important.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.800
Stakeholders love to be informed.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.100
They want to give you their opinions.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.160
They want check-ins.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.080
So it's very important that you're doing this.

04:29.080 --> 04:32.000
Oh man, the worst trip yet.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.640
It went all down as soon as I got in Texas,

04:34.640 --> 04:37.380
like in, like Seattle went fine.

04:37.380 --> 04:39.440
Traffic was typical, you know,

04:39.440 --> 04:41.280
got over to the airport with plenty of time,

04:41.280 --> 04:42.800
got myself the TSA pre-check.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.640
So I just blast through security now.

04:44.640 --> 04:45.760
Oh, nice.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.360
Yeah, yeah.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.120
Got myself some nice fast wifi

04:49.120 --> 04:51.280
so I could get connected while I waited for the plane.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.720
You know, I was able to pre-sauce before the flight.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.080
No complaints there, good flight.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.840
Land in Texas and discover that there's no cars available.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.080
I tried to book the day before.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.760
Like in all, there's just, there's just no car.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.240
They don't have cars there anymore.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.720
In all of Dallas, Fort Worth area, nobody,

05:08.720 --> 05:10.960
at least in my reach, has a car.

05:10.960 --> 05:15.000
Not Hertz, not Avis, not Turo,

05:15.880 --> 05:17.700
not the cheapo place that I can't remember the name,

05:17.700 --> 05:19.040
that's a local mom pop.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.920
Nobody had cars because there was a football game

05:23.920 --> 05:27.060
and a NASCAR event and some major industry down here

05:27.060 --> 05:28.360
is having an all hands meeting.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.400
And you're not, you don't get to go

05:29.400 --> 05:30.560
to any of those fun events.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.400
You gotta go work.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.360
No, right, right.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.040
And you know what else that means?

05:34.040 --> 05:36.760
No hotel for me, no hotel.

05:36.760 --> 05:38.720
I apparently. Wait, what?

05:38.720 --> 05:40.880
Yeah, well, apparently my administrative assistant

05:40.880 --> 05:42.360
and me made a mistake.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.960
Oh, that guy's, he's the worst.

05:43.960 --> 05:44.800
He is the worst.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.320
And this is a mistake that he doesn't normally make,

05:47.320 --> 05:48.900
but apparently he made.

05:48.900 --> 05:49.920
So I gotta fire that guy.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.400
He, I guess, only booked the hotel

05:52.400 --> 05:54.140
for the day he's leaving town,

05:54.140 --> 05:57.840
not for the whole date range that I'm going to be here.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.760
So I get in and at this point,

05:59.760 --> 06:01.640
I've been traveling since 7 a.m.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.980
and it's now about 7 p.m.

06:04.980 --> 06:07.640
And you know, when I start getting tired,

06:07.640 --> 06:10.400
I don't really feel like being really social.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.840
I just kind of want to be left alone, you know?

06:13.840 --> 06:16.840
And Uber rides, not to be a complainer,

06:16.840 --> 06:18.040
but they can be a little rough in that.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.000
Cause I just, I don't know, I just,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I don't really feel like making pleasant conversation

06:22.000 --> 06:24.400
cause I'm kind of exhausted from 12 hours of traveling.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.000
And you know, so you make your pleasant conversation

06:27.000 --> 06:28.160
for 30 minutes or whatever.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.040
You get to the hotel and I'm ready to just lay down.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.240
Haven't had food yet.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.280
Cause all I've had is booze and airplane snacks.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.640
And the lady says, we don't have a room.

06:38.640 --> 06:39.480
And I said, what do you mean?

06:39.480 --> 06:41.440
They gotta have a room, I booked.

06:41.440 --> 06:42.440
She's like, oh well, Mr. Fisher,

06:42.440 --> 06:44.520
I see that you're booked for the eighth.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.360
For one day, yes.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.800
You have no rooms available right now.

06:47.800 --> 06:49.720
And here I am, and this is where it's starting to hit me.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.320
Like, I'm in Texas, I can't get a car,

06:52.320 --> 06:54.080
so I can't get around very well.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.320
And now I don't have anywhere to stay.

06:56.320 --> 06:59.280
And it's getting close to my bedtime.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.640
Cause I'm an old man.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.000
And so she very nicely called around

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
and found at a hotel that's about 30 minutes further away.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.380
And they got me in there and the hotel's fine.

07:08.380 --> 07:09.480
I got in, but.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.120
That's very nice of her.

07:11.120 --> 07:11.960
Yeah, it was.

07:11.960 --> 07:12.800
It was one of those moments where

07:12.800 --> 07:15.680
she calls around first hotel, nothing.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.060
Second hotel, nothing.

07:18.060 --> 07:20.760
So now I'm three hotels, bubkiss.

07:20.760 --> 07:25.660
She calls the last hotel and has a conversation.

07:25.660 --> 07:28.080
They have a room, it's got two beds, you know,

07:28.080 --> 07:30.040
it's not perfect, but, and I'm like, I don't care.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.160
You know, my neighbor has a shack out back.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.440
It doesn't get too cold till the winter, so you'll be fine.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.600
So it's like on some golf course and I show up there

07:38.600 --> 07:42.840
and the guy's just given me this unbelievable attitude.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.800
At this point, I'm frazzled because I don't have a vehicle.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.560
So I'm waiting 15 minutes for Uber drivers to show up

07:48.560 --> 07:50.040
cause it's Texas and it's big.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.160
And they don't know where we're going.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.080
I don't know where we're going.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.000
It's dark.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.720
I've been traveling since 7 a.m. and it's 8 p.m.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.920
And I just want to go flip through the television

07:59.920 --> 08:01.800
in the hotel room and just chill out.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.800
It's your ritual, man.

08:02.800 --> 08:03.620
It's your ritual.

08:03.620 --> 08:04.460
It is.

08:04.460 --> 08:07.480
Your TV channels is my only time with live TV and I enjoy it.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.920
I get there and the guy's like,

08:10.920 --> 08:12.640
we don't have a reservation for you.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.400
I'm like, no, no, it was a transfer.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.240
They called and they said there was a, nobody called me.

08:18.380 --> 08:19.560
No, I called, I was standing there.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.760
Nope, I did not receive a call, sir.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.600
Well, they talked to somebody

08:22.600 --> 08:23.680
because I was standing there with you.

08:23.680 --> 08:27.040
Well, they didn't call her and they didn't call me.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.960
So they didn't talk to anybody here.

08:28.960 --> 08:31.760
And I'm like, whoa, dude, okay.

08:31.760 --> 08:35.920
Well, do you have a room open?

08:35.920 --> 08:36.760
Oh yeah, we have a room.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.740
Sure, yeah, that's no problem.

08:38.740 --> 08:41.160
Okay, can I have that room, please?

08:41.160 --> 08:44.400
All of that just to like, I want to pay you money

08:44.400 --> 08:48.120
for the service that supposedly you offer to the public.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.700
Whew, I was so done at that point.

08:49.700 --> 08:50.540
I was so done.

08:50.540 --> 08:54.000
But yeah, I'm down here at the Linux Academy headquarters

08:54.000 --> 08:58.120
to plan for 2019, big plans, got some ambitious goals.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.680
And they're also doing, speaking of ambitious goals,

09:00.680 --> 09:03.560
they're doing a content launch this last part of the year.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.360
They're launching over 200 content,

09:05.360 --> 09:08.360
like library courses and just tons of stuff, right?

09:08.360 --> 09:10.360
I mean, when you think what it takes together

09:10.360 --> 09:12.400
to put like a how-to, and these are so much bigger

09:12.400 --> 09:14.960
with labs and interactive diagrams,

09:14.960 --> 09:17.780
and of course video and audio voiceovers,

09:17.780 --> 09:19.320
and tons of things you could do

09:19.320 --> 09:20.920
to actually try it on production systems.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.800
Like it's just, it's so much bigger than a how-to

09:23.800 --> 09:25.400
and they're launching so much stuff.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.080
So they're doing a whole bunch of live streams

09:27.080 --> 09:29.720
and I've got some experience with that.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.880
So now that they have somebody on staff

09:31.880 --> 09:33.560
that's got quite a bit of experience with that,

09:33.560 --> 09:35.760
they have me come down and I'm more than happy to do it.

09:35.760 --> 09:40.420
And we co-anchored the first live stream this morning,

09:40.420 --> 09:44.120
which also, apparently my Google calendar

09:44.120 --> 09:46.560
is set to not update its time zone.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.400
So I thought I had to-

09:47.400 --> 09:48.880
You're stuck in PSD.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.080
Yeah, well, I can fix it, but I hadn't.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.800
And so I wake up and I, oh crap,

09:52.800 --> 09:53.960
I got a live stream at 8.30,

09:53.960 --> 09:55.280
I better get over to the office.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.840
I get here and it's not till 10.30.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.880
So yeah, yeah.

09:59.880 --> 10:02.360
But just as an aside,

10:02.360 --> 10:04.240
I got a little peek behind the curtain

10:04.240 --> 10:06.760
and I didn't even see the whole thing,

10:06.760 --> 10:11.400
but by my count, 20,000 Linux servers

10:11.400 --> 10:12.800
are running this place.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.960
Let that sink in for a second.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.820
20,000 Linux servers.

10:16.820 --> 10:17.660
Yeah.

10:17.660 --> 10:18.880
That's some power right there.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.960
That's a lot of Linux servers.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.440
And students can then individually

10:23.440 --> 10:25.560
spin up to nine VMs themselves,

10:25.560 --> 10:27.440
which are all Linux. That's per student, right?

10:27.440 --> 10:29.320
So there's a lot of students going on there.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.200
Yeah, that is, I mean,

10:31.200 --> 10:32.880
just mind blowing when I heard that number.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.960
And I also, just as an aside,

10:34.960 --> 10:36.520
talked to a couple of Fedora users,

10:36.520 --> 10:37.840
speaking of Fedora,

10:37.840 --> 10:40.000
and they're all on 28.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.160
They have not upgraded.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.800
None of them have upgraded to 29 yet.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.320
I think anybody who uses Fedora

10:44.320 --> 10:45.480
as a workstation does that.

10:45.480 --> 10:46.320
They wait.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.140
Isn't that the secret?

10:47.140 --> 10:49.800
You're like, well, I mean, even honestly,

10:49.800 --> 10:51.440
on Ubuntu, I'll sometimes do that too.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.280
If you don't need to update,

10:52.280 --> 10:53.800
there's not like one critical update

10:53.800 --> 10:55.880
you're really waiting to come through,

10:55.880 --> 10:57.360
better to just play it safe.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.240
Yeah, I suppose so.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.320
It seems like that's the,

10:59.320 --> 11:02.120
and you know, I asked them,

11:02.120 --> 11:02.960
and none of them are worried

11:02.960 --> 11:04.000
about their extensions breaking.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.080
They're like, oh, no, it's fine.

11:06.080 --> 11:06.920
It's fine, because they're all,

11:06.920 --> 11:08.480
oh, I should say they're all on Gnome show.

11:08.480 --> 11:11.160
All right, so speaking of Gnome,

11:11.160 --> 11:12.160
let's talk about KDE.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.160
See what I did there?

11:14.160 --> 11:16.800
Yeah, KDE Connect has got some new stuff.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.800
So first of all, version 1.10 of KDE Connect has shipped.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.560
And that is for the Android version.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.600
That's the Android app.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.760
And it's not only got a new UI,

11:25.760 --> 11:29.600
but they're now targeting Android 8,

11:29.600 --> 11:31.000
which has several implications

11:31.000 --> 11:32.520
for you active users out there.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.200
Targeting Oreo comes with an updated support library,

11:35.200 --> 11:38.880
which forces the project to drop support

11:38.880 --> 11:41.160
for Android 4 and below.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.280
Well, there are still people out there,

11:43.280 --> 11:44.120
even in this audience,

11:44.120 --> 11:46.560
that are using Android 4, surprisingly,

11:46.560 --> 11:49.680
and probably for various good reasons.

11:49.680 --> 11:53.240
And according to the KDE Connect stats,

11:53.240 --> 11:57.640
it works out to be about 400 of their users

11:57.640 --> 11:58.840
that will be affected by this.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.000
This is kind of surprisingly a big update,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.800
because with, you know, moving things to Oreo,

12:03.800 --> 12:05.920
there's more restrictions,

12:05.920 --> 12:08.560
things like to be able to run in the background all the time,

12:08.560 --> 12:12.160
which is sort of a core feature of what KDE Connect does,

12:12.160 --> 12:15.600
you have to show a persistent notification.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.520
Now, the good news is Android has decent controls here,

12:18.520 --> 12:20.880
so you can hide the notification.

12:20.880 --> 12:24.280
The bad news is they can't do it by default.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.040
Mm-hmm, yeah.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.960
Now, it doesn't affect notifications in general

12:27.960 --> 12:28.800
for KDE Connect,

12:28.800 --> 12:30.320
just the persistent notification

12:30.320 --> 12:32.280
for the application itself.

12:32.280 --> 12:36.480
I hadn't gotten enough experience with KDE Connect yet

12:36.480 --> 12:38.840
to appreciate this particular issue,

12:38.840 --> 12:41.440
but one of the things it's fixed in 1.10

12:41.440 --> 12:44.640
is mouse input now works at the same speed,

12:44.640 --> 12:47.240
independent from what the phone's pixel density is,

12:47.240 --> 12:49.880
which I didn't realize was even a thing,

12:49.880 --> 12:52.880
that that would be a problem, but I guess, you know.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.800
Wow, I mean, that's something to think of,

12:54.800 --> 12:55.840
because if I was having that issue,

12:55.840 --> 12:58.120
it would be really confusing.

12:58.120 --> 13:03.040
Also, very nice, the media controller now allows

13:03.040 --> 13:05.640
stopping of playback of what's on your machine.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.960
Yeah, that's actually super handy,

13:06.960 --> 13:09.240
and I've used that one already.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.560
The other thing I saw that was really neat

13:11.560 --> 13:14.880
is they now have registered up with KDE Connect colon slash

13:14.880 --> 13:18.720
slash as a URL, so if you're integrating with NFC tags,

13:18.720 --> 13:20.560
QR codes, third-party applications

13:20.560 --> 13:22.960
that wanna launch something in KDE Connect,

13:22.960 --> 13:24.160
you've got a way to do it.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.920
That's so awesome, that is so great.

13:26.920 --> 13:28.960
I have a lot of respect for the project,

13:28.960 --> 13:31.400
I've met some of the individuals involved with it,

13:31.400 --> 13:33.600
and I just thought they were great people.

13:33.600 --> 13:38.600
You know, I was at a KDE meetup of some kind

13:39.480 --> 13:43.520
that was in Seattle, and one of the developers,

13:43.520 --> 13:44.600
I think it was one of the main developers,

13:44.600 --> 13:46.640
had just moved to Seattle at the time.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.000
Yeah, I was there with you, Chris.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.240
Oh yeah, that's right.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.360
Can you fill in the details, Eric,

13:51.360 --> 13:53.240
because I'm fuzzy on them at this point.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.280
It was like a, was it like a design meetup?

13:55.280 --> 13:56.120
I can't remember.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.360
It was the guy who invented KDE Connect.

13:58.360 --> 13:59.920
Right, I know that was the guy that was there,

13:59.920 --> 14:02.480
but what was the event, why were we even there?

14:02.480 --> 14:04.400
It was a celebration of some sorts,

14:04.400 --> 14:06.320
but it was also just a KDE meetup

14:06.320 --> 14:08.280
that was happening in the Seattle area at the time.

14:08.280 --> 14:12.920
Yeah, it was good, I enjoyed it, and he was there,

14:12.920 --> 14:16.360
and at the time, I had talked to him about the project,

14:16.360 --> 14:19.360
and I'd asked him, where are you going to go with it?

14:19.360 --> 14:23.680
And even back then, I think some of the things

14:23.680 --> 14:25.320
that we see now, like GS Connect and whatnot,

14:25.320 --> 14:27.480
were kind of on the horizon,

14:27.480 --> 14:31.560
but now KDE Connect is a mature project with tons of users.

14:31.560 --> 14:33.960
GS Connect has just recently seen some nice improvements,

14:33.960 --> 14:35.880
which is the gnome shell side of the camp,

14:35.880 --> 14:37.320
so you can get some of the similar functionality

14:37.320 --> 14:39.040
that KDE Connect provides.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.880
And if you're not, I guess I should say,

14:40.880 --> 14:43.040
if you're not familiar with KDE Connect,

14:43.040 --> 14:46.520
it is a companion app and a piece of software

14:46.520 --> 14:49.640
that runs on the plasma desktop that has a plasmoid

14:49.640 --> 14:52.080
and some settings that you configure.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.080
You launch the Android app, you see it,

14:54.080 --> 14:55.880
you get a shared pin code, you enter that code,

14:55.880 --> 14:57.840
the two things are connected over Wi-Fi,

14:57.840 --> 15:00.120
they're talking, it's encrypted, it's beautiful,

15:00.120 --> 15:02.760
you get a shared keyboard, you get shared media controls,

15:02.760 --> 15:04.440
you get shared notifications,

15:04.440 --> 15:07.360
you even transfer files back and forth, it's really cool.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.880
So KDE Connect's a great project,

15:08.880 --> 15:10.840
and GS Connect is worth checking out.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.840
Anybody else have anything to add on the KDE Connect

15:13.840 --> 15:15.360
or GS Connect topic?

15:16.280 --> 15:18.760
And I saw that recently, I can't remember,

15:18.760 --> 15:20.000
I think it was on the Ubuntu podcast

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
that I think someone mentioned that GS Connect

15:23.000 --> 15:25.240
is in the repo for 18.10,

15:25.240 --> 15:27.000
if you want to get the latest and greatest.

15:27.000 --> 15:27.840
Yep, that's right.

15:27.840 --> 15:28.680
So there you go.

15:28.680 --> 15:29.520
Ooh, that is nice.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.360
Gnome users suffer no more.

15:31.360 --> 15:36.360
Unless you want to run that gnome desktop on a new Mac.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.480
This is the story that has gotten the most attention

15:39.480 --> 15:40.400
this week so far.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.440
And it's had an interesting life cycle

15:42.440 --> 15:45.360
because Ferronix ran a piece

15:45.360 --> 15:47.560
that I have been wondering about

15:47.560 --> 15:51.960
that said Apple's new hardware with the T2 security chip

15:51.960 --> 15:54.040
will currently block Linux from booting.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.840
And everybody kind of got upset.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.120
And then it sort of ducked down when everybody said,

15:59.120 --> 16:00.520
oh, hold down, hold on.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.600
If you disable secure boot, everything's fine.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.200
And then the story kind of died down.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.560
And then it came back.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.800
Even if you disable secure boot, Linux is still screwed.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.640
And now the story's blown up again.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.880
So at least until further notice,

16:11.880 --> 16:13.960
the new Apple systems that they've been recently announcing

16:13.960 --> 16:16.320
like the iMac Pro and the Mac Mini

16:16.320 --> 16:20.880
that use the T2 chip will not be able to boot Linux on them.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.320
If you're not like Chris

16:22.320 --> 16:25.760
who follows the Apple news just ravenously,

16:25.760 --> 16:28.520
the T2 is a security chip Apple's made

16:28.520 --> 16:30.560
or got made for them custom

16:30.560 --> 16:32.360
that's embedded into all of their newest products.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.040
And it's a secure enclave.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.800
It does APFS storage encryption,

16:35.800 --> 16:38.640
UEFI secure boot validation, touch ID handling,

16:38.640 --> 16:41.800
a hardware microphone disconnect for all you privacy lovers

16:41.800 --> 16:44.760
and a whole bunch of other little security functions.

16:44.760 --> 16:45.920
But as a result,

16:45.920 --> 16:48.080
and you probably guessed this with UEFI in there,

16:48.080 --> 16:50.400
the T2 restricts the boot process

16:50.400 --> 16:54.400
and verifies each step using crypto keys signed by Apple.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.240
Now on its own,

16:55.240 --> 16:56.480
this would probably be a pretty good thing, right?

16:56.480 --> 16:58.480
I mean, this is a lot of security functionality.

16:58.480 --> 16:59.960
If you're concerned about that,

16:59.960 --> 17:01.240
there's a lot of controls here.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.320
Unfortunately, there's not a lot of ways

17:03.320 --> 17:05.600
for the user to actually control it.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.960
Yeah, yeah, there's a few settings they expose,

17:07.960 --> 17:12.080
but as the Ferronix article notes in its second update,

17:12.080 --> 17:15.120
apparently reportedly it's still blocking Linux.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.920
You can, there is a way to use Windows 10 on there right now.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.200
So I'm sure we'll eventually,

17:19.200 --> 17:20.080
somebody will figure it out.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.960
Right, the difficulty there is that they've used the key

17:22.960 --> 17:25.320
that Microsoft uses for Windows,

17:25.320 --> 17:26.720
but they have a separate key

17:26.720 --> 17:28.320
that they use for all the third party things

17:28.320 --> 17:30.600
like Fedora or Ubuntu went through all that work

17:30.600 --> 17:32.520
to go get Microsoft to sign their bootloaders.

17:32.520 --> 17:33.360
Right.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.600
None of that gets us anywhere here.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.640
Right, oh my gosh, that's so frustrating.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.400
And you know, to be fair,

17:38.400 --> 17:40.840
Apple's own documentation makes it pretty clear.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.040
It even mentions Linux.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.160
It says, and I'll read it just directly,

17:44.160 --> 17:46.000
there is currently no trust provided

17:46.000 --> 17:50.280
for the Microsoft corporation UEFI CA 2011,

17:50.280 --> 17:51.600
which would allow a verification code

17:51.600 --> 17:53.120
signed by Microsoft partners.

17:53.120 --> 17:57.360
The UEFI CA is commonly used to verify the authenticity

17:57.360 --> 18:00.600
of bootloaders for other operating systems,

18:00.600 --> 18:01.880
such as Linux variants.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.880
And since they don't have support for it, no love for you.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.640
So no Mac mini running the latest and greatest

18:07.640 --> 18:09.320
gnome shell or plasma for you.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.320
There was a lot of confusion because for a while

18:11.320 --> 18:13.280
it seemed like you could boot up into recovery mode

18:13.280 --> 18:15.800
and disable secure boot entirely,

18:15.800 --> 18:17.240
and then not have to worry about this

18:17.240 --> 18:18.080
and be able to boot into Linux,

18:18.080 --> 18:21.000
but the latest reports say no dice.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.440
Yep, all right, so they just crushed your dreams

18:25.440 --> 18:28.720
for that Mac, so better go to your backup plan.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.040
You know, like that new Thelio hardware

18:30.040 --> 18:30.880
is looking pretty good,

18:30.880 --> 18:32.740
although it's much bigger than a Mac mini.

18:32.740 --> 18:37.520
Now, see, that was probably the most outraged story

18:37.520 --> 18:38.520
of the week.

18:38.520 --> 18:39.880
Every unplugged needs one, right?

18:39.880 --> 18:41.640
We gotta have one.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.600
I sometimes think that's what fuels our Linux.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.280
So, you know, the next story though,

18:47.280 --> 18:50.840
I think has people going, what, really?

18:50.840 --> 18:51.800
Huh, okay.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.020
And that is that Microsoft's making

18:54.020 --> 18:55.440
some more open source code.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.160
Proc dump is coming to Linux,

18:58.160 --> 18:59.800
which it's sort of like a re-imagining

18:59.800 --> 19:01.980
of the classic proc dump tool

19:01.980 --> 19:03.880
that was from the sysinternal suite

19:03.880 --> 19:04.720
of tools for Windows,

19:04.720 --> 19:07.320
which actually is a pretty legit suite of tools,

19:07.320 --> 19:09.240
and proc dump provides a convenient way

19:09.240 --> 19:11.560
for Linux developers to create core dumps

19:11.560 --> 19:15.480
of their application based on performance triggers.

19:15.480 --> 19:19.080
It's pretty sweet, and they have it up on GitHub right now.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.160
You can do things like get the CPU threshold

19:21.160 --> 19:23.960
at which to create a dump of the process,

19:23.960 --> 19:27.280
or below, like there's all kinds of like memory limits.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.220
You can, when a memory limit is triggered,

19:29.220 --> 19:30.960
you can begin to do a proc dump

19:30.960 --> 19:33.760
and get a snapshot of what's going on.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.080
This is pretty neat, eh, Mr. Payne?

19:35.080 --> 19:36.480
Oh yeah, actually it's really easy.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.720
While you were describing it,

19:37.720 --> 19:39.600
I installed it up here in the studio,

19:39.600 --> 19:42.680
and no problems, even on a newer operating system,

19:42.680 --> 19:46.120
the 16.04 devs work just fine.

19:46.120 --> 19:49.240
I'll also note that this isn't some like super weird port.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.480
If you look at the code,

19:50.480 --> 19:52.900
it's really minimal, pretty clean C,

19:52.900 --> 19:54.840
so it seems sort of like they've been

19:54.840 --> 19:57.320
not necessarily porting the actual sysinternal stuff,

19:57.320 --> 20:00.920
but being inspired by the user experience of sysinternals,

20:00.920 --> 20:02.600
and then bringing similar tools to Linux.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.000
Because as everyone has pointed out

20:04.000 --> 20:05.440
over on our Linux already,

20:05.440 --> 20:06.680
like look, we don't need this, right?

20:06.680 --> 20:08.240
We have all the information we want,

20:08.240 --> 20:09.640
we know how to scrape slash proc,

20:09.640 --> 20:12.480
we have a bunch of command line tools already,

20:12.480 --> 20:14.400
but we have to admit that

20:14.400 --> 20:16.040
on the non-open source side of things,

20:16.040 --> 20:18.040
Microsoft has spent a long time

20:18.040 --> 20:20.760
either buying or making, or both in this case,

20:20.760 --> 20:22.800
refining administrative tooling.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.080
So if we can get a little bit of that perspective on Linux,

20:25.080 --> 20:26.480
hey, that's not a bad thing.

20:26.480 --> 20:28.840
Yeah, and I think also there's,

20:28.840 --> 20:30.640
is brand the right way?

20:30.640 --> 20:33.400
Is there some brand recognition with that name?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.240
You know, you're coming over from Windows,

20:35.240 --> 20:37.600
now you've got SSH,

20:37.600 --> 20:39.840
you've got the Windows subsystem for Linux,

20:39.840 --> 20:41.160
you've got proc dump,

20:41.160 --> 20:42.480
you've got all these tools

20:42.480 --> 20:44.960
that are sort of like industry known.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.880
And even if there's already ways to do it,

20:46.880 --> 20:48.480
I think that's perfectly valid.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.600
I was digging around,

20:49.600 --> 20:51.280
I could be way off because I'm no expert,

20:51.280 --> 20:55.360
but I was digging around their project page on GitHub,

20:55.360 --> 20:57.160
and it looks like maybe they've been

20:57.160 --> 20:59.320
kind of tooling away at this for nearly a year,

20:59.320 --> 21:02.120
and only a few days ago,

21:02.120 --> 21:03.960
I think, did people start discovering it.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.400
And I was checking out to see what the license was,

21:06.400 --> 21:07.920
which was, that was like one of the,

21:07.920 --> 21:09.760
I think that was the very first commit they made,

21:09.760 --> 21:12.160
was the license, which is an MIT license.

21:12.160 --> 21:16.640
And that commit was made on November 10th, 2017.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.520
So this has been coming for a little bit.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.280
That's what's, I think, underappreciated

21:22.280 --> 21:26.240
about these Microsoft open source announcements,

21:26.240 --> 21:30.720
is they, in a lot of cases, I come to discover,

21:30.720 --> 21:34.040
have been in the works for a really long time.

21:34.040 --> 21:34.960
You're absolutely right.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.240
Yeah, we don't see it till they actually dump it,

21:37.240 --> 21:38.920
or release it, and you don't appreciate

21:38.920 --> 21:41.600
that that took one internal buy off, right?

21:41.600 --> 21:43.120
That actual developers are getting paid

21:43.120 --> 21:45.160
to work on that on their work time,

21:45.160 --> 21:46.840
and that eventually it did get open source,

21:46.840 --> 21:48.800
because it's so easy to have those projects

21:48.800 --> 21:52.240
be created internally, and then just wither and die.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.040
Yeah, I think it's hard to appreciate from the outside,

21:54.040 --> 21:56.320
just because we don't know what their processes are.

21:56.320 --> 22:00.640
We don't know at what speed they move, in general.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.280
And so we don't have really any tool sets

22:02.280 --> 22:03.920
to recognize when they're moving fast,

22:03.920 --> 22:07.640
versus moving slow, but every time I dig into it,

22:07.640 --> 22:09.720
it seems like it's a multi-year process.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.920
We just talked about, recently, on Coder Radio,

22:11.920 --> 22:16.280
that.NET Core is now becoming the de facto.NET.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.240
And that's a pretty big deal,

22:19.240 --> 22:21.280
because.NET Core has only been around

22:21.280 --> 22:23.320
for a couple of years, a few years.

22:23.320 --> 22:26.680
Whereas.NET, the thing that's been Windows only,

22:26.680 --> 22:28.120
well, sort of, for so long,

22:28.120 --> 22:29.880
it's been around for like, what, 15, 20 years?

22:29.880 --> 22:32.280
I don't know, it's somewhere in that range.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.880
It's surprisingly old now, which makes me feel old.

22:34.880 --> 22:39.000
And when I had a conversation at Microsoft

22:39.000 --> 22:42.400
with Jeffrey and a couple of other folks,

22:42.400 --> 22:45.240
I asked them, I said, with.NET Core,

22:46.720 --> 22:49.160
why do you have.NET and.NET Core?

22:49.160 --> 22:51.360
I don't understand why you have two things.

22:51.360 --> 22:52.640
It seems like a mixed message,

22:52.640 --> 22:55.600
and I didn't understand who.NET Core was for

22:55.600 --> 22:57.080
versus who.NET was for.

22:57.080 --> 23:00.160
And why is one proprietary and closed source

23:00.160 --> 23:01.000
and one's open source?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.480
I just didn't understand any of it.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.960
And the way they explained it to me

23:03.960 --> 23:05.320
was kind of a bombshell in a way,

23:05.320 --> 23:07.760
because if you parse what they said,

23:07.760 --> 23:11.240
it was sort of intention signaling, like a while ago.

23:11.240 --> 23:15.680
They said.NET Core is their current focus,

23:15.680 --> 23:19.280
and.NET is going to be for legacy platform support.

23:19.280 --> 23:24.280
Well, the platform that.NET runs on is Windows.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.680
And they called it a legacy platform.

23:30.680 --> 23:34.280
Now, maybe that was just the words they chose to use,

23:34.280 --> 23:36.400
but that's an interesting mindset, I think.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.520
So are we coming to the agreement

23:38.520 --> 23:40.520
that maybe I was right all these years?

23:40.520 --> 23:43.400
Well, does Azure Sphere OS count?

23:43.400 --> 23:45.600
Because that is technically a Linux distribution

23:45.600 --> 23:46.920
that Microsoft is using.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.840
No, no, I said that they would have a Linux distribution

23:49.840 --> 23:51.880
with a Windows desktop that gets shipped

23:51.880 --> 23:55.000
by default in all machines like currently Windows does.

23:55.960 --> 23:56.800
That's the thing.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.040
It's going to happen, mark my words,

23:59.040 --> 24:02.280
and I have another view on this thing of the core.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.240
It's just that if you have any open source project

24:05.240 --> 24:07.360
that has already everything defined,

24:07.360 --> 24:09.080
people generally don't come around

24:09.080 --> 24:11.920
and jump in to contribute, because everything is defined.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.960
So this is a good strategy for people to work with.

24:14.960 --> 24:18.760
So this is a good strategy for people to want to contribute

24:18.760 --> 24:21.040
and actually have community involvement

24:21.040 --> 24:23.520
while they still keep bringing the other stuff.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.520
It also is a great refactor opportunity

24:25.520 --> 24:29.080
because they really have found a hard time hiring people

24:29.080 --> 24:31.560
that understand the real old code base.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.720
So it's an opportunity to refactor, make it decoupled,

24:34.720 --> 24:38.480
and at the same time, gain the momentum of open source.

24:38.480 --> 24:39.320
They love this.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.440
They're doing the right things,

24:40.440 --> 24:41.880
but it's just going to take a while.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.720
2020, come on, it's getting closer.

24:43.720 --> 24:47.040
You know, as it gets closer,

24:47.040 --> 24:48.720
I started to think more and more, you're right.

24:48.720 --> 24:49.560
Initially, when you said it,

24:49.560 --> 24:51.080
I'm like, that's the craziest crap I've ever heard.

24:51.080 --> 24:54.160
But now I'm like, I could almost see it.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.960
They just reversed the subsystem.

24:55.960 --> 25:00.200
And so you run a Linux type desktop as the main desktop,

25:00.200 --> 25:01.880
and then you have a Windows subsystem

25:01.880 --> 25:03.400
that runs Windows on Linux.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.240
Pretty much.

25:04.240 --> 25:06.320
That's exactly what I said.

25:06.320 --> 25:07.840
If you go on the backlog of the shows,

25:07.840 --> 25:09.280
I said exactly that would happen.

25:09.280 --> 25:10.840
Well, you make sure we never forget, too.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.680
So I don't have to go to the back catalog, Dari.

25:12.680 --> 25:16.320
But, you know, it will be the ultimate.

25:16.320 --> 25:18.560
It will be the ultimate prediction when it happens.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.040
Five-year prediction.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.600
Well, you don't have to go five years out

25:21.600 --> 25:23.760
for good news about Linux kernel 4.20.

25:23.760 --> 25:25.880
Everybody's excited for the 4.20 kernel.

25:25.880 --> 25:29.240
And this one is going to improve your views, man.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.280
Wow, everybody loves the user space file system.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.800
Nobody really considers it to be very performant.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.840
And over time, over time,

25:38.840 --> 25:41.640
things have gotten better with views.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.400
But it looks like there are

25:43.400 --> 25:46.280
more performance optimizations to be had.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.200
Oh, yeah.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.400
That includes symlink caching,

25:50.400 --> 25:52.680
a new hash table optimization,

25:52.680 --> 25:56.040
and copy file range support.

25:56.040 --> 25:59.120
Plus, the maximum IO signs for views has been increased

25:59.120 --> 26:02.880
from 128k up to an actual, a full, a full meg.

26:02.880 --> 26:03.720
What?

26:03.720 --> 26:05.080
And there's like a whole bunch of other improvements

26:05.080 --> 26:06.520
that are working on this.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.640
I thought it was interesting, too,

26:07.640 --> 26:08.760
because some of this stuff,

26:08.760 --> 26:11.880
like actual users are submitting it.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.760
Some users saw that they were having problems

26:13.760 --> 26:15.080
where symlinks just weren't cached

26:15.080 --> 26:16.480
the same as normal files.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.320
And that was a bottleneck.

26:17.320 --> 26:19.320
So they're like, Facebook, actually, in this case,

26:19.320 --> 26:20.920
Facebook said like, look, this is a big problem.

26:20.920 --> 26:21.960
We're using symlinks a lot.

26:21.960 --> 26:24.000
It's slower than using regular files.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.160
Their fix adds a 10% improvement on top of that.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.080
The other thing I think that's neat about this

26:29.080 --> 26:31.680
is there are some EBPF fixes,

26:31.680 --> 26:34.680
in particular for that copy file range support.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.920
And that is actually pretty important

26:36.920 --> 26:38.840
if you want to do server side copying,

26:38.840 --> 26:39.880
which I'm sure you've run into, right?

26:39.880 --> 26:41.200
You're trying to copy a file,

26:41.200 --> 26:44.280
two folders on like you're on your NAS somewhere.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.440
You don't want to be in the position

26:45.440 --> 26:47.080
where you have to copy it all the way to your workstation

26:47.080 --> 26:49.120
and then copy it back to the server.

26:49.120 --> 26:52.000
Thanks to some of the EBPF changes that they've got,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.520
some of the changes in views,

26:53.520 --> 26:54.800
that's going to be a lot easier.

26:54.800 --> 26:59.200
Oh, so have we given our whole EBPF spiel on this show?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.040
I can't remember,

27:00.040 --> 27:02.120
because the Portland user Linux group thing,

27:02.120 --> 27:02.960
where we talked about it too,

27:02.960 --> 27:03.800
is kind of throwing it off.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.640
Wes and I kind of did like a mini show

27:06.640 --> 27:09.000
down at the Portland Linux users group last Thursday,

27:09.000 --> 27:09.840
was it?

27:09.840 --> 27:10.680
Yeah, it was last Thursday.

27:10.680 --> 27:13.800
And ton of fun, jumped in my golf

27:13.800 --> 27:14.920
and we drove down to Portland,

27:14.920 --> 27:17.680
which is like a three, three and a half, four hour drive.

27:17.680 --> 27:21.120
And we hung out with Michael Dexter,

27:21.120 --> 27:24.720
who pretty much runs the Portland Linux users group.

27:24.720 --> 27:28.240
Ironically, Michael Dexter is sort of famously a BSD guy.

27:28.240 --> 27:32.680
And he runs it with one of the free BSD co-founders.

27:33.680 --> 27:34.960
I mean, Rod doesn't really run it,

27:34.960 --> 27:36.640
but he's there with Dexter all the time.

27:36.640 --> 27:38.200
So it's a couple of moral support.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.040
I asked him about it.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.960
I said, so Michael, I've been meaning to ask you,

27:40.960 --> 27:42.680
but as a BSD user,

27:42.680 --> 27:45.160
why are you so involved with the Linux users group?

27:45.160 --> 27:48.760
And he said, well, it's really, it's a Unix users group.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.520
It's just mostly Linux.

27:50.520 --> 27:51.360
And it's kind of true.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.360
And you know what?

27:52.360 --> 27:54.400
They have a good open discussion around it too.

27:54.400 --> 27:57.100
It's like, everything's on the table.

27:57.100 --> 27:59.820
And it was just, I don't know, I just really enjoyed it.

27:59.820 --> 28:02.400
It was nice to just chat casually,

28:02.400 --> 28:03.720
you know what I mean about this kind of stuff

28:03.720 --> 28:05.200
that we read about all the time.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.400
You know, even though we do shows about it,

28:06.400 --> 28:07.240
you know what I mean?

28:07.240 --> 28:08.060
It was still fun.

28:08.060 --> 28:08.900
It's a little more high pressure, right?

28:08.900 --> 28:10.640
In the shows, we're trying to get things right.

28:10.640 --> 28:11.480
We've got interviews,

28:11.480 --> 28:13.760
or we've got guests with heated opinions,

28:13.760 --> 28:16.000
both for or against or good or bad.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.680
And this was more of just a group of people

28:17.680 --> 28:19.480
who were all interested in this for their own reasons,

28:19.480 --> 28:21.280
coming together, having a chat.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.120
Yeah, and it really drove home

28:23.120 --> 28:27.120
that whole concept that we have here on the show

28:27.120 --> 28:31.540
that Linux user groups are like one of the best,

28:31.540 --> 28:34.760
best things about the Linux community.

28:34.760 --> 28:38.840
And you don't have to be in a town that has a user group

28:38.840 --> 28:40.800
to be part of a Linux user group.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.560
They had, I'm blanking on the gentleman's name,

28:44.560 --> 28:49.560
but they had a member that is essentially from New York

28:50.420 --> 28:51.960
that was in town,

28:51.960 --> 28:55.640
and so participated in the Lug in person that time,

28:55.640 --> 28:57.040
but normally watches on the live stream

28:57.040 --> 28:58.400
and participates on the mailing list

28:58.400 --> 29:02.520
and is an active member of the Portland Linux Users Group

29:02.520 --> 29:03.520
from New York.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.120
And I think that really demonstrates.

29:05.120 --> 29:05.960
I asked him, I said,

29:05.960 --> 29:07.760
so why are you a member of a Portland Linux,

29:07.760 --> 29:10.000
that's on the other side of the country?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.600
He said, well, you know, the nearest one to me

29:12.600 --> 29:14.640
is about 200 miles away,

29:14.640 --> 29:17.880
and I just really liked this group.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.400
And it's the Portland Linux Users Group's been around

29:20.400 --> 29:21.360
for like 20 years,

29:21.360 --> 29:23.520
so it's pretty well established on the West Coast.

29:23.520 --> 29:26.660
And so he's a member of it from that far away.

29:26.660 --> 29:29.560
And I think that's something

29:29.560 --> 29:31.220
that everybody should just give some thought

29:31.220 --> 29:33.040
if you wanna get more involved in the Linux community,

29:33.040 --> 29:35.640
if you wanna talk to more like-minded technical people.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.620
And I'll say, you know, we have a virtual Lug too,

29:37.620 --> 29:40.000
and it is a group of people that get together

29:40.000 --> 29:43.300
and we hang out every week for a couple of hours.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.280
We meet more often than a regular Lug does.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.120
Right, yeah.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.680
I mean, that was what surprised me is, you know,

29:47.680 --> 29:50.280
Michael Dexter does a lot of work to keep that going,

29:50.280 --> 29:52.320
but you get surprising results.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.760
You know, they have a live stream, they have an IRC room.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.920
I'm sure there are times where, you know,

29:55.920 --> 29:58.840
no one really actively joins the live stream or participates,

29:58.840 --> 29:59.720
but if you leave something out,

29:59.720 --> 30:02.200
if you set that up so people can communicate,

30:02.200 --> 30:05.240
I think you're often surprised by how many people reach out.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.880
Yeah, I kinda wanna go again.

30:07.880 --> 30:10.340
I should totally say that there was this time

30:10.340 --> 30:13.880
that the Portland Linux Group used JB, long time ago,

30:13.880 --> 30:15.920
I'm not sure if you guys remembered,

30:15.920 --> 30:18.040
to broadcast some event they had.

30:18.040 --> 30:21.560
And since then, there was actually a Linux IRC channel

30:21.560 --> 30:25.880
of this Portland Linux Group that essentially,

30:25.880 --> 30:29.000
dragged lots of people to actually keep visiting that IRC.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
And since they have such a regular publication

30:34.360 --> 30:38.080
of their actual events online in the stream,

30:38.080 --> 30:39.800
lots of people can actually attend remotely,

30:39.800 --> 30:41.840
which is something that maybe other groups

30:41.840 --> 30:44.000
don't have as much, which helps.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.440
Yeah, you know, that was when Linus visited

30:46.440 --> 30:48.160
the Portland Linux User Group that we streamed in.

30:48.160 --> 30:50.800
That was a special, that was a special, yeah.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.000
He was there for an anniversary,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.640
and he just took questions from the plug.

30:55.640 --> 30:58.160
And I don't know, after I went to it,

30:58.160 --> 31:01.080
I felt like I could do this, I could do this more often,

31:01.080 --> 31:02.640
especially if I took the train or something,

31:02.640 --> 31:04.760
because we drove and it was a little exhausting

31:04.760 --> 31:08.120
to drive four hours, one, each direction.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.120
Yeah, I think next time we'll make a whole day of it,

31:10.120 --> 31:11.160
we'll stay overnight,

31:11.160 --> 31:13.560
we'll get a nice Portland brunch in the morning.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.240
Yeah, yeah, although Wes and I

31:15.240 --> 31:16.620
did have a nice romantic evening.

31:16.620 --> 31:17.680
That was, that was lovely.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.720
It was quite, not only was it geeky,

31:19.720 --> 31:21.360
and we did some work on the project

31:21.360 --> 31:23.120
that we're gonna be talking about in a little moment,

31:23.120 --> 31:24.240
on the drive down.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.080
So Wes got his ThinkPad in his laptop

31:26.080 --> 31:28.420
while I'm driving with the MiFi going.

31:28.420 --> 31:31.880
But then we couldn't really find a place to eat,

31:31.880 --> 31:33.160
but we decided we were gonna set out

31:33.160 --> 31:36.080
and try to travel around Portland and just find something.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.640
We started walking around.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.120
Everything looked a little too fancy,

31:39.120 --> 31:40.480
but time was getting tight,

31:40.480 --> 31:41.600
it was almost time to go to the meetup,

31:41.600 --> 31:43.760
so we walk into this place,

31:43.760 --> 31:45.880
and it didn't seem, it was just on the line.

31:45.880 --> 31:48.480
Like, it had cloth tables and all that stuff,

31:48.480 --> 31:51.160
and cloth napkins, but it seemed like they,

31:51.160 --> 31:52.360
they would also take somebody like me

31:52.360 --> 31:53.580
who was a bit of a slob.

31:53.580 --> 31:55.520
And she's like, oh, would you like to sit

31:55.520 --> 31:57.440
in the dining area, or would you like to sit in the bar?

31:57.440 --> 31:59.120
And both Wes and I look over, and they have a,

31:59.120 --> 32:00.120
you know, they have a fine bar.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.960
It's just a small little bar that's part of a restaurant.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.040
And we're like, well, I guess the bar.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.000
She's like, all right, well, that's around the corner,

32:06.000 --> 32:08.200
down the hallway to the left, and then up the stairs.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.040
Like, what?

32:09.040 --> 32:09.860
Oh, okay.

32:09.860 --> 32:10.700
Stairs?

32:10.700 --> 32:11.540
What are you talking about?

32:11.540 --> 32:12.560
This place was great.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.600
It was, that was where we wanted to be.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.500
It was a happening place.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.680
What was the theme of the restaurant?

32:17.680 --> 32:19.520
Was it a, it wasn't an Irish, but.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.800
It's a British, Irish-inspired comfort food sort of thing.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.680
That was kind of like a mix. It's called Raven and Rose.

32:24.680 --> 32:25.720
Yeah, there you go.

32:25.720 --> 32:27.040
You can look it up if you're ever in Seattle.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.560
And then asked to go to the bar.

32:28.560 --> 32:29.680
Don't go to the main restaurant.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.240
And then you get to go to the secret upstairs bar.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.240
That was pretty good.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.200
So we went down there, we chatted with them,

32:34.200 --> 32:37.560
and the fedora things came up, but also, you know,

32:37.560 --> 32:39.440
a lot of people had the whole IBM acquisition

32:39.440 --> 32:40.280
still in their mind.

32:40.280 --> 32:41.680
That was something that was, we talked about

32:41.680 --> 32:44.080
quite a bit there, and I just really enjoyed it.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.640
So I just want to encourage, just want to take a moment

32:45.640 --> 32:48.080
to show and encourage everybody, give it a consideration,

32:48.080 --> 32:51.680
even if you have to participate from half a country away,

32:51.680 --> 32:53.520
or more, still give it some consideration.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.360
Plus, you know, it always gives you a place to visit.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.080
Yes, and I mean, to that end too,

32:57.080 --> 32:59.220
I think it's just a nice, it's a nice reason to meet people.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.300
You have a common interest,

33:00.300 --> 33:01.400
but you don't have to talk about that.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.800
So while we were there, we got a surprise lecture

33:03.800 --> 33:05.160
about carnivorous plants.

33:05.160 --> 33:06.880
And that was just a neat thing to learn,

33:06.880 --> 33:07.720
a way to engage people.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.480
Didn't have to do anything with your regular interests

33:09.480 --> 33:10.880
or your job or anything else.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.920
Just an excuse to chat about something fun.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.560
Yeah, it was definitely, it's an example of something

33:14.560 --> 33:16.040
I wouldn't look up on YouTube.

33:16.040 --> 33:18.960
I wouldn't intend to talk if I was at a conference.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.400
But if you're at a plug for a couple of hours,

33:21.400 --> 33:23.160
you're at the plug and somebody brings it up

33:23.160 --> 33:25.680
and you're there, it's actually interesting.

33:25.680 --> 33:26.640
It was pretty neat.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
So check it out.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.560
Anyways, get involved.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.520
I wanted to bring up, speaking of the whole IBM acquisition

33:33.520 --> 33:35.440
and Microsoft and all of that,

33:35.440 --> 33:38.200
some bigger picture topics for this week's episode.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.400
I thought we could zoom out a little bit,

33:40.400 --> 33:42.800
get away from some of the specifics and talk big picture.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.320
And Mumble Room, I want you guys to get in on this

33:44.320 --> 33:47.140
because I miss you, I want to hear from you.

33:47.140 --> 33:50.600
So I thought we'd start with this article

33:50.600 --> 33:54.040
that was over at lightreading.com.

33:54.040 --> 33:55.560
And it's in their open source section,

33:55.560 --> 33:56.720
so you know it's gotta be legit

33:56.720 --> 33:58.760
because they've got an open source section.

33:58.760 --> 34:02.560
And the author, Mitch Wagner, proposes

34:02.560 --> 34:05.480
that the open source revolution is over

34:07.000 --> 34:09.600
and the revolutionaries have won.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.240
And he writes, what happens when the revolutionaries win

34:12.240 --> 34:14.160
after they've stormed the castle

34:14.160 --> 34:15.800
and they've tried on the king's clothes,

34:15.800 --> 34:17.260
they've slept in his bed,

34:17.260 --> 34:20.360
and they've drunk the royal wine, then what?

34:20.360 --> 34:22.800
Well, I think you actually have to figure out

34:22.800 --> 34:24.400
how to run things.

34:24.400 --> 34:28.260
But while we've seen like a ton of changes just recently,

34:28.260 --> 34:30.400
probably this has been happening for a while.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.480
Now, of course, there was Microsoft buying GitHub

34:33.480 --> 34:36.520
and just last week, IBM purchasing Red Hat.

34:36.520 --> 34:37.840
Those are huge moves,

34:37.840 --> 34:41.200
both just focused right around open source.

34:41.200 --> 34:42.560
But as we've talked about on the program

34:42.560 --> 34:44.320
for several years now,

34:44.320 --> 34:47.520
open source is the mainstream way of working

34:47.520 --> 34:49.880
for big enterprises to small startups.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.680
Yeah, yeah, I think it's a bit

34:52.680 --> 34:54.880
of a developer-driven revolution too.

34:54.880 --> 34:58.520
Like developers want to be able to grab a library

34:58.520 --> 35:00.260
that's been written that solves a problem for them,

35:00.260 --> 35:03.200
or they wanna have somebody help them problem solve

35:03.200 --> 35:05.440
and communicate and collaborate.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.080
If you do everything in closed source silos,

35:07.080 --> 35:08.120
that's a lot more difficult.

35:08.120 --> 35:10.720
But Wagner here, the author,

35:10.720 --> 35:14.280
reached out to Jim Zemlin of the Linux Foundation,

35:14.280 --> 35:15.240
the executive director over there

35:15.240 --> 35:16.680
at the Linux Foundation. Oh, that guy.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.760
Yeah, and Jim says he sees multiple factors

35:18.760 --> 35:21.760
contributing to the ascent of the new paradigm.

35:21.760 --> 35:23.160
He says open source won the support

35:23.160 --> 35:24.480
of mainstream technology leaders,

35:24.480 --> 35:25.840
such as IBM and Oracle,

35:25.840 --> 35:29.600
because Linux became a standard server OS,

35:29.600 --> 35:31.720
and it was embraced by non-technology companies,

35:31.720 --> 35:35.040
such as Toyota and the entertainment companies,

35:35.040 --> 35:37.440
such as, and the telcos, like AT&T

35:37.440 --> 35:38.520
and those other big ones.

35:38.520 --> 35:41.780
And of course, you can't forget people like Google.

35:41.780 --> 35:43.820
I mean, Google's been leveraging open source

35:43.820 --> 35:46.560
for a long time, especially projects like Android.

35:46.560 --> 35:49.160
And that's what Android become basically the largest

35:49.160 --> 35:50.280
operating system in the world, right?

35:50.280 --> 35:53.160
Think of all of the handsets out there running Linux

35:53.160 --> 35:54.680
in the form of Android.

35:54.680 --> 35:57.160
Yeah, so I wanted to ask, so let's pause there.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.680
I wanted to ask the mumble room.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.720
So far, we have, you know, it became the default server OS,

36:02.720 --> 36:05.840
but they go on here in a moment to say that really,

36:05.840 --> 36:10.560
it's Android that brought this open source revolution.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.440
It's because of Android

36:12.440 --> 36:14.200
and the mainstream enterprise companies

36:14.200 --> 36:17.240
that watched Google use open source successfully

36:17.240 --> 36:20.080
that open source has blossomed so much.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.740
Thank you, Android, they say.

36:21.740 --> 36:23.160
I don't think so at all.

36:23.160 --> 36:24.400
Yeah, I also disagree.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.180
If you look, what happened is the fact that you're developing

36:27.180 --> 36:30.320
for a server and that the tooling start,

36:30.320 --> 36:33.000
the complexity of the server side started to grow.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.480
Our big, basically sites become bigger.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.600
They have to do a lot more and requires a lot more knowledge

36:39.600 --> 36:43.840
of the whole system as a whole to be able to optimize for it

36:43.840 --> 36:45.200
and to take the best.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.800
So that meant that developers didn't want the friction

36:47.800 --> 36:51.640
of having to use the changing Microsoft Philly

36:51.640 --> 36:53.280
or the Mac stuff.

36:53.280 --> 36:57.380
Docker is now being used in companies as,

36:57.380 --> 36:59.520
oh, you have it installed on your machine

36:59.520 --> 37:01.320
and you run some stuff in there.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.760
And then the question becomes like,

37:02.760 --> 37:05.520
I'm already running all of those Linux things.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.320
Why don't I just use Linux?

37:07.320 --> 37:09.860
And since companies tend to have some Linux available

37:09.860 --> 37:12.200
in there, you start using the desktop

37:12.200 --> 37:13.880
and you start developing there,

37:13.880 --> 37:16.920
which is why every other player is basically trying

37:16.920 --> 37:19.860
to have some Linux tools developer for their desktop

37:19.860 --> 37:22.360
because otherwise people will just use Linux.

37:22.360 --> 37:26.080
And as a consequence, you get Linux being,

37:26.080 --> 37:28.560
I mean, you get exposed, you get to use it,

37:28.560 --> 37:30.160
you get to use it even more.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.140
That's it.

37:31.140 --> 37:32.000
It's not Android.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.920
Android is like the end user, like the consumer.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.600
All right, well, so I think I could totally follow you there.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.820
They make the case that it's not so much

37:39.820 --> 37:43.880
that Android itself made people use open source,

37:43.880 --> 37:47.160
but that Google using open source

37:47.160 --> 37:50.080
gave the CIOs and the CTOs the permission

37:50.080 --> 37:52.420
to also use it because Google was doing it.

37:52.420 --> 37:55.480
And Google made it cool, safe, and hip for the enterprise.

37:55.480 --> 37:56.800
I know we had somebody else in there

37:56.800 --> 37:58.260
that disagreed with that.

37:58.260 --> 37:59.100
Go ahead.

37:59.100 --> 38:01.320
Yeah, that just sounds like a flimsy premise to me

38:01.320 --> 38:06.320
because, I mean, Linux is not nearly

38:06.800 --> 38:09.640
the only open source project being used

38:09.640 --> 38:11.760
in large deployments.

38:11.760 --> 38:15.000
I mean, before that we had FreeBSD and Apache,

38:15.000 --> 38:19.280
and I mean, how many people are totally lost

38:19.280 --> 38:22.240
on the command line without using Bash?

38:22.240 --> 38:25.600
I mean, this open source revolution,

38:25.600 --> 38:29.600
as the author is framing it,

38:29.600 --> 38:32.400
has been going on since before Linux

38:32.400 --> 38:35.560
was barely even a Minix ripoff.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.200
Yes, Linux is the most prominent,

38:39.200 --> 38:41.760
but that's partly because people just won't shut up

38:41.760 --> 38:44.200
about how much they love Linux.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.600
And that's not necessarily a bad thing.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.240
It's just, this is the most visible,

38:49.240 --> 38:51.720
but it has been there for years,

38:51.720 --> 38:54.760
long before people made a big deal out of DevOps and Docker

38:54.760 --> 38:59.120
and all these new old technologies

38:59.120 --> 39:01.800
being retrofitted onto Linux.

39:01.800 --> 39:06.640
FreeBSD has been powering our networks for ages now.

39:06.640 --> 39:09.880
And I almost forgot that we need to remember Linux now

39:09.880 --> 39:13.760
with its close to, it's what, 20 years now, right?

39:13.760 --> 39:14.600
Yeah.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.320
So for the longest time,

39:16.320 --> 39:18.120
universities are very slow to adapt

39:18.120 --> 39:21.860
and universities still teach Windows for a large degree,

39:21.860 --> 39:24.040
but the fact that also universities are now like,

39:24.040 --> 39:27.140
for a decade, teaching Linux,

39:27.140 --> 39:29.160
using Linux as the research material,

39:29.160 --> 39:31.240
means that the job market now is like,

39:31.240 --> 39:33.760
oh, you can just take, that person knows how to use it,

39:33.760 --> 39:35.320
knows how to deal with that stuff.

39:35.320 --> 39:37.320
And that's what they grew up with.

39:37.320 --> 39:40.200
And we need to remember what is the turn rate

39:40.200 --> 39:43.320
of producing new brains on any technology, right?

39:43.320 --> 39:46.540
So first it was the shift from universities

39:46.540 --> 39:49.460
actually producing people with Linux skills

39:49.460 --> 39:51.460
to also them getting to the market.

39:51.460 --> 39:52.760
So that takes a while.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.080
And if you look at the time span, it just fits right.

39:55.080 --> 39:58.560
I'd just like to say, I think open source

39:58.560 --> 40:01.800
has a huge influence over the years.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.580
Like, I found, especially in the Windows world,

40:04.580 --> 40:07.840
often to solve problems in the Windows world,

40:07.840 --> 40:10.200
the solution was use open source,

40:10.200 --> 40:13.640
like use Firefox instead of Internet Explorer,

40:13.640 --> 40:17.280
use LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office,

40:17.280 --> 40:21.280
use a huge range of software that is available now

40:21.280 --> 40:26.240
and commonly acceptable to use in Windows,

40:26.240 --> 40:29.200
because I think a lot of the companies

40:29.200 --> 40:33.720
are changing the software and doing such practices

40:33.720 --> 40:37.600
that it's leading everyone to open source.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.560
And especially with Windows 10 and the changes

40:40.560 --> 40:44.880
from software being a program you install to cloud,

40:44.880 --> 40:46.200
there is a lot of kickback

40:46.200 --> 40:50.680
and people want that old fashioned program that you install.

40:50.680 --> 40:53.400
And with the last couple of years

40:53.400 --> 40:55.160
of free speech being an issue,

40:55.160 --> 40:58.000
people are looking into software

40:58.000 --> 41:02.100
that isn't from a traditional million dollar company

41:02.100 --> 41:05.440
and open source is getting more popular that way as well.

41:05.440 --> 41:08.880
An investor nowadays looks at what are your costs?

41:08.880 --> 41:11.160
And if you can, for example,

41:11.160 --> 41:12.760
if you are a competitor of Amazon

41:12.760 --> 41:15.260
and then you run your services in AWS,

41:15.260 --> 41:17.340
what if Amazon raises your prices, right?

41:17.340 --> 41:19.380
So all of that kind of stuff,

41:19.380 --> 41:21.860
the big companies are so entrenched in so many things,

41:21.860 --> 41:24.080
you really have no option but to be in the place

41:24.080 --> 41:27.560
that is neutral, you know, economically speaking.

41:27.560 --> 41:30.800
And yes, it is true that there is some weight

41:30.800 --> 41:34.960
on using industry best practices as an excuse, right,

41:34.960 --> 41:38.080
to use Linux and Google does give some authorization

41:38.080 --> 41:39.720
to teams that don't know what they're doing

41:39.720 --> 41:42.000
because if you will use that as a way

41:42.000 --> 41:43.200
to decide your technology, you know,

41:43.200 --> 41:44.820
but that's a personal argument.

41:44.820 --> 41:46.560
Yeah, yeah, I see your point.

41:46.560 --> 41:50.420
I think too, this is what was supposed to happen.

41:50.420 --> 41:51.940
This is what we wanted to happen.

41:51.940 --> 41:54.220
We wanted open source to kind of be the default

41:54.220 --> 41:56.520
and that's the point we're reaching.

41:56.520 --> 42:00.880
It's not universal, but I was just in a meeting today

42:00.880 --> 42:02.440
where they start with, okay, well,

42:02.440 --> 42:04.760
what components of this can we start with as open source?

42:04.760 --> 42:05.600
That's what the conversation,

42:05.600 --> 42:06.680
that's when they're talking about

42:06.680 --> 42:08.040
what Linux Academy is building next year,

42:08.040 --> 42:09.260
that's where they start the conversation.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.320
What component of these can we open source?

42:11.320 --> 42:13.480
At Jupyter Broadcasting now, we're doing the same thing.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.520
When we're working on the system,

42:14.520 --> 42:15.580
we're about to talk about.

42:15.580 --> 42:18.840
The conversation Wes and I consistently have is

42:18.840 --> 42:20.400
what of this do we open source?

42:20.400 --> 42:23.240
What open source tools can we already take advantage of

42:23.240 --> 42:25.340
so that way we can save time in building it?

42:25.340 --> 42:27.700
It just makes sense.

42:27.700 --> 42:29.680
It also helps reduce bus factor.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.760
I mean, there's tons of reasons to use open source.

42:32.760 --> 42:36.040
And I reiterate, what else did you expect?

42:36.040 --> 42:37.840
Did you want open source to be successful

42:37.840 --> 42:39.560
but not the defacto?

42:39.560 --> 42:40.640
I don't know, so these articles

42:40.640 --> 42:42.480
that try to pin it on one thing or another,

42:42.480 --> 42:43.680
they seem too narrow.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.360
Right, I mean, it's been a slow evolution

42:45.360 --> 42:46.760
this whole time, of course.

42:46.760 --> 42:50.520
And what other outcome would we want?

42:50.520 --> 42:52.220
I would also say that this is the hard work

42:52.220 --> 42:54.400
of a lot of advocates

42:54.400 --> 42:56.880
because even if you have free BSD servers

42:56.880 --> 42:57.720
running somewhere in the basement,

42:57.720 --> 42:59.480
that doesn't mean that the people at the top

42:59.480 --> 43:00.320
actually get it.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.160
And I think most of the time,

43:01.160 --> 43:02.520
it means that people at the top have no care,

43:02.520 --> 43:04.860
don't know what's happening in the tech below.

43:04.860 --> 43:07.160
And finally, we saw companies where the management

43:07.160 --> 43:09.360
and the parties in control are willing to embrace that

43:09.360 --> 43:11.280
and not be scared of open source and realize like,

43:11.280 --> 43:14.080
hey, this could be better for our bottom line.

43:14.080 --> 43:15.240
We can share and interrupt

43:15.240 --> 43:16.520
without having to be scared of it.

43:16.520 --> 43:18.920
We can still keep the stuff we need to keep secret.

43:18.920 --> 43:19.920
You get the lawyers on board,

43:19.920 --> 43:21.280
you get the board on board,

43:21.280 --> 43:22.720
and here we are today.

43:22.720 --> 43:26.640
Open source makes sense as the only way forward

43:26.640 --> 43:30.020
because it does provide the faster,

43:30.020 --> 43:31.700
better way of development.

43:31.700 --> 43:33.560
But I mean, the people at the top

43:33.560 --> 43:36.700
rarely even care what their phone is running.

43:37.720 --> 43:40.200
They don't know or necessarily care.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.780
They care about the bottom line.

43:41.780 --> 43:43.380
Open source saves some money.

43:43.380 --> 43:45.280
Without making this an endless discussion,

43:45.280 --> 43:46.720
I think that's also changing.

43:46.720 --> 43:49.560
Like we are actually having more technically savvy leaders

43:49.560 --> 43:52.600
because people don't buy into just these

43:52.600 --> 43:55.040
person like the Steve Jobs are not like

43:56.040 --> 43:58.320
popping up in there available everywhere

43:58.320 --> 44:00.260
for people to pick up.

44:00.260 --> 44:02.920
So technical leaders are now going on.

44:02.920 --> 44:05.920
If you look at all of the current major tech companies,

44:05.920 --> 44:07.740
the leaders are actually more tech savvy

44:07.740 --> 44:10.000
or come from a more tech background.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.980
But I digress.

44:12.980 --> 44:17.600
And I should say that whenever we're looking into

44:17.600 --> 44:20.960
Linux becoming the norm, well, we did a good job.

44:20.960 --> 44:24.200
We also give, we should give us credit.

44:24.200 --> 44:27.800
I mean, this show is a good credit to that, right?

44:27.800 --> 44:30.520
Just the amount of people I know that actually have,

44:30.520 --> 44:31.920
actually I was surprised.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.520
I had some, I'm in Germany now

44:34.520 --> 44:38.140
and I have some coworkers that I was never expecting.

44:38.140 --> 44:39.760
They actually are JV listeners.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.720
And it was like, yeah, that's new.

44:42.720 --> 44:43.560
Great.

44:43.560 --> 44:44.640
You know, that's actually something

44:44.640 --> 44:47.240
that I didn't used to also find frequently.

44:47.240 --> 44:49.040
Like I would say, hey, have you heard about

44:49.040 --> 44:51.160
this Jupiter broadcasting, people are like,

44:51.160 --> 44:52.720
I have no idea what they're talking about.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.760
And this is becoming also a normalization thing.

44:54.760 --> 44:58.320
It's like the culture, we're finally actually being able to,

44:58.320 --> 45:01.280
some projects, they grow big, they still open source,

45:01.280 --> 45:02.980
they're still friendly to new people,

45:02.980 --> 45:05.000
but they actually are stable.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.040
And whenever we don't, whenever we're not stable,

45:08.040 --> 45:11.760
you can just fork it and stabilize it at your pace.

45:11.760 --> 45:14.840
I would bring another thing to the discussion.

45:14.840 --> 45:17.800
There was this article, The Cathedral and the Bazaar.

45:17.800 --> 45:20.320
And I think that principle has won.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.800
So companies start to realize

45:22.800 --> 45:25.480
that close developer groups have their limits

45:25.480 --> 45:29.680
and open development is often faster and more creative.

45:29.680 --> 45:32.060
And that's, in that regard,

45:32.060 --> 45:34.800
I also see the acquisition of Red Hat by IBM.

45:34.800 --> 45:38.440
I see that in that context, that not a spirit,

45:38.440 --> 45:41.880
that bizarre spirit starts to change the world,

45:41.880 --> 45:43.120
in my opinion.

45:43.120 --> 45:46.320
And since open source is the standard now,

45:46.320 --> 45:48.040
it seemed like that was the direction

45:48.040 --> 45:51.200
for Jupiter Broadcasting to go with its new projects.

45:51.200 --> 45:54.680
And we've been trying to launch an automation system

45:54.680 --> 45:58.080
that will programmatically publish the shows.

45:58.080 --> 46:00.120
So that way, when they're finished

46:00.120 --> 46:02.840
and it goes in the master RSS feed,

46:02.840 --> 46:06.160
it goes out into all of the various other types of feeds,

46:06.160 --> 46:07.640
it gets published to the website,

46:07.640 --> 46:09.800
maybe even eventually completely automating

46:09.800 --> 46:11.720
the encoding pipeline.

46:11.720 --> 46:13.880
So Joe drops a WAV file in a folder

46:13.880 --> 46:17.600
and the next thing you know, videos and MP3s and RSS feeds

46:17.600 --> 46:21.080
and website posts have all been automatically created.

46:21.080 --> 46:23.440
And we were kicking around how to solve

46:23.440 --> 46:25.280
this particular problem for a while.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.840
Like, is this a series of cron jobs

46:27.840 --> 46:29.960
that sit around and check RSS feeds?

46:29.960 --> 46:34.480
Is this something that we have like an admin click a button

46:34.480 --> 46:36.560
and then it executes all of the various tasks

46:36.560 --> 46:38.240
like from a dashboard?

46:38.240 --> 46:41.720
And Wes came across a pretty cool project

46:41.720 --> 46:44.960
that in a sense lets you build your own if this then that,

46:44.960 --> 46:48.400
but like way more powerful.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.760
And it's called Hugin,

46:49.760 --> 46:50.880
at least that's how we're pronouncing it.

46:50.880 --> 46:53.760
It's, you know, one of those H-U-G-I-N-N.

46:53.760 --> 46:56.440
So it's kind of a vague, could be Hugin,

46:56.440 --> 46:57.480
but we really like Hugin

46:57.480 --> 46:59.880
cause it's like hugging all of our tasks together

46:59.880 --> 47:01.480
and our agents are on standby.

47:01.480 --> 47:03.320
It's really a system for building agents

47:03.320 --> 47:06.200
that perform automated tasks for you online.

47:06.200 --> 47:07.680
I could read the web, for example,

47:07.680 --> 47:09.120
it could watch for specific events,

47:09.120 --> 47:11.400
it can take an action on your behalf

47:11.400 --> 47:15.600
and agents create and consume events,

47:15.600 --> 47:18.760
which then propagate them along a directed graph.

47:18.760 --> 47:21.640
So think of it as a hackable version of Zapier

47:21.640 --> 47:24.040
or if this and that, that you run on your own server

47:24.040 --> 47:28.080
and Wes has set it up to publish shows automatically.

47:28.080 --> 47:30.720
And you wrote some custom code in there and things like that,

47:30.720 --> 47:31.560
but I don't know Wes,

47:31.560 --> 47:33.000
just kind of wanted to have you share your thoughts

47:33.000 --> 47:35.920
with the class on Hugin and building something like this

47:35.920 --> 47:39.440
and why this versus why not just a series of cron jobs?

47:39.440 --> 47:41.480
You know, that's a really good question and it's one

47:41.480 --> 47:44.040
of these tasks that's sort of trivial enough

47:44.040 --> 47:46.040
that probably anything can work.

47:46.040 --> 47:48.680
It could be an entirely custom application.

47:48.680 --> 47:49.880
It could be a series of cron jobs

47:49.880 --> 47:54.040
that pass just arbitrary text files or JSON blobs around.

47:54.040 --> 47:56.360
Some of the things I liked about Hugin, Hugin,

47:56.360 --> 47:57.480
whatever you want to call it,

47:57.480 --> 48:00.920
I will say it's based off of Norse mythology.

48:00.920 --> 48:04.600
Hugin and Munin are two ravens that sit on Odin's shoulders.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.200
Yeah, there you go.

48:06.200 --> 48:07.240
But I really like Hugin

48:07.240 --> 48:09.200
because it's like bringing all of our tasks together.

48:09.200 --> 48:10.160
You know, it's hugging it out.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.000
Yeah, exactly.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.480
Hugin, I guess is the official pronunciation.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.680
It makes sense and they, if you dig in here, look,

48:15.680 --> 48:17.400
they even have a picture illustration.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.080
So I guess that's pretty clear.

48:19.080 --> 48:20.760
Yeah, that is pretty, that is pretty clear.

48:20.760 --> 48:23.680
The parts I really liked about it was that it did have

48:23.680 --> 48:27.160
a decently fleshed out event model for you.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.640
And it has a lot of things that we wanted to use already.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.840
So things like Slack integrations

48:31.840 --> 48:32.960
or a whole bunch of other stuff, right?

48:32.960 --> 48:35.720
They've got Mattermost, a lot of other agents,

48:35.720 --> 48:38.280
things to automatically follow RSS feeds.

48:38.280 --> 48:41.600
And while I'm not always a huge Ruby fan

48:41.600 --> 48:43.160
for a variety of reasons,

48:43.160 --> 48:44.640
the project has done a good job

48:44.640 --> 48:46.240
of packaging things up pretty nicely.

48:46.240 --> 48:50.320
They've got multiple Docker files already just ready to go,

48:50.320 --> 48:52.840
easy to change, easy to customize if you need to.

48:52.840 --> 48:54.560
And if you wanna write a new plugin,

48:54.560 --> 48:56.040
well, you just make a new Ruby gem,

48:56.040 --> 48:58.320
load it on up and away you go.

48:58.320 --> 49:00.840
And because it has a pretty flexible event system

49:00.840 --> 49:02.680
already tied up with this directed graph,

49:02.680 --> 49:05.440
which is probably honestly what I would end up implementing

49:05.440 --> 49:07.280
if I was gonna write this all myself

49:07.280 --> 49:10.080
without all the nice UI and the extensibility on top.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.640
So it was kind of pre-plugged.

49:11.640 --> 49:13.480
Now, it doesn't do everything we want it to do,

49:13.480 --> 49:14.960
that was kind of a hassle,

49:14.960 --> 49:16.920
but because all we have to do is write a gem

49:16.920 --> 49:18.960
to say, you know, update so that we can work

49:18.960 --> 49:21.080
with one of the partners that we use to re-host our feeds,

49:21.080 --> 49:23.080
or we're working on a plugin right now

49:23.080 --> 49:24.720
to go do better video encoding

49:24.720 --> 49:27.200
and manage some of our uploads for us,

49:27.200 --> 49:28.880
that's all easy to do.

49:28.880 --> 49:31.760
All it has to do is consume and emit these events,

49:31.760 --> 49:34.760
which you can kind of think of as just sort of JSON blobs,

49:34.760 --> 49:36.240
arbitrary lists and maps.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.000
You know, you had some custom code in there

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
to like properly parse the feeds

49:40.000 --> 49:42.600
and get like the episode title information

49:42.600 --> 49:44.120
so you could repurpose it for other things.

49:44.120 --> 49:45.680
But one of the things you're able to do,

49:45.680 --> 49:47.280
which is really cool,

49:47.280 --> 49:50.440
is I now can go to the dashboard,

49:50.440 --> 49:51.280
the webpage that we have.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.080
We've hosted this on one of our droplets.

49:53.080 --> 49:55.760
I log in and I can see all of the agents,

49:55.760 --> 49:57.480
which are essentially the things that are like monitoring

49:57.480 --> 49:59.000
the different show feeds and whatnot.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.280
And the thing that's cool

50:00.280 --> 50:02.760
is some of the parameters are changeable.

50:02.760 --> 50:05.680
Like they're all broken out and there's a clear spot

50:05.680 --> 50:07.480
where I can change some of the settings.

50:07.480 --> 50:09.840
Like I can set it to a test publish

50:09.840 --> 50:12.000
instead of a live publish.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.080
I could change a few parameters

50:14.080 --> 50:17.880
that Wes has been able to call out specifically for the user

50:17.880 --> 50:22.280
and it gives it a specific area in the GUI

50:22.280 --> 50:25.200
for me to see those changeable variables essentially.

50:25.200 --> 50:26.160
Right, that's a nice thing.

50:26.160 --> 50:28.320
I don't have to make some custom UI here

50:28.320 --> 50:30.240
or, you know, have a config file

50:30.240 --> 50:32.320
that's easy for regular humans to understand.

50:32.320 --> 50:34.560
Now, of course you can go do all of that if you want to,

50:34.560 --> 50:37.760
but Hugin's got a pretty decent UI right on top

50:37.760 --> 50:39.640
and they have this concept of like options.

50:39.640 --> 50:41.360
So for any plugin that you write,

50:41.360 --> 50:42.920
you can expose user facing options.

50:42.920 --> 50:45.120
They can customize it, they can load custom data.

50:45.120 --> 50:47.120
Some of the places we post shows, for instance,

50:47.120 --> 50:48.880
have a lot of weird oddities.

50:48.880 --> 50:50.840
None of the names are exactly the same pattern.

50:50.840 --> 50:52.800
So each one has to be custom.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.840
Instead of me having to pre-program that into the plugin,

50:55.840 --> 50:57.800
I can just let the user enter that in

50:57.800 --> 50:58.840
once they use my plugin.

50:58.840 --> 51:00.120
So it makes it a lot more extensible

51:00.120 --> 51:01.880
and a lot more reusable.

51:01.880 --> 51:04.160
The way you've set it up is it's ingesting

51:04.160 --> 51:06.400
from the RSS feed, then it's making decisions

51:06.400 --> 51:09.800
based on the show, and then triggering other events,

51:09.800 --> 51:12.080
which then sort of go through the same process.

51:12.080 --> 51:15.160
And for us, it also then gives us a spot

51:15.160 --> 51:16.240
to audit what's happened.

51:16.240 --> 51:19.600
So one of the things about building an automated system

51:19.600 --> 51:21.520
is, especially when you're just building your own scripts,

51:21.520 --> 51:24.200
is you're maybe not as inclined to really put in

51:24.200 --> 51:27.480
a ton of logging in your own Bash script or whatever.

51:27.480 --> 51:31.520
So this system has pretty extensive logging built in.

51:31.520 --> 51:33.920
So if something doesn't successfully publish

51:33.920 --> 51:35.920
or there's an error somewhere in the process,

51:35.920 --> 51:38.480
it's fairly straightforward for us to track that down.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.960
Yeah, it kind of seemed to be just enough structure

51:40.960 --> 51:42.240
because it's not a huge project.

51:42.240 --> 51:44.360
It's not going to do every single thing for GB,

51:44.360 --> 51:46.800
but I think there will be a few odds and ends,

51:46.800 --> 51:49.000
probably a number of ones that we can throw in here.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.360
But it wasn't as big.

51:50.360 --> 51:53.520
It's not like, it's not Jenkins and it's not Rundeck.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.400
Those are both good tools, but for the things we wanted,

51:55.400 --> 51:57.760
we didn't, we're not using it to build software.

51:57.760 --> 51:59.880
We don't have a lot of complicated, stateful stuff.

51:59.880 --> 52:02.280
It's really just chaining things together.

52:02.280 --> 52:03.680
Right, I mean, there's going to be times

52:03.680 --> 52:06.760
where this thing's just kicking off a Bash script

52:06.760 --> 52:08.040
to do a bunch of work on the backend

52:08.040 --> 52:10.160
where maybe something more complicated is happening.

52:10.160 --> 52:12.760
But we can trigger that based on a previous event,

52:12.760 --> 52:14.320
which is where Hugin will come in.

52:14.320 --> 52:17.080
Yeah, the other nice part is they have decently fleshed out

52:17.080 --> 52:19.760
just arbitrary sort of web request plugins

52:19.760 --> 52:23.880
as well as connections so you can do pushes to Hugin.

52:23.880 --> 52:25.800
So you can stand a server up there,

52:25.800 --> 52:28.080
get a HTTP push of things that you want

52:28.080 --> 52:29.560
and then spawn other events from there.

52:29.560 --> 52:30.840
So pretty flexible, yeah.

52:30.840 --> 52:32.320
Hey Wes, I have a question for you.

52:32.320 --> 52:33.960
Yeah, oh yeah, Brent.

52:33.960 --> 52:36.840
How do you feel about the future proof of this system?

52:36.840 --> 52:38.280
I know you've put a lot of work into it,

52:38.280 --> 52:42.520
but how long do you think it'll be useful to JB?

52:42.520 --> 52:43.360
You know, that's a good question.

52:43.360 --> 52:45.560
That is something I've been thinking about.

52:45.560 --> 52:48.520
Part of the hopes was that with the developed UI,

52:48.520 --> 52:52.240
I mean, next time JB launches the next exciting JB show,

52:52.240 --> 52:55.480
stay tuned everyone, then it'll be easy.

52:55.480 --> 52:56.960
It won't have to be me that's involved.

52:56.960 --> 52:58.240
It'd be straightforward enough

52:58.240 --> 52:59.240
that someone else on the network,

52:59.240 --> 53:00.800
someone involved or just administrative staff

53:00.800 --> 53:03.960
or whatever the case may be, could go in and update it.

53:03.960 --> 53:05.240
Yeah, that's the nice part.

53:05.240 --> 53:09.480
That is really, you define events for a show

53:09.480 --> 53:10.600
and then those are exportable

53:10.600 --> 53:12.400
and we can re-import them, change the names

53:12.400 --> 53:15.840
to protect the innocent and in a sense duplicate the work

53:15.840 --> 53:18.080
and it doesn't have to be Wes creating a bunch

53:18.080 --> 53:20.520
of custom code for a new app for a new show.

53:20.520 --> 53:21.640
Yeah, exactly.

53:21.640 --> 53:24.800
The other thing is it's been relatively active,

53:24.800 --> 53:26.720
not super active, but relatively active

53:26.720 --> 53:29.120
and it's not that complicated.

53:29.120 --> 53:31.240
One thing I do like to audit for things like this

53:31.240 --> 53:33.200
is can I grok the source code?

53:33.200 --> 53:35.200
Can I scroll through it and figure out at least

53:35.200 --> 53:36.880
the high level of what's going on?

53:36.880 --> 53:38.240
Oh, here's the piece I need to go.

53:38.240 --> 53:40.000
Here's the piece over there that I need to find.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.160
And in this case, yes.

53:41.160 --> 53:43.920
So even if it stagnates terribly

53:43.920 --> 53:46.000
and no new features get developed,

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
I think we can still use it.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.520
It's already packaged up in a nice little Docker file

53:49.520 --> 53:52.200
and it's really just a bunch of Ruby dependencies.

53:52.200 --> 53:53.320
So as long as those don't have

53:53.320 --> 53:56.720
super major breaking API changes, we'll be fine.

53:56.720 --> 53:59.200
The other thing is we're just using it internally.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.920
So it won't have any like regular user interface.

54:01.920 --> 54:04.240
So we can go up on the security on that side,

54:04.240 --> 54:06.080
make sure that only the people that need to have access

54:06.080 --> 54:07.400
have access to it.

54:07.400 --> 54:10.000
And then even if we do have an old dependency,

54:10.000 --> 54:11.480
well, I'm less worried about it.

54:11.480 --> 54:13.920
Looks like some minor stuff in the documentation

54:13.920 --> 54:15.120
was updated six days ago.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.920
So it's not under heavy development,

54:16.920 --> 54:18.240
but the team is still alive

54:18.240 --> 54:20.040
or the individual, whoever's behind it,

54:20.040 --> 54:24.320
is DS and or is still active.

54:24.320 --> 54:26.280
So that's part one.

54:26.280 --> 54:30.320
So that's a Hugin or Hugin or Hogan or Hogan's heroes,

54:30.320 --> 54:31.160
whatever you wanna call it.

54:31.160 --> 54:34.040
That's the open source by default that we went with,

54:34.040 --> 54:35.520
but now to make it really hip and modern

54:35.520 --> 54:38.080
and actually for a very practical reason,

54:38.080 --> 54:40.400
it's all packaged up inside a container.

54:40.400 --> 54:43.920
So we have it running on the Fedora 29 host

54:43.920 --> 54:46.040
that I've talked about just on the last episode.

54:46.040 --> 54:50.360
And it is now one of the containers on this box.

54:50.360 --> 54:52.480
Why did we go with a Docker container, Wes?

54:52.480 --> 54:53.840
I mean, we could have just installed it

54:53.840 --> 54:54.880
on the Fedora machine.

54:54.880 --> 54:56.520
You know, we definitely could have,

54:56.520 --> 54:58.520
but it meant that we get to skip

54:58.520 --> 54:59.760
a lot of the little details.

54:59.760 --> 55:02.120
For one, the main Docker container it's based on

55:02.120 --> 55:03.360
and a lot of the developer environment

55:03.360 --> 55:05.520
seems to be on Ubuntu.

55:05.520 --> 55:07.200
Now that's not a huge deal

55:07.200 --> 55:09.280
and we could certainly bootstrap all the gems

55:09.280 --> 55:11.240
that we needed right there on the Fedora host.

55:11.240 --> 55:12.960
But with the Docker workflow,

55:12.960 --> 55:14.280
you get a lot of nice things, right?

55:14.280 --> 55:16.200
So we can have, right now we have our own fork

55:16.200 --> 55:17.040
of the project.

55:17.040 --> 55:18.320
Later we'll be pushing everything upstream

55:18.320 --> 55:21.080
as we solidify on design choices and et cetera.

55:21.080 --> 55:22.240
And that means when I'm ready to,

55:22.240 --> 55:24.200
I can just go build a new Docker container,

55:24.200 --> 55:26.080
push it over to our server,

55:26.080 --> 55:27.360
reload with the new container.

55:27.360 --> 55:30.360
It's got a separate database kept off somewhere else

55:30.360 --> 55:31.520
statefully on the machine.

55:31.520 --> 55:32.920
So we don't have to worry about that.

55:32.920 --> 55:35.160
Reload the container and the latest released,

55:35.160 --> 55:36.760
all the changes are right there.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.600
I know that there's no weird local state that,

55:38.600 --> 55:40.120
you know, you edited something and forgot to change it

55:40.120 --> 55:42.400
or I didn't notify you about changing something

55:42.400 --> 55:43.720
because it always builds fresh.

55:43.720 --> 55:45.960
It always comes from our Docker source.

55:45.960 --> 55:47.000
Yeah, that's pretty neat

55:47.000 --> 55:51.200
because the other part of that is down the road,

55:51.200 --> 55:53.040
it could be deployed to a laptop.

55:53.040 --> 55:54.840
So when I'm on the road, I'm offline.

55:54.840 --> 55:57.640
I could in theory have the entire automation

55:57.640 --> 56:01.560
and encoding system in a container on my laptop.

56:01.560 --> 56:03.000
That would be the same exact one

56:03.000 --> 56:05.160
that we run on our production server.

56:05.160 --> 56:06.120
And that's pretty neat

56:06.120 --> 56:08.880
because you can start to modularize that a little bit.

56:08.880 --> 56:12.200
So say we later add video components to this.

56:12.200 --> 56:14.880
Well, video encoding could be its own container

56:14.880 --> 56:18.240
that perhaps while I'm on the road is unnecessary.

56:18.240 --> 56:19.680
I won't be doing any video jobs.

56:19.680 --> 56:22.000
So I don't need the video encoding container.

56:22.000 --> 56:23.480
But on the server, you would deploy

56:23.480 --> 56:26.800
both the main Hugin container and the video container

56:26.800 --> 56:28.440
so that we could do all the jobs.

56:28.440 --> 56:31.440
And that modularity and that flexibility is pretty sweet.

56:31.440 --> 56:34.200
And by having it all tied back upstream,

56:34.200 --> 56:36.280
that means that we're always, when we're deploying,

56:36.280 --> 56:39.040
we're always deploying the same consistent image

56:39.040 --> 56:41.800
to both my production laptop and the production server.

56:41.800 --> 56:43.560
Yeah, and Hugin has some pretty good support

56:43.560 --> 56:46.680
for both dry runs and injecting manual events.

56:46.680 --> 56:48.200
So even if you're in a case where like you were,

56:48.200 --> 56:49.560
you wanted to run it yourself, you had a one-off,

56:49.560 --> 56:50.400
you just did a special,

56:50.400 --> 56:52.560
and telling the JB audience about a cool new project

56:52.560 --> 56:55.000
you were working on or you had a neat little vlog post

56:55.000 --> 56:56.720
that you decided to get back into doing,

56:56.720 --> 56:57.920
you release that to the stream,

56:57.920 --> 56:58.880
you could do it all locally

56:58.880 --> 57:00.160
and you wouldn't have to jumpstart,

57:00.160 --> 57:01.200
you wouldn't have to make sure

57:01.200 --> 57:02.920
you have all the webhooks wired up correctly.

57:02.920 --> 57:04.840
You could just inject a manual event,

57:04.840 --> 57:06.040
push it through the system.

57:06.040 --> 57:07.720
Yeah, isn't that, it's just so neat.

57:07.720 --> 57:09.040
It's gonna be so neat.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.080
And if we can down the road,

57:11.080 --> 57:13.680
like we may even just publish the container up on Docker Hub.

57:13.680 --> 57:14.720
So if you wanna do the same

57:14.720 --> 57:17.560
and you wanna use our encoding and publishing system,

57:17.560 --> 57:19.440
you'd have to change the configs and stuff.

57:19.440 --> 57:21.840
And we have to go through and make sure

57:21.840 --> 57:23.160
that we don't have anything embarrassing

57:23.160 --> 57:24.120
in there like our passwords.

57:24.120 --> 57:26.040
But we've actually been trying to build it

57:26.040 --> 57:29.280
from the beginning in a way where we could always do that.

57:29.280 --> 57:31.560
So we have in mind, we just have to double check.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.760
And the idea could be,

57:33.760 --> 57:35.480
I mean, one day what we're gonna try to get to

57:35.480 --> 57:39.400
is you have everything you need

57:39.400 --> 57:43.520
to really get one Linux box or a fleet of Linux boxes

57:43.520 --> 57:44.840
as a podcast production system.

57:44.840 --> 57:47.480
Because when you combine from two episodes ago

57:47.480 --> 57:49.560
when we released our get jacked scripts,

57:49.560 --> 57:52.000
which I used today even to do this show,

57:52.000 --> 57:54.440
I just use those scripts that we've released as open source

57:54.440 --> 57:56.720
to completely pre-configure my jack environment

57:56.720 --> 57:58.040
and route all my audio.

57:58.040 --> 57:59.840
And I'm sitting here talking to you right now

57:59.840 --> 58:04.040
from a laptop that really is,

58:04.040 --> 58:06.920
it's amazing how quiet and well-performing it is

58:06.920 --> 58:09.280
when you consider it's an entire studio

58:09.280 --> 58:11.400
being routed inside my machine right now

58:11.400 --> 58:14.120
with multiple ins and outs and physical hardware

58:14.120 --> 58:15.680
and software sound devices

58:15.680 --> 58:17.800
and multiple applications that are feeding it.

58:17.800 --> 58:20.080
And we released all of that as open source.

58:20.080 --> 58:23.040
And there is hopefully going to eventually be

58:23.040 --> 58:24.240
sort of this complete picture

58:24.240 --> 58:27.080
where the setting up of the machine,

58:27.080 --> 58:29.400
the publishing of the podcast,

58:29.400 --> 58:31.400
the encoding of the podcast,

58:31.400 --> 58:33.680
more and more will become just,

58:33.680 --> 58:36.240
as we expand our process, will become open source

58:36.240 --> 58:38.720
that people could use to start their own podcasts.

58:38.720 --> 58:41.520
And then eventually we'll get into actual hardware

58:41.520 --> 58:43.040
and that'll be just documentation that we do.

58:43.040 --> 58:45.880
But that's all down the road and stuff

58:45.880 --> 58:47.680
that I won't even fully commit to yet

58:47.680 --> 58:51.040
because we have also big ambitious show goals.

58:51.040 --> 58:53.400
But the idea, hopefully we'll be able to,

58:53.400 --> 58:55.080
the more we can automate with this system,

58:55.080 --> 58:57.000
the more time we have to work on open sourcing

58:57.000 --> 58:58.320
and building the rest of that stuff.

58:58.320 --> 59:01.600
That's the idea is, just for those of you

59:01.600 --> 59:03.360
that are curious what kind of change this makes

59:03.360 --> 59:06.360
for us in-house, is last time I tracked it,

59:06.360 --> 59:09.800
and this may actually have increased since then,

59:09.800 --> 59:13.440
is it's 175 individual steps that a human being,

59:13.440 --> 59:16.680
actions that a human being must take to publish an episode.

59:16.680 --> 59:18.920
You figure we got one or two sometimes going out a day.

59:18.920 --> 59:20.040
And that's not even the editing, right?

59:20.040 --> 59:23.440
That's just from the edited final WAV file

59:23.440 --> 59:25.160
to pushing it out to all you guys.

59:25.160 --> 59:29.560
Best time, mind you, that I've been doing this

59:29.560 --> 59:31.720
for about 12 years.

59:31.720 --> 59:33.880
My best time is usually about 22 minutes

59:33.880 --> 59:35.040
to get an episode published.

59:35.040 --> 59:36.600
And that's if I pre-stage things,

59:36.600 --> 59:38.480
like I pre-stage all my tabs.

59:38.480 --> 59:41.160
I have it down to a science.

59:41.160 --> 59:44.160
Like I know, I have the WordPress install so well,

59:44.160 --> 59:46.160
I know it so well that I know like what things

59:46.160 --> 59:47.880
take a while to load, so I go to the other tab,

59:47.880 --> 59:49.240
and I take an action in that tab,

59:49.240 --> 59:50.400
and I know how long that takes to load,

59:50.400 --> 59:52.200
so I switch back to another tab, and then I do the,

59:52.200 --> 59:54.280
I mean, I'm telling you, there's no downtime here.

59:54.280 --> 59:55.800
Everything's preloaded, the artwork's done,

59:55.800 --> 59:57.920
everything's ready to go, and it's still 22 minutes

59:57.920 --> 59:58.960
is like my best time.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.320
And that's after doing it for 12 years.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.200
And so it's about 175 actions.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.480
I haven't counted for a while because it's so tedious.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.600
So that is huge because that takes up a part of my day

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.000
every day, a part of Angela's day every day.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.880
And it also means frequently that people are sitting

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.360
around waiting for episodes to get published.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.320
And it's just a matter of like the show's done,

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.840
but nobody's awake to push all 175 buttons.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.600
And it's just manual labor because until now

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.280
wasn't a really clear way to tie it all together.

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.480
And that's where Hogan, or Hogan's Heroes,

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.520
has really come in and given us sort of this cohesive piece

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:40.200
that we can build off of to tie all of these things together.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.080
And we're just beginning, and we're trying to build it

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.560
in a way where we can share it with everybody,

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.320
but we wanted to give you sort of a bit of an update

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.600
so that way as we come across a couple of open source tools

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.920
that just are like, holy crap,

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.280
this is gonna be such a game changer for us,

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.360
like gotta share it with you guys.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.720
Because maybe if you just want to monitor the weather

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.360
and have it trigger an event, this will do that.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.880
Like it doesn't have to be like you're trying

01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:03.920
to publish podcasts, like it's,

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.520
there's all kinds of things you could use it for.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.720
So we'll have a link to it in the show notes.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.560
I'm gonna go check it out.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.680
And also, we'll have a link in the show notes

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.240
to our submission, I guess it's a Google form?

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.480
I don't know what they call these things.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.400
Goes into a sheet, and it's a,

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.880
we're trying to collect suggestions

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.040
for what to name the entire system when we're all done,

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.320
because Hogan is just part of it.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.040
There's other components to it.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.920
And we want to just have a name so we can say,

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.800
go get the latest version of,

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.120
and it will be encompassing of the entire thing.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.440
And we've gotten a bunch of really funny submissions,

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.760
really good ones so far, and some great like,

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.280
ones that I'm surprised, I just didn't think of,

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.720
like there's some really obvious ones in there,

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:41.920
but there's a whole range.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.200
And what we're gonna do is we're gonna try

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.040
to distill it down to like four or five of them,

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.360
and then open it up to a vote.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.560
And then the community will name our new baby.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.120
So find the link in the show notes

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.600
at linuxunplugged.com slash 274,

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.480
and look for the automation naming,

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.960
automation system naming Google Form.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.480
Mr. Payne, is there anything else we want to mention

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.600
about Hogan there, or Hogan?

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.320
I just think it's kind of new ground we're exploring here.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.800
So if you have similar systems,

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.600
you have technology you like for automating

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.600
sort of responsive event-driven workflows.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.040
And to keep in mind that we're not a giant enterprise,

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.440
there's gonna be four people who touch this

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.760
for the time being maybe.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.920
So a tool that's right sized for that,

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.320
I would love to hear about it.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.320
Yeah, that's a great point.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.560
There are a lot of tools,

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.600
but we need one that's appropriate for our scale.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:30.800
Here's a tool for you.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.720
You know, why not Electron app all the things I always say?

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.560
You know, why not?

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:39.640
Like just get 64 gigs of RAM and Electron all the things.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.840
No, here's our app pick for the day.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.600
I kid, but at the same time, it kind of looks legit.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.560
It's called CPOD.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.880
It's an open source cross-platform podcast app.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.000
And yes, as you guessed it, it is Electron,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.200
but it's FOSS has what I would say

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.680
is the best write up on the internet about this.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.840
Hands down.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.680
With some beautiful late night Linux album artwork

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.160
there in the demo screenshot

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.680
and later on some Linux action news

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.720
that may be making me slightly biased towards their post,

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.480
but either way, they do a great write up here.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:13.480
Simple, clean podcasting app that does a really decent job

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.680
of listing out the podcasts on your computer

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.560
and let you listen to them.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.840
It has a dark mode.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.760
It uses the iTunes podcast directory,

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.320
which a lot of these apps do.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.680
And it has, of course, all of the essentials like

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.440
the speed up and slow down playback modes,

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.560
auto fetching of new episodes, multiple language support,

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.840
all kinds of sorting options.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.360
But I thought this one was a good one

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.080
that I think more apps should implement.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.400
You can sync your podcast subscriptions with gpodder.net.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.080
And that right there.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.480
Yeah, when I saw that, I just, I love that.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.640
I don't listen a lot.

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.800
I'll either use the Pocket Cast web player

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.360
or the Overcast web player if I'm listening on the desktop.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.480
But you'd be surprised how many times

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.040
we get people writing into the show asking,

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.040
hey, how could I manage podcasts on the desktop?

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.520
There's not like a great, there's like not a clear way.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.480
So C pod could be one of them.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.240
It says here in the article that you can snap install C pod.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.480
I tried to do that and it did not work for me.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.320
I tried that as well.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.240
It didn't work great, but I do have it running

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.040
thanks to App Image right here on the studio machines

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:13.880
up on the live stream.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.720
And it's pretty easy.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.960
I mean, I've already got, I'm listening to Light Night Linux

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.840
and Linux Action News right now.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.120
Nice, how's it look?

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.080
Do you think it's a good, I thought it was a good UI.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:22.920
What do you think?

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.760
Oh yeah, it's pretty clear and easy.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.640
It didn't take me very long to understand.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.480
It has the normal sort of stuff,

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.240
like a place to go find new podcasts.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.760
And then once you've subscribed,

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.720
a home location where all of your subscribed podcasts

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.360
show up in a sort of feed style.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.600
Like you'd expect from a podcast app.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.200
And now you got one for your desktop.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.720
All of the good luck for them.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.240
Maybe reconsider the name because a search for their name

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.040
also shows chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.520
Oh no.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.600
Serious.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.560
Yeah, all right.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.520
Well, okay.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.480
That's my advice.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:55.840
All the luck, open source, it's Electron,

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:58.120
but you know, pulmonary disease and Electron.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.640
I say, why not own it?

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.320
Call it like Electron Potter or something.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.080
Just own it because in the name,

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.560
it also says it's cross platform.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.360
So if you've got several desktops of different OSs

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.360
and you want to sync your podcast across all of them.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.680
If somebody had a bad experience with Electron in the past

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.920
and they read Electron and it shouldn't really matter

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.000
what the technology is, if the tool is good, right?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:20.760
So check it out.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.880
We'll have a link in the show notes to its bosses right up.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.160
So that way you can see the advantages.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.960
It's also available in many of your local repos,

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.760
surprise, surprise, including the arch user repository.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.840
I know shocker on that one.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.600
Didn't see that one coming, did you?

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.280
I thought, I thought though the podcast audience

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.760
might appreciate a podcast app.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:37.600
So that's up there.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.040
If you want it linuxunplug.com slash 274, go grab that.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.480
And if you've got an app pick or a topic suggestion

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.680
or something like that, let us know linuxunplug.com

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.680
slash contact, or you can tweet me.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.240
I'm at Chris LAS.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.560
Mr. Payne is at West Payne.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:53.120
That's Payne with a Y.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:56.760
And you are more than welcome to come hang out

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.280
in our virtual lug on Tuesdays.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.160
We do it at 2 p.m. Pacific, which turns out,

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.240
turns out it's like 4 p.m. Central time.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.080
Who knew?

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.160
Nobody knew until I arrived.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.200
Nobody knew that, no.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.640
Not a single person in that time zone had figured it out,

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.040
which is, they're lucky they have you.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.080
Yeah, I know, man.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.120
If I didn't travel around the world,

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.960
how could I inform people of my wisdoms?

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.800
It's a good thing, it's a good thing.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.240
And also, it gets converted to your local time

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.840
at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.040
One more plug, go help us name the automation system,

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.480
because it's something internally

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.880
that we'll be referring to for the rest of time, likely.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.240
And it'll be something that we say in meetings.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.360
It'll be something that we say

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.680
when we're introducing new people to the how we do things.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.440
It'll be potentially something that people deploy

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.560
on their own systems.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.640
So help us name this thing.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.140
And I think what we'll do is we'll leave the votes open

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.240
for one more week,

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.840
because I really want to get a name for it.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.440
I'm very excited about this.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.040
So we'll probably do one more week or so.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:58.800
After that, we'll probably have the vote.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.360
So if you're listening, say, two, three weeks on delay,

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.760
the vote may already be happening.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.160
So you might want to check the latest show notes.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.800
But again, that's linked to at linuxunplug.com slash 274.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.680
But that wraps us up for this week's episode.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.920
Thanks so much for joining us,

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.160
and we will see you next Tuesday.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:41.120
Okay, bye guys.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:49.520
Hey, Chris, I have a question for you.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.520
Yes, sir.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:55.040
Today is November 6, and November 7 marks the Dropbox switchover.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.040
Yeah.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:01.840
I just wondered if you had an update and if anyone else had any updates.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.640
Oh, man.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.040
Turns out Chris has been embracing the ext4 lifestyle.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.720
He's all about it now.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:13.200
I have actually loaded a couple, like my new ThinkPad is ext4, just in case I had to kick

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.200
this can for a little bit.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.200
I got this...

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:22.080
See, here's the problem is I got this network effect going on that has amplified recently.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.600
The crew here at Linux Academy is using Dropbox.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.560
They use it fairly extensively.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:32.860
The other problem is that several of the publishing services that we currently use are integrated

01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:33.860
with Dropbox.

01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:38.840
I actually queue the files up for encoding by moving them to a Dropbox folder, and then

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.280
they get uploaded to the service, which then ingests them, and then it outputs the results

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.480
to another Dropbox folder.

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.200
It's pretty integrated right now.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:56.480
On top of that, I have not been fully happy with any individual replacement for various

01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.800
reasons.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:01.240
For example, Nextcloud is pretty much set now.

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.280
I'm pretty happy with Nextcloud, and their mobile app is sufficient where I can upload

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.680
images like when I'm at MeetBSD or whatever to start writing a blog.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:12.720
That's all working fantastic.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.680
The web interface has been tops.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:18.120
The performance is where I want it at now, which has always been my primary complaint

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.120
from years past.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.280
Performance is where I want it now.

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.640
They've got undeletion of files.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:29.120
Desktop sync integrates beautifully with Plasma Desktop, way better than Dropbox does.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:34.240
The only issue I have is that, no, it's that network effect.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:39.280
The performance, I believe, is better with Dropbox still, but they have massive CDNs,

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:46.360
and I'm uploading to a single Droplet, so that doesn't surprise me.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:53.920
I don't have enough time to admin the storage, and so what happens is I get going on a project,

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:58.800
and I fill up what I've allocated, and my Nextcloud quits working.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.180
I sit down to go to my computer to go into production mode, and my files aren't there,

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:07.160
and that's how I discover, oh yeah, that's right, I did see a critical error message

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.280
pop up, but they happen.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280
It's very verbose.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.680
I get a lot of, your Nextcloud instance needs your attention, critical error.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.760
I get errors, and then I go there, and there's no error.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.900
I guess there's one question.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:22.820
Would it help you, because even though you would probably still want to read the message

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:28.120
at some point, if it just automatically scaled your Droplet?

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:40.120
Maybe, but then I get into a cost range, where it's not really economically, yeah, exactly.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:46.020
Do you have any other place that you currently have for, you probably do, which is for cold

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.020
storage locally?

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:50.440
Oh yeah, we have a big old Freenaz in the studio.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:56.240
I can see this as, for your pipeline, there's something that just triggers, if for some

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:04.600
reason you reach the limit, it scales it for a limit, and then it triggers the other process

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:08.640
to offload from it, because you don't need it there anymore, after all.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.720
You have the cold storage in the mass, and then you're just there.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:17.680
Actually the Hugin, I would be very interested to see a Hugin doing this, and at least you

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.440
can actually not succumb to the proprietary world, Chris, you can do this, I trust you.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.800
Maybe, there might be a way, it's just, it's very, you know, I've got to build a solution

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:31.720
to do it, and so that, you have Hugin, that's the whole thing, let's put it to test.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.960
I would say you have Wes, you have Wes to do it.

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:37.040
Well, that's what I would do, I'd ask Wes to do it, I would ask Wes to build the Hugin

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.760
connection, and yeah, just R-Sync it for me, Wes, please.

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:45.760
No, I hadn't really, you know, I hadn't really landed on a way to solve that.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.720
I bet you there'd have to be some reorganization to start offlining stuff, but I bet you there's

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:56.480
a lot of stuff we have in there that could be accessed once a month, once every quarter

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:00.480
even, that could totally be sitting on the free NAS rig.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.120
So yeah, that might be a pretty clever solution to this problem.

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:09.840
I don't know when I would get it done, that's the issue, is I ran up to the deadline now.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:13.640
So there's probably machines in the studio that I guess won't sync anymore.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.520
So I got to solve it, I guess when I get back, it's probably one of the things on the top

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.520
of my list.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.520
Thanks, Brent.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.960
Well, I have one more little itty-bitty question about that.

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:27.720
I know a few years ago, you guys were looking, you and Noah were looking at Nextcloud when

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.560
I was much younger, and you were running into some file syncing issues with, I think it

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.560
was a large number of files.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.560
Are you seeing any of that now?

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.560
Yeah.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.560
It's not called Nextcloud by then.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.560
Come on.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.560
Homecloud.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.560
Yeah, back then it was Homecloud.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.560
Sorry.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.560
No.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:47.280
You know, I guess I haven't put like the two or three terabytes that I have in Dropbox

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:53.180
in there, but I've put 100 gigs in there, and I haven't yet had an issue.

01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:59.440
The thing that helps a lot is I have been a little more selective about what goes into

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.440
Nextcloud.

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.440
So it's a little more current.

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.440
And so it's...

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.040
I don't know how to put it.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:07.440
It's not just like I haven't just been doing like big data dumps like we did early on.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.920
So it's been a little more selective about what goes in there.

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.660
So I haven't done like a four gig file that's landed in there.

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:17.320
But the other thing that I really like in Nextcloud that I hadn't played with in the

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:23.720
past, which makes a big difference, is they have an ignored files list that you can use.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:29.080
And when you go in there and you edit this, you can actually leave out an entire directory.

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.320
It's not just individual files.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.160
And so on like my laptop with a small SSD, I just won't even sync those files now, which

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.100
also alleviated the problem a bit.

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:38.020
Are you thinking about Nextcloud?

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.720
So I've been playing with it for the last few weeks, and it's been going really, really

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:41.720
well.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:45.760
And a few of those questions were at the back of my mind like, hmm, am I getting into a

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.760
trap here?

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.640
But so far, it's been quite amazing.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.560
And I don't generate a huge amount of data.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.560
But there's...

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.160
It's only a trap if you try to consume the content directly through it.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.160
I'm sorry.

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.160
I shouldn't say these things.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.160
It's true.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:14.680
But it is how it is.

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:19.440
Right?
