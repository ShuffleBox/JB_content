WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
So Wes and I have been kind of geeking out and

00:01.800 --> 00:05.560
following the development of getting Linux support for

00:05.560 --> 00:09.240
the M1 platform, like completely upstream support.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.840
And Hector Martin and the Linux team, they're working on that.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.360
And as part of this interest and just kind of documenting it so

00:15.360 --> 00:18.800
we can report on the shows, Wes was watching one of the live streams last

00:18.800 --> 00:23.040
night that Hector Martin does of development, fascinating insights.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.120
And listen to how they're actually developing the GPU driver,

00:26.120 --> 00:31.120
which they've just upstreamed some of the M1 GPU driver

00:31.120 --> 00:37.920
support to Mesa with 75% OpenGL ES compliance, which is wild at this stage.

00:37.920 --> 00:38.880
But how are they doing this?

00:38.880 --> 00:41.560
Since they don't have a complete Linux operating system to run and

00:41.560 --> 00:44.240
develop on, they have an amazing hack.

00:44.240 --> 00:48.000
Yeah, the M1 GPU driver, that's the user space part, by the way.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.280
So it's running on Mac OS at this point, but

00:50.280 --> 00:53.040
it's really awesome that it's passing a ton of the tests already.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.680
So that's why I really wanna work on this hypervisor,

00:55.680 --> 01:00.520
because once this works, it will give me the information I need to write

01:00.520 --> 01:01.760
the kernel side of this.

01:01.760 --> 01:05.440
And since the user space side is going so well, basically,

01:05.440 --> 01:11.440
once the kernel side has basic GPU context and memory management,

01:11.440 --> 01:14.320
we can plug that in and then suddenly everything works on Linux too.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.560
So it's really cool that we're getting so much progress.

01:18.560 --> 01:22.280
I had a private conversation with Hector and he told me that he was optimistic

01:22.280 --> 01:25.440
that we may have a usable desktop by December.

01:25.440 --> 01:30.040
And I thought he was crazy when he said that, I thought, no way, no way.

01:30.040 --> 01:33.120
But now that I hear that, he might be onto something.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.360
Sounds like you better start budgeting, buddy.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.560
I don't think so.

01:36.560 --> 01:39.920
I mean, if you think about it, Wes, if you're gonna spend that kind of money,

01:39.920 --> 01:42.280
it's gotta be, if you're gonna do it for a brand new computer,

01:42.280 --> 01:44.040
it has to be really operational.

01:44.040 --> 01:48.160
I think at this stage, it's gonna be, you can do data recovery,

01:48.160 --> 01:52.000
you can do forensics, you could do some sort of rescue and

01:52.000 --> 01:53.360
get basic Linux functionality.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.840
I think that's gonna be where we get to in 2021.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.240
But that's gonna be really valuable.

01:57.240 --> 02:08.480
Hello, good looking and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

02:08.480 --> 02:09.440
My name is Chris.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.440
My name is Wes.

02:10.440 --> 02:11.960
Hello, Wes.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.760
You know, you didn't have to wear the postal outfit for today's episode.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.840
That wasn't required.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.960
You turned the studio into a post office.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.680
I just thought I'd dress to fit.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.800
This episode is brought to you by the all new at Cloud Guru,

02:22.800 --> 02:26.640
the leader in learning for Linux, the cloud, and other modern tech skills.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.520
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs.

02:28.520 --> 02:32.320
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

02:32.320 --> 02:36.560
Well, coming up on episode 404, it's webmail has been found.

02:36.560 --> 02:40.080
It's the finale of the email server series this week.

02:40.080 --> 02:45.840
It's a three-part series, and we have one last important task we must finish.

02:45.840 --> 02:48.600
We must get webmail up and running after a back and forth.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.800
If we were gonna do it, we decided, yes, it's a feature we need.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.880
And really, to make it complete,

02:54.880 --> 02:57.200
we know we gotta have a little bit of a production test.

02:57.200 --> 03:02.520
So we're gonna give out credentials live on the show to, I won't say who,

03:02.520 --> 03:04.680
I'm gonna reveal, but to a test user.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.400
Hint, hint, he's in the mumble room.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.440
And he's gonna try logging in for the first time and send an email and

03:09.440 --> 03:11.840
let us know if it works right here live.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.520
Then after all this is done, we're gonna kind of, just from time to time,

03:15.520 --> 03:17.840
follow up and do check-ins on the email server.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.400
It's not gonna be like a regular thing anymore,

03:19.400 --> 03:22.000
kind of like how we do the Arch server from time to time.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.920
But of course, we've got community news, we've got pics, we've got some feedback.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.440
So before I get into any of that,

03:27.440 --> 03:30.120
I'd like to say time appropriate greetings to that mumble room.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.760
Hello, virtual lug, lup-lup.

03:31.760 --> 03:32.440
Hello.

03:32.440 --> 03:32.960
Hello.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.480
Hello.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.000
Hello.

03:34.000 --> 03:34.520
Hello.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.520
Namaskaram.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.560
Hello, everybody.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.080
Boy, it's nice to have, look at that, 25 of you in there.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.720
Good to have you here today.

03:41.720 --> 03:45.480
So let's start with a little community news because one of those members in that

03:45.480 --> 03:50.400
virtual lug is Mr. Daniel Fore from the elementary OS project.

03:50.400 --> 03:54.200
And we have news of a beta for elementary OS 6.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.880
Dan's joining us to tell us a little bit about it.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.160
Hello, Dan, welcome back.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.520
Hey, how's it going?

03:58.520 --> 03:59.760
Oh, pretty good.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.160
Good to see a beta land.

04:01.160 --> 04:06.240
This is kind of an exciting milestone in the road towards elementary OS 6.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.240
So what are we expecting here?

04:08.240 --> 04:10.320
This doesn't look like it's a final product at this stage, but

04:10.320 --> 04:14.320
it's looking like it's getting pretty close to something you could use day to day.

04:14.320 --> 04:18.120
Yeah, I tell you what, it's been a rough year for obvious reasons, but

04:18.120 --> 04:20.360
I'm really excited to get this beta out.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.920
So what we're really looking at here is we're making this big transition over to

04:24.920 --> 04:27.600
a flat pack based app center, right?

04:27.600 --> 04:31.440
And we have all these great new APIs, both from upstream and

04:31.440 --> 04:33.160
from things we've been working on.

04:33.160 --> 04:36.320
And we're in a place right now where we want to really stabilize that developer

04:36.320 --> 04:40.520
experience and get people in and building their apps as flat packs with these new

04:40.520 --> 04:43.240
APIs and getting feedback about their experience so

04:43.240 --> 04:44.920
we can get ready to do the real thing.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.840
All right, so you mentioned the year.

04:46.840 --> 04:53.520
It's been 370-ish days since 2004 came out, which will be the base.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.560
And I'm wondering, what are your thoughts reflecting on that amount of time?

04:56.560 --> 05:00.280
Is it the project's goal to generally ship sooner than that?

05:00.280 --> 05:04.360
Or is it really just a matter of you ship when it's ready, and

05:04.360 --> 05:08.920
if it takes 370-ish days to get to a beta, that's acceptable and

05:08.920 --> 05:10.240
what the user should expect?

05:10.240 --> 05:12.240
Yeah, I mean, it's a little bit of this, a little bit of that.

05:12.240 --> 05:15.360
Like, obviously, it would have been nice to ship a lot sooner.

05:15.360 --> 05:22.200
We had planned a sprint early last year that we were supposed to be able to go and

05:22.200 --> 05:25.760
get all this flat pack app center stuff done at that time.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.360
And then the world blew up.

05:27.360 --> 05:32.680
So this is definitely a lot more delayed than we really wanted.

05:32.680 --> 05:39.240
But that is kind of the beauty of deciding to release when we're ready is we've

05:39.240 --> 05:42.400
never really had these big commitments to dates.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.840
And it was more like, this is the work that needs to get done.

05:44.840 --> 05:48.680
And as long as it takes to get the work done, that's the experience we want to ship.

05:48.680 --> 05:51.840
And you know what, I think the users appreciate that.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.040
So there is now ways, though, for people to get involved and

05:55.040 --> 05:58.480
help accelerate development and help make elementary OS 6 great.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.200
I saw you have information posted where you go through the beta,

06:02.200 --> 06:03.440
you show some of the new features.

06:03.440 --> 06:07.960
By the way, I really like that new, I think you guys call it accent colors

06:07.960 --> 06:10.560
feature that kind of just lets you spice up the UI a little bit.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.400
That looks really slick.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.200
How does that work, Dan?

06:14.200 --> 06:17.760
Does it highlight the default buttons in different colors that you choose?

06:17.760 --> 06:19.200
Is that essentially what it's doing?

06:19.200 --> 06:23.880
Yeah, so under the hood, what it actually is, is we're now shipping

06:23.880 --> 06:27.920
eight different variations of our style sheet that are kind of built at compile

06:27.920 --> 06:32.680
time, and they all use a different base accent color.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.440
So when you're getting things like the suggested action buttons, or

06:36.440 --> 06:40.400
selections in radios, or in menus, or lists, or things like that,

06:40.400 --> 06:44.840
anytime that you see, normally you just see a blue accent by default.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.680
But now you can kind of choose what your favorite color is, or

06:47.680 --> 06:51.800
we actually even just merged the ability to have it automatically select a color

06:51.800 --> 06:53.120
based on your wallpaper.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.680
There must be a performance benefit to you guys building those themes ahead of

06:56.680 --> 06:57.320
time.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.720
And then as a user, I select them, they're built and ready to go.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.160
That just seems great.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.600
Is that something that's normal, or

07:03.600 --> 07:06.320
is that something that elementary OS does differently?

07:06.320 --> 07:10.240
You know, I'm really not sure how other platforms are handling it.

07:10.240 --> 07:14.920
I think Deepin maybe has a color selection, and

07:14.920 --> 07:17.280
I think maybe another desktop environment.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.960
I'm really not sure about how other ones are working.

07:19.960 --> 07:23.720
But this is like the one we felt that would be the easiest to maintain and

07:23.720 --> 07:26.520
allow us to add as many colors as we want and

07:26.520 --> 07:30.760
make sure that when people go to switch them, they're switched and they're done.

07:30.760 --> 07:34.080
I just like to know these kinds of things because I think honestly one of the great

07:34.080 --> 07:39.400
things about the elementary OS experience is I love a lot of GTK applications.

07:39.400 --> 07:43.360
But in the past, I've run into issues with Gnome Shell itself.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.400
A lot of that's been fixed up, but elementary OS has always been there as

07:46.400 --> 07:49.840
an alternative that lets you play in that user space, kind of like Budgie does, but

07:49.840 --> 07:52.080
with some real nice choices you guys have made.

07:52.080 --> 07:57.240
So to that end, I'm curious just to get your high level thoughts on

07:57.240 --> 08:02.320
Gnome 40 adopting a horizontal layout that reminds me a lot of

08:02.320 --> 08:04.120
the way Pantheon does things.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.320
Yeah, I think it's really interesting.

08:06.320 --> 08:11.560
I think that a lot of people have this perception that developers from different

08:11.560 --> 08:15.320
desktop environments are in fierce competition and don't ever talk to each

08:15.320 --> 08:18.440
other or anything like that, but it's really not true at all.

08:18.440 --> 08:22.200
We were at the design sprint where they were working on the design for

08:22.200 --> 08:23.440
the new login and lock screen.

08:23.440 --> 08:27.880
And a lot of the discussions that we had with the Gnome design team actually

08:27.880 --> 08:29.920
informed the design for our stuff.

08:29.920 --> 08:34.520
So we're in contact with designers at Gnome and we go to Guadac and things like that.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.720
And so there's a lot of cross-pollination of ideas, and

08:36.720 --> 08:42.120
it doesn't totally surprise me that we would decide to do a lot of things very similarly.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.880
Right, and I gotta say, as an end user, the experience for

08:44.880 --> 08:48.360
me just means it's more consistent when I'm switching between desktop environments.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.360
It's just like one less thing for me to have to do a translation in my head.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.480
So it kind of works out for an end user, so I like it.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.000
Well, there's a lot in here, like stuff with App Center and flat packs, but

08:58.000 --> 09:00.800
I'm curious if there's any other areas that you'd just like to particularly touch on

09:00.800 --> 09:04.040
before we give people any more info on how to get involved.

09:04.040 --> 09:08.880
Yeah, I think the biggest ones here are just that we were trying to roll out that

09:08.880 --> 09:11.800
whole new look and feel with the new style sheet, and

09:11.800 --> 09:16.520
we really need feedback from app developers to make sure we didn't break our styles.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.600
So any kind of weird idiosyncrasies, we'd love to have reported there.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.040
I mean, we're really just in this stage of here's all the big stuff and

09:24.040 --> 09:25.160
tell us what we broke.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.360
Yeah, that new installer needs some hands on.

09:27.360 --> 09:31.160
That's probably a really easy way for people to give it a test.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.480
I like that you have this page, so

09:32.480 --> 09:34.760
I'm gonna recommend everybody that wants to help out, check it out.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.440
Elementary.io slash git dash involved.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.000
Every project should do this.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.800
The team just outlays a lot of ways you can just get involved,

09:43.800 --> 09:47.080
be it from funding to design to desktop and support.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.960
It's super clever, and it's really well done.

09:49.960 --> 09:50.880
Thanks a lot.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.240
Well, Dan, thank you.

09:52.240 --> 09:55.480
Thank you, and thank you guys for putting out all the good stuff.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.800
And I look forward to giving it a try.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.200
And then, of course, the release.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.960
When that does happen, you come back and chat with us about it.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.200
Yeah, absolutely.

10:04.200 --> 10:09.480
I think we're probably gonna kick off another beta, hopefully relatively shortly.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.920
We're getting a lot of great feedback and a lot of bug fixes in, so

10:11.920 --> 10:14.400
we really wanna keep that feedback loop churning.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.120
Thank you, sir.

10:15.120 --> 10:15.800
Thanks for updating us.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.440
Good to have you here.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.240
Thank you.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.560
Mr. Daniel Fore, everybody, from Elementary OS.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.360
We will have links to everything we just chatted about in the show notes,

10:22.360 --> 10:25.460
of course, so you can go right there.

10:25.460 --> 10:28.040
Now, a project that we just love on this show,

10:28.040 --> 10:31.680
we use it to help produce this here podcast, is Audacity.

10:31.680 --> 10:36.960
And you may have heard this week that Audacity has joined the Muse Group,

10:36.960 --> 10:40.520
which is a collection of brands that includes another popular open source

10:40.520 --> 10:44.520
music app called MuseScore, a lot of people are familiar with that.

10:44.520 --> 10:49.840
And I think that the Muse Group is, I don't know a lot about it yet, but

10:49.840 --> 10:53.320
we've invited several people involved onto the show to come tell us about it.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.280
And I did reach out to the Audacity development team,

10:56.280 --> 10:58.960
well, at least a couple of the developers.

10:58.960 --> 11:02.720
And they don't have a lot to add to this story at this moment.

11:02.720 --> 11:07.360
But the way it seems to be coming through is that MuseScore will be involved with

11:07.360 --> 11:10.400
the management and day-to-day operation of Audacity,

11:10.400 --> 11:12.840
much like how sometimes a foundation will.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.960
And then there will be a team of developers that will remain that have been

11:15.960 --> 11:19.160
there for a while that will continue to develop under that umbrella now.

11:19.160 --> 11:23.280
I essentially believe what's happened here is the equivalent of copyrights and

11:23.280 --> 11:27.520
trademarks have been purchased and acquired and transferred to Muse Group.

11:27.520 --> 11:32.520
And one of the key goals, it sounds like from the outset here,

11:32.520 --> 11:37.160
is to improve the UI of Audacity, it's kind of job number one right now.

11:37.160 --> 11:42.600
Which, Wes, it's like the developer that I spoke with literally said to me,

11:42.600 --> 11:45.160
I'm also both scared and excited.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.360
Yeah, I think that's right.

11:46.360 --> 11:50.160
I mean, it's really been a long journey for Audacity.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.960
It began development way back in 1999, yeah, that's right,

11:53.960 --> 11:59.240
last millennium at Carnegie Mellon University and has come a long way since there.

11:59.240 --> 12:04.920
I mean, they just recently shipped version 3.0, which added a lot of stuff already.

12:04.920 --> 12:08.520
It's not really clear exactly all what's going on here.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.360
Muse Group itself was formed, just like the company,

12:11.360 --> 12:15.320
was formed a few days prior to the Audacity announcement.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.640
Although obviously MuseScore and

12:16.640 --> 12:20.960
some of the other stuff involved had been going on a lot longer than that.

12:20.960 --> 12:24.360
We don't know a lot about the financials or the exact structure, but

12:24.360 --> 12:28.960
if how this works out is they've got a new steward who wants to help support

12:28.960 --> 12:33.800
the development of this free and open source audio tool, I think I support that.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.920
And because it is open source, I mean, if they ruin it, at least we can fork it.

12:37.920 --> 12:41.040
That's true, and I'm not particularly familiar with MuseScore, but

12:41.040 --> 12:44.440
from just kind of doing some research for this story, it seems to be really well

12:44.440 --> 12:48.360
liked, it seems like people are very much a fan of that software and

12:48.360 --> 12:51.920
have a lot of goodwill towards this acquisition because of how they have

12:51.920 --> 12:56.760
managed MuseScore, hopefully that's a good sign.

12:56.760 --> 13:01.240
This is one of those stories that does actually kind of terrify me just a little

13:01.240 --> 13:03.480
bit because it is a tool that is so precious to so

13:03.480 --> 13:07.400
many of us in any kind of media production on Linux.

13:07.400 --> 13:11.000
Media production, I mean, it's used a bunch in academic research.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.600
It's just sort of, like it happens with the best open source tools,

13:14.600 --> 13:17.560
it just becomes sort of part of the landscape because it doesn't cost anything.

13:17.560 --> 13:20.040
You can always count on it, it's always there for you, and

13:20.040 --> 13:21.640
it would be a shame for that to change.

13:21.640 --> 13:27.800
Yeah, I will continue to leave our doors open to anyone

13:27.800 --> 13:31.120
involved that would like to come chat with us, I've sent out a couple invitations.

13:31.120 --> 13:35.320
And maybe we'll do a follow up next week, kind of a head scratcher.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.800
And one thing that was a little strange to me is that the announcement

13:39.800 --> 13:47.800
started on YouTube in a YouTube video by the design lead from the Muse group.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.200
Who's a well known individual, and so maybe that makes sense.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.520
But it wasn't like a press release from the Audacity project or

13:54.520 --> 13:56.720
like the Muse group website, if there is one.

13:56.720 --> 14:00.520
And that video, I mean, it had a lot to like in the video, definitely, but

14:00.520 --> 14:04.360
it was aimed at the existing audience, his audience on YouTube.

14:04.360 --> 14:07.520
And so it's sort of like, hey, I'm in charge of Audacity now, isn't that?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.480
Here's what I'm thinking, which is great.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.800
But yeah, there hasn't been a lot of communication geared to the wider

14:12.800 --> 14:15.720
open source community or users who aren't familiar with Muse group but

14:15.720 --> 14:17.240
are familiar with Audacity.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.920
Put very well, and we will have a link in the show notes.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.360
There is now a post on the Audacity website,

14:22.360 --> 14:24.200
which we will also link in the show notes.

14:24.200 --> 14:29.760
But quite literally, all it does is it quotes the YouTube video.

14:29.760 --> 14:34.560
They just put a block quote of essentially a transcript from the YouTube video.

14:34.560 --> 14:40.120
And then the only thing they add to it is that we're scared and excited, and

14:40.120 --> 14:40.920
they hope we are too.

14:41.960 --> 14:46.600
That's the entirety of the statement from the Audacity project.

14:46.600 --> 14:50.920
And I think it's one of those situations where things are still getting dialed in.

14:50.920 --> 14:55.360
And whenever you have a deal like this, it involves copyright and

14:55.360 --> 14:57.560
intellectual property and money.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.680
That there's just certain things that people can't say right now.

15:00.680 --> 15:05.720
And so this news has kind of come out before maybe everything is fully formed

15:05.720 --> 15:09.120
based on my read of my conversation and this post.

15:09.120 --> 15:12.360
It's like they just can't say everything fully yet.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.600
But the headlines are getting written fast, so

15:14.600 --> 15:15.760
that's why I wanted to contact them.

15:15.760 --> 15:19.960
Because the headlines clearly say the Muse group now owns Audacity and

15:19.960 --> 15:24.560
is in control of it and will be quote unquote partnering with the open source

15:24.560 --> 15:26.840
developers, which is just not very clear.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.680
It doesn't really say who is quite in charge then.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.960
Because you can't make an open source community do anything.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.840
It's like you can't, you can't herd cats.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.440
It's like you can have goals and you can have outlines.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.320
If you get everybody on board, they'll go for it.

15:41.320 --> 15:45.120
But if you just come at them from on high with a mandate,

15:45.120 --> 15:46.160
not all of them are gonna do anything.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.920
They're not gonna jump necessarily.

15:47.920 --> 15:48.840
Right.

15:48.840 --> 15:52.520
How many resources will be expended by the project in terms of development time?

15:52.520 --> 15:54.360
How much of that will be sort of shepherding and

15:54.360 --> 16:00.200
helping out existing development, volunteer resources, or paid resources?

16:00.200 --> 16:00.800
We don't know.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.760
I guess we'll just have to pay some close attention to the repo and

16:03.760 --> 16:04.360
see what happens.

16:04.360 --> 16:08.520
Linode.com slash unplugged.

16:08.520 --> 16:13.640
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit, yep, $100 towards a new account.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.320
And go there to really support the show too.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.920
Let us know you heard about it here.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.400
Linode is our cloud hosting provider.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.560
It's what we've built our new email server on.

16:21.560 --> 16:22.600
It's Linode, of course.

16:22.600 --> 16:26.360
It's what we do our back end processing, and hosting, and our automation system,

16:26.360 --> 16:30.000
and next cloud, and object storage for config backups.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.600
It's how we do a lot of the things that make it possible for

16:33.600 --> 16:38.200
a small team to operate at the scale that we operate at.

16:38.200 --> 16:41.000
That's why Linode is essentially like part of our team.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.240
Because they're a fundamental aspect of how we get production done.

16:44.240 --> 16:50.120
And unlike the big clouds, unlike big cloud, like AWS and

16:50.120 --> 16:56.480
the Googs and Azure, Linode gives you access to tools they would never dream of.

16:56.480 --> 17:01.240
And man, oh man, is Linode's UI infinitely simpler and

17:01.240 --> 17:02.720
much more straightforward.

17:02.720 --> 17:07.400
And yet somehow, you'll be amazed at the speed, performance, and

17:07.400 --> 17:10.120
complexity of things you could actually build if you wanted to.

17:10.120 --> 17:12.200
And you get 11 data centers to choose from.

17:12.200 --> 17:16.240
Every service level is backed by the best customer support in the business.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.280
And that matters, that really matters.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.440
Instead of just being a number,

17:20.440 --> 17:22.680
you're gonna talk to an individual by phone or ticket.

17:22.680 --> 17:26.200
And it's gonna make all the difference when you're in a tough spot.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.480
And it's not just like that one great thing about Linode.

17:29.480 --> 17:33.280
It's like all the things about Linode that make them our go-to choice for

17:33.280 --> 17:34.920
anything we're building.

17:34.920 --> 17:41.120
It's not even really a debate, because when you become kind of a Linode connoisseur,

17:41.120 --> 17:43.480
there's just things you can't do on the other providers.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.240
And they really, truly love Linux.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.080
I mean, you can see it in the projects they support and

17:47.080 --> 17:49.040
the conferences that they've supported.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.080
But when they are building anything,

17:51.080 --> 17:54.720
they start from a perspective of how can we make Linux do this for us?

17:54.720 --> 17:56.720
Even if it doesn't fully do it yet.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.800
I've shared the story before about when they became their own ISP.

17:59.800 --> 18:04.240
And back then when they did that, it was ridiculous to be using Linux

18:04.240 --> 18:07.800
at the layer that they were planning to use, at the networking layer.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.160
And now it's become an entire industry.

18:10.160 --> 18:13.040
Because they see this stuff like we do.

18:13.040 --> 18:16.760
Like we're sitting here shucking and jiving about pipe wire.

18:16.760 --> 18:20.080
Back in 2018, well, it's shipping in 2021.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.600
Because we're passionate about this stuff.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.560
We follow it for a long time, just like Linode does.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.760
And that's what I love about them.

18:25.760 --> 18:29.600
Because if you're a long time Linux user, that stuff shines through the product.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.160
I think it's really great.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.040
So go see what you can do with Linode.

18:33.040 --> 18:36.040
Go put that $100 to work for you and see what I've been talking about it.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.400
linode.com slash unplugged.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.040
Build something or maybe even learn something.

18:41.040 --> 18:44.760
There's a lot of great places to host, I'll admit.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.040
But nobody does it like Linode.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.800
Go see why we choose Linode every single time.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.840
linode.com slash unplugged.

18:51.840 --> 18:59.280
You know, Mr. Payne, we have a really major, major housekeeping today.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.760
I normally say we just have a spot of housekeeping.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.920
But I enthusiastically embraced the housekeeping this week.

19:07.240 --> 19:10.120
Well, we woke up and it was a mess in here.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.800
Clearly, we didn't clean up after ourselves last week.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.440
Oh, it wasn't you and me.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.800
It was Minimac and that rowdy Luplug.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.960
They had a hell of a get together this Sunday.

19:18.960 --> 19:22.760
Minimac, do you want to give us a little update on how the Mycroft get together went?

19:22.760 --> 19:24.120
Well, it went really well.

19:24.120 --> 19:27.040
We had an excellent pre-talk.

19:27.040 --> 19:32.920
And I want to thank all the members of the Mycroft community that found the time for

19:32.920 --> 19:34.960
a really Luplug session.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.200
And most of them will be present next week, too.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.560
Yeah, that's the main show, right?

19:38.560 --> 19:39.880
That's the big event.

19:39.880 --> 19:40.880
Indeed.

19:40.880 --> 19:45.320
So in the pre-talk, we tried to nail down the structure of the talk that actually takes

19:45.320 --> 19:46.680
place next week.

19:46.680 --> 19:51.360
But we already had some inside information and everything was really cool.

19:51.360 --> 19:55.560
And we played around with our Mycroft bot we have now in the Mumble channel.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.960
And that one will be available, I guess, for the whole week.

19:58.960 --> 20:02.880
So if you want to test that one, you can whenever you want.

20:02.880 --> 20:08.840
Please be aware that it can be a little bit tricky with the wake word, with the HeyMycroft

20:08.840 --> 20:09.840
word.

20:09.840 --> 20:13.600
And maybe you have to adjust your microphone settings a little bit.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.880
I have some excellent news.

20:15.880 --> 20:20.320
Chris Gessling, you know, the guy from Down Under, the community manager.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.120
He has announced his presence, too, for the talk.

20:23.120 --> 20:26.360
So I guess we're going to have to beam him some coffee.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.960
That is great.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.040
So it will be an excellent talk.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.240
And I really hope that you find the time to join us.

20:34.240 --> 20:38.240
I will put a reminder on all the JB social media channels.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.760
All I can say is see you next Sunday.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.720
It's really neat to see the Mycroft team engaging.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.880
There's people that showed up just for the pre-talk this Sunday.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.680
So you know it's going to be a great turnout this Sunday.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.200
And yeah, you heard him right.

20:50.200 --> 20:54.280
They now have a Mycroft bot in the Mumble room that you can speak to via Mumble.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.280
It's so cool.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.280
It's so cool.

20:56.280 --> 20:57.280
Yeah.

20:57.280 --> 20:58.760
So check it out this Sunday.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.820
Also, I want to put a call out there for your questions.

21:01.820 --> 21:05.640
We want to do a Q&A episode coming up later this month because I'm going to be doing some

21:05.640 --> 21:06.640
traveling.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.760
I'm going to just take that opportunity to just answer questions.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.560
We haven't done that ever on the show.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.560
So ask us anything.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.440
We'll answer as many as we can.

21:14.440 --> 21:20.640
Go to linuxunplug.com contact for the Q&A episode coming up real soon.

21:20.640 --> 21:27.560
And also I'll mention we have a couple very limited retro last items in the garage right

21:27.560 --> 21:30.400
now, including the very last few coins.

21:30.400 --> 21:35.480
We still have some swag bags that honestly the swag bags are super popular.

21:35.480 --> 21:38.120
Those are up right now at Jupiter garage.com.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.760
It's the very last of the last coins.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.880
So grab one if you would like them.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.400
What's this tech talk today portable speaker?

21:45.400 --> 21:46.400
I see.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.160
That seems like the perfect way to listen to a Linux unplugged.

21:49.160 --> 21:52.900
If you happen to have a device that still has a headphone jack, it's just a little,

21:52.900 --> 21:54.520
it just runs right off the headphone jack.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.520
I might have a battery in there.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.520
I can't remember.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.520
It works though.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.520
I just plugged it in.

21:58.520 --> 21:59.520
Yeah.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.960
If you were a tech talk today fan, I looked at that little speaker and I thought, you

22:01.960 --> 22:03.480
know, I kind of miss doing that show.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.340
I don't need to do any more shows.

22:05.340 --> 22:08.300
I really don't need to do any more shows, but I kind of miss it.

22:08.300 --> 22:13.080
So that's all at Jupiter garage.com.

22:13.080 --> 22:16.460
So this is the finale of our email series.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.400
We today finally we'll finish it all up.

22:19.400 --> 22:23.720
We've been building our own self hosted email server in 2021.

22:23.720 --> 22:24.920
Yeah, I know.

22:24.920 --> 22:29.040
I know we're doing it because everybody says you should never host your own email server.

22:29.040 --> 22:32.240
So we're going to do it so you don't have to spite email server.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.800
It's definitely the best possible reason.

22:34.800 --> 22:39.800
It is totally a spied email, you know, and we have two important tasks to complete today.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.360
We must deploy the web mail.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.920
And of course, we must get our first production user online.

22:44.920 --> 22:50.680
But I have to first acknowledge that we have gotten a lot of feedback about this topic.

22:50.680 --> 22:51.940
Wow.

22:51.940 --> 22:53.880
We weren't even sure if you guys would love this idea or not.

22:53.880 --> 22:59.960
But it turns out a lot of you crazy bastards out there are also hosting your own email.

22:59.960 --> 23:04.260
But additionally, a lot of people are thinking about it for some reason.

23:04.260 --> 23:07.740
Maybe it's Google fatigue, or it's probably a dozen reasons.

23:07.740 --> 23:10.520
But this is this has been remarkable.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.480
I spent oh, I don't know.

23:13.480 --> 23:20.020
Three hours yesterday, just reading email about self hosted email hosting.

23:20.020 --> 23:26.120
So I kept sending West messages like I'm I've made it back to this date.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.400
I've made it this far.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.880
I was given like real time messages.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.560
It was a mountain of feedback.

23:31.560 --> 23:32.560
Yeah, wow.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.560
I did not expect that.

23:33.560 --> 23:34.640
I mean, a few sure.

23:34.640 --> 23:37.840
But apparently email is a spicy topic.

23:37.840 --> 23:38.840
Yeah.

23:38.840 --> 23:41.360
And Hank wrote in with a with a pretty good question that I think we should cover on the

23:41.360 --> 23:42.360
show.

23:42.360 --> 23:43.360
So I wanted to respond to this one on air.

23:43.360 --> 23:47.000
He says, What's your plan to keep your email servers secure?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.920
You tout the fact that your update woes are minimized.

23:49.920 --> 23:54.760
I think you've just shifted the need to update the OS though to needing to update the containers.

23:54.760 --> 23:59.000
In this regard, I just prefer to keep things within the packaging system on Debian and

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
its derivatives.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.440
I install unattended upgrades package which defaults to install security updates daily.

24:04.440 --> 24:07.720
Security updates are tested and very unlikely to break anything.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.960
I suppose the same is true for a containerized email server.

24:10.960 --> 24:14.560
But I'm unaware of any automated security updates.

24:14.560 --> 24:18.960
By the way, unattended upgrades is a good little pro tip on you Debian users out there

24:18.960 --> 24:20.660
and derivatives.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.360
If that's something you might be able to get away with on your box.

24:23.360 --> 24:27.680
But he makes a good point West because I think we kind of maybe tried to connect security

24:27.680 --> 24:29.880
with containerized application.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.200
And that is something we should never do on this show.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.200
Yeah, right.

24:33.200 --> 24:37.760
I mean, of course, you still need to do updates if there's a vulnerability or a bug that needs

24:37.760 --> 24:38.760
attention.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.680
Well, you got to get those somehow.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.440
Containers do give us some nice tools for sort of separating those concerns.

24:45.440 --> 24:49.280
It allows us to sort of choose when we want our updates in our containers versus on our

24:49.280 --> 24:50.280
host system.

24:50.280 --> 24:54.840
And so if we did want, you know, automated updates on the host system, we certainly could,

24:54.840 --> 24:58.840
although we still need to attend to what's going on in the container.

24:58.840 --> 25:03.920
What's nice about having this all in Docker and open source is we have access to everything.

25:03.920 --> 25:08.260
So if we want to rebuild things, if we want to make tweaks, we have that functionality.

25:08.260 --> 25:12.520
And we try to choose projects that have regular updates to the end releases to their images

25:12.520 --> 25:13.520
anyway.

25:13.520 --> 25:16.200
Beyond that, there are some nice tools around there as well.

25:16.200 --> 25:20.200
If you do want to set up something like an automatic update, but you will have to do

25:20.200 --> 25:21.200
that yourself.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.200
True.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.880
Real time update from Neil in the chat room.

25:23.880 --> 25:31.240
He says that if you're on Fedora, a DNF-Automatic will achieve the same result as unattended

25:31.240 --> 25:32.240
dash upgrades.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.240
Nice tip.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.240
Yeah.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.240
Thanks, Neil.

25:35.240 --> 25:40.000
Yeah, I think the message I was trying to make last episode is that when I looked at

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
say Mail-in-a-Box, which I still think is an awesome project, and if you're good with

25:43.000 --> 25:46.600
the traditional way of deploying software where it just uses packages and it just kind

25:46.600 --> 25:49.840
of goes all over your system, that's a great option.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.040
I was surprised by my reaction, guys.

25:52.040 --> 25:55.800
And I think the thing I want you to take away is when I used Mail-in-a-Box and I watched

25:55.800 --> 26:00.480
that install script run, instead of having this sensation of, oh, man, it's so great,

26:00.480 --> 26:06.800
this is just taking care of everything for me, I had this sinking concern that I had

26:06.800 --> 26:09.980
no idea what was really happening to my system.

26:09.980 --> 26:17.000
And I just watched package after package after config file after config file get written

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
to the hard drive.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.800
And I started thinking, this is fundamentally altering this box in a way that I don't know

26:21.800 --> 26:26.740
if I'm going to feel confident in just upgrading when there's a new update that comes out.

26:26.740 --> 26:30.940
It also gets more complicated when, you know, like we were doing for today's show, start

26:30.940 --> 26:35.040
hacking in things like web mail, and suddenly you've got multiple conflicting things installed.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.040
And maybe you don't do that.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.180
Maybe you've got, you know, a VPS or a VM for everything.

26:38.180 --> 26:41.840
But I think it's pretty common to just sort of add those things on when it's convenient.

26:41.840 --> 26:45.800
And then you've got mixed requirements that maybe one update needs an update, but that

26:45.800 --> 26:47.440
might break another part of the system.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.560
I mean, there's several advantages, right, Byte?

26:49.560 --> 26:55.000
Yeah, so when you restart a system because of an update, usually you get a message like

26:55.000 --> 27:00.800
a restart is necessary, then your entire system is down for a long time.

27:00.800 --> 27:05.760
But if you use containers, a container is usually really fastly rebooted.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.880
And if it's only by the service itself, yeah, it's really fast.

27:09.880 --> 27:14.280
Yeah, I think that when you look at running your core applications that you want to run

27:14.280 --> 27:21.260
for, you know, five years minimum, and you want to maybe even survive an entire OS upgrade,

27:21.260 --> 27:25.500
having that isolation is such a killer feature for me.

27:25.500 --> 27:32.000
Other things like snapshots, or easily quickly rebooting, or switching to a different image

27:32.000 --> 27:34.760
or something like those, there's a lot of nice advantages.

27:34.760 --> 27:35.760
Migrating to a new host server.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.760
Right, oh my gosh, yes.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.640
That's been very handy for us.

27:38.640 --> 27:45.160
We did a migration from DigitalOcean to Linode, and it was absolutely much simpler by having

27:45.160 --> 27:48.680
a lot of our applications, nearly all of our applications containerized.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.680
It made it just significantly simpler.

27:50.680 --> 27:55.840
And so mobility and maintainability of the host OS are paramount for me.

27:55.840 --> 28:00.440
And then there was other benefits, like instead of going with Ubuntu 18.04, I could now deploy

28:00.440 --> 28:04.720
CentOS Stream 8, which is something I've wanted to test in production so I could just talk

28:04.720 --> 28:05.720
about on the show anyways.

28:05.720 --> 28:10.120
I mean, Hank does have a good point though, right, that you don't get the security for

28:10.120 --> 28:14.320
free, and it's still definitely something you have to manage, and that may influence

28:14.320 --> 28:15.920
how you want to run your software.

28:15.920 --> 28:19.440
So Neil, I'm curious what your thoughts are, because I know one of the things that's

28:19.440 --> 28:23.360
drive you crazy in the past is when people equate running applications in a container

28:23.360 --> 28:27.520
to being secure, but there's probably still some use cases here that you probably agree

28:27.520 --> 28:28.520
with.

28:28.520 --> 28:32.560
Yeah, so like for me, it isn't necessarily about security to choose to use containers

28:32.560 --> 28:37.080
over something else, although security can be beneficial.

28:37.080 --> 28:41.360
The main aspects I wind up using it for is I actually kind of use it a little differently

28:41.360 --> 28:42.360
than most people.

28:42.360 --> 28:46.200
I use it mainly to replace virtual machines.

28:46.200 --> 28:50.680
So unlike a lot of folks, I actually have an init.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.880
I have systemd init running in my containers.

28:53.880 --> 28:59.080
I'm using systemd nspawn instead of Podman for some of my stuff, because a lot of my

28:59.080 --> 29:04.380
stuff are multi-service stuff, and it's just not worth it for me to do the extreme splitting

29:04.380 --> 29:07.380
required to do it in something like Podman or whatnot.

29:07.380 --> 29:12.080
So I run them as nspawn containers, which means they boot up like they would VMs.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.200
And because I'm using Butterfests in my file system, they're snapshot and I can actually

29:15.200 --> 29:18.320
do Butterfests and receive to transfer them everywhere.

29:18.320 --> 29:23.520
And I also, because of Butterfest's coolness, I actually just layer them on top of the host

29:23.520 --> 29:25.760
operating system root file system.

29:25.760 --> 29:32.120
So I take the host operating system, make a snapshot, use that as the base to instantiate

29:32.120 --> 29:35.020
a container and do clever rebase things.

29:35.020 --> 29:39.180
So for me, what the advantage of containers is, these different things are still running

29:39.180 --> 29:43.580
on the same system I would normally run it on, like if they were all in one box, but

29:43.580 --> 29:47.700
I have the ability to orchestrate them independently.

29:47.700 --> 29:51.320
If they need to have conflicting requirements, they're easily handled.

29:51.320 --> 29:58.460
Like if I have to have CentOS for an environment and use different module streams, like being

29:58.460 --> 30:03.160
able to use the different application stream from RHEL or modules from CentOS and activate

30:03.160 --> 30:06.400
them for the language stacks and whatnot, I can still use packaging.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.720
I can still use all the tools that I'm familiar with.

30:08.720 --> 30:13.460
I can still manage it with config management or Ansible or whatever I'd like.

30:13.460 --> 30:17.460
But because most of my applications don't need a different kernel and don't need emulated

30:17.460 --> 30:22.860
hardware for all of them, I can drastically simplify the maintenance and management of

30:22.860 --> 30:23.860
my systems.

30:23.860 --> 30:29.160
And the big win for me there is when I sometimes get trapped into running an application that

30:29.160 --> 30:34.240
can't necessarily upgrade right away, the operating system can move forward and most

30:34.240 --> 30:38.520
of my things can move forward and that one thing can stay back a little bit until either

30:38.520 --> 30:42.760
I figure out a way to upgrade it or I replace it with something else.

30:42.760 --> 30:44.500
I don't use it as a way to hold back.

30:44.500 --> 30:51.160
I use it as a way to be more strategic about how I spend my time managing my infrastructure.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.160
Well put.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.160
And two thoughts.

30:53.160 --> 30:57.200
First thought is, and this is why, why we covered all this is a huge part of security

30:57.200 --> 31:01.580
is staying current, especially with software that has open ports to the internet.

31:01.580 --> 31:05.720
We've locked ours down and can because we have mail route in front of it, but we could

31:05.720 --> 31:06.720
lock it down further, obviously.

31:06.720 --> 31:12.320
I mean, there's all options we have there, but some software like SSH and web servers,

31:12.320 --> 31:14.440
they're always going to be exposed directly to the internet.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.480
So keeping them current is a huge, huge part of security.

31:17.480 --> 31:20.780
But if you, if you listen to what Neil said in there too, is you'll also essentially hear

31:20.780 --> 31:27.000
the reason why developers that want a modern workstation need a more modern file system

31:27.000 --> 31:28.540
than extended for.

31:28.540 --> 31:35.060
He just clearly laid out how he can use ButterFS as part of his development workflow to give

31:35.060 --> 31:39.640
him different environments that are safe and disposable and do it in a very clever way.

31:39.640 --> 31:43.120
And that's why you need something beyond what just extended for can do.

31:43.120 --> 31:48.260
Even if you or I maybe only use it for compression or something like that, he or other developers

31:48.260 --> 31:53.600
like him can use it for a lot of crazy features, including just making their day to day job

31:53.600 --> 31:54.600
simpler.

31:54.600 --> 31:59.140
And that's why it's important that we ship really competitive file systems with desktop

31:59.140 --> 32:01.960
Linux distributions that want to be used as a workstation.

32:01.960 --> 32:05.620
Just my little side note, and thankfully most Linux distributions will let you format any

32:05.620 --> 32:08.000
disk and just about any file system you want.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.720
All right, so we had to decide essentially between two webmail packages as we saw it.

32:13.720 --> 32:14.980
There's a lot out there.

32:14.980 --> 32:20.500
And one of the kind of nice things about doing it in these three part stages that we've done

32:20.500 --> 32:25.160
here on the show is in between the audience has had time to give us a lot of good ideas.

32:25.160 --> 32:29.260
And we definitely got two suggestions the most via all the different mechanisms people

32:29.260 --> 32:30.260
get a hold of us.

32:30.260 --> 32:32.660
And that was RainLoop and RoundCube.

32:32.660 --> 32:36.160
And I was a little hesitant to RoundCube just because I had used it before and kind of wanted

32:36.160 --> 32:38.840
to try something new.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.280
So we first took a look at RainLoop.

32:40.280 --> 32:45.340
Yeah, you know, we heard a lot of good stuff about RainLoop and I'd never used it either.

32:45.340 --> 32:47.740
So I was pretty curious where I think I'd used RoundCube.

32:47.740 --> 32:51.480
I didn't run it myself, but it was used by someone else that was hosting email for me

32:51.480 --> 32:53.740
and that had been fine.

32:53.740 --> 32:57.520
But it's funny, we were just talking about, you know, how containers are kind of an integral

32:57.520 --> 32:59.660
part of this setup.

32:59.660 --> 33:04.320
And that's where things, at first we were hopeful, but kind of fell down in our trials

33:04.320 --> 33:06.560
with RainLoop.

33:06.560 --> 33:10.340
There is a Docker Compose and some Docker setup in their repository, but they don't

33:10.340 --> 33:15.220
have a lot of docs around it, at least that I could find in my cursory survey.

33:15.220 --> 33:17.800
And it just didn't seem as set up for that.

33:17.800 --> 33:22.280
The docs on their main site really were geared around more of a legacy installation setup

33:22.280 --> 33:26.640
where you've already got like web server infrastructure running and you kind of just bootstrap this

33:26.640 --> 33:29.680
PHP app onto there.

33:29.680 --> 33:35.320
By comparison, RoundCube has a lot of nice docs there, their site seems really well developed.

33:35.320 --> 33:39.180
Seems like they've got a community around them and they've got this whole plethora of

33:39.180 --> 33:44.740
Docker Compose support, multiple Docker Compose files and very explicit examples of sort of

33:44.740 --> 33:45.740
like, well, here's three different options.

33:45.740 --> 33:49.820
If you want to go the Apache route or the NGINX FPM route and here's an option with

33:49.820 --> 33:52.200
Postgres or here's an option with MySQL.

33:52.200 --> 33:56.860
So it just felt like here's a project that's embracing this as an option for running the

33:56.860 --> 33:58.120
software that they make.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.420
And that was a pretty big signal.

34:00.420 --> 34:05.240
And simplicity in setup is also appealing here because it's not going to be our primary

34:05.240 --> 34:07.000
job to admin this.

34:07.000 --> 34:12.320
And it's kind of a jackass move even to put a mail server in production and then give

34:12.320 --> 34:13.840
it the amount of attention that we're going to give it.

34:13.840 --> 34:18.800
So we want to build it in a way that when future Wes and Chris come back to this thing,

34:18.800 --> 34:22.880
we know how to fix it or how we built it or how we could even rebuild it.

34:22.880 --> 34:27.720
And when we looked at RainLoop versus RoundCube, it honestly kind of just came down to RoundCube

34:27.720 --> 34:32.400
was a little simpler, had a little bit clearer documentation and just was a little bit easier

34:32.400 --> 34:35.240
for us to snap into the old configuration and setup that we had.

34:35.240 --> 34:39.680
Now, I still would like to do some some playing with RainLoop and there might be some things

34:39.680 --> 34:43.440
I've missed or if the audience has a as a compose file handy that they want to share

34:43.440 --> 34:44.440
with us, that'd be great, too.

34:44.440 --> 34:45.440
I would totally try it.

34:45.440 --> 34:47.280
And I think it's still something I want to try.

34:47.280 --> 34:51.500
It was just to get this, you know, accomplish our tasks, start playing with web mail, see

34:51.500 --> 34:56.720
how to integrate RoundCube was really the simpler and easier option.

34:56.720 --> 34:59.720
And I mean, it is pretty neat, like it's not a bad experience.

34:59.720 --> 35:00.860
We'll get more into that.

35:00.860 --> 35:04.560
And they've been around for 13 years, like since 2008.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.640
That's also pretty impressive.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.840
And it seems actively developed today.

35:07.840 --> 35:13.480
A former past version of Chris definitely deployed RoundCube and liked it back then.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.360
But you know, we could sit here and tell you about it.

35:15.360 --> 35:19.240
But maybe we should put it to the test.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.440
All right, Mini Mac, get your telegram ready.

35:22.440 --> 35:23.440
This is it.

35:23.440 --> 35:24.560
I am ready.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.040
So Mini Mac will be our first production user.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.920
We want this to be a tool for members of our community.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.760
And we thought let's put it to the test right here.

35:31.760 --> 35:37.840
So I just sent you on telegram the URL for the web mail, your credentials.

35:37.840 --> 35:42.280
If you could log in, first of all, tell us if it works, if it loads for you and if you

35:42.280 --> 35:43.280
can send off an email.

35:43.280 --> 35:47.560
Now, you should use your full email as the sort of username.

35:47.560 --> 35:48.560
Login.

35:48.560 --> 35:49.560
Yeah.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.560
What do you think, Wes?

35:50.560 --> 35:51.560
Are you nervous?

35:51.560 --> 35:52.560
Fingers crossed.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.560
I should be looking at the logs, shouldn't I?

35:53.560 --> 35:57.240
I'm a little nervous, actually, because, you know, we really did not test this beforehand.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.920
I mean, we tested it, but it's a whole different ballgame.

35:59.920 --> 36:00.920
Okay.

36:00.920 --> 36:01.920
First success.

36:01.920 --> 36:02.920
I mean.

36:02.920 --> 36:03.920
Good.

36:03.920 --> 36:04.920
Good.

36:04.920 --> 36:05.920
Good.

36:05.920 --> 36:06.920
That's a good sign.

36:06.920 --> 36:07.920
Okay.

36:07.920 --> 36:11.720
Now, do you want to send me an address where I should my first famous first words sent

36:11.720 --> 36:12.720
to?

36:12.720 --> 36:13.720
Oh, yeah.

36:13.720 --> 36:14.720
Email me.

36:14.720 --> 36:15.720
Chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

36:15.720 --> 36:16.720
He gets a lot of email.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.720
He probably won't reply.

36:17.720 --> 36:18.720
Don't be offended.

36:18.720 --> 36:22.960
Wes suggested that I should send you a welcome email, but I wanted you to send the first

36:22.960 --> 36:24.160
email.

36:24.160 --> 36:28.400
I think this is a good test because Gmail is really picky about who it actually accepts

36:28.400 --> 36:29.800
email from.

36:29.800 --> 36:34.440
So if it's going to reject your email, it's going to be Gmail.

36:34.440 --> 36:35.560
My heart rate is pounding, actually.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.560
My heart is going.

36:36.560 --> 36:41.760
I suppose the question is, does Minimax sound like a scammer in his event?

36:41.760 --> 36:46.160
He does have some products to sell you, but that's just, you know, that's that's a coincidence.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.160
Okay.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.160
Email is out.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.160
Oh, boy.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.160
Let's verify and sent.

36:51.160 --> 36:52.160
Yeah.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.880
Okay, I don't see it yet.

36:54.880 --> 36:55.880
Come on.

36:55.880 --> 36:56.880
Wes, you see?

36:56.880 --> 36:57.880
Dad, you have the logs up?

36:57.880 --> 36:58.880
Oh, no.

36:58.880 --> 36:59.880
Here, let me check.

36:59.880 --> 37:00.880
Wait.

37:00.880 --> 37:01.880
Hold on a second.

37:01.880 --> 37:02.880
Hold on a second.

37:02.880 --> 37:03.880
Oh, there it is.

37:03.880 --> 37:04.880
What?

37:04.880 --> 37:05.880
Yeah, you got it.

37:05.880 --> 37:06.880
It works.

37:06.880 --> 37:07.880
Congratulations, Wes.

37:07.880 --> 37:08.880
Yeah.

37:08.880 --> 37:09.880
We got it.

37:09.880 --> 37:10.880
See titles, famous first words.

37:10.880 --> 37:11.880
All right.

37:11.880 --> 37:12.880
I'm going to write back.

37:12.880 --> 37:13.880
Yeah, I'm going to write back.

37:13.880 --> 37:14.880
Just very simply.

37:14.880 --> 37:15.880
It worked.

37:15.880 --> 37:16.880
And I'm going to tell me if you got that.

37:16.880 --> 37:17.880
I mean, I'm very happy.

37:17.880 --> 37:19.680
I suppose we should check it round round trip.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.840
But did you get the reply?

37:21.840 --> 37:22.840
Not yet.

37:22.840 --> 37:23.840
Oh, my God.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.240
I hate email.

37:26.240 --> 37:30.080
Just the other week, you were talking about how it's a cool federated system.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.560
And now, here you are.

37:31.560 --> 37:32.560
I know.

37:32.560 --> 37:33.560
It should see it.

37:33.560 --> 37:34.560
It should come right in.

37:34.560 --> 37:35.560
Success.

37:35.560 --> 37:39.160
Re from Chris Fisher, famous first words.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.920
Excellent.

37:40.920 --> 37:50.440
And the content is, in fact, it worked.

37:50.440 --> 37:51.440
Nicely done, Wes.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.440
Nicely done, Minimac.

37:52.440 --> 37:57.720
I mean, I'm honestly, I'm still surprised, but it just doesn't seem like we did it so

37:57.720 --> 38:01.160
hastily and we really didn't know what we were doing.

38:01.160 --> 38:05.600
But thankfully, the tools that we have access to right now are good enough that it kind

38:05.600 --> 38:07.520
of takes care of that for us.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.760
I mean, not to do a shameless plug, but it is legitimately why Alex and I started the

38:10.760 --> 38:15.800
self-hosted podcast, because these tools, the stuff that you can run yourself now, it's

38:15.800 --> 38:20.280
at a level way beyond anything we dreamed when we first started doing these shows.

38:20.280 --> 38:25.200
And I am so grateful for the open source projects that make all of that possible.

38:25.200 --> 38:30.160
And so our plan there is we're just going to slowly roll that out a little bit to certain

38:30.160 --> 38:32.480
people just over time as we just kind of expand it.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.760
And then maybe eventually, I don't know, we might go further from there.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.120
I don't know what we're going to do exactly.

38:37.120 --> 38:40.640
We just want to try to get a few people on there to make sure everything's working.

38:40.640 --> 38:43.520
Because you know, even though we're crazy, we want to be cautious.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.360
And then we'll probably just kind of ramp it up over time.

38:45.360 --> 38:48.160
So I guess more on that when we do a future email server update.

38:48.160 --> 38:53.000
And that essentially right there completes the email server series.

38:53.000 --> 38:58.680
And Wes Payne was a hero and a legend in this one, because we put a lot of work, specifically

38:58.680 --> 39:01.560
Wes did, into Rain Loop.

39:01.560 --> 39:05.400
And we thought we were going to go with that all the way until just really last night,

39:05.400 --> 39:06.520
maybe this morning.

39:06.520 --> 39:10.520
And then at the last minute, we said, now let's do round cube instead.

39:10.520 --> 39:14.840
And Wes got it all set up and running just a little bit before the show, like a real

39:14.840 --> 39:15.840
legend.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.240
So let's pause everybody to Wes Payne for getting that done.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.640
Good job, Wes.

39:19.640 --> 39:23.560
Now you'll just have to wait and see how it lasts, right?

39:23.560 --> 39:24.560
Can we maintain it?

39:24.560 --> 39:25.560
How does it do?

39:25.560 --> 39:26.720
Do we keep using it?

39:26.720 --> 39:31.360
Stay tuned to Linux Unplugged for more.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.160
Mailroute.net slash Linux.

39:33.160 --> 39:37.240
Try out Mailroute today and get 10% off the lifetime of your account and get a 30 day

39:37.240 --> 39:40.320
free trial, no credit card required.

39:40.320 --> 39:43.840
Mailroute is how we are routing mail through to our mail server.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.960
So yeah, during the live show, we went through Mailroute.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.680
It happened so dang fast.

39:48.680 --> 39:55.000
And if you have a business where even just a handful of people, you know how critical

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
email is.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.880
And you know how bad threats like ransomware are getting more and more.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.880
And admins are looking for ways to manage that risk.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.980
And Mailroute is a fantastic way to do that.

40:04.980 --> 40:10.480
For 24 years, they have focused on that core competency, just providing cutting edge email

40:10.480 --> 40:11.480
security.

40:11.480 --> 40:15.320
And I absolutely loved the tools as an admin while we were setting up our email server

40:15.320 --> 40:16.840
the first time around.

40:16.840 --> 40:21.800
I logged in and looked at their real time logs and saw the emails coming and going and

40:21.800 --> 40:23.680
knew that, hey, we'd gotten some stuff set up.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.960
So I was pretty confident it was going to work.

40:25.960 --> 40:29.960
You know, it gave me a pretty good snapshot and I really liked that tool, especially when

40:29.960 --> 40:30.960
I'm setting things up.

40:30.960 --> 40:34.800
But another thing that I know I'm going to take advantage of at some point, and I would

40:34.800 --> 40:39.480
really, I would really recommend you consider this as well, is you can use Mailroute to

40:39.480 --> 40:44.240
queue up messages for up to like 15 days or like whatever you set it to.

40:44.240 --> 40:48.800
So that way you have time for maintenance or if you have an outage or an internet outage

40:48.800 --> 40:52.680
of some kind, Mailroute will make sure you don't lose your email.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.480
And then when your system comes back online, it just forwards it right to your mail server

40:55.480 --> 40:57.420
like it was never down really.

40:57.420 --> 40:59.120
That's just such a nice piece of mind.

40:59.120 --> 41:04.440
Additionally, if you work in government and compliance is an issue for you, Mailroute

41:04.440 --> 41:07.760
has some of the most important compliances that you could have in that business.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.320
So you can feel safe using Mailroute.

41:09.320 --> 41:11.840
Of course, they have a lot of information on their website.

41:11.840 --> 41:17.540
So go try Mailroute out today and get 10% off the lifetime, lifetime of your account.

41:17.540 --> 41:19.960
How great is that that they're doing that for us and for you guys too?

41:19.960 --> 41:22.800
So go get a 30 day free trial, no credit card required.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.600
Visit mailroute.net slash Linux.

41:25.600 --> 41:30.220
This is an example of one of those great partnerships where we contacted Mailroute because we were

41:30.220 --> 41:33.640
absolutely going to be using Mailroute and we just said, we think you'd be a great fit.

41:33.640 --> 41:36.400
We're doing this mail series where we'd love to have you on board.

41:36.400 --> 41:41.000
Mailroute said, all right, let's do it and they did it for two episodes and now they're

41:41.000 --> 41:44.780
back because they got a lot of great feedback from you guys.

41:44.780 --> 41:50.220
We had a bunch of you try it out and really like it and so they thought, let's stick around

41:50.220 --> 41:51.220
for a little bit longer.

41:51.220 --> 41:54.040
So they're here for a little bit longer and I'd love for you to go try them out because

41:54.040 --> 41:57.740
I think they could provide a real service regardless of the scale of your institution.

41:57.740 --> 42:02.560
But this could offer a lot of benefit if you're a large institution or a small business.

42:02.560 --> 42:05.640
But if you're just a self-hoster and you want the peace of mind, you don't want to worry

42:05.640 --> 42:09.000
about the crap and you don't want to worry about the downtime, Mailroute's going to solve

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
that for you.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.640
And they've been solving it for 24 years.

42:11.640 --> 42:16.400
So go to mailroute.net slash Linux, get 10% off the lifetime of your account, support

42:16.400 --> 42:21.040
the show and start a free 30-day trial with no credit card required.

Mailroute.net slash Linux.

42:25.840 --> 42:32.960
Well speaking of email, it's time to check our mailbag and we've got an email from Murray

42:32.960 --> 42:35.920
wanting to know more about Pipewire.

42:35.920 --> 42:42.120
Hi, you guys asked what specific things from Fedora 34 listeners would like you to cover.

42:42.120 --> 42:48.320
I know you choked about Pipewire being too niche, but as a musician and podcaster transitioning

42:48.320 --> 42:55.560
off macOS and onto Linux full time, I would love to hear more about it.

42:55.560 --> 43:02.440
Audio has been the single biggest pain point in my move since it works dramatically differently

43:02.440 --> 43:03.440
than in macOS.

43:03.440 --> 43:08.160
I only learned about Pipewire shortly before listening to the episode and it sounds super

43:08.160 --> 43:09.440
cool.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.320
Please do share more of your thoughts on it.

43:12.320 --> 43:13.880
Best, Murray.

43:13.880 --> 43:19.280
Murray, you are coming in at such a great time into Linux media production.

43:19.280 --> 43:26.680
Oh, how do, how I could just picture that the future for you is going to be so bright

43:26.680 --> 43:30.360
because Linux has really gotten to a good point.

43:30.360 --> 43:33.800
I kind of seem to kind of get the impression that you're focused more on the audio end

43:33.800 --> 43:34.800
of stuff.

43:34.800 --> 43:36.800
Pipewire does manage video.

43:36.800 --> 43:43.000
In fact, it started to manage video, but it has really, really gotten to the point where

43:43.000 --> 43:47.800
you can produce media on Linux all day long and it's fantastic.

43:47.800 --> 43:52.560
We do things that I simply could never leave Linux.

43:52.560 --> 43:57.200
We just had a hypothetical like back and forth this other Sunday when we were recording land,

43:57.200 --> 44:00.520
like how would we even recreate what we do now on other platforms?

44:00.520 --> 44:05.240
It's just, it's remarkable what we get out of one computer running Linux because of jack

44:05.240 --> 44:11.620
audio and Pipewire takes everything I love about the current state of Linux audio and

44:11.620 --> 44:14.680
makes it easier and remains compatible with it.

44:14.680 --> 44:18.640
And that's why it's going to be kind of a big deal as it rolls out.

44:18.640 --> 44:25.200
It started as really a way to just focus on getting video in and out of the Linux desktop,

44:25.200 --> 44:26.760
particularly like in a Wayland future.

44:26.760 --> 44:31.360
But it's really grown into a low latency audio and video system for playback and capture.

44:31.360 --> 44:35.440
Yeah, you know, we did some chatting with the developers and they kind of emphasize

44:35.440 --> 44:40.240
that that once you've got this sort of graph node processing to handle, you know, little

44:40.240 --> 44:46.680
bits of either video or audio, it's kind of the same and why not unify that in one tool?

44:46.680 --> 44:51.200
You can think about this too, in terms of development, you can think of Pipewire as

44:51.200 --> 44:55.880
a server and a user space API to deal with multimedia pipelines on the desktop like mixing

44:55.880 --> 45:02.160
available sources of video and accessing sources of audio and bringing those all together.

45:02.160 --> 45:07.480
And there is an API the developers can write to as well as they can just continue to use

45:07.480 --> 45:10.760
pulse audio or jack audio, if that's what their application is designed for, because

45:10.760 --> 45:13.120
Pipewire speaks that as well.

45:13.120 --> 45:14.120
That's huge.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.120
Right.

45:15.120 --> 45:18.760
So you get the like legacy support, but you also have a new Pipewire native API if you

45:18.760 --> 45:24.160
want to be future forward, right with that more efficient lower latency Pipewire backend

45:24.160 --> 45:26.600
server managing it all now.

45:26.600 --> 45:29.760
So really, depending on your distribution, things are going to pretty much work just

45:29.760 --> 45:34.000
as normal, you won't even really know anything has changed.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.040
And it really has been, for me, at least a very smooth transition.

45:37.040 --> 45:40.720
It's been a very positive transition, unlike maybe a decade ago where it would have been

45:40.720 --> 45:43.120
a little or decade plus would have been a little bump here.

45:43.120 --> 45:45.160
Yeah, it should all just work.

45:45.160 --> 45:49.420
But one of the neat things about Pipewire supporting all of these options at the same

45:49.420 --> 45:53.400
time is in the audio world, it unifies them.

45:53.400 --> 45:55.980
Before you had a lot of neat stuff you could do with jack.

45:55.980 --> 45:59.040
And then of course, there was the pulse world, which is growing more and more functionality

45:59.040 --> 46:01.080
with things like pulse effects.

46:01.080 --> 46:04.120
And you can do a lot of clever stuff with pulse, but it was never really designed for

46:04.120 --> 46:08.000
that pro audio, low latency sort of workload.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.840
And that just meant you had two or three different Linux audio worlds that didn't always play

46:12.840 --> 46:16.560
nicely together, or you had to, you know, really know what you're doing to link them

46:16.560 --> 46:17.560
up correctly.

46:17.560 --> 46:19.480
But in Pipewire, that just works.

46:19.480 --> 46:22.160
Or maybe another way to put it is stack them on top of each other, right?

46:22.160 --> 46:25.480
You would have you would have sound system stacked on top of sound systems.

46:25.480 --> 46:29.340
Yeah, really, as much fun as that sounds like.

46:29.340 --> 46:32.920
And so I think, you know, for Murray's case, things should just work, you can just get

46:32.920 --> 46:33.920
started.

46:33.920 --> 46:36.640
But when you're ready, you can start playing with some of these tools that are designed

46:36.640 --> 46:40.880
around jack workflows, things like like Katia or Carla.

46:40.880 --> 46:44.780
And then you can start doing some of that fancy orchestrating of moving inputs wherever

46:44.780 --> 46:49.680
you need doing loop backs, monitoring input on the system, all that fun kind of pro audio

46:49.680 --> 46:52.000
stuff that you might have been using a special Mac app for.

46:52.000 --> 46:57.100
Yeah, put really simply, if you're recording a podcast, and you want to record a guest,

46:57.100 --> 47:02.620
and you want to do it all on maybe one laptop, or one computer, how do you capture that application

47:02.620 --> 47:08.480
audio and bring it into your recorder to record it, you need tools that can link that all

47:08.480 --> 47:09.480
together.

47:09.480 --> 47:13.760
And that's what Pipewire will enable in a way that we've had before, but was not in

47:13.760 --> 47:17.200
a unified framework for exchanging all of this.

47:17.200 --> 47:21.800
And none of the previous solutions that we've talked about were really built with our way

47:21.800 --> 47:27.160
land future in mind and the security requirements that come with that, like having applications

47:27.160 --> 47:32.200
sandboxed in flat packs that need ways that are standardized and API's to communicate

47:32.200 --> 47:33.200
with each other.

47:33.200 --> 47:38.120
And Pipewire aims to solve all of those problems to outside of just the multimedia improvements

47:38.120 --> 47:43.200
we've talked about, it's really going to be a unified framework for both consumers that

47:43.200 --> 47:46.960
won't even know they're using Pipewire quite legitimately won't even know.

47:46.960 --> 47:52.280
And pros like us who are going to rant and rave about it for years now because this is

47:52.280 --> 47:57.560
over time and even already beginning to solve pain points that we have struggled with for

47:57.560 --> 48:04.520
13 years, legitimately, legitimately, probably maybe even longer, maybe 15 years.

48:04.520 --> 48:09.000
And so it's really exciting for us as content creators who've been using this platform for

48:09.000 --> 48:14.900
a very long time to see something that really truly feels competitive with what you see

48:14.900 --> 48:15.900
on the Mac side.

48:15.900 --> 48:20.120
Well, we're clearly very excited about Pipewire the future, especially now that it's deployed

48:20.120 --> 48:21.120
in Fedora 34.

48:21.120 --> 48:25.180
But it's also a project we've been following for a long time here on the show.

48:25.180 --> 48:29.180
So if you want some background and to get an idea of how far things have come, maybe

48:29.180 --> 48:35.920
check out Linux Unplugged 272 way back when October 2018 when we sat down with lead Pipewire

48:35.920 --> 48:41.840
developer Wim Taymans who told us what he was aiming to do.

48:41.840 --> 48:44.320
And just a couple of picks before we get out of here.

48:44.320 --> 48:47.920
This week, we wanted to share a Pastebin alternative.

48:47.920 --> 48:48.920
There's a lot out there.

48:48.920 --> 48:52.560
So we'd love your feedback too for ones that you love that are simple and self-hostable.

48:52.560 --> 48:59.160
But our beloved Slexi.org, which we have used as a J.B. team for years to past Pastebins

48:59.160 --> 49:02.720
back and forth or when you hear us read an email on the show that we've linked in our

49:02.720 --> 49:08.280
show notes, we put it in Slexi.org and they are shutting down as all hosted services that

49:08.280 --> 49:11.040
Giveth eventually Taketh.

49:11.040 --> 49:13.560
Just when you really depend on them and don't think they'll go anywhere.

49:13.560 --> 49:14.560
I really hadn't.

49:14.560 --> 49:17.200
I just started thinking, huh, I guess they are sticking around.

49:17.200 --> 49:22.680
So this week, Wes found us a markdown loving Pastebin service.

49:22.680 --> 49:27.560
Although really, I should give credit to Gamma over in our matrix chat, the J.B. matrix who

49:27.560 --> 49:28.560
posted this.

49:28.560 --> 49:31.900
And I just thought, boy, that seems perfect for our needs.

49:31.900 --> 49:32.900
Thank you, Gamma.

49:32.900 --> 49:33.900
I didn't know that.

49:33.900 --> 49:34.900
Look at you.

49:34.900 --> 49:35.900
Good guy, Wes.

49:35.900 --> 49:36.900
Giving him credit.

49:36.900 --> 49:37.900
All right.

49:37.900 --> 49:38.900
Now, I'm trying to get you to say the name, though, because I'm avoiding the name.

49:38.900 --> 49:41.960
I'm going to say rentree, rentree.org.

49:41.960 --> 49:44.520
For our entry, I don't know if that's better.

49:44.520 --> 49:45.520
Yeah.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.720
And rentree.co, too, works maybe?

49:47.720 --> 49:48.720
I'm not sure.

49:48.720 --> 49:49.720
But it's called rentree.

49:49.720 --> 49:53.480
And it's a markdown lightweight Pastebin that is really clean.

49:53.480 --> 49:58.240
And you can combine images, inline links, code snippets, all the markdown stuff.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.800
And we put a link to that in the show notes.

49:59.800 --> 50:04.860
And then this is also, at the same time, the show saying to you, hey, we know of a handful

50:04.860 --> 50:05.860
of these.

50:05.860 --> 50:10.360
And we've debated which one we want to use, which one we want to self-host.

50:10.360 --> 50:13.600
But we'd like to point to this link and say, hey, do you know of anything that's kind of

50:13.600 --> 50:14.600
clean like this?

50:14.600 --> 50:20.320
Because what we need is just a nice, clear reading experience with not a lot of junk

50:20.320 --> 50:21.960
because we're reading it live on air.

50:21.960 --> 50:26.820
And we don't want like sidebar stuff or big, huge, fat header bars and stuff like that.

50:26.820 --> 50:28.040
We just want something nice and clean.

50:28.040 --> 50:32.840
And if you know of a Pastebin alternative that's open source and self-hostable, please

50:32.840 --> 50:35.960
let us know at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

50:35.960 --> 50:40.040
Because we'd like to try one out and then standardize one for the network.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.400
Like we kind of have with HedgeDock.

50:42.400 --> 50:45.400
And then we have one last extra pick for you this week.

50:45.400 --> 50:48.840
And it's a special one, Wes, do you happen to know why?

50:48.840 --> 50:55.080
Something tells me it must be written in Rust.

50:55.080 --> 51:00.720
That's right.

51:00.720 --> 51:01.720
Feels good.

51:01.720 --> 51:03.320
It's been too long since we've had a Rust pick.

51:03.320 --> 51:08.740
And this one is the kind of pick you were never asking for, a replacement for PS written

51:08.740 --> 51:10.520
in Rust called Prox.

51:10.520 --> 51:15.840
But hear me out, it actually has a pretty great output.

51:15.840 --> 51:19.640
They call it a human readable format that is colored with automatic theme detection

51:19.640 --> 51:26.120
based on your terminal background, keyword search over a multi-column UI, and then additional

51:26.120 --> 51:32.920
information that your boy PS doesn't have like TCP UDP port usage, read write throughput,

51:32.920 --> 51:37.240
the Docker container name that that process might be running under, and more memory information

51:37.240 --> 51:40.480
which is nice in the era of system DOOMD.

51:40.480 --> 51:43.880
Oh, you know, this tree view is pretty sweet too.

51:43.880 --> 51:48.880
Yeah, it really does actually look good enough that I'm I think I'm legitimately switching

51:48.880 --> 51:49.880
to this.

51:49.880 --> 51:54.340
I initially picked this as an ironic pick because who needs another PS?

51:54.340 --> 51:55.700
That's ridiculous.

51:55.700 --> 51:58.200
And then I installed it and I absolutely love it.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.240
It's even great on our server.

51:59.240 --> 52:02.320
I love the Docker support and that is really handy.

52:02.320 --> 52:06.880
Whoa, and there's experimental support on both Mac and Windows.

52:06.880 --> 52:07.880
Look at them.

52:07.880 --> 52:08.880
Everybody gets to play.

52:08.880 --> 52:12.560
Oh, I didn't even I didn't even really think about the fact that there's Rust apps on the

52:12.560 --> 52:13.560
Mac.

52:13.560 --> 52:14.560
Of course there are.

52:14.560 --> 52:18.500
I knew Microsoft was hot to trot with Rust, but I'm sure Apple's been super helpful getting

52:18.500 --> 52:21.280
Rust working on Mac OS.

52:21.280 --> 52:24.560
And Chris, you'll never guess, it's already packaged in Arch.

52:24.560 --> 52:25.560
Oh, of course.

52:25.560 --> 52:26.560
Yeah, absolutely.

52:26.560 --> 52:27.560
I knew that.

52:27.560 --> 52:28.560
You know, I knew that.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.560
Anyways, go check it out.

52:29.560 --> 52:34.600
It's a really nice, really clean, really elegant way to list all of the processes and the resources

52:34.600 --> 52:35.820
they're using and all of that.

52:35.820 --> 52:40.840
It's called Prox, P-R-O-C-S, and yeah, it's up on GitHub, so it's probably just easier

52:40.840 --> 52:46.120
to get the link in the show notes, if I'm being honest with you.

52:46.120 --> 52:50.840
Thank you very much to our Unplugged Core contributors at unpluggedcore.com for like

52:50.840 --> 52:52.280
a few more hours.

52:52.280 --> 52:57.640
The secret promo that I gave out will be valid and then I'm going to remove that product

52:57.640 --> 52:58.640
from the garage.

52:58.640 --> 53:04.160
So if you haven't taken advantage of it yet, you got hours, you got hours left.

53:04.160 --> 53:06.280
But you know, there's other things we do to thank our members.

53:06.280 --> 53:09.760
We also make a couple of feeds available to them, a completely unedited raw version where

53:09.760 --> 53:15.900
you hear us screw up and lots of probably, I would say, two solid pre-shows easily, maybe

53:15.900 --> 53:20.600
three pre-shows that we just totally blew and did not record except for our members.

53:20.600 --> 53:21.760
That's in the feed this week too.

53:21.760 --> 53:24.280
And then also you can get just a limited ad feed if you prefer.

53:24.280 --> 53:28.680
It's a little tighter version of the show, same full production, all of that stuff.

53:28.680 --> 53:32.740
Those are two different feeds we make available to those of you who help make the show sustainable

53:32.740 --> 53:36.340
at unpluggedcore.com.

53:36.340 --> 53:39.240
And thank you everybody who does support the show there.

53:39.240 --> 53:44.200
Be sure to go check out jupytergarage.com too for some of that limited time last merch.

53:44.200 --> 53:48.680
And those coins are almost gone at jupytergarage.com.

53:48.680 --> 53:51.720
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow the show at linuxunplugged.

53:51.720 --> 53:57.480
The website's linuxunplugged.com, but we do have a Twitter handle, which, you know, you

53:57.480 --> 53:58.760
can follow.

53:58.760 --> 53:59.760
You can follow.

53:59.760 --> 54:01.120
I follow the network.

54:01.120 --> 54:02.920
I'll just follow the whole network at Jupiter Signal.

54:02.920 --> 54:04.200
I'd probably follow Wes.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.080
Wes, tweet a picture of some dogs sometime.

54:07.080 --> 54:12.120
Maybe you have, but you know like that epic superhero like A-Team shot you took of the

54:12.120 --> 54:13.320
pups the other morning?

54:13.320 --> 54:16.200
That would make, that's some serious Twitter material right there.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.200
Cute dogs.

54:17.200 --> 54:18.200
Who can say no?

54:18.200 --> 54:19.200
All right, I'm on it.

54:19.200 --> 54:20.200
I can't say no.

54:20.200 --> 54:21.200
I can't say no.

54:21.200 --> 54:22.200
So go find him.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.200
He's at Wes Payne on the Twitter.

54:23.200 --> 54:24.200
I'm at Chris LAS.

54:24.200 --> 54:27.640
The entire network and all of our fantastic podcasts, like the self-hosted podcast and

54:27.640 --> 54:33.440
Linux Action News, and the Coda Radio program, are all over at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

54:33.440 --> 54:34.880
And we'd love to have you join the show live.

54:34.880 --> 54:36.880
See you next week.

54:36.880 --> 54:39.320
Same bad time, same bad station.

54:39.320 --> 54:41.820
Just get your Linux on every Tuesday.

54:41.820 --> 54:42.820
Get all Linux-y.

54:42.820 --> 54:47.800
And join us live at 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

54:47.800 --> 54:51.160
I'm not exactly sure what it means to get all Linux-y.

54:51.160 --> 54:54.140
Probably means like boot up a Linux box and join the live stream.

54:54.140 --> 54:55.140
That's probably what it means.

54:55.140 --> 54:59.160
The only way to find out is join us live next week while we get Linux-y, right?

54:59.160 --> 55:00.160
Yeah.

55:00.160 --> 55:01.160
Maybe bring a towel, though.

55:01.160 --> 55:02.160
Yeah.

55:02.160 --> 55:03.160
That's not a bad idea and a beverage.

55:03.160 --> 55:05.120
And you can absolutely join us in our mumble room.

55:05.120 --> 55:07.480
Info for that is at LinuxUnplugged.com slash mumble.

55:07.480 --> 55:08.480
That's the way.

55:08.480 --> 55:09.480
You get the idea.

55:09.480 --> 55:10.480
You get the idea.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.480
We have a website.

55:11.480 --> 55:12.480
Aren't you proud of us?

55:12.480 --> 55:15.480
And we put links of relevant information on there that you're probably wondering.

55:15.480 --> 55:17.120
It's a good idea.

55:17.120 --> 55:31.360
See you next Tuesday.

55:47.120 --> 55:55.160
Alright, JBtitles.com.

55:55.160 --> 55:57.600
Let's go name this thing.

55:57.600 --> 56:01.560
Do we miss anybody or anything in the show that we wanted to catch up on the post show

56:01.560 --> 56:03.040
before we head out of here?

56:03.040 --> 56:06.960
Well, Neil let us know that our pick is also packaged in Fedora.

56:06.960 --> 56:11.160
So you know, all those folks we convinced to try Fedora 34 don't have to miss out.

56:11.160 --> 56:12.160
Nope.

56:12.160 --> 56:13.160
Absolutely.

56:13.160 --> 56:14.160
Absolutely.

56:14.160 --> 56:15.160
I don't know.

56:15.160 --> 56:18.720
I've kind of played with the whole episode 404 thing with KOTORadio.

56:18.720 --> 56:21.600
So I feel like it's kind of silly if we go all in.

56:21.600 --> 56:26.100
But also I feel silly if we don't acknowledge that today is May 4th, which all of the Star

56:26.100 --> 56:29.180
Wars fans are excited about because the fourth is with them.

56:29.180 --> 56:31.640
And it is episode 404 on May 4th.

56:31.640 --> 56:33.320
There's a lot of fun to be had there.

56:33.320 --> 56:35.460
But this show is not a Star Wars show.

56:35.460 --> 56:40.960
And we just did the 404 gag with KOTORadio like 11 weeks ago.

56:40.960 --> 56:45.280
So I'm I'm perplexed as to how to title this monster.

56:45.280 --> 56:48.080
Well, you could always reference the 504 code.

56:48.080 --> 56:49.080
Which is?

56:49.080 --> 56:54.840
I don't actually know what it is because I've never seen it before.

56:54.840 --> 56:58.720
That is the least helpful ever.

56:58.720 --> 57:03.360
Like I'm sure Wes as a as a web dev like actually knows it off the top of his head.

57:03.360 --> 57:04.360
Method not allowed.

57:04.360 --> 57:05.360
Oh, my gosh.

57:05.360 --> 57:06.360
Listen to you.

57:06.360 --> 57:07.360
Nicely done.

57:07.360 --> 57:12.360
Thank you.
