1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
The case for open source in all of the things researchers have found the code in Volkswagens

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,840
that was used to cheat emissions tests and it's pretty sophisticated stuff.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,840
They would monitor all kinds of conditions like the position of the tire, how fast the

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,040
engine was having, how hard the engine was having to work to move the tires, how fast

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,000
they would spin and it was all tucked away under something very innocuous, just something

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,160
really simple called acoustic condition.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,480
Yeah, a little specific piece of code that was just labeled acoustic condition which

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,500
was originally started as just a way to control the sounds that the engine makes but it later

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,520
became a euphemism for conditions occurring during the emissions test and the code allowed

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,960
for as many 10 different profiles, as many as 10 different profiles for different potential

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
tests.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
When the computer would determine the car was undergoing a test, it activated the emissions

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,160
curbing system which reduced the amount of nitrogen oxide that was emitted.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,940
I found that kind of interesting because there was, it turns out, also a less sophisticated

15
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,000
version that Fiat was implementing and this one didn't have to worry about like the position

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,340
of the tire or how hard it was to spin the wheel, the car's onboard computer just simply

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,200
turned on emission curbing software for the first 26 minutes and 40 seconds of the engine

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
start.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Nice, yeah.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,520
So every time you started your engine, it just ran a little worse for the first 26 minutes

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,520
and 40 seconds.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
If you were driving somewhere far, then you know.

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,040
Yeah, and then that would cover most emissions tests by that point.

24
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,760
Most of them don't run longer than that and so you're out.

25
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,460
Researchers noted that for both Volkswagen and for Fiat, the vehicle's engine control

26
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,280
unit is manufactured by an automotive component giant, Robert Bosch.

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,840
Oh, of course.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,680
Yeah, Bosch and car manufacturers are then under their own choice, they can then enable

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,240
the code by entering certain parameters into the emissions control unit.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,600
This is why we need open source for all of the things because, you know, our buddy Chase

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,120
got bit by this directly.

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Did he?

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Yeah.

34
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
I didn't realize that.

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,240
He had to give back his Volkswagen diesel and he's now driving a Ford.

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:24,240
This is Linux Unplugged episode 198 from May 23rd, 2017.

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,920
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that might just be planning a barbecue

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,080
for its birthday.

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
My name is Chris.

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,600
My name is Wes and I'm hungry for burgers.

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Hello, Wes.

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Oh, I know.

44
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
I know.

45
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,880
You're the one that dropped the word ribs.

46
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,880
Just saying.

47
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
You might have to own that one, Wes.

48
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,920
You might have to own those barbecue ribs.

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,880
Coming up though on this week's episode, we're not there yet.

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,040
We're not yet to episode 200.

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,600
No, we're going to talk about some of our favorite open source projects, one that I

52
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,720
bet you have been looking for.

53
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,640
If you've ever considered getting a Chromecast and want to integrate it with your Linux box,

54
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,920
we'll talk about that, which I am particularly excited about because I have a Chromecast

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,560
sitting around needing to get a little more useful.

56
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,360
If you want to update some Logitech hardware under Linux, which I do, we have some good

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,520
news for you.

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,420
Big updates from Solus, a new version of Nextcloud is in the house and Joss will be here to talk

59
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,760
about it with us.

60
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,400
And then the magic device tool, I mentioned it a little bit last week.

61
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,040
It promises to make my Nexus 5 usable.

62
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,320
We'll talk with Marius, the gentleman who created the magic device tool, a simple and

63
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,940
feature rich tool to install or replace operating systems on a lot of common phones.

64
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,840
It's really slick.

65
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,520
And then also, we'll tell you a little bit about our barbecue plans, a little bit of

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,280
news that's going on, and of course, all of the wonderful discussions.

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,720
But one of the things I need to do right off the top because I neglected to do it last

68
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,480
week right now, prepare yourselves.

69
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,640
We're going to bring in that Mumble Room.

70
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,440
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

71
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Hello.

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Hello.

73
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
Hello.

74
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Hello.

75
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
Hello.

76
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Dear friends.

77
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Hey, you know what?

78
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,320
That intro right there, that whole show, powered by the new open source caster soundboard,

79
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
how great was that?

80
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,480
Hey, you know what?

81
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,960
That ding right there, also powered by the open source soundboard.

82
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
100% digital ding.

83
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,940
It is so awesome.

84
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,420
If you haven't checked it out yet, you should go to github.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

85
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,440
and check out caster soundboard.

86
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,400
Now with new art graphics, like look at that icon right there.

87
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
You see that duck?

88
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Yeah.

89
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Look at that cute little duck.

90
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Albert made us that.

91
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,820
That tells, that's the system-wide ducking.

92
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,240
You hit that and it ducks all the audio.

93
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
Awesome.

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,820
Brings it down to 33%.

95
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,960
Such a cool piece of software.

96
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,620
A legitimately competitive piece of software that was created by our community and it's

97
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,620
just so awesome.

98
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,620
And it's come so far so fast.

99
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,620
Yeah.

100
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,620
And we're using it in production now on all the shows.

101
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,800
It's pretty neat.

102
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,480
And you guys can go check it out if you want.

103
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,880
Now we'll talk about, we've got a bunch of stuff to talk about today.

104
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,920
That's not really it.

105
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,240
But why don't we talk about something else that's up on github?

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:57,240
MK, so Mik maybe, Chromecast, MK Chromecast, which allows Mac and Linux machines to send

107
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,680
audio and video to Google Cast devices and also Sonos devices.

108
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,720
Which not particularly appealing to me but I bet is to some people.

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,600
You can find more at MKChromecast.com.

110
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,860
And it's a program that lets you cast your audio or your Linux audio, whichever, it's

111
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,440
Mac or Linux, I don't think it works on Windows.

112
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,240
And it can also send video files.

113
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Nice.

114
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,260
Super nice, over the land.

115
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:30,480
If you've ever had like, in fact it was like a, it must have been like Christmas or Thanksgiving

116
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,960
or Halloween, some recent major holiday event.

117
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,120
We had all these videos on my computer and I wanted to play it for the family on the

118
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
television.

119
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
And I ended up installing all these crazy Chrome extensions to try to make it work and

120
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
they were super rickety.

121
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,560
You have to pay a bunch.

122
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Yeah, yeah.

123
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,360
This is just using FFmpeg and AVConf on the back end.

124
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,400
I think it's spinning up a Node.js instance and then it's using some MP3 codec encoding

125
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,520
to send it to this thing.

126
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,120
But at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter because it's allowing you to stream

127
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
high end audio.

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,560
You can do 24 bit, 96 kilohertz, high resolution audio using this thing.

129
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,480
And the other thing that's really nice about it is it integrates in on either the Mac OS

130
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,400
menu bar or if you're on Gnome or the Plasma desktop, it can also integrate with the desktop

131
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
there too.

132
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,560
So you get a little like a little Chromecast icon.

133
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Look at that.

134
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
That is slick.

135
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Yeah.

136
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,840
How fantastic would this be, right?

137
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,160
Now Sweetlo, you were going to mention CastNow.

138
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:39,080
Yeah I'm assuming that this MK Chromecast program works similar to how CastNow works.

139
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,560
I've ran CastNow a couple of times before and it did the job in that, mostly during

140
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,000
times when I was having issues with something like YouTube or something.

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,960
One thing CastNow can do that this can't, I'm not positive, is I think CastNow supports

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,960
torrents directly, but CastNow is command line only, whereas this integrates with the

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,340
menu bar on your desktop and stuff, which some people would prefer.

144
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,000
And it looks like CastNow isn't super, I mean there are some people making commits to it,

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,600
but on the read me there it talks about how the guy's kind of moved on, he's using DLNA.

146
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,560
So I know I'd use CastNow in the past too, so it's interesting to see another contender.

147
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Yeah.

148
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,440
You know like Sweetlo says, I know I've run into times where certain content providers

149
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,880
are like, why are you not working?

150
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,840
I could just download the file, play it on the TV, so hey, there you go.

151
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,040
Well and there is some legitimate use for Chromecast like in the workspace too.

152
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,780
So if you could throw a Chromecast on a television in a conference room and now you can send

153
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,620
stuff to it from your Linux box, that could be some money.

154
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,140
So it's MK Chromecast, it's only $100.

155
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,240
So you just go there, you give them your username, if you don't have an account, create one,

156
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,680
give them your shipping address, make sure you have a U.S. credit card, they only take

157
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
U.S. credit card.

158
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,360
Yeah, maybe you're social, and then it's only $100, what, I'm sorry, what?

159
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,480
Oh, this is not the Mac Action Show, uh-huh, okay, oh it's free, okay, uh-huh, okay.

160
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,880
I'm sorry, it uses something called the open source, and it's free, it's totally free,

161
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
100%, who knew?

162
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
Can we trust that?

163
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,880
Who knew?

164
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,360
I wouldn't, but you know what, I guess if you want to take your own risk.

165
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,720
You come back next week with a paid version and maybe we'll talk.

166
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,760
I'm just telling you, man, I'm just telling you.

167
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,080
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

168
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
That is not us.

169
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,240
So I like to mess with my hardware peripherals.

170
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,000
I have a bunch, right now in front of me, I have a bunch of Logitech hardware, and one

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,600
of the things that's great about Logitech is they have these unifying receivers.

172
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,920
You put one USB, little itty bitty USB receiver, and you can have your mouse and your keyboard

173
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,560
using one receiver.

174
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,620
Well, guess what?

175
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,480
There is a vulnerability, in fact a whole suite of vulnerabilities, and when you put

176
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,960
them all together, it even has a great name called MouseJack.

177
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,520
It uses a whole bunch of different stuff, vulnerabilities that are targeted, the low

178
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,200
level wireless protocol that's used by the unifying devices, they can do things like

179
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,960
pair new devices without prompting the user, they can inject keystrokes, they can inject

180
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,760
raw HID commands with about $15 of hardware.

181
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,140
You could be 50 meters away in doing this.

182
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,960
So that typical imagine sitting in a cafe scenario is, of course, it's very scary.

183
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,920
I have a little mouse I take with me everywhere.

184
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Yeah, me too.

185
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,600
That's what I'm all about.

186
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,560
These Logitech MX Anywheres are the best little laptop meese on the market, and so I have

187
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,360
these unifying receivers everywhere.

188
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,680
So Logitech Bastille Security worked with them, and Logitech acknowledged they had a

189
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,300
problem, and it took them a couple of releases, but after a couple of releases, they have

190
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,800
some updates that fix it.

191
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,280
It took them a few weeks, but they got it.

192
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
They fixed it.

193
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,480
The issue is solved, unless you're running Linux.

194
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,840
So they call up Logitech, and they're like, okay, here's what we're thinking about doing.

195
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,820
The cat's out of the bag on this whole mouse jack thing.

196
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,460
So we now know how we can randomly flash firmware onto your proprietary hardware.

197
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:49,640
If you gave us a little bit of official documentation, I bet you we could flash that secure firmware

198
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:56,200
onto these receivers using FW upload, which is a standard Linux utility.

199
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,680
It took a couple of weeks, and they rewrote the previously reverse-engineered plug-in

200
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,320
for FW upload.

201
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,680
The new documentation from Logitech came in, so they knew exactly what they were supposed

202
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,320
to do, how everything was supposed to match up, byte by byte.

203
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,920
They compared it with the Windows update version, and they were able to push this new firmware.

204
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,840
You could actually test it, too, right now.

205
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,240
If you'd like to test it, you need to get the new version of FW upload, because you

206
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,160
have to be able to talk to the hardware, so you need version 0.9.2-2, which is in Fedora

207
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,560
26 right now, and you can get it from Koji or for Fedora.

208
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,320
If you scroll just down a little bit there, doesn't it sure look nice in that GNOME software

209
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,160
that you just have that little update?

210
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
This is the idea, right?

211
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,520
They can then use this down the road via GNOME software update to update firmware like this.

212
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,040
That's brilliant, I think.

213
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,920
It shows you how everything... You've got to be thinking about the update life cycle

214
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,700
on everything now.

215
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,160
We're so used to talking about... We're about to talk about an update to Nextcloud.

216
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,200
We're used to talking about an update to our GNOME desktop, but there's even bootloader

217
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,360
code on these little receivers that the documentation-

218
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,360
Turtles all the way down, and the turtles run horrible, ancient software.

219
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,760
Yes, very well put.

220
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,160
It is turtles all the way down.

221
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,440
That's why we always are looking for a little refreshing cup of tea, or maybe a nice, relaxing

222
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,960
bowl of soup.

223
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,920
We got a little plasma in the soup this time.

224
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,840
Yeah, so Ikea has a rare blog post over at the Solus site, and it looks like, ladies

225
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,320
and gentlemen, prepare yourselves for the shocker of a lifetime, but it's early days,

226
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,740
but the plasma desktop is coming to Solus, and I actually think this is a great combination.

227
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,040
That's why I wanted to put it in here, because I think Solus is a great distribution, and

228
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,880
I think this could be one of the great plasma distributions if they work on it.

229
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,660
So right now, it's not officially supported, but they have Peter.

230
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,560
He's working on the project.

231
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,520
He's been maintaining plasma packages and KDE dependencies for a while, because it turns

232
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:03,640
out things like KDE and Live, Corita, K3b are pretty popular among Solus users, so they're

233
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,240
already packing in all of the dependencies for that anyways, and they're packaging...

234
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,520
So it wasn't that much further to just...

235
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,900
So the way Ikea writes this is, he says, Peter's ambition is to eventually support a full plasma

237
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,680
stack on Solus, and if you want to help him get there, you can help him evolve it, so

238
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,340
you can get involved, work with Peter, help Peter report bugs, things like that.

239
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,000
So do you think this would be something that you're interested in?

240
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,840
Are you doing it over here now?

241
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Is this Solus here?

242
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
No, I just wanted you to...

243
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Yeah.

244
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
Okay.

245
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
Maybe.

246
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
I would consider it.

247
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:44,560
I would definitely kick the tires, and Ikea here has laid out to who's now working on

248
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
the different desktops.

249
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,080
Josh is working on GnomeShell, Ikea's working on Budgie, Peter on KDE Plasma, Justin on

250
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Mate.

251
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
It's a nice insight into how the projects...

252
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
Yeah.

253
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
What they're each kind of focusing on.

254
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
Yeah.

255
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Good for them.

256
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
Yeah.

257
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
So if you asked about it, I'm excited to see where they take Budgie.

258
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,400
I think it's great to have another distribution where Plasma could eventually become a tier

259
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,320
one citizen.

260
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,040
Patreon.com slash Solus if you want to help them.

261
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,580
I think this would be a great way, even if you're not running Solus, but you like what

262
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,240
they're doing.

263
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,880
I really like the idea that there's a project out there that's making a really modern distro,

264
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,280
and they're not being religious about what desktop you have to use, and they're playing

265
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,680
well with others too.

266
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,880
Patreon.com slash Solus, and keep up the great work, guys.

267
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,480
I'll probably be checking it out.

268
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
I'll probably check it out.

269
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
I bet you will.

270
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,400
So NextCloud12 is out, and Joss is here to chat with us about it.

271
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,160
So before we go there, before we get any further, let's take a moment and thank our first sponsor

272
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
this week, Linux Academy.

273
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Oh, yeah.

274
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,600
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, a platform where you can learn more about Linux and all

275
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,680
of the technology around Linux.

276
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,560
I think this is a resource that if you would have told Chris from 10 years ago existed,

277
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,080
he would have been delighted.

278
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,880
When I first started working with Linux, I actually just went and got a bunch of books,

279
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,360
and then I tried to find community college courses, and it was always hit and miss on

280
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,400
how good the instructor was going to be, and I would try to figure out what courseware

281
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,160
would be the best investment of my time, and there was really no oversight or way to figure

282
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,240
it all out, especially for somebody who's busy and had a lot going on.

283
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,860
Linux Academy checks all those boxes and more.

284
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,640
So it's built by people that are incredibly passionate about Linux.

285
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,840
They have full-time instructors available when you need them.

286
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:29,120
They're continually investing in content to make Linux Academy more valuable.

287
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,320
They have hands-on labs and exercises.

288
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,220
They have in-depth cert training if that's the route you want to go.

289
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,920
You get unlimited access to the courses.

290
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,400
They spin up the servers on demand when you need them.

291
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,440
They're even doing deep dives into things like AWS and Azure and all that kind of stuff.

292
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,880
Man, it is a new world, and Linux Academy is going to help you meet it head on.

293
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,440
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

294
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,400
You go there, you sign up for a free seven-day trial, try them all out, get a little idea

295
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,800
of how it works, wrap your head around it a bit, enjoy, and if you have any questions,

296
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,960
take advantage of that instructor mentoring.

297
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,300
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

298
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,720
Sign up for a free seven-day trial and support the show, and a big thank you to Linux Academy

299
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,560
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

300
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,680
See, I think at that point, you'd have to work hard to not learn something.

301
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,600
Ah, man, you would really have to not want to learn, which would sort of defeat the purpose.

302
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,280
Why are you doing that?

303
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,440
So Joss joins us again.

304
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,160
Hey Joss, welcome back to the show, sir.

305
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Good to have you.

306
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,920
Hey guys, nice to be here again.

307
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,240
Thanks for inviting me.

308
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,000
Now we have a new Nextcloud on our hands, and it looks like it's going global scale

309
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
this time.

310
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Congrats.

311
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah, you like that, huh?

312
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I do, I do, I do like that.

313
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,720
There's also a couple other features in there that are actually more applicable directly

314
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,200
to me, like writable public links, improvements to the audio video chat.

315
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
But Joss, you're the expert.

316
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,640
Where do you think we should start on the new release?

317
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,920
Well, let's start, indeed, about the smaller features.

318
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,240
Well, I mean, next to global scale, everything looks small.

319
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,560
That's kind of the point of it.

320
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,160
But yeah, I think the collaboration features that you mentioned, like that you can send

321
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,760
a public link to someone with like a Collabora file, you know, a docx or something, and then

322
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,320
they can add it together with you.

323
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,480
They don't need an account.

324
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
That's really nice.

325
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Very nice.

326
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,400
So it's essentially a very easy drop in replacement for Google Docs, because the end user you're

327
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,200
just sending a link to, they just click it and they're in.

328
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,280
They don't have to worry about what the software is.

329
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,160
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

330
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
Our Office 365.

331
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,880
I mean, that's kind of officially what we're going after.

332
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,480
I mean, a lot of the other features, you see the same thing.

333
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,080
I mean, obviously, on top of that, you have all the control things, you know, that you

334
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,040
can say, okay, file access control, you can only you can limit, you know, access to files

335
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,840
from certain IP ranges or certain file types, you can say like, yeah, people in the HR department

336
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:58,640
when they share an Excel sheet via public link, you know, that is not accessible from

337
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,720
outside of the company, internal network, stuff like that.

338
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,320
You know, so you can put these these policies on top of it, which you can't really do with

339
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,560
most of the other solutions, because it just, well, they're not self hosted, they they're

340
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,320
not built to give you that kind of control as an administrator.

341
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Sure.

342
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:21,120
And what what are the what are the when you say the big changes for like the global scale,

343
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,400
what does that really translate to what is what are the real technical changes happening

344
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
behind the scenes?

345
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,640
Yeah, so global scale, let me introduce it quickly for those who haven't seen it or seen

346
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
our video.

347
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,080
So the idea behind global scale is to transform the architecture of Nextcloud.

348
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,520
So Nextcloud, when Frank started this seven, eight years ago, it started as a standard

349
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
web app.

350
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,600
So in a web application, you can scale by just throwing more hardware at it at least

351
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,200
to a certain degree.

352
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:56,040
So with Nextcloud, you can you have an application server, Nextcloud itself, and then you have

353
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,960
database and storage and user directory like LDAP, and you connect it to those three.

354
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,040
And Nextcloud itself scales almost without limits.

355
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,080
If you want twice as many users, you just put down two Nextcloud servers.

356
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,800
But the thing is, they both need to connect to the same database and same storage and

357
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,460
the same user directory.

358
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,280
So at a certain scale, and I mean, you're talking about 10, 20, 30,000 users is all

359
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,360
quite doable, but if you get above 50,000, you really need to buy very expensive enterprise

360
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:34,720
storage, very expensive enterprise databases, it gets very pricey and slow at some point.

361
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,760
So that's what we want to fix.

362
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,880
So that's also what makes it more than interesting for really big solutions.

363
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:52,200
So global scale, the goal was to scale beyond 100 million users, like seriously huge installation

364
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
should be possible.

365
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,060
And the second goal was to lower the costs.

366
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:03,480
As I said, you get really high storage and database costs at the high end at large installations.

367
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,240
And the third was actually something a lot of people have been asking for, which is to

368
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,400
be able to say about the data that's on your Nextcloud, to be able to kind of split it

369
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,120
up and to say, look, I want this data to physically stay in San Francisco and this data to physically

370
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,600
stay in Germany.

371
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,840
Now you kind of could do that with Nextcloud 11 and 10 and other older releases by using

372
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,440
federation and you would simply have two servers and then the users would have to log in to

373
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,300
one or the other and then they could share with each other because they were connected

374
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,400
via federation.

375
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,680
That's kind of nice.

376
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,200
We still have multiple places to log in and what if an employee moves from the US to Europe?

377
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,560
You know, like you have to close their account and then create a new account, move their

378
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,640
data, all their shares will be gone.

379
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
That's kind of uncool.

380
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,760
So it wouldn't act like one instance, a little bit, but not really.

381
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,000
So this is what global scale is about, to make these three things different.

382
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,300
And it does that by splitting up indeed what federation did, except that it adds a couple

383
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,520
of components on top of that to make it act like a single instance.

384
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,840
So, you get the global site selector.

385
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,840
It's simply a server that when you log in, you go to cloud.nextcloud.com.

386
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,280
It's what I do every day, right?

387
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,160
That's our internal cloud.

388
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,360
And from there it automatically redirects you to the node where your data is.

389
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,400
So in my case it would be in Germany.

390
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
And what is doing that?

391
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,440
What's doing that redirection?

392
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,400
Is there some global master login database that knows where to send people?

393
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Yeah.

394
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,920
So that's the global site selector itself.

395
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,480
It knows where you are.

396
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:48,600
The global site selector, is this a new piece of server software that Nextcloud is publishing?

397
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Yes.

398
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Correct.

399
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:58,960
It's a new separate, we actually implemented it, I have to see how it was implemented.

400
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,840
Give me a second.

401
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
Interesting though.

402
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,680
Because a number of things was done as an app and I would have to look up the details

403
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
there.

404
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,760
But it's a separate server component.

405
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,600
It's a separate thing that you have to run.

406
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,080
And that's where the users log in and then it redirects them.

407
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,000
And the user sets a cookie so that they don't have to go over this server every single time,

408
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
right?

409
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,320
Because your client logs in every 30 seconds and that would mean with 100 million users

410
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,920
you got 300 million connections every 30 seconds.

411
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,380
That's a little crazy.

412
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,120
So they remember what the node was, but as a user you don't notice that.

413
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
It's not that your URL changes.

414
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,080
You just go to cloud.nextcloud.com.

415
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,080
So you're in one place, but in the underlying there you're actually connected to a local

416
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,080
data center.

417
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,880
If local data switch fast, it's under control of the local sys admins.

418
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,920
They can say this data has to stay here or there and you know, it's all transparent for

419
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
you.

420
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,080
So that's one component.

421
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,880
And there are two more.

422
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,880
So the second component, that would be the lookup server.

423
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,080
So the lookup server, it knows where you are.

424
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,360
It's actually the global site selector that keeps a database with the node.

425
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,440
But the lookup server knows where you physically are.

426
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,600
It also knows your user sharing ID.

427
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,440
And when you migrate between nodes and your sharing ID changes too, then the lookup server

428
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,600
will keep a list of those so that if somebody connects is looking for an old share ID, then

429
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,880
the lookup server will redirect that to the new one.

430
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,280
So the lookup server is all about sharing.

431
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,960
Even if you would switch between, for example, providers, but I'll get to that a little bit

432
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,920
later, but lookup server is really important also for normal users.

433
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,880
Like this is not only relevant for a hundred million user deployment, but also for smaller

434
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
ones.

435
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
I'll get to that.

436
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,520
So it also stores information about you, like the quality of service metrics, like your

437
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,240
storage and quota settings, your reliability class.

438
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,080
Maybe you want your data replicated at least three times.

439
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,760
Maybe you're a VIP and you need always to be on SSD, stuff like that.

440
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,080
That's all in the lookup server.

441
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Interesting.

442
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,960
And then the third part is the balancer.

443
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,740
And the balancer also runs on a dedicated machine and it monitors all the nodes.

444
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:32,160
So in Nextcloud 10 you might remember we introduced the monitoring app, which gives you either

445
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:38,560
via the web interface or via an API information about the CPU load, the memory load, the number

446
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,040
of shares, the number of users, all this kind of information.

447
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,480
Now this actually fits with the balancer because it takes that data and it keeps track of it.

448
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,120
And when it sees that the node is overloaded, it can actually initiate a migration of user

449
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,840
accounts from one node to another.

450
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,520
Or if it asks the lookup server where a user is, then it says, oh, this user just moved

451
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,200
from the US to Europe, let's migrate the user from the US data center to the Europe data

452
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,340
center and bang, the balancer makes that happen.

453
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,080
Or maybe you need to be moved on SSD because you bought an upgrade from your server provider

454
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,360
and you need faster data transfer.

455
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,560
So the balancer will make sure that you get on SSDs.

456
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,920
So this is the kind of stuff that the balancer does.

457
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,680
That is, that sounds super high end and fancy for enterprises, sounds like it's probably

458
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,120
be amazing for a lot of...

459
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Flexible too, yeah.

460
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Yeah.

461
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,000
And probably very useful for a lot of state installations.

462
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,280
Is there benefits that the home user or smaller, you know, small office user will also glean

463
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
from any of this?

464
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,680
Yeah, so that's a cool thing.

465
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,360
There are a number of elements where this helps normal users.

466
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,560
Now first of all, of course, the ability to migrate between servers, imagine you're at

467
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,260
one service provider and you don't like them.

468
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,120
You can migrate to another with all your data, with everything.

469
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,400
I mean, that's really cool.

470
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,560
This is something we're working on, by the way, I have to give a little caveat here.

471
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,680
So global scale isn't done yet.

472
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,840
We have a couple of pieces.

473
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,680
We have, for example, the lookup server, we have the global site selector, the lookup

474
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,720
server still needs more work, but it's already up and running.

475
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,360
We're using this already.

476
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,000
The balancer still needs to be done.

477
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,040
We've started working on the migration, but at the moment this is only doing the data

478
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
of the users.

479
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
So it's not doing a lot yet.

480
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,120
Josh, speaking of the global server, if I'm, you know, I'm Justin Trudeau and I want to

481
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,280
move the entire Canadian government over to Nextcloud, can I run my own global server?

482
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,480
Or is that something that's only hosted by Nextcloud?

483
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,160
How does that particular part work?

484
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,560
No, this is part of your own installation.

485
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,080
So all these pieces are fully open source.

486
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
They're in our GitHub.

487
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,880
And the idea is that, well, we would probably need to help a customer to set all this stuff

488
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,440
up, especially if you're big like the Canadian government, but you would run all these components

489
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,560
as part of your infrastructure and that would then be one massive Nextcloud system that

490
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,400
consists of nodes in every major city, for example.

491
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,260
So everybody has fast access, but at the same time, you know, it's cheap because you're

492
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,760
on all these small, you know, like two machines or something, you know, we're thinking that

493
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,440
nodes would have two to maybe six machines and that's all commodity hardware.

494
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,000
So that's way cheaper than this really high end storage stuff that you currently need.

495
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,700
So are you guys going to put feelers out with companies to see if they want to become like

496
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,240
a Nextcloud provider?

497
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,120
So there is already like a few dozen Nextcloud providers and some of the bigger ones will

498
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,920
definitely be interested in this.

499
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,520
And this is also something that might be interesting for service providers, like for telephone

500
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,760
providers, for example, telecom, mobile, photo phone, those guys might be interested in this

501
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,200
as well to provide this to their customers.

502
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,160
Because until now, you know, with own cloud and now Nextcloud, you couldn't really do

503
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,160
this because you couldn't get 50 million, 10 million users on a single system, right?

504
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,120
I mean, that wouldn't really work well.

505
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,600
And with global scale, you can actually do this now.

506
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,840
So that's really a nice step forward.

507
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,920
Another nice thing, because you were asking about what this does for home users, another

508
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,880
nice thing is this lookup server, because we already had a lookup server, a more limited

509
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
lookup server.

510
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,000
And the idea of the lookup server was always to allow you to store your federated cloud

511
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,400
ID and maybe some personal data that you choose, for example, your Twitter account, so that

512
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,280
people could look up what your federated cloud ID is, so they can share with you, it's like

513
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,840
an email address, they could look it up on the lookup server.

514
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,600
They say, oh, I know this guy's, you know, I know Chris Lust, that's his Twitter account,

515
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,160
you know, you look it up, and then you get your federated cloud sharing ID, and then

516
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,600
they can share files with you.

517
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
That's cool.

518
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Yeah.

519
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Huh.

520
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,640
So this is all in beta right now, yes?

521
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,280
It's all still kind of...

522
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,640
Yeah, beta is a good term for it.

523
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,280
I mean, we're putting all the pieces together now.

524
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,080
But we want the people to talk about this, to help us test it, you know, to get involved

525
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,800
with this, to give feedback on it.

526
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,680
And the core Nextcloud 12 release is out and solid, sounds like a lot of folks are already

527
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,240
jumping on and doing the upgrade.

528
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,680
Oh, yeah, it's totally, it's really cool, actually.

529
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,760
I tweeted earlier today, you know, it's so nice to see so many people say, like, yeah,

530
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,400
you know, we're upgraded, and it was totally smooth, as I've gotten used to.

531
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
That's great.

532
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,640
Now, you might remember in the old days, it wasn't always like that.

533
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,560
And I haven't seen a single person complain about upgrades yet, except one person was

534
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:37,000
really angry on the forums because an upgrade from beta 1 to beta 2 didn't work well.

535
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,600
Now, I personally take it as a compliment that the only fault you can find is in a pre-release

536
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
version.

537
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,240
You know, so yeah, this is really nice to see that we really managed to get the update

538
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,960
and upgrade issues under control.

539
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,600
I gotta say, I really like seeing, as far as security goes, I like seeing rate limiting

540
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,360
in there, which is kind of nice for developers to be able to specify, like, yeah, certain

541
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,440
rate limits based on IP range and time periods.

542
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,040
And looks like some improvements to two-factor authentication, support for other authentication

543
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,320
mechanisms like OpenID and OAuth 2 and Kerberos.

544
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,960
That's all pretty solid stuff, Joss.

545
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,080
Yeah, it's full of really cool features.

546
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,240
I mean, you have a lot of functions, like the guest app, you know, you can create a

547
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,720
temporary restricted account to a customer or a friend or a partner to share data with.

548
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,240
You have an app that can, well, we're working on a backup app now.

549
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,760
A lot of users will probably be very happy to hear that.

550
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,680
It's Frank himself who started to code that together at the last Hack Week.

551
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,680
Awesome.

552
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,400
So that's really, really cool.

553
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,440
And then we have the Circles app, which is, it's like user defined groups, you know, you

554
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,380
can create your own groups of people that you share with a lot.

555
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,880
And one thing that its developer is already working on is to make it then possible to

556
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,200
also just share your mood, you know, like a status update.

557
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,800
And at that point, then people who would follow you as part of a circle, because people can

558
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,280
join circles and leave circles, they can see status updates.

559
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,840
I mean, you all know where this is going, right?

560
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
That's really cool stuff.

561
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
Huh.

562
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
Interesting.

563
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Interesting.

564
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,840
That'll be something to watch for.

565
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
See where that develops.

566
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,880
Boy, I mean, you guys don't have enough things you're taking on?

567
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
No kidding.

568
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,700
Yeah, the thing is, we have all the pieces already, right?

569
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,040
We have this federation.

570
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,840
This just kind of piggies back on it.

571
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,700
Like with Nexlot 12, one of the little changes to federation that comes together with other

572
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,160
stuff is that we are now federating activities.

573
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:41,080
So if you federate a file, you share a file from one Nexlot server to another server,

574
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,840
and then on the other server it gets changed by the recipient, then you will see that in

575
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,120
your activity feed now.

576
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Oh yeah.

577
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Wow, that's cool.

578
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Yeah.

579
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,720
And once we have this like metadata sharing between servers in place, well, it's completely

580
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
trivial.

581
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,360
It's just a small number of lines of code to also share non-file related events, which

582
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,640
would be like Moot, right?

583
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,980
It's actually quite a simple thing to just inject something else in there.

584
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,960
So we're building this infrastructure and we're just using it.

585
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Yeah.

586
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Yeah.

587
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,640
And actually, as you were talking, I was thinking that very thing, and it just seems to all

588
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
make sense.

589
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,920
It seems like a good direction to go.

590
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,720
And it seems like functionality that will make sharing between Nexcloud servers even

591
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
easier.

592
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,680
Yeah, I mean, Nexcloud is like a core part of the lifeblood of my system.

593
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,260
It could be like the utility of file sharing and collaboration that now different vendors

594
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:37,320
could provide and you as a user could move between, it sounds like, with pretty...

595
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
Yeah.

596
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
So vendor lock-in, right?

597
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Yeah.

598
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
We just kind of kill vendor lock-in with this stuff.

599
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Exactly.

600
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
Yeah.

601
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
Provider lock-in.

602
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
Yeah.

603
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,320
That's really interesting.

604
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
Well...

605
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Yeah, yeah.

606
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,320
This is really quite awesome.

607
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,320
Another thing that I don't want to...

608
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,280
Yeah, I want to make sure we don't miss it, is the audio and video calls, right?

609
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:00,520
We introduced this as kind of a tech preview in 11, and in 12, it's becoming really solid.

610
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,040
We use it now internally for our company calls every week, and it's working really, really

611
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,800
well.

612
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,360
And you can now share your screen, so screen sharing is built in.

613
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,880
That's kind of the one big feature.

614
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,360
But there's one other feature that we're working on, which is already part of the server side,

615
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,200
but it's not yet published in the client, it's coming.

616
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,160
This is push notifications.

617
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:29,280
So on your cloud, you can call somebody, and then they'll actually get that call on their

618
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,160
phone real time as a push notification, so you can actually really use it to replace

619
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,080
WhatsApp or Signal or whatever you're using to call people, right?

620
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,840
It's peer-to-peer, private, yeah, that's all there.

621
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,880
So we're working on integrating that in the clients.

622
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:51,880
And one of the things that we want to do in time is also to federate these calls.

623
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,040
So you have one server, and you can call a user on another server.

624
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,240
Combine it with a lookup server, and suddenly you have a completely decentralized audio-video

625
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,640
call system from Nextcloud servers all over the world.

626
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:09,120
So we've gone from documents and simple files all the way to a full, crazy, enterprise-ready

627
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,120
VoIP system.

628
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
This is a wild ride.

629
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
Yeah, and screen sharing, too.

630
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,120
That's pretty cool.

631
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,240
Yeah, the cool thing is people ask for this, right?

632
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:23,120
I mean, in 2005, 2010, you know, you would share files and have them on multiple servers

633
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,480
or multiple devices, you know, your phone, your desktop.

634
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
That was awesome.

635
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,760
But, you know, if you receive a file from someone, it's shared by them, what's missing

636
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
is context.

637
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,840
You know, normally you would have sent an email and you would say, hey, I need you to

638
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
review this.

639
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,560
But if you share it via Dropbox or Nextcloud, you miss context, so we added commands.

640
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,000
But then, you know, you see in a command that somebody says, well, this file, this is completely

641
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
stupid.

642
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,880
And then you want to call, right?

643
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,600
You don't want to have a whole yelling session in the chat.

644
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,120
That doesn't work.

645
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,960
So we need to be able to call.

646
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,520
And then, you know, you say, okay, let's just make this document right together.

647
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,600
You want to have a collaborative editing solution.

648
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,360
We got that, too.

649
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,760
So this is kind of a natural progression that you start to need all these pieces coming

650
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
together.

651
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Yeah.

652
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,520
Yeah, and you can see some of the areas that we're using other tools, maybe commercial

653
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,480
tools at that, that are getting really popular right now that can do some of this stuff.

654
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,800
But there's not a big gap where if you just add a few more of these things to Nextcloud,

655
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,280
it can do all of the stuff those can do and a lot more.

656
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,280
And it's much, much, much more under user's control.

657
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,920
You could obviously take advantage of the fact that it's open source.

658
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,600
I mean, it's all the stuff with monitoring and the management options.

659
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
Yeah.

660
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
With the recent features, too.

661
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Yeah.

662
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
I mean, what really, really exciting stuff.

663
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Yes.

664
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Thank you for coming on the show.

665
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,440
And hey, my pleasure, guys.

666
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,960
It's always nice to present what we're doing to you guys.

667
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,240
I mean, it's exciting stuff.

668
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,360
And I'm always glad that you guys see it for what it's worth and like it.

669
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,440
So I got to tell you, too, it's obvious you guys are hustling over there, too.

670
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,640
So really, a lot of respect, too, for how hard you guys are working.

671
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,720
If I'm picking up just even half of what you're putting down, it seems like you guys have

672
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,200
got a real vision on something you can go after and something that you're actually already

673
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
executing on.

674
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,200
Yeah.

675
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,520
I mean, they started seven years, seven and a half years ago.

676
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,320
And on one hand, it's the same vision, and on the other hand, it has evolved since then.

677
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
Right?

678
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,920
I mean, it started just to give people a way to control their data.

679
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:35,720
Well, OK, now we add collaboration and communication to it, but it's still the key is the same.

680
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,480
And the approach is the same, right?

681
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:45,080
Super easy to use, super like try to make it reliable first before you add the whole

682
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
kitchen sink to it.

683
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,600
I mean, these things have always been what we did, and then we keep doing that.

684
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
And it's working.

685
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
People love it.

686
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:58,520
It is essentially a visioning of how this technology could be used if it worked out

687
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,120
the way we all wanted it to work out.

688
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,600
Instead of having these things locked off with vendor lock-in and cloud lock-in, it's

689
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
the opposite of that.

690
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,640
It's the ideal version of how we could have done this, and it's really nice to see.

691
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,000
Not only, by the way, is all this technical stuff impressive, but the UI is looking great,

692
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,480
performance is looking great, security is getting better all the time, too.

693
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,520
So it's really kind of just firing on all cylinders.

694
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,360
And guys, check out all of the info about the new release.

695
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,160
We have it all in the show notes, Nextcloud 12.

696
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,840
There's links to blog posts and all of that stuff.

697
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,480
Yos, is there anything else you want to toss in before we roll?

698
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,520
Yeah, somebody on the chat is just pointing out that I should really say something, not

699
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,480
an incur image I just shared.

700
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:46,040
So one big annoyance of a lot of sys admins that would upgrade Nextcloud and before, obviously,

701
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,400
is that you have to re-enable the apps always.

702
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,760
We fixed it.

703
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,320
So if you have PHP 7 and you upgrade your Nextcloud, you don't need to re-enable apps.

704
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,760
Nextcloud will automatically check if they are compatible.

705
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,240
If not, it will try to update them from the app store, and after that, re-enable them

706
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,240
again.

707
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Hallelujah.

708
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,240
Brilliant.

709
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Very nice.

710
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
That's great.

711
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
Yeah.

712
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240
That's those little things that make a big difference.

713
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,360
On the other hand, the fact that this was kind of one of the major issues that people

714
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,920
still had with Nextcloud does tell you how far we've come.

715
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,920
That's true.

716
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
It's a good problem.

717
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
If that's your problem, it's a good one to have.

718
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
All right, thank you.

719
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Thank you, Yos.

720
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
Thank you very, very much.

721
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
Thank you for having me.

722
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,920
Bye, guys.

723
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,920
Have a good show.

724
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,920
Thank you, sir.

725
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,520
We're going to talk a little bit about the magic device tool here in just a moment, and

726
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,920
I couldn't think of a better time to mention Ting.

727
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,540
Two things that would go great together, like peanut butter and jelly, or peanut butter

728
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,680
and chocolate.

729
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,280
Ting is a smarter way to do mobile.

730
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,500
It's how we'd have to do mobile today if we just all of a sudden had mobile service.

731
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,920
If everything was equal and the carriers had to compete fairly.

732
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
You're dreaming.

733
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
I know.

734
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,200
But this is how it would work.

735
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,400
It would be $6 for your line.

736
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,340
You just pay for your line, and then it would just be your usage.

737
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
Just whatever you use.

738
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,440
That's how the market would work.

739
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,320
There'd be no contracts or agreements, no early termination fees.

740
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,400
You just buy the device, you choose if you want CDMA or GSM, and you'd pay for what you

741
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
use.

742
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
That's Ting.

743
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
That's how Ting does it.

744
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
It's a smarter way to do mobile.

745
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,100
One of the things I love about it is there are months where I am antisocial, and I really

746
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,480
do not pay much.

747
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,480
There's some months, maybe like Linux Fest Northwest month.

748
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:31,040
I might have a $45 bill that month, and then the month after that, because I am so done

749
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,920
talking to people, I might have a $20 bill.

750
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,060
It's really nice.

751
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,460
At the end of the year, I end up saving like $2,000 compared to my other service plans

752
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,000
I had before I switched.

753
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's incredible.

754
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,520
Linux.ting.com is where you go to save $25 off a device, or if you have a device that

755
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,120
works with Ting, $25 in service credit.

756
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
What?

757
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:56,600
The average bill is just $23 per line, so if you get $25 in service credit, it's going

758
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,160
to pay for more than your first month of service.

759
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,080
That's crazy, because not only do they have nationwide coverage, no contracts, it's paid

760
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,680
for what you use, and they have a great dashboard, but they also have fantastic customer service

761
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,180
and a great range of devices.

762
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,180
From ones you can bring yourself, pick up from the Play Store, or buy, they even will

763
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,680
help you find one if you contact their customer service.

764
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,640
I got to say, probably the best ever customer service experience I've ever had was when

765
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
I've called Ting.

766
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,480
They also have a little giveaway going on right now.

767
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,840
If you describe your home screen in a haiku, the home screen of your phone, they're doing

768
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,840
a giveaway.

769
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,240
Ting credit, maybe a Moto G5, things like that, you can find out details at the Ting

770
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
blog.

771
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Just do me a favor.

772
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,680
First, go to linux.ting.com, and then head out from there.

773
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
Check it out.

774
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
See how much you might save.

775
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,360
That's such a better way to do mobile.

776
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:53,600
It's really, really, really fantastic for $6 a month to have a couple of GSM or CDMA

777
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,200
lines that you can activate devices for testing.

778
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,060
It's a great way to test devices.

779
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,840
It's a handy way to keep something connected, like say a tablet that you use with your drone

780
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
or something like that.

781
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
I just love it.

782
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,040
It's so handy, all the different ways.

783
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,560
Linux.ting.com, and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

784
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,320
Now, Marius joins us from way over across the world, where he is way, way... Let me

785
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,320
look.

786
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,360
I thought I had the clock up here, but I think it's like 11 o'clock, 11 PM.

787
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
Yikes.

788
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Thanks for staying up.

789
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
Yeah.

790
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
Yeah.

791
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,360
Marius, welcome.

792
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
Is it Marius?

793
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,360
Am I saying your name right?

794
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
Make sure I don't mess it up too long.

795
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
You can say Marius or Marius.

796
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
That's fine.

797
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
Thank you for having me.

798
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
All right.

799
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
All right.

800
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
I'm sure they couldn't make it last week.

801
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
No problem.

802
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
No problem.

803
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,640
It gave me a chance to mess around with Magic Device Tool, which I was pleasantly surprised

804
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,480
to see that all of the dependencies are in the AUR, and it's also a very easy snap to

805
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
install.

806
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,800
And if you have Ubuntu, it's just a couple of app commands away to get all the essential

807
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,080
files and dependencies you need to be able to flash any of the more recent BQ Aquarius

808
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:03,280
devices we've talked about, like the E5 or the M10, the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 7 2013,

809
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,880
Samsung Nexus 10, the OnePlus One, the Fairphone 2, any of these devices.

810
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,000
Of course, I have the Nexus 5.

811
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,080
You have made a tool that essentially makes these devices relevant again.

812
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,680
I mean, it really does.

813
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,560
And I just I wanted to bring you on just for a little bit to talk about how the hell are

814
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,760
you doing this and how can we help you do it more?

815
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,240
So let's start with the first one.

816
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,560
How are you doing this Blackmagic?

817
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,140
How are you hacking my phone and replacing the very secure and safe image on there with

818
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:38,000
Cyanogen or Lineage or Maroo or even that there Ubuntu Touch?

819
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,840
What Blackmagic are you using, sir?

820
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,800
So I have to tell you a bit of a story back then from the history of Magic Device Tool.

821
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,600
When we started it back in or when I started it back in July 2016, I had like all of this,

822
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,820
all of the Ubuntu Touch devices that were out there back in the time.

823
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,720
And yeah, I wanted to make it easy to flash Ubuntu on it.

824
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,960
And but I also was one of the guys who got really annoyed by Ubuntu after a short time

825
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,680
and wanted to get back on the Synergy Mod or on Lineage, no Lineage came later, but still.

826
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,840
And yeah, I was tired of doing all the fastboot and ADB commands and I was like, okay, you're

827
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,840
going to write a script which is going to do all of this automatically.

828
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,760
And then I added a few other devices and then it kind of exploded.

829
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,160
And now I'm sitting here with, let me count, I think over 10 devices sitting on my desk

830
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
at the moment.

831
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,160
All of them are charging.

832
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,320
And I basically after every new release of whatever ROM I have to check if the update

833
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,440
is still working and if it's still compatible with magic device to it.

834
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,800
So it's a constant process.

835
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,600
So I imagine you probably have a few micro USB cables around your house.

836
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Yeah, I would say too many.

837
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,720
Well, it's pretty cool tool.

838
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:54,520
And I kind of wanted to pick your brain a little bit about how people are using it today.

839
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,760
Because it seems to me that I found out about it because I was reading a thread on Lineage

840
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
OS.

841
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,720
I had heard of it obviously before, but it came back up on my radar when I was reading

842
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,240
a thread about Lineage OS.

843
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,040
Seems to me there's a lot of folks that want to use this to flash Lineage OS on their device.

844
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,680
So how is it being used today versus how it was originally envisioned?

845
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,360
Well back when we started it, it was obviously mostly used for flashing Ubuntu on it or

846
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,640
making backups or some of the other functions.

847
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,600
But yeah, thanks to the recent news by Canonical, many of the former Ubuntu people now got back

848
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,600
on the telegram chat and started asking questions about how they could get back on to Lineage

849
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,600
or to AOSP.

850
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:42,920
And yeah, unfortunately I can't really track how many of the watch functions are mostly

851
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
get used.

852
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,320
I can only see the current download numbers from the snap.

853
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,440
But I think it's mostly Lineage OS in the last few months.

854
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,720
So you know, what are the things that I would say if I had my critical hat on is I would

855
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,880
say things like there's only a very small fraction of the user base that's ever going

856
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,560
to want to install Lineage OS or Maru, which also looks very cool, or Ubuntu Touch.

857
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,320
This is just something that only nerds want to do.

858
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,320
Marius, what are your thoughts on that?

859
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,400
And what are your thoughts on sort of working on something that's sort of on the fringe

860
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
like this?

861
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,760
Do you think it's an uphill battle or do you find a purpose in it?

862
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Well, it basically makes my life much easier because sometimes I'm just switching devices

863
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,800
because thanks to the Ubuntu Project I have so many things on my desk and sometime or

864
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,840
someday I just pick up the Nexus 4 or the Nexus 7 and decide that that's going to be

865
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,960
my daily phone or tablet for that week.

866
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,240
Yeah, it's still usable and relevant.

867
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,920
It absolutely is, yeah.

868
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,600
And we've also recently added other ROMs to it like Maru OS and what's it called, Phoenix

869
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,760
OS, which is a bit like Remix OS but for more devices.

870
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,720
And yeah, it's basically just, well, if other people wouldn't say that they're using it

871
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,000
and we just recently passed 10,000 downloads from the Snap Store from Edge Device to it

872
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,640
so people are clearly using it, I also would have just bought it for myself, which is basically

873
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,640
how it started.

874
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,800
Yeah, that's totally understandable.

875
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,380
So I really found it valuable because I'm like, I have this Nexus 5 here.

876
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,120
My kids would love to have another device to play around on.

877
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:25,200
Why not flash it with Lineage or Maru or just play around with Sailfish again?

878
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,400
Make the device totally relevant again and make it usable and the performance is surprisingly

879
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,400
good.

880
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
It's totally usable.

881
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,520
And a lot of these devices you have otherwise, I mean, my mom has a Nexus 5.

882
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,480
She bought it six months ago so it was otherwise brand new still and it works fine for her

883
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,760
but I want her to have some, I might even want to customize it more.

884
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,480
I think also, like you were talking about, sure, there's some niche aspect to this but

885
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,680
this tool really bridges the gap for like, if you were even considering trying it, suddenly

886
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,780
you have to become like kind of an Android expert.

887
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,280
Not so if you have something like this.

888
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,280
That's why I really liked it.

889
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,280
Yeah, it really didn't exist before.

890
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,840
I had no interest in like all the other stuff you'd have to learn but just to try it really

891
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,760
quick on an old Nexus 5 I had sitting around, it was the perfect level of resistance.

892
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,320
It was okay, I could manage to make this work, especially because all the stuff I needed

893
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,320
was in the AUR too.

894
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Yes.

895
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
It made it pretty nice.

896
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,480
Marius, can we talk a little bit about the Snap process?

897
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,320
Is that something you were involved in and what's your impression been so far?

898
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:25,200
Well, I think we've moved, to have to start with, the magic device tool was a few months

899
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,360
before still adjust a batch script which we had to start manually and then I think it

900
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:37,400
was like four months ago, Canonical started promoting the Snapcraft tool.

901
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,000
So basically just this little one command line tool which makes it easy to create your

902
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,200
snaps and to upload them to the store and I was thinking with it for I think one evening

903
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:51,920
and the end result that I got was almost perfectly working and then we refined it and so it's

904
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,920
very easy.

905
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,040
Every change that we are pushing to the Git repository gets automatically picked up by

906
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,160
the Launchpad servers which are then going to build the Snap and then re-uploading them

907
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,000
to the store so I basically just have to commit to the Git repository and then everything

908
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
gets done automatically.

909
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,480
It all just happens after that.

910
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:11,440
That is the way of the future, I swear, that's so great.

911
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:20,720
If I could just interject, what Marius is using, if you go to build.snapcraft.io, you

912
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:28,560
can connect your GitHub repository to our build farm which in turn is connected to the

913
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,560
store.

914
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:36,000
So every time there's a commit in GitHub, the Snap is built on all of the architectures

915
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,080
in the build farm, so that's all of the ARM architectures and all of the Intel architectures

916
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,440
and some of the more exotic ones if you choose them and then gets published into the Edge

917
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:53,080
channel in the store and this is how Rekai hooked up Castor Soundboard to the Snap store.

918
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,080
That is great.

919
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,880
So Castor Soundboard is going to be a Snap.

920
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,880
That's good.

921
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,880
Beautiful.

922
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,880
That is really cool.

923
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,160
And you mentioned earlier, I was listening, you said AIF doesn't play when you were doing

924
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,280
things and you had to convert it in Sound Converter.

925
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:14,720
So I've updated the Snap to add the necessary codecs so AIF works in the Snap.

926
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,720
True gentleman.

927
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,720
A true gentleman.

928
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,720
This is pretty great.

929
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,600
I love seeing this stuff come together as these Snap packages.

930
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,000
There was another, oh yeah, Visual Studio Code was announced this week as a Snap package.

931
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
That's right.

932
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Yes, it was.

933
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So that's this.

934
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,460
It's a pretty interesting range from a very high-end GUI application to a command line

935
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:38,320
tool that will flash a smartphone to a Visual Studio Code editing tool.

936
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,480
Wow, that's a big range.

937
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,880
So Mariusz, where do you go next?

938
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,520
I know one of the top questions people always ask is, what do I got to do to get this XYZ

939
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,520
hardware supported?

940
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,520
Exactly.

941
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,040
So where do you guys go next in terms of the project and in terms of hardware support?

942
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,600
Well, as I said, most of the emails that I'm getting like 10 or 15 emails per day which

943
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:04,800
is like, please support device X and I have to reply, no, it's not meting the requirements

944
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,280
of our guidelines that we have set up.

945
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,960
But still, what we are going to do next is, I definitely have to mention this because

946
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,600
Max was also listening to this live, was just messaging me.

947
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,540
He basically rewrote the whole tool and he's a friend of mine, he's working on a community

948
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:23,200
project that I'm involved with and he basically completely rewrote the magic device tool and

949
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:29,840
the new release that will come out I hope next month will feature a completely QT GUI

950
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,880
so it will no longer be, well, it can still be a command line tool but it will also come

951
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:39,840
with a GUI soon and we will maybe refine the process of how to add new devices and make

952
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:44,660
it a bit more modular so that other people can contribute to it which is already happening

953
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,360
but I think we can do better on that front.

954
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,480
Yeah, it seems like there's more interest now than ever.

955
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,480
Yeah, absolutely.

956
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,760
There you go, and if you guys want to check it out, we have links in the show notes.

957
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,040
If you just Google magic device tool though, it's like the first thing that comes up.

958
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,360
Oh, Wimpy, you wanted to jump in.

959
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,600
Maybe let me plug one thing real quick.

960
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,080
We also have got a Telegram group which is basically an update and support channel and

961
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,480
where you can ask questions and it's magicdevice tool.com slash Telegram.

962
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,480
Oh, easy peasy.

963
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,480
So easy.

964
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,480
Yeah.

965
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,920
Yeah, magicdevice tool.com slash Telegram.

966
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,920
Exactly.

967
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,880
Now, Wimpy, you wanted to jump in on something, go ahead.

968
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,680
I was just looking at the store statistics and I was bowled over.

969
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,480
Do you realize how many installs you've had, Mariusz?

970
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,480
I know.

971
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,280
We've recently passed 10,000 downloads.

972
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,360
Yeah, over 10,000 snap installs.

973
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,360
That's awesome.

974
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,360
I'm one of them.

975
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,320
I have no idea who these people are but I'm glad to have found that the thing that I produce

976
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,320
is useful.

977
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,640
Well, you know, I really think it's just about anybody who's not on Ubuntu that wants magic

978
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,640
device tool.

979
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,360
That could be, yeah.

980
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,480
I think that's really what it is because the first thing I thought of was, well, I could

981
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,640
try getting these, I could try these things in the AUR or I'll just go grab the snap.

982
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,760
And that's what I did.

983
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,880
So I would imagine there's probably a lot of other people there too.

984
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,880
It's super handy.

985
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,880
It really is.

986
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,880
Yeah.

987
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,880
I love it.

988
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,280
Maybe let me add real quick to the point that Wimpy had before.

989
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,760
I'm definitely, I wouldn't consider myself to be a coder or a developer at all.

990
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,200
But still, with the batch scripts and the SnapCraft things that I did behind the scenes

991
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,600
and with the SnapCraft Builders tool that is also up on Git, it was really, really easy

992
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,360
for me to snap it in just one evening or two to make it completely run in like two days.

993
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,840
And definitely for the non-developer kind of you, it's really awesome.

994
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,840
Awesome.

995
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,840
That's a great field report.

996
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,840
Yeah, that is.

997
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,840
Thank you.

998
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,840
Thank you, Mariusz.

999
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,840
Thank you very much.

1000
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,840
Mariusz, I was curious, what's your daily driver?

1001
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
Is it a Linux desktop?

1002
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
Is it Unity?

1003
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,760
Is it an Ubuntu system?

1004
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,760
I'm still on Unity.

1005
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,760
Yeah.

1006
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,760
I'm currently using 16.04.

1007
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,600
Hashtag no judgment here.

1008
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,280
This is a no judgment zone.

1009
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,280
You're welcome to use...

1010
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,280
At least today.

1011
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,280
Yeah.

1012
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,760
I wouldn't call him out, but Terz in the chat room is totally using Windows right now and

1013
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,080
it's no judgment zone.

1014
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,200
You're using Unity.

1015
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,200
Wes over here is using...

1016
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,200
What are you using?

1017
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,200
Budgie?

1018
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,200
I forgot what you're using.

1019
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,640
It was Budgie for a while right now.

1020
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,640
It's Gnome.

1021
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,640
Oh, yeah.

1022
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,640
Okay.

1023
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,640
That's what I'm on too.

1024
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,640
I'm on Gnome.

1025
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,200
I'm on Gnome and I have some thoughts on that, but I want to let Minimac jump in with Mariusz

1026
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,200
before we move on.

1027
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,200
Minimac, go ahead.

1028
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,200
Yeah, Mariusz.

1029
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,640
And do you touch the partitions of the phone when you're flashing the images?

1030
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:16,000
Do you change the partition tables or does it always stay the same?

1031
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,960
Well, I'm technically not changing the partition tables or the formats itself, but sometimes

1032
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,960
I have to...

1033
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,380
If I have to flash, for example, Sailfish on it, then I have to preformat the system

1034
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,440
image, but I'm not changing anything about the partition layouts.

1035
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,640
I'm just formatting the partition itself.

1036
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,640
Okay.

1037
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,640
Thanks.

1038
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,640
So it'll stay the same.

1039
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,640
You're welcome.

1040
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,640
Yeah, that's a great question, Minimac.

1041
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,640
Thank you for asking it.

1042
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,640
All right.

1043
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,340
Well, so Mariusz, keep up the fantastic work.

1044
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:44,020
Thank you for staying up late, and if there's other developments down the road that happened

1045
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:47,960
that you want to share with the class, you are welcome to join our virtual Lug on a Tuesday

1046
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,880
and share with us.

1047
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,120
Or if you just can't sleep that night, we'll be here.

1048
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,120
We'll keep a chair out for you.

1049
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,120
Thanks for having me, guys.

1050
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,120
All right.

1051
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,120
Very good.

1052
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,080
So I do want to talk a little bit about Gnome.

1053
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,080
Not a lot.

1054
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,080
I know.

1055
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,080
I won't...

1056
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,080
You know what?

1057
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,080
I know.

1058
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,080
Just a hint.

1059
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,080
I'm just warning you.

1060
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,080
I'm just warning you.

1061
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,080
I know not all of you are big Gnome fans, so first, let's talk about DigitalOcean.

1062
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,260
Then if you don't want to talk about Gnome, you can leave.

1063
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,520
But first, let me tell you about DigitalOcean, because I know that's really what you tuned

1064
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,520
in for.

1065
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,520
It's what I tuned in for.

1066
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,520
DigitalOcean is my go-to platform now for when I need infrastructure.

1067
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,040
Essentially, if I need a Linux rig and it doesn't need a screen hooked up directly to

1068
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,160
it all the time, I'm pretty much just default DigitalOcean.

1069
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,160
I'm default DO.

1070
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,160
Oh!

1071
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,160
Default DO.

1072
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,160
DigitalOcean.com.

1073
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,160
Go there.

1074
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,160
Create an account.

1075
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,160
So sign up.

1076
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,160
I know I'm asking a lot, but trust me.

1077
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,160
You're going to use it.

1078
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,100
Create an account, and then apply our promo code.

1079
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,320
It's like taking gasoline and putting it on top of your barbecue.

1080
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,040
It makes everything taste better.

1081
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,120
DO Unplugged.

1082
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,400
One word, lowercase, and then it makes that fire go like crazy.

1083
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,600
Plus, it's like a barbecue in the cloud.

1084
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,600
Yeah.

1085
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,600
Yeah.

1086
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,600
Oh, shoot.

1087
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,600
We've got to talk about our barbecue coming up.

1088
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,600
Yeah, that's true.

1089
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,600
I forgot about that, too.

1090
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,600
It's not in the cloud.

1091
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,600
Go back to it.

1092
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,360
No, but first, before we get talking about barbecue, let's talk about cooking in the

1093
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,360
cloud.

1094
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,360
DigitalOcean.com.

1095
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:03,160
Use the promo code DO Unplugged, SSDs throughout so you get really fast disk I.O., 40 gigabit

1096
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,440
e-connections to the hypervisor so your network performance is great.

1097
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,160
Linux is the host operating system, KVM for the virtualizer.

1098
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:17,080
You can do huge rigs, super, super high-end rigs, crazy, crazy, monstrous, monstrous high-end

1099
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:22,600
rigs, rigs that would make 64 kilobytes of RAM Bill Gates' mind explode with the insanity

1100
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,000
in their size.

1101
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,720
And they also have a CDN system built in, monitoring.

1102
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,560
They have been integrating more and more features.

1103
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,880
My favorite one is block storage, and then, like the cherry on top, they have the best

1104
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,680
damn documentation on the web.

1105
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,840
Check it out at DigitalOcean.com, create an account, use our promo code DO Unplugged,

1106
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:46,840
get deployed in seconds, enjoy that SSD performance, work with teams, have a little block storage

1107
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:52,200
when you need a little extra storage, and deploy a pre-built open source application.

1108
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:57,880
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DO Unplugged, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

1109
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,820
the shenanigans that is the Unplugged program.

1110
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,560
So Mr. West, we're almost at 200 episodes of the Unplugged program.

1111
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,560
That is crazy.

1112
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,920
And I've been trying to think of what we should do.

1113
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,920
What should we do?

1114
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,920
What should we do?

1115
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,920
Because I'd love to do something.

1116
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,160
And one thing that turned out, oh, now iQIYI shows up.

1117
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,160
Now iQIYI shows up.

1118
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,160
See how that...

1119
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,160
He heard us talking about him.

1120
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,160
Yeah, that's true.

1121
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,700
But I think there was some sort of transmission delay, because we were talking about his fantastic

1122
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,920
blog post a while ago.

1123
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,920
Anyways...

1124
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,920
The iQIYI signal, it's on the fritz.

1125
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,920
Come on.

1126
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,320
I think there was some fog or something that delayed it.

1127
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:35,840
So I don't know how long ago it was, but we did a barbecue, and Wes showed up.

1128
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,040
And basically, we made out during the bar... No, oh geez, that was somebody else.

1129
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,480
You weren't supposed to say it.

1130
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,480
I know.

1131
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,000
But anyways, Wes showed up for the barbecue, and things just went from there, and now here

1132
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,680
he is doing a show.

1133
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,280
And that was pretty fun.

1134
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,640
I don't think that's going to happen this time, but I still thought we could kind of

1135
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,320
have a tradition where, when the show has milestones, we have a community meetup.

1136
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,320
I love that idea.

1137
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,240
Like, you know, we have these extra chairs here in the studio.

1138
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,320
It's perfect now.

1139
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,120
So even if a couple of... Even if only a couple of people could make it, because it's

1140
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,640
the middle of the weekday, but even if only a couple of people could make it up here in

1141
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,360
Podunk Arlington, they could be sitting in these big, comfy, red chairs, and they could

1142
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,560
be part of our lug right here in the studio doing the show with us.

1143
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,820
That could be just a super awesome way to celebrate 200.

1144
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,200
But I feel like we need to give people a few weeks more heads up.

1145
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,520
Yeah, I think so too.

1146
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:27,780
So we were thinking it's possible around the 4th of July, because we will have an Unplugged

1147
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:30,880
program on the 4th of July.

1148
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,460
And I was planning to go to Montana for the 4th of July, but Noah ruins everything.

1149
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,460
That guy.

1150
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,460
Totally Noah's fault.

1151
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,000
So I think instead we could have a barbecue.

1152
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,240
That might be a lot of fun.

1153
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,840
It's going to be, well, it'll be a few weeks after our 200th episode, but it seems like

1154
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,840
a pretty good opportunity.

1155
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,320
Maybe that's more fair too, because what if 200, what if it goes terribly, or the internet

1156
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,320
dies?

1157
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:57,520
So it's better to have past 200, we've proved that we did it, and then we can all celebrate.

1158
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,760
Yeah, that would be probably the best.

1159
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,000
So that's sort of our tentative plan.

1160
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,480
So there you go, Ike, you got your heads up and I travel out here now.

1161
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,960
All the burgers you can eat.

1162
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,040
No, that's true, yeah.

1163
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,840
But if you do want to come out for our 200th birthday and celebrate on the 4th of July,

1164
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,760
which will be weeks and weeks after, because we're only like two weeks away, it's going

1165
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,720
to be literally a month after our 200th episode, but it'll be fun.

1166
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,480
It seems like because it could be a good chance people might have the day off from work, and

1167
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,280
it turns out my boss never lets me have the day off, so I'll be here, and might as well

1168
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,280
be cooking.

1169
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,280
Yeah, exactly.

1170
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,160
And we could fit a couple people in here, plus we have the TV in the living room hooked

1171
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:43,080
up, so you could watch from the living room, you could watch the show live, and so even

1172
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,880
if you couldn't make, even if you can't fit in the studio, we'd have room for you in the

1173
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:50,380
living room to watch the show, and you basically would get fed by us.

1174
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,380
Seems like a pretty good deal.

1175
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,380
It seems great.

1176
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,440
Seems like a pretty good deal.

1177
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,860
So we'll have more details.

1178
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:58,920
If you would be interested, contact me at ChrisLAS, and we're thinking on the 4th of

1179
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:03,440
July to celebrate the 200th episode of the Unplugged program.

1180
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,160
Yeah, my boss is a bozo.

1181
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,160
That's true.

1182
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,160
Yeah, he's a real jerk.

1183
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,760
He's a real jerk.

1184
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,080
So I wanted to discuss, just with anybody in the Mumble Room that maybe has a little

1185
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:20,560
experience, and I thought maybe I'd start with Wimpy, because I suspect maybe he's played

1186
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,920
around with this, maybe under Matei.

1187
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,960
I'm not really an expert on the plumbing of Gnome.

1188
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:34,240
My basic understanding is you have the Gnome shell, which then uses Mutter in the current

1189
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:40,340
configuration to do essentially the compositing, and Mutter talks to X.

1190
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:45,840
And in the Wayland setup, if I'm understanding this correctly, Mutter takes on more of the

1191
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,680
X server roles.

1192
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,800
It does the mouse tracking, all the stuff that the X server would traditionally do.

1193
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,080
And I don't know where these problems lie, but I've been recently having... I'm going

1194
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,720
to talk more about it on User Air, because I'm doing a deep dive right now.

1195
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:05,200
So tune into User Air this week, where I'm chasing bug reports, and I'm doing all this

1196
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,200
stuff.

1197
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,200
So I'll have a full report later.

1198
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,360
But I've been noticing.

1199
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,620
I wanted to just check in with the virtual log, and I wanted to check in with you, Wes.

1200
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:18,520
Is it just me, or if your system's been up for a couple of weeks, does Gnome 3 start

1201
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,600
to slow down to a crawl over time?

1202
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,040
Has anybody else noticed this?

1203
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:28,560
I have not, but I don't have any systems that are up that long that have a desktop that

1204
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,680
don't get rebooted or suspended.

1205
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,080
So I don't know if I have that exact use case.

1206
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,560
But I've seen it here happen at the studio, so I can definitely confirm that it's happening.

1207
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,560
Yeah.

1208
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,820
Actually, earlier in the show today, we just had Gnome 3 crash on us, and we had to stop

1209
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,800
recording and start again, because we weren't sure if we lost part of the recording.

1210
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,800
That's no good.

1211
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,560
We could lose audio on the stream while Gnome 3 crashed for some reason.

1212
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,680
Wimpy, have you played around at all with benchmarking Gnome or looked at the performance

1213
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,600
of this stuff?

1214
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,200
Not a great deal, no.

1215
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:06,840
I have done some work to integrate MUTTA with MATE to see how that works.

1216
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:15,680
And aside from key bindings not passing through, and what was the other?

1217
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:22,120
The alt-tab and alt-grave implementation just doesn't work the same as you would expect.

1218
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,680
So it works, but I've not done any serious profiling.

1219
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:32,680
I am at the moment doing some power profiling on the different compositors to see what the

1220
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:38,240
additional power draw is on the different compositors, but I have not concluded that

1221
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,240
yet.

1222
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,240
OK.

1223
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,080
Yeah, that's a whole other aspect of it, too, is when you do have a system like this,

1224
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:49,040
what kind of difference do the different compositors make on the CPU or GPU usage and the power

1225
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,040
draw that they have?

1226
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,520
That's a fascinating conversation, probably for a future show.

1227
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,960
This is something I'm wondering about because I did not notice this under Plasma.

1228
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:04,280
So just a little background for those of you who don't catch every episode is for weeks

1229
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,840
and months, essentially since the last release of the Plasma desktop, I've been running the

1230
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,080
Plasma desktop on my main workstation.

1231
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,960
This is a machine that I leave on 24-7.

1232
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,720
I've even recently started leaving the monitors on at lower brightness, so that way I can

1233
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,800
literally just... I walk in the room, I sit down, I start working immediately, and...

1234
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,600
The studio's always on.

1235
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,320
The Plasma desktop never ran into this issue, at least not that I noticed.

1236
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:32,040
I probably never made it more than two months without rebooting, because I usually just

1237
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,260
decide, OK, it's time to get a new kernel.

1238
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:39,720
But I definitely am noticing it within a couple of weeks, really, even a week on GNOME, and

1239
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,360
on all of the machines in the studio that we've switched over to Linux that are running

1240
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,360
GNOME are exhibiting these symptoms.

1241
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,360
Really?

1242
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,920
So it's something I'm trying to dig into.

1243
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,960
It's not just a one-off on one machine.

1244
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,920
I can't swap out mutter, right?

1245
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,920
That's not something I can just... I can't just do that.

1246
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,320
I can't swap out mutter for kwin or something.

1247
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,320
Back in GNOME 2 days, you could do some crazy shit like that, but I don't think you can

1248
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,320
do that with GNOME Shell.

1249
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:06,840
So anyways, if anybody has any more information on it, I would like your help, tweet me at

1250
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:11,640
chrislas or check out the new subreddit, linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

1251
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,040
Sounds like Ikey's got a take on it, too.

1252
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,680
I was reading his take in the chatroom, which is pretty interesting.

1253
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,080
And that's what some of the bug reports that I've been digging into have been saying, too,

1254
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,080
Ikey.

1255
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:24,080
If you want to participate in our chatroom, we do this show live on Tuesdays at 2 p.m.

1256
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,920
over at jblive.tv.

1257
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,200
You can get it converted to your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendars.

1258
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,040
Like Marius there, he has to sit there and do the time math.

1259
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,600
We were chatting about it this morning.

1260
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,800
I got you, Marius says, I hate time zones, and I'm like, I totally know what you mean.

1261
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,800
We solved that already.

1262
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,320
We have these robots on standby at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1263
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,120
It will convert it to your local time.

1264
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,880
If you think you could make the 4th of July work, which I know is a little crazy, but

1265
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,360
if you think you could make it work, let me know.

1266
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,640
I don't know for sure we're going to do it, but I think it's like a 90% lock.

1267
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,200
And if we got a few people saying they'd be down, I mean, you and I are going to be here

1268
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,200
anyways.

1269
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,200
Yeah, we will.

1270
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,040
We should probably, regardless if people show up or not, have that barbecue going on the

1271
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,040
4th of July.

1272
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,360
So I almost feel like it's all lined up perfectly, so we should just do it.

1273
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,360
I think it's a lock.

1274
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,360
I think I'm going to say it's a lock.

1275
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,960
Yeah, if we don't barbecue on the 4th of July, then what are we doing?

1276
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,960
I know.

1277
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,960
I think I'm going to say it's a lock.

1278
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,600
And basically, if you guys want to show up while Wes and I are cooking out and the beard's

1279
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,600
here eating our burgers.

1280
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,600
Then please do.

1281
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:21,600
Yeah, yeah.

1282
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,600
It's one of your few opportunities to see the beard in person doing his thing.

1283
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,600
Yeah.

1284
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,080
Now that means I'll have to tell people how to get here and all that.

1285
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,080
We'll have all that information.

1286
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,080
But yeah, okay.

1287
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,080
All right.

1288
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,080
I think we're going to call it a lock.

1289
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,160
Wimpy, I'll expect you here, of course, obviously, I'm sure you'll fly out.

1290
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,680
Marius, I'm sure you'll fly out.

1291
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,720
Ike, I expect you guys all to make it here.

1292
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,720
Should be no problem.

1293
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,320
I'm sure everybody in the mumble room will just make it.

1294
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,400
I mean, you know, it should be no problem at all.

1295
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,400
What was the date?

1296
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,400
The 4th of July, right?

1297
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,400
America Day.

1298
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,200
Don't you want to come out for America Day?

1299
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,400
No, I might be in the area the week after that.

1300
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,840
You know, Ike, if you make it, we'll have a wet t-shirt contest.

1301
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:54,840
We might...

1302
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,840
Oh, really, Wimpy?

1303
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,840
Which is possible.

1304
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,840
Hmm.

1305
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,840
Well, yeah.

1306
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,960
If you're in the area, let me know, I'd make a trip out to see you.

1307
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,600
If you'd like to make a trip out to see us, go to jupitabroadcasting.com and grab a new

1308
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:11,200
episode, usually Tuesday evenings, Wednesday morning, depending on your neck of the woods.

1309
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,240
Don't forget we have the RSS feeds over there.

1310
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,880
I did mention it, but I'll just say it again, linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

1311
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,040
That's where you go to get involved in the conversation after the show and jupitabroadcasting.com

1312
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,560
slash contact if you want to send us your feedback.

1313
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,800
And Wes, are you ready for me to fire off the end of the show music with Caster Soundboard?

1314
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,200
There it is.

1315
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,200
That's it, right there.

1316
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,200
That's so awesome, dude.

1317
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,200
Now the show's ending.

1318
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,200
You have such power.

1319
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,200
That is incredible.

1320
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,200
And I touched it right there.

1321
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,940
It's a touch screen, and I'm watching it play across Caster Soundboard.

1322
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,200
Now available as a Snap.

1323
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,260
It's amazing.

1324
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,260
So great.

1325
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,720
Listen, we have a new show out, User Air.

1326
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,720
Go check it out.

1327
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,200
And Linux Action News, linuxactionnews.com and User Air at jupitabroadcasting.com.

1328
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,120
Two great shows with more Linux content.

1329
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,440
User Air, a little raunchier.

1330
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,640
It's more for an adult audience.

1331
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,600
Linux Action News, of course, is your hardcore take.

1332
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,600
Super hardcore.

1333
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,600
Really rough.

1334
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,600
So hardcore.

1335
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,600
It's OK.

1336
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,600
No, it's not that at all.

1337
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,600
All right.

1338
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,600
Thank you for joining us.

1339
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,600
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1340
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,600
Say goodbye, Wes.

1341
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,600
Goodbye.

1342
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:32,760
Bye, everybody.

1343
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:55,240
What are the chances that the week that you don't have to record TechSnap, we're done

1344
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,240
super early?

1345
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,240
How does this happen?

1346
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,240
Yeah.

1347
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,040
We got thrown off a little bit, I think, when Dome crashed.

1348
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:09,920
So Ike, we really crapped on how ridiculous it is that you're shipping the plasma desktop

1349
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,280
about how everybody in your project is going to burn out because of the diffusion of resources

1350
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:19,480
and time and the chaotic state that the project must be finding itself in as a result of the

1351
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,560
fragmentation of your desktop focus.

1352
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,560
Did not say any of that.

1353
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,560
Fair question.

1354
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,560
Did not say any of that.

1355
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,560
Did not.

1356
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:29,560
No.

1357
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,560
I actually just think it's really cool.

1358
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,560
And sounds like Peter's a cool dude.

1359
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,560
Yeah.

1360
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,560
That's pretty much what we said.

1361
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,560
Accurate.

1362
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,560
I will confirm.

1363
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:36,560
I don't know, though.

1364
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:41,080
I thought that was pretty good for coming off.

1365
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,640
Let's see what kind of armchair bullshit internet criticism could I come up with if I just randomly

1366
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,640
...

1367
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,640
Let's troll as a service.

1368
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:49,640
Thank you, Mumble Room.

1369
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,640
You guys were great.

1370
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,640
Marius, it was great to speak with you.

1371
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,640
Yeah.

1372
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,640
That was awesome.

1373
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,640
Anytime, Chris.

1374
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,640
Give me your phone, Chris.

1375
01:06:55,640 --> 01:07:00,040
It won't be bricked.

1376
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,040
Just flash away.

1377
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,040
Oh, I'm just kidding.

1378
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,040
I got it.

1379
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,040
See, I got him a little bit.

1380
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:05,040
I got him a little bit.

1381
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,040
That's good.

1382
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,040
All right.

1383
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,040
JBtitles.com.

1384
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,040
JBtitles.

1385
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,040
JBtitles.

1386
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,040
JBtitles.

1387
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:19,040
We covered your blog post about Plasma and all that.

1388
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,040
Plasma.

1389
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,040
Jeez.

1390
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,040
Bitcoin is $2,200 right now.

1391
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,040
$2,200.

1392
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,040
That's crazy.

1393
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:30,880
Did anybody else hear anything about Japan using Bitcoin or something about Japan making

1394
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,880
it more official?

1395
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,880
Yep.

1396
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,880
Yep.

1397
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,880
We're going to talk a little bit about it in user error.

1398
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:35,880
It's a good question.

1399
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:36,880
Sweet.

1400
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,880
Yes.

1401
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,880
Yes.

1402
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:39,880
Yes.

1403
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:40,880
I can't buy things fast enough at the moment.

1404
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,880
The rate that Bitcoin keeps going up in value.

1405
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,440
It's gone up $400 in like six days or something.

1406
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:51,920
Have you had any problem with the transaction fees being too low and your purchases not

1407
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,320
getting verified in time?

1408
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,960
I had a huge problem with that.

1409
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:58,960
I thought I was crazy.

1410
01:07:58,960 --> 01:07:59,960
Yeah.

1411
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,600
I had a problem with it too.

1412
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:09,680
So I'd say half my transactions are Bitcoin transactions and half are transferring Bitcoin

1413
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:14,440
to fiat currency and then using that to fund the purchase.

1414
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:20,720
I had to do like a dollar something fee just to make sure it would go through.

1415
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,720
I tried 50 cents.

1416
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,720
I tried 60 cents.

1417
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,720
I tried 70 cents.

1418
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,880
I did them like, okay, a dollar?

1419
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,880
What the hell?

1420
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,280
It's just I think the network is super busy right now.

1421
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,840
There you go, Ike.

1422
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,520
There you go, boy.

1423
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,520
Is this-

1424
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,520
Yeah.

1425
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,520
What is this?

1426
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,520
Western Union?

1427
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:44,200
Well, someone suggested in the Ubuntu podcast telegram group that how much an effect WannaCry

1428
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:50,840
Bitcoin purchases are having on the price of Bitcoin at the moment, which was an interesting

1429
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:51,840
point of view.

1430
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,840
Ubuntupodcast.org.

1431
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,420
They're still recording, so I'm going to put that in here right now.

1432
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:00,920
After this show is over, what you should do is go get Ubuntupodcast.org.

1433
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:01,920
Right away.

1434
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:07,880
Then download Linux Action News and then download Ask Noah and then download User Air and then

1435
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:26,960
if you're missing Ike, download Late Night Linux.
