WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.160
So this is no joke, Wes.

00:01.160 --> 00:04.680
Did you see that the XKCD form got owned?

00:04.680 --> 00:05.200
A leak?

00:05.200 --> 00:07.600
Oh, watch out.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.640
Watch out, Wes.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.400
It's no good.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.560
I mean, XKCD, the site's OK.

00:13.560 --> 00:17.160
But the user form, which has a pretty sizable amount

00:17.160 --> 00:20.480
of accounts, like 562,000 accounts, was compromised.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.560
Oh, boy, yeah.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.600
Email, IP, and password hashes.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.560
This was pointed out by the one and only Troy Hunt.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.800
And I guess it actually occurred two months back.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.160
Yeah.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.880
You know, happens to all of us.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.160
Happens to the best of us.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.440
They did, of course, have a little comic to go with it.

00:38.440 --> 00:39.880
That's pretty great.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.000
There's a How Hacking Works by XKCD.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.320
Very relevant right now.

00:43.320 --> 00:52.560
Hello, friends, and welcome into Linux Unplugged,

00:52.560 --> 00:53.880
your weekly Linux talk show.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.960
This is episode 317.

00:55.960 --> 00:56.880
My name is Chris.

00:56.880 --> 00:57.680
My name is Wes.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.960
Hello, Wes.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.560
Good to be connected with you from afar.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.680
I'm on the road today.

01:01.680 --> 01:02.760
It's impressive.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.280
But nevertheless, we've got a huge show.

01:05.280 --> 01:05.800
We do.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.160
Actually, I think it's really kind of,

01:08.160 --> 01:10.240
it might be too much show for a remote episode.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.400
We'll find out if we pull it off.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.200
Well, stop messing around, gosh.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.440
Well, you know, Wes, I decided to take a little trip, which

01:16.440 --> 01:18.280
I'll tell you all about here in a little bit.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.440
And it turned out to be very fruitful.

01:20.440 --> 01:23.120
Not only did we get to go hang out with the one and only Wendell

01:23.120 --> 01:25.520
Wilson from Level One Techs, but I just

01:25.520 --> 01:27.320
got back from the Red Hat Tower, too.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.040
So we'll tell you about that and help

01:29.040 --> 01:30.840
us get through all of the community news

01:30.840 --> 01:33.920
and a bunch of big stuff that's launching next week.

01:33.920 --> 01:37.240
Of course, we've got our Mumble Room.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.960
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

01:38.960 --> 01:39.460
Hello.

01:39.460 --> 01:39.960
Hello.

01:39.960 --> 01:40.460
Hello.

01:40.460 --> 01:40.960
Hello.

01:40.960 --> 01:41.460
Hello.

01:41.460 --> 01:41.960
Hello.

01:41.960 --> 01:42.160
Hi.

01:42.160 --> 01:42.660
Oh, hi.

01:42.660 --> 01:44.400
And also, we got Cheesy and Drew here,

01:44.400 --> 01:45.800
helping us break it all down, too.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.680
Hello, gentlemen.

01:46.680 --> 01:47.440
Hey, guys.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.560
Hey, nice to have you there.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.400
Boy, we got a packed Mumble Room today.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
So that's pretty great.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.720
Alex, you're graciously hosting me today,

01:53.720 --> 01:55.160
and you're in the Mumble Room.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.000
That's wonderful.

01:56.000 --> 01:56.500
Yeah.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.000
Howdy.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.120
Howdy over there.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.100
Alex has the ultimate podcast set up right now

02:00.100 --> 02:03.000
because I kicked him out of his office to host him,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.960
and he's rocking it like a pro podcaster

02:05.960 --> 02:07.160
right now on the couch.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.560
Soup's comfortable.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.440
I see how it is.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.280
Now that we've launched self-hosted,

02:11.280 --> 02:13.200
you're like just gone all pro now.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.120
He's got a microphone stand that's designed just

02:16.120 --> 02:17.280
to be right next to him.

02:17.280 --> 02:19.480
He's got this comfortable spot with the dog,

02:19.480 --> 02:22.040
and he's been hosting me since Thursday.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.920
We came down.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.800
I came down from Seattle.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.600
He came and picked me up from the airport,

02:27.600 --> 02:30.120
and it's been quite the adventure.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.040
So we have a lot to talk about today.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.760
But we should probably start with some community news

02:33.760 --> 02:35.640
as we like to do, some big things going on

02:35.640 --> 02:40.600
in the community, starting off with the news around exFAT.

02:40.600 --> 02:43.120
So by now, you've likely heard that Microsoft

02:43.120 --> 02:46.800
has given their blessing for the exFAT file system

02:46.800 --> 02:48.520
to not only land in the Linux kernel,

02:48.520 --> 02:52.360
but to also become part of that wider OIN Linux system

02:52.360 --> 02:52.920
definition.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.320
So it's big news.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.320
And the information has been pretty extensive.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.840
Like, everybody's really covered this.

02:57.840 --> 02:58.920
We got the story down.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.120
But the short version is code's not out,

03:01.120 --> 03:03.080
but it's a policy change.

03:03.080 --> 03:07.080
And surprise, surprise, a driver has existed for quite a while,

03:07.080 --> 03:08.840
although it's proprietary.

03:08.840 --> 03:12.240
But it started popping up in 2013.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.760
That code was never actually released under a free license

03:14.760 --> 03:16.160
because patent issues remained.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.160
So no real serious efforts to upstream it

03:18.160 --> 03:19.760
went into the mainline kernel.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.440
It just never really happened.

03:21.440 --> 03:24.520
But LWN, Jonathan Colbert, has a really good article

03:24.520 --> 03:27.720
that we'll link to that talks about part of the background

03:27.720 --> 03:29.920
here about this kernel driver that's kind of getting

03:29.920 --> 03:30.920
beaten into shape now.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.200
Yeah, that's right.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.720
Way back in July, a developer posted

03:34.720 --> 03:37.640
that he'd transformed the code into something that maybe could

03:37.640 --> 03:40.960
be upstreamed, but didn't know what else needed to happen

03:40.960 --> 03:42.160
to make that possible.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.840
And the ensuing discussion made it clear

03:43.840 --> 03:46.760
that the patent issues were still a showstopper.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.960
And I mean, can you blame them with those things outstanding?

03:49.960 --> 03:52.240
I wouldn't want it in my kernel.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.080
Yeah, right.

03:53.080 --> 03:56.800
Although, they may actually have something out of this, right?

03:56.800 --> 03:58.880
Now that Microsoft's given their blessing,

03:58.880 --> 04:01.080
maybe those patent issues aren't such a big deal.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.920
Maybe we're going to get a driver sooner than later.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.640
Yeah, I mean, it seems like with Greg KH agreeing

04:05.640 --> 04:08.680
that it could be part of the staging tree,

04:08.680 --> 04:11.000
I think it's going to happen one way or another.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.480
Yeah, it has all things a bit of drama around this.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.800
Some people think it's too shoddy of work.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.440
Other people think that they should start over clean.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.800
But it looks like it's headed towards the staging tree,

04:22.800 --> 04:23.960
where it will be tested.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.760
And people will determine if it's usable or not.

04:26.760 --> 04:30.040
It's coming faster than I think we anticipated.

04:30.040 --> 04:30.960
Thank goodness, too.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.280
I mean, I just remember a couple of weeks ago,

04:32.280 --> 04:34.760
you were finding out that this didn't work so well

04:34.760 --> 04:35.400
under Linux.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.880
And maybe all the future Crises out there,

04:37.880 --> 04:39.800
they can just forget about this little problem.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.760
Yeah, you're right.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.600
I popped in my SD card from my Canon camera a couple of weeks

04:43.600 --> 04:46.400
ago, took some pictures from the old Sprint Skis that we had,

04:46.400 --> 04:48.480
and thought, oh, I'll just grab these really quick

04:48.480 --> 04:50.040
and share them with everybody.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.800
And realized that out of the box, my Fedora desktop

04:52.800 --> 04:55.440
could not read an exFAT formatted SD card.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.160
And of course, that's a very, very common format

04:58.160 --> 05:01.320
for external disks and for SD storage on cameras.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.960
Yeah, you know, Chris, Joe and I covered this a little bit

05:03.960 --> 05:06.440
on Linux Action News 121.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.120
That you did.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.160
And as always, thank you for filling in on that.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.080
You're always great, Wes, on Linux Action News.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.120
So check that out.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.120
The guys go into a bit of detail there.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.600
And incidentally, for those of you that don't remember,

05:17.600 --> 05:21.760
in 2014, it was reported that Microsoft makes anywhere

05:21.760 --> 05:27.040
from $5 to $15 per Android device that's

05:27.040 --> 05:28.480
shipped with an exFAT driver.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.320
So that's a huge chunk of change.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.080
That's crazy.

05:32.080 --> 05:32.920
That's crazy.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.440
I know.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.440
It's so much money.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.200
And they say no more further patent litigation is in the works.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.120
They're done with that.

05:39.120 --> 05:39.600
Done.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.840
Woo-hoo.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.480
The Wayland future is near.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.320
And there's some great news coming out

05:44.320 --> 05:46.320
of a Google Summer of Code project

05:46.320 --> 05:49.760
Michael Eberle over on Ferronix has a write-up about Wayland

05:49.760 --> 05:53.520
Pipe, which will provide network-transparent Wayland

05:53.520 --> 05:58.240
proxy for running native Wayland programs or games

05:58.240 --> 06:03.560
over a network similar to x11's x40 over SSH capabilities.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.000
How great is this?

06:05.000 --> 06:09.360
It all started when student developer Manuel Stogel got

06:09.360 --> 06:11.040
paired up with Google Summer of Code

06:11.040 --> 06:12.340
and funded to work on this.

06:12.340 --> 06:14.280
And it's now successfully working

06:14.280 --> 06:16.680
for Wayland games and applications.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.240
You can go give it a try right now if you like.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.760
It also supports some handy features

06:20.760 --> 06:23.500
like compression, multi-threaded optimizations,

06:23.500 --> 06:26.320
and hardware acceleration in some cases.

06:26.320 --> 06:30.160
I have one reaction to this, which is finally.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.600
Yeah, it's one of those things that's kind of outstanding.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.160
Everyone working on Wayland is like, yeah, yeah,

06:34.160 --> 06:34.800
we'll get to it.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.680
We'll solve it.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.600
So far, no one's complained about it too much.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.520
In theory, we can do it.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.560
There's nothing stopping us.

06:39.560 --> 06:40.240
We just haven't.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.200
And I guess, I mean, now that's true.

06:42.200 --> 06:42.960
Yeah.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.760
Yeah, while Google Summer of Code has ended,

06:44.760 --> 06:47.880
the project is going to go on, hopefully.

06:47.880 --> 06:51.080
Some further code cleanup, potentially some refactoring,

06:51.080 --> 06:53.600
some protocol extension.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.920
There's a really, really kind of comprehensive breakdown

06:56.920 --> 06:58.680
we have linked in the show notes.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.320
We'll give you a couple of highlights.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.960
Unlike the original X protocol, only part of the data

07:03.960 --> 07:06.080
is needed to display an application transferred

07:06.080 --> 07:09.000
over the network for the application

07:09.000 --> 07:11.800
because the connection is done at the compositor level.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.560
So large chunks of information can just

07:13.560 --> 07:15.360
be data that the compositor needs

07:15.360 --> 07:18.760
to draw the application and associated file descriptors.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.200
There is side channel information

07:20.200 --> 07:22.480
you could include in there that talks about the position

07:22.480 --> 07:24.840
and all of that kind of information

07:24.840 --> 07:27.920
that the display manager needs to display it on the other end.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.240
They just need a communications channel between them.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.440
And in this case, they can use SSH.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.400
Yeah, Waypipe even includes some handy little wrappers too.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.960
So you can just sort of run Waypipe,

07:36.960 --> 07:38.120
point it at another server.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.280
It'll handle all the little SSH details,

07:40.280 --> 07:42.720
and you just get a remote Wayland connection.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.480
Yeah, that's really nice.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.360
And some of the small tweaking is

07:47.360 --> 07:51.400
done to just sort of make things a little more network

07:51.400 --> 07:52.320
transportable.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.440
For instance, they'll strip out certain kinds

07:54.440 --> 07:56.920
of advertising capability messages

07:56.920 --> 07:59.320
that will often be associated with graphics cards

07:59.320 --> 08:02.080
or whatnot that advertise what their capabilities are.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.760
Instead, that can be done once, and then it

08:03.760 --> 08:06.160
can be edited out from the transmission over the network.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.480
Yeah, the developer has a very impressive and detailed blog

08:09.480 --> 08:11.360
post up that we'll have linked in the show notes.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.360
Yeah, check it out.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.600
Linuxunplugged.com slash 317.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.600
I'm really, really hopeful about this

08:17.600 --> 08:20.160
while it was a Google Summer of Code project, which,

08:20.160 --> 08:22.840
side note, some really good stuff coming out of Google

08:22.840 --> 08:24.080
Summer of Code this year.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.600
Anyways, Waypipe also supports a bunch of quality of life

08:27.600 --> 08:29.840
features, including, like Wes said,

08:29.840 --> 08:32.760
that wrapper, hardware accelerated video encoding,

08:32.760 --> 08:35.880
awesome, transfer compression, and a method

08:35.880 --> 08:38.120
to reconnect to applications if your connection,

08:38.120 --> 08:40.480
like your SSH connection, drops.

08:40.480 --> 08:44.800
It'll support reconnecting and resuming the applications.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.600
Really excited about this.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.720
And of course, it can proxy programs

08:48.720 --> 08:50.520
that render images using OpenGL.

08:50.520 --> 08:53.640
So like we mentioned, there is a capability here

08:53.640 --> 08:56.040
that you could even stream something

08:56.040 --> 08:59.400
as complex as a game over the network with reasonable results

08:59.400 --> 09:01.200
if your bandwidth is sufficient.

09:01.200 --> 09:01.960
That's crazy.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.160
Doesn't this really kind of solve

09:03.160 --> 09:05.080
the number one concern people usually

09:05.080 --> 09:07.920
bring up about switching to Wayland is X11 forwarding?

09:07.920 --> 09:09.120
Yeah, we're getting there.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.360
More and more of these just keep getting knocked down,

09:11.360 --> 09:13.520
sometimes surprisingly quickly, like in this case.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.480
And before long, well, the Wayland future will be here.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.360
The only one left now is NVIDIA, right?

09:18.360 --> 09:19.360
Yeah.

09:19.360 --> 09:23.200
I mean, I know there's initial work on that.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.280
Yeah, that stings.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.520
That does sting.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.880
Because I've been rocking Wayland still.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.360
Since that weekend with Wayland, I

09:29.360 --> 09:31.880
haven't gone back on my ThinkPad.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.360
I'm still using it.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.440
I'm hooked on the Smooth.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.800
Once I see it, I can't go back.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.400
We talked to Wendell about that, too, a little bit.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.200
We'll get to that.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.840
But let's talk about something huge happening next week.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.360
A major version of Gnome Shell, I'm sorry,

09:47.360 --> 09:51.600
Gnome Shell is coming out, Gnome Shell 3.34.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.600
And Joey over at OMG Ubuntu has a write-up of some of the top

09:55.600 --> 09:56.740
things that are in there.

09:56.740 --> 09:58.400
But we'll just cover a couple of these.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.400
And then we're going to go deep on some performance work that

10:01.400 --> 10:02.800
really moves the needle.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.440
But from a general user improvement,

10:06.440 --> 10:09.720
there's a few things in here that are nice in Gnome 3.4,

10:09.720 --> 10:12.600
which is scheduled to land next Tuesday,

10:12.600 --> 10:15.200
should everything go as planned.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.920
Now, the new version makes it much easier

10:16.920 --> 10:19.720
to create app folders in that application overview.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.080
Right there, when you have all of the apps that come up,

10:22.080 --> 10:24.600
you can now, from in there, kind of like on a mobile device,

10:24.600 --> 10:26.360
you can drag icons on top of each other.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.360
It creates a folder.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.480
It makes it nice to organize that.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.440
And then, like in the Ubuntu doc, I believe,

10:31.440 --> 10:34.280
haven't tested this yet, but I believe those folders will then

10:34.280 --> 10:36.520
also work in the doc, which I think

10:36.520 --> 10:37.760
that's a really cool thing.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.280
Oh, that's very nice.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.520
It's also much easier to preview backgrounds.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.000
You don't actually have to set them, you know?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.120
You can also set an image as the desktop background,

10:46.120 --> 10:49.600
lock screen background, or both with the handy new popover

10:49.600 --> 10:50.360
menu.

10:50.360 --> 10:53.080
And you're no longer limited to picking a wallpaper

10:53.080 --> 10:56.120
from the top level JPEG folders in your pictures folder.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.600
Just click the Add Picture button

10:57.600 --> 10:59.980
and pick a file anywhere on your system.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.560
I mean, come on, about time.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.680
Hallelujah.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.120
It's truly 2019.

11:04.120 --> 11:07.240
I can now choose my own pictures folder, which is nice,

11:07.240 --> 11:09.660
because I like to organize my pictures folder.

11:09.660 --> 11:11.120
I don't like having everything just

11:11.120 --> 11:13.200
in the root of my freaking pictures folder.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.800
So I am surprisingly stoked about this feature.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.400
Well, another thing you might like

11:17.400 --> 11:21.400
is an improved Sysprof tool for profiling your system.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.360
It's got a redesigned UI, new data sources,

11:24.360 --> 11:27.680
and integration with core GNOME platform libraries,

11:27.680 --> 11:29.520
including GTK and Mudder.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.400
So maybe now you can measure just how smooth it is.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.720
Joey's got a killer screenshot of this.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.760
Like, this looks like a real tool, doesn't it?

11:36.760 --> 11:39.400
Yeah, I mean, if I didn't already have NetData,

11:39.400 --> 11:41.280
I might really, really want this.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.320
Hmm, hmm, yeah.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.280
No, actually, the deep hooks right into GNOME,

11:45.280 --> 11:46.480
this seems like super handy.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.480
It wasn't as useful before, but now I

11:48.480 --> 11:50.880
think I'll definitely be using it on systems that have GNOME.

11:50.880 --> 11:51.840
Yeah.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.760
I am also delighted to see improvements

11:53.760 --> 11:55.240
coming to GNOME boxes.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.580
That's the virtual and remote machine manager.

11:57.580 --> 12:00.440
Some nice changes in the 3.34 release.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.000
For instance, the new Box Assistant

12:03.000 --> 12:05.880
has an improved workflow to make it super quick

12:05.880 --> 12:08.640
to get machines up and running.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.880
And there's a new option.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.760
I don't know what this is, Alex, but it's

12:11.760 --> 12:14.060
called the 3D acceleration.

12:14.060 --> 12:16.160
Is it now optional setting?

12:16.160 --> 12:18.960
Do you think they're talking about pass-through?

12:18.960 --> 12:20.640
I don't know.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.600
VirtualBox has had a 3D acceleration thing for a while.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.680
Maybe it's related to that, but we can hope.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.520
Could just be a different kind of driver.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.520
I think it's more likely related to VertIO 3D

12:30.520 --> 12:35.000
acceleration, which is available for some Linux distributions.

12:35.000 --> 12:35.640
Right.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.680
That would make sense.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.480
I feel like GNOME boxes would be the perfect project

12:40.480 --> 12:44.400
to make a PCI pass through a couple of checkboxes

12:44.400 --> 12:47.420
and a dropdown to choose the PCI device you want to pass through.

12:47.420 --> 12:50.160
It would unleash so much virtualization power.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.460
It's a whole new level, right?

12:51.460 --> 12:54.000
Like, that would actually be very accessible to people in a way

12:54.000 --> 12:55.240
that it's just not right now.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.360
Yeah, yeah.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.680
Well, there is some good news.

12:57.680 --> 13:02.000
There is an open issue for that on the GNOME GitLab.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.320
Yeah, maybe it'll result in something.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.680
That would be wonderful.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.000
We've seen a lot of performance improvements

13:08.000 --> 13:11.120
landing in the most current releases of GNOME.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.840
Talk about a great meme, because the meme is now like, oh, yeah,

13:13.840 --> 13:16.480
every release has performance improvements.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.060
This one, though, is so significant.

13:18.060 --> 13:19.760
We're seeing last-minute inclusion,

13:19.760 --> 13:21.200
although it's been tested.

13:21.200 --> 13:25.120
But GNOME 3.4 is expected to release in just a few days

13:25.120 --> 13:25.880
as we record this.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.240
So squeezing this mutterfix in at the last moment

13:28.240 --> 13:29.160
is a big deal.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.480
And it has a big impact for those

13:31.480 --> 13:35.960
that are running GNOME on X11 with the NVIDIA proprietary

13:35.960 --> 13:36.920
graphics driver.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.000
Yeah, that's right.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.160
Canonical's been hard at work, in particular,

13:40.160 --> 13:41.960
Daniel von Wut over there.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.160
And you may know him from his many GNOME performance

13:45.160 --> 13:47.840
optimizations that we're very happy with.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.840
Well, over the past two years, he's

13:49.840 --> 13:53.480
been toying with a particular NVIDIA fix.

13:53.480 --> 13:57.280
It's basically the removal of GLX-threaded swap weight

13:57.280 --> 14:00.200
handling for the NVIDIA binary driver.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.280
And it ended up stalling both the CPU and the GPU.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.160
And it's just not serving its intended performance use cases

14:06.160 --> 14:08.640
with the current state of mutters code.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.960
The issue it was originally designed to address

14:10.960 --> 14:13.280
around unthrottled rendering, well, that's

14:13.280 --> 14:15.160
just been addressed in a separate patch

14:15.160 --> 14:17.600
and done in a different way earlier this summer.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.520
So just in time for 3.34.

14:20.520 --> 14:21.900
If you've been fighting with this,

14:21.900 --> 14:25.440
if you've noticed that you're an NVIDIA binary user, hey,

14:25.440 --> 14:27.520
it's a great time to be using GNOME.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.060
Yeah, and that's not the only performance

14:30.060 --> 14:33.600
fix that came from Canonical's Daniel von Wut.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.880
We've got to get him on the show,

14:34.880 --> 14:38.400
because he has done the people's work recently.

14:38.400 --> 14:42.120
He's also landed another fix that

14:42.120 --> 14:44.360
will be performance improving for everyone

14:44.360 --> 14:45.720
that has a mouse cursor.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.880
So if you use GNOME Shell with a mouse,

14:47.880 --> 14:49.920
this performance improvement applies to you.

14:49.920 --> 14:50.400
That's me.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.640
That's me.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.480
It also has a fun name, geometric picking.

14:55.480 --> 14:59.080
And yeah, it's about cursor movement and avoiding OpenGL

14:59.080 --> 15:02.800
or using the GPU for color picking operations.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.680
That logic is now being done on the CPU without OpenGL,

15:05.680 --> 15:08.400
but it turns out it's actually more efficient this way

15:08.400 --> 15:11.720
and is able to cause a measurable drop in CPU usage

15:11.720 --> 15:13.480
when moving the mouse.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.880
And I don't want something that simple to be taxed on my system.

15:16.880 --> 15:23.000
So by not using the GPU, they're saving CPU cycles.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.600
You know, I imagine they were shuffling data off over

15:25.600 --> 15:26.960
to the GPU in this case.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.240
And if it's faster to just do it with the CPU,

15:29.240 --> 15:31.080
then bother to go out, get the data,

15:31.080 --> 15:32.660
send it to the GPU, and bring it back.

15:32.660 --> 15:34.160
Well, that might be a win.

15:34.160 --> 15:34.840
I guess so.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.320
I guess so.

15:36.320 --> 15:40.320
They write on the bug tracker, this new approach also

15:40.320 --> 15:43.120
dramatically reduces the number of picking paint cycles

15:43.120 --> 15:46.240
required for cursor movements since the pickability

15:46.240 --> 15:49.600
of an entire screen is calculated and cached.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.360
That's smart.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.280
Interesting.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.640
Stuff like this is so, so great.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.960
So these are like core infrastructure things

15:55.960 --> 15:57.560
that we need to see improved in Gnome.

15:57.560 --> 15:58.360
It's interesting too, right?

15:58.360 --> 15:59.780
This is kind of exactly the stuff

15:59.780 --> 16:03.000
we were hoping for when Canonical adopted Gnome

16:03.000 --> 16:04.120
as their default desktop.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.360
And it's really been coming true.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.580
100%, 100% true.

16:08.580 --> 16:09.600
Good point.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.120
And kind of along these same lines,

16:11.120 --> 16:14.560
Gwadek just wrapped up the Gnome conference.

16:14.560 --> 16:18.040
And Cassidy, who is, is it the Chief Experience Officer?

16:18.040 --> 16:19.620
Cassidy, is that what the X stands for?

16:19.620 --> 16:20.680
He's joining us today.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.400
Yeah.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.160
Hello, Cassidy.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.200
Thank you for being here.

16:23.200 --> 16:27.320
You had a talk on the need for a free desktop dark style

16:27.320 --> 16:28.400
preference.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.020
Now, you're not in this talk.

16:30.020 --> 16:33.200
You're not advocating dark style, dark theme,

16:33.200 --> 16:34.840
all the things.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.840
But what you are saying is, hey, maybe dark theming

16:37.840 --> 16:39.920
is an accessibility thing.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.920
Yeah, basically over the last year,

16:42.920 --> 16:46.120
we've seen all these other platforms adopting dark styles.

16:46.120 --> 16:49.440
And they've done it in a really similar way.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.280
And so I've been kind of watching this happen.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.760
And I've been listening to developers and users

16:53.760 --> 16:56.800
talk about the issues with dark styles.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.240
And so this proposal is basically a way

16:59.240 --> 17:01.560
that we could support this on free desktop OSes,

17:01.560 --> 17:07.000
like Gnome-based OSes, or KDE-based, or elementary OS.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.320
But in a way that's easy for developers to implement

17:09.320 --> 17:11.480
and doesn't really break everything.

17:11.480 --> 17:12.760
Yeah, you had a great example.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.920
You'll have a link to your video in there.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.720
You talk about, well, what if that one day you're

17:17.720 --> 17:20.260
in a dark conference room, and you want to take notes,

17:20.260 --> 17:23.020
and you want to flip your screen over to dark mode for that day?

17:23.020 --> 17:24.960
Or what if you're starting to have a headache come on,

17:24.960 --> 17:26.520
and you've got to finish something up,

17:26.520 --> 17:28.020
and you just want to flip your system

17:28.020 --> 17:29.840
to dark mode for a little bit?

17:29.840 --> 17:32.360
And then there's also the overwhelming evidence

17:32.360 --> 17:35.920
that all of the other desktop and mobile vendors

17:35.920 --> 17:38.520
are implementing dark mode support,

17:38.520 --> 17:39.640
and including web browsers.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.300
So it's here, really.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.100
And we don't want to be necessarily left out.

17:43.100 --> 17:46.960
But you're not saying everybody go off and do it your own way.

17:46.960 --> 17:49.480
You're saying we should come up with a free desktop.org

17:49.480 --> 17:50.520
standard.

17:50.520 --> 17:54.040
However, you are saying it in a time

17:54.040 --> 17:57.000
when there's a bit of pushback on theming in general.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.360
So I'm curious, how's it being received?

17:59.360 --> 18:02.560
How did the bird of the feather session go afterwards?

18:02.560 --> 18:04.840
How's the overall reception to this idea

18:04.840 --> 18:06.800
that we should accommodate this?

18:06.800 --> 18:09.080
So the BoF, the birds of a feather session,

18:09.080 --> 18:11.640
actually went really well.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.520
It seems like about a year ago, when I first

18:13.520 --> 18:16.120
started bringing this idea up, there was a lot of pushback.

18:16.120 --> 18:20.440
Because this idea of ripping the style sheet out

18:20.440 --> 18:24.280
from under apps and putting a different theme on them,

18:24.280 --> 18:26.720
there was a lot of pushback from app developers.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.440
But when we talk about it from doing it at a specification

18:29.440 --> 18:33.000
level where it's expected, an expected feature

18:33.000 --> 18:35.320
of the platform, and when other platforms are doing it

18:35.320 --> 18:38.800
in a really similar way, it seems like the conversation

18:38.800 --> 18:39.300
shifted.

18:39.300 --> 18:44.280
And people are just kind of like, yeah, let's just do it.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.440
And what was cool is we actually combined the birds

18:46.440 --> 18:49.480
of a feather session with the GTK one,

18:49.480 --> 18:51.160
because there wasn't actually that much

18:51.160 --> 18:54.880
to discuss in our separate one for the dark style.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.400
And that meant we got the insight

18:56.400 --> 18:59.600
of very experienced GTK developers,

18:59.600 --> 19:02.200
and we got a whole room of a few dozen people

19:02.200 --> 19:05.720
to kind of think about this and think about a way forward.

19:05.720 --> 19:09.280
So there's already work going into GTK 4 to help support

19:09.280 --> 19:11.000
this, some new APIs.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.280
So it's exciting to see it already moving forward.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.400
I also noted, and I'm not sure if this was a product of Guadec

19:17.400 --> 19:19.200
or if it just happened around the same time,

19:19.200 --> 19:22.920
but it seems like there's been some kind of agreement

19:22.920 --> 19:25.120
that vendor themes are going to stick around,

19:25.120 --> 19:28.000
and now we need to figure out how to properly do them.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.880
Did you see this?

19:28.880 --> 19:31.760
Yeah, and I was actually involved quite a bit in this.

19:31.760 --> 19:35.200
It's actually all intertwined with the different style

19:35.200 --> 19:39.000
sheets that are user style sheets, dark styles,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.440
and then downstream vendors like Ubuntu or Pop!

19:42.440 --> 19:46.200
OS, or even elementary to a certain degree.

19:46.200 --> 19:50.040
We're going to exist forever, and there's

19:50.040 --> 19:53.560
different arguments from different camps of we really

19:53.560 --> 19:56.680
think that the system should have a certain style that

19:56.680 --> 19:59.920
matches our hardware and fits in with our brand.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.000
And I think a year ago, again, we

20:02.000 --> 20:03.540
had that whole theming discussion,

20:03.540 --> 20:05.840
and then this year, it's a little bit

20:05.840 --> 20:07.600
of a more mature discussion, I think,

20:07.600 --> 20:11.400
about it of, OK, we've kind of heard the extremes.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.320
Let's come to the middle and agree on something

20:14.320 --> 20:16.320
on some way forward.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.420
And so basically, the way we're moving forward,

20:18.420 --> 20:26.240
it seems like within Gnome, is a more publicized and supported

20:26.240 --> 20:31.720
styling API, I guess, with publicly exposed CSS variables

20:31.720 --> 20:35.320
in the GTK style sheet so that app developers can

20:35.320 --> 20:38.040
use semantic variables or variables that

20:38.040 --> 20:40.680
are guaranteed to be supported.

20:40.680 --> 20:43.600
And then themes like Pop!

20:43.600 --> 20:47.200
OS or Ubuntu, they can actually make

20:47.200 --> 20:50.040
sure they support those different variables as well.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.160
So it's kind of an in-between of it's not

20:52.160 --> 20:54.320
ripping the entire style sheet out from under apps.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.640
It's more like, hey, it's compatible

20:56.640 --> 20:57.960
with these different variables.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.160
And so I think we'll see some really interesting things

21:00.160 --> 21:03.200
in Yaru moving forward and in Pop! OS

21:03.200 --> 21:04.600
moving forward with this.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.960
It's essentially letting the applications know, hey,

21:06.960 --> 21:08.360
I'm set up to display this way.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.320
I look this way right now.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.540
And they can choose to implement that or not.

21:12.540 --> 21:14.000
And if they do, they can implement it

21:14.000 --> 21:16.120
in a way that they know is consistent with their UI

21:16.120 --> 21:16.720
design.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.420
Yeah, and it's from multiple angles, too.

21:18.420 --> 21:22.120
So it's like, applications can say,

21:22.120 --> 21:25.280
can use those variables to create custom styled widgets.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.720
But then the vendors themselves can use those variables

21:28.720 --> 21:31.600
to create their own style sheet that's compatible with Adueda.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.920
So you get less breakage.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.640
Adueda is how you're supposed to say it?

21:34.640 --> 21:36.920
Oh, man, I've been way off.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.080
I have no idea if that's how you're supposed to say it.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.080
That's just how I say it.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.040
So no one knows.

21:41.040 --> 21:41.520
Wow.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.160
You've probably been around people pronouncing it.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.600
So you probably got it close.

21:44.600 --> 21:45.680
I say Aduadia.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.080
So what do I know?

21:48.080 --> 21:50.560
It might be like Advaita or something.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.200
I don't know.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.000
Could we just go with gnome theme?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.840
The built-in, yeah, the shell theme.

21:54.840 --> 21:58.160
Of course, then we'll debate on how you say gnome or gnome.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.000
Exactly.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.240
And there's varying ideas there, too.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.640
There's no winning.

22:03.640 --> 22:04.840
Well, good talk.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.160
Everybody on the team watched it.

22:06.160 --> 22:06.760
We liked it.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.080
We have it linked in the show notes.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.720
I think it's a great approach to this.

22:09.720 --> 22:13.160
I'm obviously, I skew on the side of dark theming

22:13.160 --> 22:15.920
all of the things, because I just

22:15.920 --> 22:18.520
find it a strain on my eyes after about five, six hours

22:18.520 --> 22:20.800
of using the computer to have everything so bright.

22:20.800 --> 22:21.800
But I don't want to go overboard.

22:21.800 --> 22:22.920
And I really like the balance you're

22:22.920 --> 22:23.960
striking with it, Cassidy.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.360
I think you really have a great approach.

22:26.360 --> 22:29.720
And I'm willing to bet that's going to translate into pretty

22:29.720 --> 22:31.080
good support in elementary OS.

22:31.080 --> 22:34.400
So some of these things you're talking about in your talk,

22:34.400 --> 22:37.000
are you moving ahead with them in elementary OS?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.560
We're kind of waiting to see.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.920
So the way Free Desktop works is they really

22:41.920 --> 22:44.800
like to have two independent implementations

22:44.800 --> 22:46.680
before they call it a Free Desktop spec.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.760
Because otherwise, it's just only one project

22:49.760 --> 22:51.800
just kind of pushing Free Desktop.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.640
So I think we're going to wait to see how it's done in GTK

22:54.640 --> 22:58.400
specifically and engage the developers there.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.120
And then we'll help expose it in elementary OS

23:01.120 --> 23:05.280
and work with Gnome as well to help expose it.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.360
So I think the elementary implementation in Gnome

23:07.360 --> 23:09.840
counts as two separate implementations.

23:09.840 --> 23:12.400
And then we'll work on officially standardizing

23:12.400 --> 23:13.080
the spec.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.640
Really curious to see where this goes.

23:14.640 --> 23:18.000
I like that it seems like it's, like you said, it's been a year.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.280
So it's not happening super fast.

23:20.280 --> 23:23.200
But at the same time, it feels like if it does happen,

23:23.200 --> 23:24.240
it'll be really set.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.280
And it'll stick.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.440
And that's a rarity.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.520
So that's really good to see.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.800
So keep up the good work, sir.

23:28.800 --> 23:29.560
Thank you.

23:29.560 --> 23:30.560
Thank you.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.280
And thank you for stopping by.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.760
Mr. Payne, what do you say?

23:33.760 --> 23:35.760
Should we sashay into the housekeeping?

23:35.760 --> 23:38.880
Oh, yes, we must.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.640
All right, well, let's kick off the housekeeping this week

23:41.640 --> 23:43.120
with announcements.

23:43.120 --> 23:47.600
September's free courses for the Linux Academy community

23:47.600 --> 23:49.400
members is now available.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.400
Couple of things that Al has cranked the free handle on

23:52.400 --> 23:54.120
that caught my attention.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.840
The Microsoft SQL Server on Linux Quick Start guide.

23:56.840 --> 23:57.360
Heck, yeah.

23:57.360 --> 23:58.560
Oh, yeah, right.

23:58.560 --> 24:01.520
Maybe you're interested in self-hosting something

24:01.520 --> 24:02.480
like Bitwarden.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.520
That seems like a great guide.

24:04.520 --> 24:05.600
Exactly.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.960
Network routing fundamentals.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.480
You want to get your wire guard on?

24:08.480 --> 24:10.040
You're going to need to know that one.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.240
And along those same lines, Linux networking

24:12.240 --> 24:13.360
and troubleshooting.

24:13.360 --> 24:16.720
And a Git, Quick Start, and core OS essentials,

24:16.720 --> 24:18.240
plus a lot more.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.040
All free now for Linux community members

24:20.040 --> 24:21.160
for the month of September.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.480
You just go create an account.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.280
Get a community member account, and then

24:24.280 --> 24:27.600
you can go take that Mastering System D class too.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.720
That's a good one there, Al.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.120
You got a good list this month.

24:30.120 --> 24:30.640
Thanks.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.520
I'm really hoping to help people kind of get their journey

24:33.520 --> 24:35.000
into Linux Kickstarted.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.200
Now, speaking of journeys, let's talk about Texas Cyber Summit.

24:39.200 --> 24:43.400
We have the Be New track, which sounds pretty killer.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.680
We've got a birthday party.

24:44.680 --> 24:48.560
So where do you want to start with the Texas Cyber Summit?

24:48.560 --> 24:52.040
I think I'd like to kick off with the Be New track.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.960
And the concept is really what I've been,

24:54.960 --> 24:56.480
I'm going to say preaching, because I

24:56.480 --> 24:58.240
think I get on my high horse every once

24:58.240 --> 25:00.880
in a while about tackling new things

25:00.880 --> 25:02.760
and not being afraid of it.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.600
The number one feedback that I get to people

25:04.600 --> 25:06.680
where they don't go to conferences is they say,

25:06.680 --> 25:07.760
well, I'm not ready yet.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.920
I'm not at that part of my career.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.960
And I can't stress enough that at the time

25:12.960 --> 25:16.200
that you are starting out, that you're looking to find something

25:16.200 --> 25:18.360
new or looking to get into the tech sector,

25:18.360 --> 25:21.320
that's the perfect time to start going to conferences.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.160
Because you can learn more than just what you can see in a book

25:24.160 --> 25:25.480
or what you can see in a forum.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.440
You can see what people are actually doing with the tech.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.160
So we've built a whole track around, hey,

25:31.160 --> 25:32.280
you want to learn Docker?

25:32.280 --> 25:32.760
Cool.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.120
Let's do it with not just doing DevOps,

25:35.120 --> 25:37.120
but let's learn it with DevSecOps.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.440
Let's put security first and foremost in your learning

25:40.440 --> 25:41.640
process.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.320
You've heard about capturing the flag,

25:43.320 --> 25:45.680
but you don't feel you know enough to do it?

25:45.680 --> 25:47.320
Then come to our Capture the Flag.

25:47.320 --> 25:50.240
Purvey.com has decided to sponsor that for us.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.480
And they will have mentors at the table teaching you

25:53.480 --> 25:55.160
not just how to capture that flag,

25:55.160 --> 25:56.680
but what your thought process should

25:56.680 --> 26:00.400
be when you're actually approaching password cracking

26:00.400 --> 26:03.480
or whatever it is that you have to do to be

26:03.480 --> 26:04.680
able to capture that flag.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.120
So I'm really excited.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.440
Yeah, that seems like the most valuable part is you're

26:08.440 --> 26:09.720
learning how to think, too.

26:09.720 --> 26:12.120
So then you can take that, and you can apply that

26:12.120 --> 26:13.600
to future situations.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.000
And if you understand that kind of stuff, you're employable.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.480
Because technology is always changing.

26:17.480 --> 26:18.640
There's always more to learn.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.800
It's about learning how to think about the problem.

26:20.800 --> 26:23.120
I think the major thing that people can walk away with

26:23.120 --> 26:25.080
is not just being able to say, hey, I

26:25.080 --> 26:27.400
went to this conference, but to say,

26:27.400 --> 26:30.320
hey, I went to this conference, I participated in the event,

26:30.320 --> 26:33.120
and I hands-on was able to build X,

26:33.120 --> 26:35.720
or I was able to win this competition.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.840
That's something that you can put on a resume,

26:37.840 --> 26:40.600
because it shows practical hands-on knowledge.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.280
Now, Texas Cyber Summit is coming up.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.920
It's just around the corner.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.520
So I want to get you the dates, because the crew's going.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.960
A lot of us are going to be there, so we'd love to see you.

26:49.960 --> 26:53.080
So it's October 10th through the 12th

26:53.080 --> 26:56.720
at the Grand Hyatt in San Antonio, Texas.

26:56.720 --> 26:59.240
So if you can make it, we'd love to see you there,

26:59.240 --> 27:03.160
because we're going to have a big presence.

27:03.160 --> 27:06.480
And we're also going to have an unofficial Hacker Family

27:06.480 --> 27:08.880
dinner and a birthday party, too, Elle.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.120
It's going to be my birthday.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.360
And I can't think of anybody who I'd

27:12.360 --> 27:14.400
like to share it more with in our community.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.680
So come by, have some Texas-style barbecue and some cake.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.240
It's going to be a great time the day

27:19.240 --> 27:20.680
before the conference starts.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.560
That's amazing.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.520
We'll be at the Two Brothers barbecue.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.160
I'll be there.

27:24.160 --> 27:28.320
The details, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.120
I can't believe it's finally happening, Elle.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.520
It's like actually happening, Texas Cyber Summit.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.440
I feel like I've been preparing for months,

27:34.440 --> 27:36.880
so I hope that everyone loves the event.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.880
I'm pretty sure you and I have been talking about it

27:38.880 --> 27:40.360
since January, at least.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.240
So it's been a long time, and you've probably

27:42.240 --> 27:44.200
been thinking about it even longer than that.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.160
So we'd love to see you there.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.800
And it's a great chance to get started

27:46.800 --> 27:49.600
and just see what the state of the cybersecurity industry

27:49.600 --> 27:52.400
as it is now, quite an industry, where it's at.

27:52.400 --> 27:57.520
So all those details, linuxunplug.com slash 317.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.720
Well, that's the housekeeping.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.880
Now let's talk a little bit about some great tips

28:01.880 --> 28:03.480
that I got from Wendell.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.920
So for our self-hosted show, self-hosted.show,

28:06.920 --> 28:09.160
for episode two, we're going to have Wendell on.

28:09.160 --> 28:12.760
And the topic of the episode is why you should actually

28:12.760 --> 28:17.040
self-host in the first place, and fairly enough,

28:17.040 --> 28:18.960
when you shouldn't self-host.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.000
And Wendell has a super cool approach to this.

28:21.000 --> 28:26.200
So we went down to his studio in Lexington, Kentucky.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.600
And I got to start the story at the very beginning.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.400
I have to give a shout out to Alex.

28:30.400 --> 28:34.240
He's taking care of all of the trip details, the room booking.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.000
He's letting me bum internet here at his house.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
He cooked a sandwich, or his wife cooked a sandwich.

28:40.000 --> 28:40.760
It's been good.

28:40.760 --> 28:41.360
It's been really good.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.200
So thank you, Alex.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.680
It's been wonderful.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.640
And I flew in last week.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.120
Did I get in Thursday, I think?

28:48.120 --> 28:49.560
I got in, I don't know.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.040
You know, I think I got in Thursday.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.040
I think Thursday.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.920
Yeah, you and the wife picked me up at the airport.

28:54.920 --> 28:58.640
And we got right to dinner, which was good.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.160
You know me, I like to eat.

29:00.160 --> 29:04.120
And then the next day, we took a drive

29:04.120 --> 29:07.360
from Raleigh, North Carolina to Lexington, Kentucky,

29:07.360 --> 29:10.440
which was about 10 hours, 10 or so hours.

29:10.440 --> 29:13.400
But it's a drive through the mountains.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.600
We got to drive on what's called the Tale of the Dragon.

29:16.600 --> 29:21.160
We got to take Blue Ridge Parkway, which are,

29:21.160 --> 29:24.520
they look like they should be in an episode of Top Gear.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.120
They look like they should be in car commercial roads.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.720
That's really something.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.600
I've never had road jelly before,

29:30.600 --> 29:33.080
but I am so envious of the roads around here.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.320
It was a lot of driving, though.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.320
And Alex did more than the majority of it,

29:36.320 --> 29:38.080
so I appreciate that.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.640
When we got in, we got in on Saturday.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.760
And Alex had to stay in a quality

29:42.760 --> 29:45.560
in a hotel, which I will say, the first one was pretty good,

29:45.560 --> 29:46.520
of decent quality.

29:46.520 --> 29:51.800
However, I did have this weird, over-softened bedsheet

29:51.800 --> 29:56.200
situation, where there was this weird residue on my bedsheets

29:56.200 --> 29:59.920
that felt almost a little moist.

29:59.920 --> 30:00.480
That was hard.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.200
This is an awkward silence.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.120
It was a little weird.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.000
It was a little hard.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.480
But I powered through like the pro traveler that I am.

30:07.480 --> 30:11.520
And we got down, and we met Wendell at his studio

30:11.520 --> 30:14.840
and spent the entire day with him.

30:14.840 --> 30:16.280
He was just really gracious.

30:16.280 --> 30:19.760
And you know what's really nice is you get to meet people,

30:19.760 --> 30:23.720
and they're legitimately what they are on camera.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.120
And that doesn't happen very often.

30:25.120 --> 30:31.280
But Wendell is a fountain of information.

30:31.280 --> 30:33.920
Alex, do you want to share the story?

30:33.920 --> 30:36.800
Of course, because we're sitting around the studio,

30:36.800 --> 30:38.880
there is all kinds of hardware.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.420
There's probably not a system in there

30:40.420 --> 30:41.880
with less than 16 cores.

30:41.880 --> 30:44.800
I mean, we're talking Tesla video cards.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.660
We're talking just all kinds of great stuff.

30:46.660 --> 30:49.440
And so as one does, when you're in the presence

30:49.440 --> 30:54.080
of such hardware, we start benchmarking.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.080
I never really used the Forerunix benchmark suite

30:56.080 --> 30:56.580
before.

30:56.580 --> 30:58.720
And Wendell just busts it out and says, oh, look,

30:58.720 --> 31:02.800
this machine can compile a kernel in, what, 20 seconds,

31:02.800 --> 31:03.840
12 seconds?

31:03.840 --> 31:06.040
He showed us a system that it compiled so fast

31:06.040 --> 31:08.840
that I believe the test suite had to do further tests

31:08.840 --> 31:12.000
because it figured it was an error that had compiled

31:12.000 --> 31:13.520
the kernel so fast.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.920
Yeah, it was pretty great.

31:14.920 --> 31:19.720
He had two 2-terabyte NVMe boot drives in RAID 0.

31:19.720 --> 31:20.600
Yeah.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.680
And then, of course, he had a massive CPU in there.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.320
I can't even remember how many cores it had.

31:24.320 --> 31:26.320
It might have been 24 cores.

31:26.320 --> 31:26.920
I don't know.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.480
He just casually threw out, oh, this one has a Thread Ripper,

31:29.480 --> 31:31.000
but this one has a 3900X.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.560
Oh, there's another Thread Ripper over there.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.480
What really impressed me is because, of course,

31:36.480 --> 31:38.480
as soon as we busted out the Forerunix test suite,

31:38.480 --> 31:39.200
I start geeking out.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.240
Because you guys know how much I love that freaking thing.

31:41.240 --> 31:42.320
So we're talking about it.

31:42.320 --> 31:44.360
And, of course, Alex is discovering it.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.720
And we're like, well, Alex, let's run it on your systems.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.280
So Alex remotes in, and he's got a server here

31:49.280 --> 31:51.440
with a bunch of cores and a couple of Xeons in it.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.640
And he's got a desktop.

31:52.640 --> 31:57.180
And you go to town, and Alex discovered the same Wendell

31:57.180 --> 31:59.560
rabbit hole, which I now find myself in, which is so funny.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.680
So tell them first what you discovered,

32:01.680 --> 32:04.200
and then I have something I have to admit.

32:04.200 --> 32:08.960
So I ran this benchmarking suite on a dual Xeon system.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.200
And I was able to compile a kernel, I think,

32:11.200 --> 32:15.200
in 64 seconds, which was a good deal slower than his Ryzen

32:15.200 --> 32:17.440
system in front of me, but it seemed pretty good.

32:17.440 --> 32:21.760
So then I thought, OK, let's break out the i7-8700K.

32:21.760 --> 32:24.920
Let's see what this can do, expecting a really good result.

32:24.920 --> 32:26.800
126.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.320
Horrible.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.640
So I was quite disappointed by that.

32:28.640 --> 32:31.320
What's great about Wendell, too, just a side note,

32:31.320 --> 32:33.440
is you can rattle off the parts.

32:33.440 --> 32:35.360
And before the benchmark finishes,

32:35.360 --> 32:38.040
he'll tell you what number you should expect.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.640
And then when you didn't get the number that you expected,

32:40.640 --> 32:43.840
he knew what the problem was from afar.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.800
He just said to me, what motherboard is it?

32:45.800 --> 32:49.200
And I said, oh, it's a Z370 Tai Chi ASRock motherboard.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.760
And he goes, ah, you haven't enabled

32:50.760 --> 32:52.280
this setting in your BIOS.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.480
I get home, lo and behold, I enable that setting,

32:55.480 --> 32:57.240
and I knock 25 seconds off.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.480
Amazing.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.040
He knew exactly what setting it was,

33:01.040 --> 33:03.480
where it was in the BIOS, right off the top of his head

33:03.480 --> 33:06.200
with that particular hardware combination.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.240
So I couldn't resist but start talking

33:08.240 --> 33:11.680
to him about the general performance and smoothness

33:11.680 --> 33:13.440
of the Linux desktop.

33:13.440 --> 33:16.520
He has a video that's coming out on his Level 1 Linux channel,

33:16.520 --> 33:19.080
probably by the time this episode is posted.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.680
And we chat a little bit further about this with him

33:21.680 --> 33:22.960
in his video.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.120
And he has a pretty good idea of what

33:25.120 --> 33:27.120
it would take to get the Linux desktop a little more

33:27.120 --> 33:27.880
responsive.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.200
And I agree with him completely.

33:29.200 --> 33:32.560
And he gave me a couple of tips that I've heard over the years.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.280
But when you combine them all together,

33:34.280 --> 33:38.680
really do make a pretty sizable performance difference.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.880
So I wanted to share them with you guys,

33:40.880 --> 33:42.840
so that way you could go down the same rabbit hole.

33:42.840 --> 33:46.200
Because I did these things and realized

33:46.200 --> 33:48.760
there was a lot more area for optimization and improvement.

33:48.760 --> 33:52.440
And now I've been spending my free time in the evenings,

33:52.440 --> 33:55.520
locked away in my room, tweaking my laptop.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.400
And so I want you all to experience this, too.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.800
First of all, take a little time.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.120
Don't run it forever.

34:03.120 --> 34:07.320
But if you're on GNOME, install the CPU FREQ extension,

34:07.320 --> 34:08.320
just for a little bit.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.080
It's a little slow.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.400
It's a little clunky.

34:11.400 --> 34:14.280
It's got a pop-up banner thingy, not a pop-up.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.800
It's got a splash thingy while it loads.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.920
But it gives you such a good wealth of information,

34:19.920 --> 34:23.880
including a simple way to turn on turbo boost, which

34:23.880 --> 34:26.040
on some machines is off by default.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.720
So that's A with right there, A number one.

34:28.720 --> 34:31.880
You can increase performance by turning on turbo boost.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.840
CPU FREQ will also tell you what things

34:33.840 --> 34:35.560
you need in order to control your governor.

34:35.560 --> 34:38.960
Most Linux boxes are not in a performance mode,

34:38.960 --> 34:40.960
so you'll get some throttling.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.400
And in this, you can also do things

34:42.400 --> 34:43.640
like turn off some of the cores.

34:43.640 --> 34:45.320
So this morning, I was in a long meeting,

34:45.320 --> 34:46.800
didn't have my power plug, so I just

34:46.800 --> 34:50.040
turned off four of my CPU cores.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.800
Additionally, it'll tell you if there's

34:51.800 --> 34:53.720
a couple of low-hanging fruit performance

34:53.720 --> 34:58.400
items on your Linux box that you need to resolve.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.120
For myself, this is interesting because Wendell

35:01.120 --> 35:03.480
brought this up, IRQ Balance, which

35:03.480 --> 35:07.840
is a service that it looks like it's designed for performance.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.760
In fact, if you read most things online,

35:09.760 --> 35:12.960
most people say install IRQ Balance for performance,

35:12.960 --> 35:16.000
because it's a little piece of software outside the kernel

35:16.000 --> 35:17.960
that looks at your load and your tasks

35:17.960 --> 35:20.560
and will do some workload splitting up

35:20.560 --> 35:22.160
amongst your CPU cores.

35:22.160 --> 35:25.000
I mean, that sounds like a good thing, right?

35:25.000 --> 35:29.160
Turns out, eh, not so much.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.920
It's kind of conservative in how it actually manages things.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.760
And the logic in sorting all of that out

35:33.760 --> 35:35.360
puts overhead in there, and it actually

35:35.360 --> 35:37.320
can be one of the things that can make your machine a little

35:37.320 --> 35:37.960
more leggy.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.760
So this is something that this application

35:39.760 --> 35:43.960
will flag, the CPU FREQ, CPU-F-R-E-Q, like frequency.

35:43.960 --> 35:47.720
It also puts a little item up in your Gnome Shell toolbar

35:47.720 --> 35:50.360
that tells you what frequency your processors are running at,

35:50.360 --> 35:53.000
which is something that you can use to see if you're getting

35:53.000 --> 35:55.640
the full peak performance that your CPU is capable of.

35:55.640 --> 35:58.640
Before I made some of these changes, I wasn't.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.920
By stock, Wes, you probably aren't either,

36:01.920 --> 36:04.440
because some of these settings will be the same for you.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.120
So you install that.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.280
It'll tell you if you have IRQ Balance messing up

36:07.280 --> 36:07.920
your performance.

36:07.920 --> 36:10.380
It'll tell you if your CPU is being throttled.

36:10.380 --> 36:12.720
You can do things like turn off your cores,

36:12.720 --> 36:15.720
turn on turbo boost. So if it's a one catch-all application,

36:15.720 --> 36:17.720
it's like the first thing Wendell was installing

36:17.720 --> 36:19.640
on his machine, because he set up a Fedora box

36:19.640 --> 36:21.120
while we were there for some testing.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.600
And the first thing he installed was CPU frequency.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.200
Do you remember the drill that he installed the CPU cooler

36:26.200 --> 36:26.720
with?

36:26.720 --> 36:29.680
And then he didn't.

36:29.680 --> 36:32.200
So he wanted to get as close as he

36:32.200 --> 36:34.240
could to replicating Alex's home setup.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.480
And he basically has every machine iteration.

36:36.480 --> 36:40.640
So he grabs an MV&E drive and a CPU and walks up to a machine

36:40.640 --> 36:44.320
and just takes a screwdriver and screws the CPU and cooler

36:44.320 --> 36:47.920
in, pops the MV&E in, gets to work.

36:47.920 --> 36:49.960
It was great, because you're having a conversation

36:49.960 --> 36:50.480
with Wendell.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.920
And it goes like this, hmm, I wonder

36:52.920 --> 36:54.160
how that would work.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.560
And then he says, well, let's go test it.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.480
So that's what we did on several things.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.160
Every time.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.200
Yeah.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.840
That was pretty fun.

37:01.840 --> 37:04.560
So I have links to that in the show notes.

37:04.560 --> 37:07.160
If you're on a T480, there's an additional step

37:07.160 --> 37:07.840
you need to take.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.680
Or if you're on, actually, it's not just a T480.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.160
There's several ThinkPad laptops,

37:11.160 --> 37:17.000
including a lot of the X series, like the X280, the XC16,

37:17.000 --> 37:20.560
the T580 is also, the ThinkPad Anniversary Edition even,

37:20.560 --> 37:26.880
a couple of E series, the Dell XPS 9365 and 9370 series,

37:26.880 --> 37:30.080
and the Microsoft Service Books are all

37:30.080 --> 37:36.160
suffering from aggressive, naughty CPU throttling,

37:36.160 --> 37:39.800
where they're actually even cranking down

37:39.800 --> 37:41.600
the wattage of the CPU.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.800
Initially, it's 44 watts when you're plugged in.

37:43.800 --> 37:46.040
And then when you're on battery, it hard

37:46.040 --> 37:47.600
limits it to 29 watts.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.920
And you can't ever go above that, even

37:49.920 --> 37:51.800
for turbo boosting.

37:51.800 --> 37:56.400
And it actually resets to that every five seconds.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.200
Yikes.

37:57.200 --> 38:01.440
Yeah, and it's every 30 seconds when you're on battery.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.240
And it's a value from the driver and the embedded controller

38:04.240 --> 38:06.520
that are getting passed back and forth.

38:06.520 --> 38:10.600
And it represents itself in essentially limiting

38:10.600 --> 38:12.400
your overall CPU burstiness.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.200
Your machine might run slightly cooler.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.240
Your battery life might be slightly better.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.940
But if you're plugged in or you have great battery life already,

38:18.940 --> 38:20.720
this isn't really a concern for you.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.160
So there's a fix you can run.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.440
And I'll have that linked to the show notes.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.800
And it sets up a system de-service that essentially

38:25.800 --> 38:26.440
turns this off.

38:26.440 --> 38:30.880
It's still safe, but you can use it at your own risk.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.880
But it was fun talking to him about this stuff,

38:32.880 --> 38:35.520
because he talks about it in kind of a holistic way.

38:35.520 --> 38:38.840
He talks about how it's all these different components that

38:38.840 --> 38:41.600
kind of need somebody to come in like an orchestrator

38:41.600 --> 38:43.440
and fix it all up.

38:43.440 --> 38:46.120
You know, you need somebody who's working at the compositor

38:46.120 --> 38:49.760
level, at the graphic stack level, at the kernel level,

38:49.760 --> 38:52.360
and at the audio stack level, and at the scheduling level.

38:52.360 --> 38:55.240
All of these things need to be kind of working together

38:55.240 --> 38:56.800
to really get the kind of performance

38:56.800 --> 38:58.360
that we want on Linux.

38:58.360 --> 39:02.000
But you do have the means to make some of these tweaks

39:02.000 --> 39:04.160
yourself, since it's Linux after all,

39:04.160 --> 39:08.360
and get the performance closer there than you do by stock.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.200
And I don't know.

39:09.200 --> 39:11.220
You look at some of these settings,

39:11.220 --> 39:14.400
and you think to yourself, why are we

39:14.400 --> 39:18.480
doing this out of the box on desktop distributions, things

39:18.480 --> 39:19.880
like IRQ balance?

39:19.880 --> 39:23.440
Maybe there's reasons, but I don't know what they are.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.280
Yeah, and I'm sure much of it is legacy changes

39:26.280 --> 39:28.660
in architecture that just haven't bubbled up

39:28.660 --> 39:30.320
all the way through the different layers.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.760
And Linux is deployed on so many different types of systems,

39:33.760 --> 39:35.880
especially maybe older or low-end systems,

39:35.880 --> 39:39.200
that I imagine it's a hard thing to get just right.

39:39.200 --> 39:41.640
But if more of us start experimenting with it,

39:41.640 --> 39:42.760
maybe we can change that.

39:42.760 --> 39:43.860
Yeah.

39:43.860 --> 39:48.480
I love the idea, though, of maybe one day,

39:48.480 --> 39:50.940
some Skunk Works project turns into this big project

39:50.940 --> 39:54.140
where people put money into funding development on all

39:54.140 --> 39:56.780
of these little rough edges to make Linux audio just

39:56.780 --> 40:01.880
a little bit smoother, to make performance mode a little bit

40:01.880 --> 40:03.420
easier to achieve.

40:03.420 --> 40:07.000
There is a project out there.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.880
I think, oh, I always forget this,

40:08.880 --> 40:10.540
but there's a project out there that's

40:10.540 --> 40:13.160
made by a group that changes some of this for you.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.200
They're a gaming company.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.400
I don't know if you guys know who I'm talking about.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.800
They have a game mode for Linux.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.240
You guys familiar with this?

40:19.240 --> 40:21.200
I actually have it installed on my system.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.000
All right, maybe you can make me look it up.

40:23.000 --> 40:23.960
Game mode for Linux.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.960
And it is a project that's attempted, yeah,

40:25.960 --> 40:27.280
by Farrell Interactive.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.640
That's who.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.540
You guys are probably familiar with Farrell Interactive.

40:30.540 --> 40:33.160
They have a project right now called Game Mode for Linux,

40:33.160 --> 40:34.920
which optimized Linux's performance

40:34.920 --> 40:36.720
for on-demand gaming.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.760
And it essentially changes a lot of these things.

40:38.760 --> 40:41.120
That's what I'm talking about, your CPU governor, your IO

40:41.120 --> 40:43.400
priority, and it even goes a little bit further

40:43.400 --> 40:45.080
in some cases.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.360
It'll put your GPU, if it's an AMD or NVIDIA,

40:47.360 --> 40:48.640
in performance mode.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.800
It'll inhibit your screen saver.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.840
It can change the kernel scheduler.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.240
So it can go even further.

40:54.240 --> 40:54.720
Yeah.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.480
This looks great.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.200
No, I totally missed this one.

40:57.200 --> 40:58.080
Yeah, this is something that's been around.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.160
I've been watching for a little bit.

40:59.160 --> 41:00.760
They have different installation methods

41:00.760 --> 41:01.760
for different distributions.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.520
So you could play around with it.

41:03.520 --> 41:06.160
They got stuff for Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, Gen 2,

41:06.160 --> 41:07.560
or you could build it yourself.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.760
I've been running it for a little bit on my laptop.

41:09.760 --> 41:13.000
You activate it, and you go play some No Man's Sky.

41:13.000 --> 41:13.840
It works great.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.640
I'm sitting here gaming on Wayland,

41:15.640 --> 41:19.120
playing No Man's Sky under Proton with an eGPU all day

41:19.120 --> 41:20.240
long.

41:20.240 --> 41:20.960
That's wonderful.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.240
It's made a big difference.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.400
It's a noticeable game of difference.

41:24.400 --> 41:28.720
And I, on my setup, haven't noticed any stability impacts.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.800
One of the other amazing tools that Wendell threw

41:30.800 --> 41:34.040
into my toolkit this weekend is i7z.

41:34.040 --> 41:37.040
This allowed me to look at the CPU frequencies

41:37.040 --> 41:39.560
and the different C states of my processors

41:39.560 --> 41:42.240
as well whilst I was running benchmarks.

41:42.240 --> 41:45.040
And I find this is going to be an excellent new tool

41:45.040 --> 41:48.000
in my toolkit alongside something like S2E, which

41:48.000 --> 41:50.080
is another tool that lets you do a similar thing.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.400
Yeah, we've covered S2E on a previous Linux Unplugged

41:52.400 --> 41:54.840
pick, I believe.

41:54.840 --> 41:56.040
It's pretty great.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.600
So we'll have a link to CPU frack.

41:57.600 --> 42:02.360
We'll have a link to i7z and also ThrottleD

42:02.360 --> 42:04.520
if you're on one of those laptops that's

42:04.520 --> 42:06.960
impacted by that built-in throttling,

42:06.960 --> 42:09.320
which is really kind of a bug that's really a shame

42:09.320 --> 42:11.680
that Lenovo hasn't fixed a firmware update.

42:11.680 --> 42:12.880
So it's kind of on them.

42:12.880 --> 42:16.840
You know, I saw a little update in a Lenovo forum recently.

42:16.840 --> 42:21.120
It sounds like they're working on it, but nothing concrete yet.

42:21.120 --> 42:21.880
All right.

42:21.880 --> 42:23.760
One thing I'd like to mention about ThrottleD

42:23.760 --> 42:28.000
before we move on is the undervolting section

42:28.000 --> 42:29.600
can be pretty important when you're

42:29.600 --> 42:32.320
trying to really get those thermal levels down.

42:32.320 --> 42:34.320
I went through and did that today

42:34.320 --> 42:36.240
and noticed some real improvements.

42:36.240 --> 42:38.600
But you do kind of have to know what you're doing

42:38.600 --> 42:42.480
and test conservatively as you start activating that feature.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.680
What are you using to monitor your thermals?

42:44.680 --> 42:47.080
ThrottleD actually has a built-in utility

42:47.080 --> 42:49.360
that you can launch on the command line

42:49.360 --> 42:51.880
with the dash dash monitor flag.

42:51.880 --> 42:55.440
And it will show you exactly what's causing any limits.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.080
No way.

42:56.080 --> 42:56.600
Really?

42:56.600 --> 42:57.400
I got to try that.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.160
That is so great.

42:59.160 --> 42:59.920
Thanks, Drew.

42:59.920 --> 43:02.840
That's a really handy way to kind of see some.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.840
I've been using CPU frack, and that's a lot.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.000
It's verbose, it's gooey.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.600
And I don't plan to keep the extension around forever.

43:08.600 --> 43:10.200
So that's awesome.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.440
Yeah, I find between Tuned and ThrottleD,

43:12.440 --> 43:14.840
once ThrottleD is configured properly,

43:14.840 --> 43:16.640
I'm getting some good performance

43:16.640 --> 43:18.800
with better thermals.

43:18.800 --> 43:19.840
That's a win-win.

43:19.840 --> 43:22.520
So check out the links in the show notes

43:22.520 --> 43:24.160
if this has got your interest piqued.

43:24.160 --> 43:29.680
And be sure to keep an eye on selfhosted.show.

43:29.680 --> 43:32.360
Episode one comes out on September 12th.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.600
And then episode two comes out with Wendell

43:34.600 --> 43:36.360
on why to self-host, and then we kick off

43:36.360 --> 43:38.280
a whole series of episodes.

43:38.280 --> 43:39.600
We had a good chat with Wendell.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.940
We talked a little bit about his home setup, his Linux

43:41.940 --> 43:44.640
background, his server setup that he

43:44.640 --> 43:47.440
has there in the studio, what he chooses to cloud

43:47.440 --> 43:50.320
host versus what he doesn't trust in the cloud.

43:50.320 --> 43:53.480
Really good conversation coming up in self-hosted episode

43:53.480 --> 43:54.560
number two.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.320
And that's at selfhosted.show.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.400
They all start shipping on September 12th,

43:58.400 --> 44:00.880
and it follows fortnightly after that.

44:00.880 --> 44:05.160
Selfhosted.show slash subscribe for the RSS feed.

44:05.160 --> 44:06.320
Really was a great trip.

44:06.320 --> 44:09.920
Alex, thank you so much for the fun drives, for the trip,

44:09.920 --> 44:12.080
for scheduling all the details so I could just show up

44:12.080 --> 44:13.460
and get the work done and not have

44:13.460 --> 44:16.520
to worry about all the individual itty-bitties.

44:16.520 --> 44:17.440
Thank you very much, sir.

44:17.440 --> 44:18.600
It was a pleasure having you.

44:18.600 --> 44:22.480
I mean, the farts aside.

44:22.480 --> 44:25.240
Now also, Cheesy's been doing some work.

44:25.240 --> 44:27.880
He set up a new gallery that has all of the photos

44:27.880 --> 44:29.680
from a lot of these events we've been talking

44:29.680 --> 44:32.480
about over the last few weeks, including Red Hat Summit,

44:32.480 --> 44:38.480
Linux Fest, Northwest, our sprint for Self Hosted,

44:38.480 --> 44:42.400
the trip that Alex and I just took to go see Wendell,

44:42.400 --> 44:46.600
all of that at a new site, jupyter.gallery.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.140
What's some of the magic here, Cheesy?

44:48.140 --> 44:50.140
What's on the back end to make all this happen?

44:50.140 --> 44:53.800
Well, I mean, obviously it's self-hosted

44:53.800 --> 44:58.560
with a little assistance from my buddy Wes over there.

44:58.560 --> 45:04.280
But yeah, it's Lychee, I believe is how you guys pronounce it.

45:04.280 --> 45:09.080
Essentially, all I've done is set it up through Docker.

45:09.080 --> 45:11.400
And I got it set up on a Linode.

45:11.400 --> 45:15.360
And just kind of messing around with it this weekend.

45:15.360 --> 45:18.120
I looked at various other options, other choices

45:18.120 --> 45:20.800
out there, other pieces of software and self-hosted

45:20.800 --> 45:22.360
routes.

45:22.360 --> 45:26.040
But this was really the most attractive to me.

45:26.040 --> 45:30.120
So that's why I ended up choosing Lychee.

45:30.120 --> 45:32.220
And it seems to be doing pretty well so far.

45:32.220 --> 45:33.480
We'll see.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.480
Right now, obviously, everything's been posted

45:35.480 --> 45:36.800
in September of 2019.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.760
But as we progress through, those dates will be fixed.

45:39.760 --> 45:43.640
And everything will be in order from here on out.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.760
So looking forward to it.

45:44.760 --> 45:47.040
It's a great way for us to catalog our photos.

45:47.040 --> 45:49.000
And I encourage any of the listeners out there,

45:49.000 --> 45:50.800
if you have photos from any of these events

45:50.800 --> 45:53.880
that you see there, please get them over to me.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.720
Cheeze at Jupyter Broadcasting.

45:55.720 --> 45:58.200
I'll get them posted into these galleries.

45:58.200 --> 46:02.440
Because really, the whole part of this is showing our community.

46:02.440 --> 46:05.680
And I want our community to share their photos with us

46:05.680 --> 46:07.120
so we can enjoy them as well.

46:07.120 --> 46:10.760
I'm sure there are some great shots of myself, or Chris,

46:10.760 --> 46:12.680
or some other great candids out there

46:12.680 --> 46:15.280
that we just haven't seen yet.

46:15.280 --> 46:17.400
Maybe we can get one of those Noah photos

46:17.400 --> 46:20.080
in there of him in his bathing suit.

46:20.080 --> 46:20.960
Oh, my gosh.

46:20.960 --> 46:21.740
Oh, my gosh.

46:21.740 --> 46:22.880
Those might be too hot for the internet.

46:22.880 --> 46:23.840
I got a couple of those.

46:23.840 --> 46:27.200
And so there you go.

46:27.200 --> 46:29.640
It's nice looking back at the LinuxFest Northwest pictures,

46:29.640 --> 46:32.120
just remembering how long that line was

46:32.120 --> 46:34.400
that you had to go to the front for for your brands.

46:34.400 --> 46:34.880
Oh, yeah.

46:34.880 --> 46:35.600
Yeah, that's right.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.400
Yeah, good times.

46:36.400 --> 46:36.920
Good times.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.880
And that's really what the gallery is about,

46:38.880 --> 46:40.160
is to capture those moments.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.420
And so I encourage any of the community members

46:42.420 --> 46:45.220
out there that have photos to share, please get them to me.

46:45.220 --> 46:47.840
And I'll make sure to get them uploaded into the gallery.

46:47.840 --> 46:50.400
And yeah, looking forward to seeing it grow.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.160
Jupyter.gallery for that.

46:52.160 --> 46:54.400
And the software, the open source software

46:54.400 --> 46:55.960
that's the gallery management software,

46:55.960 --> 47:00.440
is L-Y-C-H-E-E, if you want to check that out.

47:00.440 --> 47:04.640
And yeah, it's fun having all the pictures in one spot.

47:04.640 --> 47:05.560
So go see that.

47:05.560 --> 47:06.400
It's pretty great.

47:06.400 --> 47:07.160
It is.

47:07.160 --> 47:08.960
And we had some emails come into the show.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.360
I thought this was a really good one.

47:10.360 --> 47:11.780
So I wanted to read it on the show.

47:11.780 --> 47:16.680
And then lucky us, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Drew DeVore,

47:16.680 --> 47:18.980
still in the house, hasn't evacuated yet.

47:18.980 --> 47:21.680
And he's here to answer your technical audio questions.

47:21.680 --> 47:22.960
He's just perfect for this one.

47:22.960 --> 47:23.280
I know.

47:23.280 --> 47:23.760
He really is.

47:23.760 --> 47:24.520
So JT wrote in.

47:24.520 --> 47:27.320
He says, I've read on a few different blogs and message

47:27.320 --> 47:29.800
boards that the audio systems in Linux

47:29.800 --> 47:32.120
are not up to professional standards.

47:32.120 --> 47:34.080
I know we don't have any DAWs, that's

47:34.080 --> 47:38.360
Digital Audio Workstations, as fully baked to say Pro Tools.

47:38.360 --> 47:41.400
But is that the result of an inferior audio system

47:41.400 --> 47:43.720
or just the typical Linux problems

47:43.720 --> 47:47.680
we always face when it comes to proprietary applications?

47:47.680 --> 47:51.880
Is there something lacking in ALSA, Jack, or Pulse Audio stack

47:51.880 --> 47:53.320
that I'm not aware of?

47:53.320 --> 47:55.780
Or is there something that we obviously

47:55.780 --> 47:57.480
can do in pro audio production, given

47:57.480 --> 47:59.520
that we have Arduer and Reaper and Audacity,

47:59.520 --> 48:01.240
that people just are missing?

48:01.240 --> 48:03.480
Thank you very much, JT.

48:03.480 --> 48:05.800
Well, Drew, I thought this would be a great question for you

48:05.800 --> 48:10.000
to answer, since your day job is audio engineering on Linux.

48:10.000 --> 48:10.880
That's right.

48:10.880 --> 48:16.560
So audio production in Linux definitely is not fault free.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.200
There are plenty of issues with it,

48:19.200 --> 48:24.000
probably the most visible one being that the ALSA, Jack,

48:24.000 --> 48:27.200
and Pulse stacks, when you put them all together,

48:27.200 --> 48:29.040
it's really complex.

48:29.040 --> 48:32.840
And it hopefully will get streamlined down

48:32.840 --> 48:34.720
with Pipewire in the future.

48:34.720 --> 48:38.720
But for the moment, it's still pretty hairy

48:38.720 --> 48:42.480
to try to work with it on a daily basis.

48:42.480 --> 48:44.600
Once you understand it, you can work around

48:44.600 --> 48:46.160
a lot of those issues.

48:46.160 --> 48:49.360
But it does take some deep diving.

48:49.360 --> 48:55.640
Now, as far as software, with things like Bitwig and Reaper

48:55.640 --> 48:59.600
and VST producers starting to target Linux,

48:59.600 --> 49:02.360
I think the tide is starting to shift.

49:02.360 --> 49:04.320
And hopefully, we'll see more pro level

49:04.320 --> 49:06.560
software coming our way.

49:06.560 --> 49:10.920
But honestly, for now, I can do 90% of what

49:10.920 --> 49:13.280
I need to do all in Linux.

49:13.280 --> 49:16.240
There are still a couple of things that I run in Wine.

49:16.240 --> 49:18.960
But even that works just fine so long

49:18.960 --> 49:21.600
as the application is compatible with Wine,

49:21.600 --> 49:24.680
and even some Wine VSTs that I can run directly

49:24.680 --> 49:26.560
through a compatibility layer.

49:26.560 --> 49:28.200
Right, and those Wine VSTs and things

49:28.200 --> 49:30.960
that you're running through an app compatibility layer

49:30.960 --> 49:35.120
are actually, it's possible to bring them up in Reaper.

49:35.120 --> 49:37.760
So it's like in the Linux editing application you're

49:37.760 --> 49:40.440
using, you can summon these Wine plugins.

49:40.440 --> 49:44.120
Right, they just masquerade as a Linux VST,

49:44.120 --> 49:46.120
and they're just kind of piped through Wine

49:46.120 --> 49:48.960
to get them into the application.

49:48.960 --> 49:53.520
So will we ever see things like Audition or Pro Tools

49:53.520 --> 49:55.800
or the other big boys coming to Linux?

49:55.800 --> 49:56.320
I don't know.

49:56.320 --> 49:57.640
I kind of doubt it.

49:57.640 --> 50:01.080
But Reaper is really, really good.

50:01.080 --> 50:03.960
I consider it professional quality.

50:03.960 --> 50:08.840
So realistically, I don't know if we need everything

50:08.840 --> 50:10.960
to come to Linux so long as we have

50:10.960 --> 50:13.240
enough things of high enough quality

50:13.240 --> 50:14.520
that we can get the work done.

50:14.520 --> 50:17.840
And I'd say we're most of the way there.

50:17.840 --> 50:20.800
Yeah, and Wes, you've done some deep diving into Jack.

50:20.800 --> 50:24.000
And once you learn the system, there

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
are a lot of powerful things you can do from not just audio

50:27.000 --> 50:29.520
processing and routing, but real time monitoring

50:29.520 --> 50:31.500
and all kinds of stuff that are really

50:31.500 --> 50:33.380
useful in a professional audio workstation.

50:33.380 --> 50:33.880
Oh, yeah.

50:33.880 --> 50:35.940
I mean, you definitely have to invest.

50:35.940 --> 50:39.040
And really, I think a lot of areas were lacking.

50:39.040 --> 50:41.380
I mean, you've been using Reaper a bit more.

50:41.380 --> 50:43.800
You've also introduced me and shown me some stuff

50:43.800 --> 50:46.880
over on the Mac side that can do some similar audio routing

50:46.880 --> 50:47.820
capabilities.

50:47.820 --> 50:50.080
And it doesn't expose to you the same level of detail,

50:50.080 --> 50:53.420
but it also has a much simpler default and easy

50:53.420 --> 50:54.600
to use sort of settings.

50:54.600 --> 50:57.640
And Drew, you were helping us out learning Reaper better.

50:57.640 --> 50:59.200
And there's a lot of stuff you've

50:59.200 --> 51:02.420
got to go tweak and configure to make it look competitive,

51:02.420 --> 51:05.080
to make it sort of as nice of an editor.

51:05.080 --> 51:06.380
You can get there.

51:06.380 --> 51:08.560
You just have to be willing to invest the time.

51:08.560 --> 51:09.880
Yes, that's right.

51:09.880 --> 51:14.100
And I would say that I like Jack better than anything

51:14.100 --> 51:16.440
on Windows or Mac that I've played with.

51:16.440 --> 51:19.800
But yeah, you've got to learn a lot more

51:19.800 --> 51:23.720
to really expose those features and take use of them.

51:23.720 --> 51:27.280
And once you do, you have a whole new tool set

51:27.280 --> 51:27.900
to work with.

51:27.900 --> 51:29.560
And that's the part I'm struggling with,

51:29.560 --> 51:33.520
is I'm in that point right now where specifically with Reaper,

51:33.520 --> 51:35.760
like Jack is clicking with me more.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.000
And I get it.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.640
But Reaper is a big shift from what

51:40.640 --> 51:43.720
I'm used to in proprietary world editors.

51:43.720 --> 51:47.600
But I can already tell that once I have it set up and working,

51:47.600 --> 51:51.640
it's just as powerful, if not more powerful,

51:51.640 --> 51:54.180
than what I've used in the past on the proprietary side.

51:54.180 --> 51:55.800
This isn't totally fair.

51:55.800 --> 51:58.940
But I've jokingly said to the guys behind the scenes

51:58.940 --> 52:04.280
that Reaper has a $60 UI and a $5,000 functionality.

52:04.280 --> 52:06.960
And the UI, thankfully, is themable.

52:06.960 --> 52:11.380
So you can get far if you just know a couple of websites

52:11.380 --> 52:13.460
to go to to set things up properly.

52:13.460 --> 52:15.860
Drew, what's the number one one you always told me to go to

52:15.860 --> 52:16.880
for my Reaper stuff?

52:16.880 --> 52:20.000
Stash.reaper.fm.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.840
And it's also worth noting that not only can you theme it,

52:22.840 --> 52:27.800
you can configure just about everything in the workstation

52:27.800 --> 52:28.440
as well.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.440
So you can put things in different places.

52:30.440 --> 52:33.040
You can add different things to your toolbars.

52:33.040 --> 52:35.680
The whole thing is just fully extensible,

52:35.680 --> 52:38.320
which I know I sound like an ad for Reaper right now.

52:38.320 --> 52:42.240
But it's the one thing that lets me do my job on Linux

52:42.240 --> 52:44.000
all day, every day.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.440
Now, when you make a really good product

52:46.440 --> 52:49.520
and you make it available for Linux as a native binary,

52:49.520 --> 52:51.720
and you update it frequently, and you've been doing it

52:51.720 --> 52:57.040
for years on Linux, and you only charge $60 for personal use,

52:57.040 --> 53:00.640
you buy loyalty that $60 could never afford you.

53:00.640 --> 53:02.760
We're just such huge fans of it.

53:02.760 --> 53:06.320
The thing is, and I think, JT, this is what you're noticing,

53:06.320 --> 53:08.500
because I suffered from this as well,

53:08.500 --> 53:10.800
is there is a lot of hard lessons

53:10.800 --> 53:13.100
you've got to learn when you're doing production on Linux.

53:13.100 --> 53:15.000
PulseAudio is going to fail you a few times.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.940
Jack's going to be complicated.

53:16.940 --> 53:19.560
You've got to learn a really weird UI in Reaper.

53:19.560 --> 53:22.840
And these paper cuts add up to a really frustrating experience,

53:22.840 --> 53:25.360
especially when you're used to being really proficient

53:25.360 --> 53:26.720
at a particular job.

53:26.720 --> 53:29.080
And then you move to do that same job on another platform,

53:29.080 --> 53:31.480
and you are no longer proficient.

53:31.480 --> 53:35.320
You actively seek out all of the things that are not your fault

53:35.320 --> 53:38.240
as to why it's bad, because you're frustrated.

53:38.240 --> 53:39.380
You're suffering.

53:39.380 --> 53:42.040
And so a lot of times what you see is people go to their blog,

53:42.040 --> 53:44.960
their Twitter account, their podcast,

53:44.960 --> 53:47.000
and they'll do a kind of a rant and rave

53:47.000 --> 53:48.560
when they're in the midst of that.

53:48.560 --> 53:50.320
And then you fast forward like a year later.

53:50.320 --> 53:53.280
Like, we're nearly two years into this transition now.

53:53.280 --> 53:57.280
And it's so smoothed out that it's just table stakes now.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.400
Everything.

53:58.400 --> 54:01.440
This show is being streamed live on Linux.

54:01.440 --> 54:04.640
All of our hosts are connecting in over Linux remotely.

54:04.640 --> 54:06.240
I mean, I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina,

54:06.240 --> 54:08.780
and I'm using all Linux to do this right now.

54:08.780 --> 54:11.040
It's being recorded on Linux.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.720
It gets edited on Linux.

54:12.720 --> 54:15.660
It's the whole thing from top to bottom of what

54:15.660 --> 54:18.960
I feel like are some of the best podcasts on Linux in the world

54:18.960 --> 54:22.640
is all produced and done every single day on Linux.

54:22.640 --> 54:23.840
It's totally capable.

54:23.840 --> 54:25.480
It's just once you get it all figured out

54:25.480 --> 54:27.000
and it's no longer a frustrating topic,

54:27.000 --> 54:29.340
you just don't talk about it as much because it's old news.

54:29.340 --> 54:29.840
Yeah.

54:29.840 --> 54:31.160
And that's why it's doubly hard.

54:31.160 --> 54:32.380
I mean, if you're trying to learn

54:32.380 --> 54:34.720
how to do a bunch of audio production work on Linux,

54:34.720 --> 54:36.600
you have to learn two things at the same time.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.600
And all the tools and examples are

54:38.600 --> 54:41.000
targeting those other platforms.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.800
And experts are already used to assembling their own tools

54:43.800 --> 54:44.640
in this domain.

54:44.640 --> 54:47.620
So they just go tune their references and get to work.

54:47.620 --> 54:49.480
And the rest of us are left wondering

54:49.480 --> 54:51.040
how they make it all happen.

54:51.040 --> 54:51.540
Yeah.

54:51.540 --> 54:52.800
And the other thing that can be, there's

54:52.800 --> 54:54.040
a creative element to this too.

54:54.040 --> 54:56.840
And if what you're doing is like you want to make music

54:56.840 --> 54:59.200
and you just want to have a creative expression

54:59.200 --> 55:02.440
and you're mashing your face against your tools,

55:02.440 --> 55:04.880
it's really kind of an impedance mismatch.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.400
You want to creatively express.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.540
You don't want to go do a deep dive and learn.

55:08.540 --> 55:13.140
So what I have found is for me to really learn a new tool,

55:13.140 --> 55:16.720
it has to be a project that I'm starting fresh with.

55:16.720 --> 55:20.680
Fresh project, maybe it's not under a massive deadline.

55:20.680 --> 55:23.760
So I can learn the tool as I learn the project.

55:23.760 --> 55:25.840
And that's the best way to make a transition.

55:25.840 --> 55:28.480
And I am applying that very logic to Reaper.

55:28.480 --> 55:30.120
There's a new project we're working on.

55:30.120 --> 55:31.620
And I'm going to use Reaper for it.

55:31.620 --> 55:33.360
I'm going to make myself use Reaper.

55:33.360 --> 55:34.480
And I'll learn it that way.

55:34.480 --> 55:35.800
Oh, that makes me happy.

55:35.800 --> 55:36.280
I know.

55:36.280 --> 55:36.920
It's great, isn't it?

55:36.920 --> 55:38.500
It is fun because we get to geek out.

55:38.500 --> 55:40.920
We're all geeking out on different Linux audio tricks

55:40.920 --> 55:41.400
now.

55:41.400 --> 55:43.280
So it's just something to consider.

55:43.280 --> 55:45.280
And if you get frustrated, I have something

55:45.280 --> 55:46.440
to help you Zen out.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.240
It's called ZFrag.

55:48.240 --> 55:51.640
We got two app picks this week, and this first one's silly.

55:51.640 --> 55:53.200
But it's so awesome.

55:53.200 --> 55:55.980
If you've switched to Linux from Windows

55:55.980 --> 55:59.560
and you've missed defragging your hard drive, well, friends,

55:59.560 --> 56:01.760
I've got a fake application for you.

56:01.760 --> 56:06.480
It's a fake DOS display of defragging your hard drive.

56:06.480 --> 56:09.160
There's an interactive version and an automated version

56:09.160 --> 56:13.600
where it just sits there and does a fake DOS-style defrag

56:13.600 --> 56:15.800
for all day, every day.

56:15.800 --> 56:16.840
That's all it does.

56:16.840 --> 56:18.240
Oh, man, there's an automated?

56:18.240 --> 56:18.720
I missed that.

56:18.720 --> 56:20.080
I'm just sitting here in the studio.

56:20.080 --> 56:21.600
I've been doing it while you've been blabbing on

56:21.600 --> 56:22.840
about Reaper this whole time.

56:22.840 --> 56:24.040
It's very relaxing.

56:24.040 --> 56:26.880
I love, too, that if you're doing it, it measures you, too.

56:26.880 --> 56:28.880
So it shows you how far you've completed and then

56:28.880 --> 56:29.800
the elapsed time.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.760
And we can all maybe make it a race

56:31.760 --> 56:33.160
if you're feeling a little too relaxed.

56:33.160 --> 56:35.800
Our Windows and Mac-using friends aren't left out, too.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.680
There is a download for them as well.

56:37.680 --> 56:40.320
Yeah, you just kind of find the auto defrag mode

56:40.320 --> 56:42.600
and then just sit back and enjoy the show.

56:42.600 --> 56:43.880
It's a little bit of nostalgia.

56:43.880 --> 56:46.120
Well, you just need then a little hard drive

56:46.120 --> 56:50.520
seeking sound effect, you know, as it's

56:50.520 --> 56:52.320
moving all the stuff around.

56:52.320 --> 56:53.200
That's sort of perfect.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.680
So check out ZFrag.

56:54.680 --> 56:58.640
The URL is not friendly for air.

56:58.640 --> 57:01.480
So you're just going to have to get it from the show notes.

57:01.480 --> 57:04.960
And then Cheesy coming in with old Mesh Room, which

57:04.960 --> 57:07.360
looks like some high-end stuff.

57:07.360 --> 57:08.160
This is really cool.

57:08.160 --> 57:09.160
And it's open source.

57:09.160 --> 57:10.480
Yeah, so Mesh Room.

57:10.480 --> 57:13.400
And I just started getting into photogrammetry,

57:13.400 --> 57:18.200
which is basically where you use photos to help you determine

57:18.200 --> 57:19.720
distances and depths.

57:19.720 --> 57:24.040
And you can use it for mapping and those sorts of things.

57:24.040 --> 57:25.640
But you could also, say, use it if you

57:25.640 --> 57:28.020
wanted to take a bunch of photos of your boss

57:28.020 --> 57:30.080
and create a bobblehead of his head.

57:30.080 --> 57:30.760
Sorry, what?

57:30.760 --> 57:31.400
Yeah, exactly.

57:31.400 --> 57:32.960
Oh, oh, we do want to do that.

57:32.960 --> 57:37.280
So I was just looking at some different photogrammetry tools

57:37.280 --> 57:38.320
to do this with.

57:38.320 --> 57:40.840
And I came across this one.

57:40.840 --> 57:43.360
Mesh Room is produced by Alice Vision.

57:43.360 --> 57:45.760
They also have another application.

57:45.760 --> 57:50.200
And it looks like they support Windows and Linux.

57:50.200 --> 57:51.820
So sorry, Mac folks.

57:51.820 --> 57:55.720
But you should take a look at it if you're into photogrammetry.

57:55.720 --> 57:57.940
If you're not into it, maybe you have a 3D printer

57:57.940 --> 57:59.560
and you want to do something different.

57:59.560 --> 58:03.800
And you could go to some statue in your town

58:03.800 --> 58:07.880
and take a ton of photos of it and use this Mesh Room

58:07.880 --> 58:10.420
to put it all together and 3D print an object for yourself.

58:10.420 --> 58:11.240
Oh, man.

58:11.240 --> 58:13.320
Now I'm never going to hear the end of it from Alex.

58:13.320 --> 58:15.080
This whole week he's been trying to get

58:15.080 --> 58:17.200
me to get a 3D printer.

58:17.200 --> 58:19.240
Now it's my excuse.

58:19.240 --> 58:23.080
There's life before 3D printing, a life after.

58:23.080 --> 58:25.720
Well, you just have to find space in the rig for it, I guess.

58:25.720 --> 58:26.680
I think I could fit it.

58:26.680 --> 58:28.560
Because I'm sitting next to Alex's right now

58:28.560 --> 58:30.160
in his studio here.

58:30.160 --> 58:32.960
And now I understand why when he's on the post show,

58:32.960 --> 58:33.960
you can hear his printer.

58:33.960 --> 58:37.120
Because it's within arm's reach of the microphone.

58:37.120 --> 58:37.880
It's pretty cool.

58:37.880 --> 58:40.240
I think that would totally fit in the RV, too.

58:40.240 --> 58:41.080
There's really no excuse.

58:41.080 --> 58:42.160
I could put that in a storage bay.

58:42.160 --> 58:44.040
I could have a 3D printer in a storage bay,

58:44.040 --> 58:45.640
like a replicator bay.

58:45.640 --> 58:48.480
You could 3D print some storage for your 3D printer.

58:48.480 --> 58:48.980
Totally.

58:48.980 --> 58:49.880
That would be nice.

58:49.880 --> 58:50.800
I like it.

58:50.800 --> 58:52.440
Yeah, some meta boxes.

58:52.440 --> 58:53.680
That's what I'll call them.

58:53.680 --> 58:55.720
All right, well, before we get out of here,

58:55.720 --> 58:57.600
just a couple of bits of business.

58:57.600 --> 59:00.040
Everything's over at linuxunplugged.com.

59:00.040 --> 59:02.080
Of course, check out the self-hosted show.

59:02.080 --> 59:03.800
A couple of other things to check out.

59:03.800 --> 59:05.720
Go listen to our friends over at Ubuntu Podcast.

59:05.720 --> 59:07.060
They're not here this week, but they're still great.

59:07.060 --> 59:08.320
So we'll give them a plug.

59:08.320 --> 59:12.360
Of course, TechSnap with Mr. Wes Payne and Jim Salter

59:12.360 --> 59:13.360
from Ars Technica.

59:13.360 --> 59:14.760
Check out TechSnap.

59:14.760 --> 59:17.120
Better than ever, you guys are killing TechSnap.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.160
So if you haven't listened to TechSnap for a while,

59:19.160 --> 59:20.240
go grab that.

59:20.240 --> 59:24.000
And of course, go listen to Choose Linux with both Drew

59:24.000 --> 59:24.720
and Ell on it.

59:24.720 --> 59:26.120
And Joe, he's on there.

59:26.120 --> 59:27.280
Great show.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.720
Always some fun distributions you guys are trying out.

59:29.720 --> 59:31.760
Do you want to give any teasing for the one that's

59:31.760 --> 59:35.440
coming up this week, since you guys are likely in the know?

59:35.440 --> 59:36.400
Sure.

59:36.400 --> 59:39.480
So we're going to be talking about Slackl.

59:39.480 --> 59:42.840
That's a distribution based on Slackl.

59:42.840 --> 59:45.960
It's based on Slackware and Salix.

59:48.960 --> 59:49.480
Sorry, Drew.

59:49.480 --> 59:51.080
It sounds like you're saying Slackl.

59:51.080 --> 59:52.680
That doesn't make any sense.

59:52.680 --> 59:54.560
I'm sorry, Drew.

59:54.560 --> 59:56.160
That's what you get when Drew drinks.

59:56.160 --> 59:58.360
That's the name of the distro.

59:58.360 --> 59:59.640
Oh, OK.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.120
So it's based on Slackware, huh?

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:01.960
Yeah.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:02.680
Cool.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.880
I'll definitely check that out.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.760
I always do.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:05.480
So there's that.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.480
And also, I'm going to give one more plug because I'm

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.440
feeling generous today.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.320
You've got to go check out UserAir.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.400
And then tweet, myself and at Joe Resington,

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:17.960
top or bottom bunk after you listen to UserAir.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.880
I've got to know.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.080
All right.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.420
That's all the plugging I have.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.880
Thank you so much for joining us.

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.960
I'm at Chris LAS.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.920
He's at Westpane.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.280
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.720
Be sure to check out selfhosted.show next week.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.240
And we will see you next Tuesday.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.640
Bye-bye.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.520
Cassidy, so welcome.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.520
You just got back a little bit ago from Guadic.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.920
Thanks for making it on the show, man.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.200
Guadic was incredible.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.400
It was my second year this year.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.480
And we were in Greece on the beach.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.600
Oh, it's hard to beat that.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.480
Yeah, it was so good.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.920
So Guadic, is it just for Gnomies?

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.960
Is it worth somebody like myself going?

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.000
I think it's worth anybody who uses Gnome or uses

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
stuff that's based on Gnome.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.720
I mean, other than Gnome, I think

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.280
uses stuff that's based on Gnome.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.160
Elementary is trying to go there every year now.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.080
And we're not strictly Gnome-based,

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.440
but we work with Gnome on stuff.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.640
So it's just a lot of really cool people

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.040
building a lot of really cool stuff

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.520
and sharing what they're working on.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.880
How big of a presence is Endless there?

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.720
They're always there.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.280
I don't know.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.360
I think there's a handful of people there always.

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.840
Man, I wish they'd have it somewhere

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.720
where it would be a little bit easier for me to get to.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.840
And I'd totally go.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.640
I think that does sound like it'd be nice.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.200
So next year, the two intense, so they

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.400
bid for the location every year.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.520
One of the bids is for Mexico.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.440
I forget what city, but it's somewhere in Mexico,

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.760
which is a little closer for me to get to.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.680
Yeah, I could probably make the one in Mexico.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.720
That sounds really fun.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.120
Yeah, that does sound great.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:17.880
I mean, if it has to be in a nice location

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.000
with great weather, I mean, that's OK, I guess.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:21.960
We'll rough it?

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.440
No, we have to.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.120
Well, I'm really glad you've enjoyed it.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.120
It does seem like it's pretty important for elementary

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:29.680
to be there.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.880
Because like you said, you don't use Gnome Shell.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.440
Gnome Shell, I'm trying to say Gnome this episode.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.640
But you do use a lot of the stack, like a lot of the stack,

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:39.240
don't you?

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.680
Yeah, we use basically all the underlying stuff,

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.720
just a different UI.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.160
So it's really important that things like GTK and GLib

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.560
are being developed not just with Gnome in mind,

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.920
but with these other downstreams like XFCE and elementary.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.120
I got a funny, just anecdotal story for you.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.840
Not that it really matters, but I just

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.040
thought it was interesting.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:04.080
I decided to reinstall my wife's XPS 13 from Kubuntu,

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.200
which had been great.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.160
But just some things had collected over time,

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.880
and I thought, let's do a fresh install.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.800
And I put her on the latest elementary.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.280
It's even got the new login, which looks really slick.

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.320
And she felt like I upgraded her whole computer.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.800
She felt like it was a more professional, elegant

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.360
experience.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.120
She really took to it a lot more than I thought she would.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.600
So it's two of my family now in elementary OS.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.360
You're next.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.000
You know what?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:28.960
I could see it.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.640
I could definitely see it.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.240
Yeah, well, and I run it myself, and I'm also a supporter.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:40.160
So I think JB is definitely covering the elementary aspect

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.120
with private machines, that's for sure.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:42.800
There you go.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.040
Yeah, we do.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.400
We love it.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.720
Well, I'm glad you made it.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.800
Thanks for coming today.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.140
Yeah, absolutely.

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.640
I also just got back from somewhere kind of neat.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.320
Just a little bit before the show,

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.520
Alex arranged a tour of Red Hat Tour.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.320
He works at Red Hat on OpenShift as part of his day job

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.280
over there.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.000
And so we called him up and said,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.920
hey, I'd like to give this podcaster guy a tour of Red Hat

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.160
Tower in downtown Raleigh.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.040
And after some back and forth, as happens with PR departments

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.960
and whatnot, they arranged it for us.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.840
I got to go there.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.680
And let me tell you, this office is

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.480
decked out with glass gates.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.680
And they have a badge culture.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:25.040
I mean, the security around this place is top notch.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:29.720
There is a real culture around everybody badges in.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.120
Even if somebody holds the door open for you, you still badge in.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.440
Well, you don't want stragglers.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.000
Come on.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.960
You get your picture printed on your guest badge.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.520
But a beautiful office.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.980
Not only just high quality interior stuff,

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:47.800
but beautiful displays, glass artwork, huge open windows,

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.360
interesting different kind of workspaces,

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.520
and of course, cafeterias and snacks.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.600
Lots of snacks.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.680
Lots of snacks.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:58.000
But there was one thing that Alex had his eyes on,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.760
like 10 minutes after we got there.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.080
And this is part of that sandwich that they made for me

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:02.760
earlier.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.420
What is it, Alex?

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.160
What is this?

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.800
He goes and he buys a sauce from the cafeteria.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.080
It's so funny, because if you get the sauce anywhere else,

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.600
you've got to pay an arm and a leg.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.300
I've got to deal with the cafeteria guy.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:17.480
He sells me a big pot of Chipotle gourmets for $10.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.600
They get a hookup here.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:22.320
So they got the food system, which is all sort of discount

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.360
or subsidized, however you want to put it.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.360
But Wes, get ready for this perk.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.480
Are you ready for this?

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.360
Ooh, tell me, tell me.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.680
They've got a post office.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.200
No, just like right there?

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:33.960
In the building.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.000
You go up to it.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.160
You give them something you need to ship.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:36.880
They'll weigh it.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:37.700
They'll box it.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.440
They'll ship it.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.680
And then the cost of the postage is subsidized.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.460
No.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:42.960
Yes.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.960
How does that make sense?

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.760
That's incredible.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.100
I tell you what, that's a serious perk.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.120
It's almost making me want to send mail.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.240
I know.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.000
You know how I hate sending mail.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.520
But I mean, come on, right?

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.600
That seems pretty serious.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.560
That seems legitimate.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.960
So I was pleasantly surprised with my tour.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.540
It's a corporate office space, but it's

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:04.560
one with a lot of accoutrements, a lot of nice accoutrements.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.600
I was really impressed.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.840
It's a pretty nice place to work, it seems.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:12.080
And you have one of the best views of downtown Raleigh

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.080
from this red hat tower.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.480
It even has a red hat.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:22.040
And happy to report, they are so on point with the branding.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.920
You know the new red hat logo?

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:38.960
They've even updated the signs in the parking garage.
