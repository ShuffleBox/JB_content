1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
So I got this text message from DHL, the delivery service,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,000
saying, hey, your thing from China is about to arrive.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Are you going to sign for it?

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,160
And I'm thinking to myself, thing from China?

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,360
What did I order from China?

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,600
You ever have this problem?

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,880
Or maybe I'm just ordering too many things.

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,720
I think you're ordering too many things.

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,560
So we open up the box, and we pulled out

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,960
what was basically 100 little different parts

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,800
that once you assemble it, you have the Clockwork Pi

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,000
dev terminal.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This thing's really retro looking.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,440
Yeah, it was super fun to put together, too.

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,400
I will admit, we did look at it for about three minutes

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,480
once we opened the box and said, what is this thing again?

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,320
Why does it have a thermal printer?

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,680
Once we dug into it, though, it's actually really great.

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,000
They set it up so that you can just build the thing yourself,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,880
which was a fun experience, really.

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,520
Yeah, it snaps together.

22
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,640
And I know your son, Dylan, was super interested,

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,520
because I was able to, in front of him, just take it all apart.

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,800
And then we built it up again.

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,840
And it was really fun and modular.

26
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,200
So it's basically, I guess it's Pi-based.

27
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,440
You're going to fill me in.

28
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,680
You got the details in front of you here.

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,760
Yeah, Pi 3 base.

30
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,840
So this is the Clockwork Pi dev term.

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,960
And it's got a full keyboard on it, which is impressive.

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,480
It also has lots of USB inputs, got three USB-As, USB-C power,

33
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,320
and also can run on batteries, lithium batteries.

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Yeah, it doesn't come with the lithium batteries,

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,100
but they're just a standard size that you can order from Amazon.

36
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,200
And we did just that.

37
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,320
It runs Armbian, which was fun.

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,360
That was my first dive into that.

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,120
And this expansion port with the thermal printer, I thought,

40
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,080
would be kind of fun.

41
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,440
So we're looking for ideas of what to do with this thing.

42
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,560
It also has a mini trackball at the very top of the keyboard.

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,760
A la Blackberry.

44
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,080
Yeah, exactly.

45
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,500
And then on the far right side of the keyboard,

46
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,440
above the Backspace key, it has a X, Y, B, and A

47
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,000
sort of Super Nintendo-style gamepad buttons.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,560
It has arrow key buttons on the far left side of it.

49
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,360
It's pretty fascinating.

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,360
I'll be honest, a little tough to type on in that size.

51
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,860
It's true.

52
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,400
It's just right for Dylan's hands.

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,320
It was fine once I taped those pencils onto my fingers.

54
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,880
Right.

55
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,680
I just shaved down my nails real good.

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,120
And ours also makes a hilariously loud buzzing noise.

57
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,640
It's really too bad when you have it

58
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,800
plugged into the power source, which in this case

59
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,760
is a USB-C power source.

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,560
It kind of does that electronic hum that everybody hates.

61
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,680
And so we were thinking of having it in the studio

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
to control the soundboard for guests and stuff.

63
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,400
But it's just so irritating.

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,000
It's too noisy.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,040
It's fine with the battery.

66
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,200
Right.

67
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,600
Once you charge up the batteries, it's totally fine.

68
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,160
So now I'm just thinking there's going

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,280
to be some way that we could have something that prints out

70
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,800
on that thermal printer from time to time,

71
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
because that's just too much fun.

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,920
Someone once suggested the, well,

73
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,200
it was Dylan actually that suggested having the Bitcoin

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
price once an hour just print out on this thing.

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,700
Oh, no.

76
00:02:49,700 --> 00:03:02,720
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

77
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,520
My name is Chris.

78
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,320
And my name is Wes.

79
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,840
Hello.

80
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,600
My name is Brent.

81
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Oh, hey, Brent.

82
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,960
Yeah, Wes is actually out on assignment

83
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,280
trying to work out a distribution deal with Spotify

84
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,040
because everybody's doing it.

85
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,040
But this week, we thought maybe it was the perfect moment

86
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,360
to talk about how open source can help save podcasting.

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,560
Really, what I mean by that is keep

88
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,400
podcasting independent and decentralized

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,080
so it doesn't end up behind these giant corporate platforms

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
like Spotify.

91
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,000
Not that we have any problem with you choosing

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,320
to listen in Spotify.

93
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,200
In fact, we think that's an important aspect.

94
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,320
You should have the right to choose any player you want.

95
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,360
And that's what we're trying to protect here.

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,440
And it turns out open source is the key.

97
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,000
So we thought at this point, this time of the year,

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,040
maybe we should talk about this.

99
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,520
Because it's something that's what's

100
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,360
going to impact all of you all out there.

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,320
And then to help us get through the feedback

102
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,280
after we're done with our interview with Dave,

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,640
we have our buddy from Self hosted.

104
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,580
Hello, Alex.

105
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,680
Welcome back to Linux.

106
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Unplug, sir.

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,120
I like what you've done with the place.

108
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,800
It's nice.

109
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,280
Yeah.

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,800
Cozy.

111
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, you know, when Brent's here, projects get done.

112
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,940
They do.

113
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,600
Oh, did we send him the picture of you

114
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,640
and Hadid with the construction in the bathroom?

115
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,200
No, we didn't.

116
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,320
Oh, we shouldn't do that.

117
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,560
Brent's been doing bathroom construction while he's here.

118
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Few renos at the studio.

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,000
We did fix the fence, too.

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,760
Oh, yeah.

121
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,840
That is actually a good thing.

122
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,640
That fence needed.

123
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,400
It got blown over.

124
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,720
Keeps the dog in the house.

125
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,180
Yeah, the wind was strong that night, Brent.

126
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,320
It's handy having Brent here in multiple ways.

127
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,680
So before we get into the show, before I tell you about what

128
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,120
we've got coming up, we've got to do

129
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
a little bit of business here.

130
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,440
We've got to say hello to our virtual time appropriate

131
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,560
greetings, Mumble Room.

132
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,440
Hello.

133
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,800
Hello.

134
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,720
Hello, everybody.

135
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,440
Thank you for being here on a Sunday.

136
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,200
It's nice to see.

137
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,440
We've got about 21 people joining us in there today.

138
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,080
A lot of people just choosing to hang out

139
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,720
in the quiet listening, probably kind of cool on a Sunday.

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,120
You know, you pop in, you get a nice high quality opus

141
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,520
codec and low latency, and you get to listen to the show.

142
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,640
And if you want to say something,

143
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,980
you can pop in the On Air channel.

144
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,680
Perfect for doing your Sunday chores.

145
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
And it could get even more real if you want

146
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,360
to join us here at the studio.

147
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,360
We have a meetup coming January 30,

148
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,320
right here at our humble little abode.

149
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,960
I have the meetup page up now.

150
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,560
I'm going to use a meetup for this one.

151
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,720
So go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

152
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,360
for the event details there.

153
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,320
We're going to make it a birthday party for myself,

154
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,480
a little hangout and chow.

155
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,200
I'm going to encourage people to bring their favorite dish,

156
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,320
although you don't have to.

157
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,440
Food will also be supplied.

158
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,680
We just want to see your smiling faces,

159
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,440
because it's a big number, this one.

160
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,200
Sounds like a podcast potluck to me.

161
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,640
Yeah, it is kind of a podcast potluck.

162
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,940
So what I was thinking, and I haven't really

163
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,980
sorted out all the details yet.

164
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,980
I don't know if people are interested in this.

165
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,040
What I was thinking is people show up around,

166
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,440
what did I put in there, like 11, 11.30, or something

167
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
like that AM.

168
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,900
Now, we could do it another way.

169
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,780
But what I was what I was consternating on

170
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,400
is people show up, do the meet and greet, get snacks going,

171
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
and then we do a live Linux unplugged.

172
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,280
Put the speaker out there, put the screen up,

173
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,120
and everybody attends a live Linux unplugged.

174
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,360
And then afterwards, we break out all the food

175
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
and start eating.

176
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,640
I don't know, that seems like kind of the way to do it.

177
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,440
So if you're interested in attending a live Linux

178
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,560
unplugged, I mean, you'll be out in the other room,

179
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,000
but you'll be listening live.

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,520
And you want to then chow down with us for my big four zero,

181
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,700
go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

182
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,000
And if you have a small vessel of flight,

183
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,480
we do have a local airport about 10 minutes from the studio.

184
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,000
It's true.

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,160
We have to mention that because in the past, listeners

186
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,280
have flown in for meetups.

187
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,000
That's true.

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,760
There's one just here that interrupts us.

189
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,320
You know what?

190
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,800
I mean, we're just saying.

191
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,480
We're just saying.

192
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,400
You never know.

193
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,920
And then before we get in, if you've

194
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
been listening recently, before we get into the main topic

195
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,400
today, I just want to give you a brief update on our server.

196
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,080
Just been doing the migration thing.

197
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,600
Although, Brent, this is so tricky when Wes isn't around

198
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,160
because he may have had the solution,

199
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,400
but twice this week, I ended up finding these pieces

200
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,720
of rando software that I just wanted to try out.

201
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,600
You don't install those on the server, do you?

202
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,320
Well, this is where I think maybe I should

203
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,960
have set up a Proxima Xbox.

204
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,700
But I thought, it's safe.

205
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,320
But yeah, I'm going to run it on the server

206
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,760
because I want to hear on the LAN.

207
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,720
But that was not the way to go because all of these just all

208
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,520
assume Docker.

209
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,920
They all, and it's like some of them

210
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,920
are a shell script that assumes you have Docker.

211
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,680
Ultimately, I ended up not doing it on the server

212
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,920
because we're using Podman.

213
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,600
And I ended up doing it on the Linode.

214
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,880
But I ran into it, it was just kind of funny

215
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,240
because we're like, we're going to try doing Podman.

216
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,120
And we have probably 30 containers that are Docker.

217
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,760
And how many have we transitioned successfully so

218
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,260
far?

219
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,760
Two.

220
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,260
Ah.

221
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, it's been bumpy.

222
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,160
It hasn't been as smooth as I was hoping.

223
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,320
I think Wes would probably be quicker at it, but you know.

224
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,900
You and I are just hopeless, I think.

225
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,840
Well, and you know me, I'm doing five things at once, right?

226
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,120
So I'll actually spend five minutes on the actual task

227
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,240
where Wes will just wait for us all to go to bed

228
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,440
so we stop messaging him, and then he'll just get it done.

229
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,040
So that continues.

230
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,960
We'll have more updates on that soon.

231
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,160
But Brent is also going to put out the word to help

232
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,440
us build a server cabinet.

233
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,400
You're looking for input?

234
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,320
You've got a few ideas.

235
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,360
Yeah, I think we've been thinking about this ever

236
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,720
since these servers showed up is.

237
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,320
We don't want to cook them next summer.

238
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,660
Yeah, that was an issue we were worried about on our trip

239
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,480
to Denver this year was the heat in that garage.

240
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,160
And we even considered keeping the garage

241
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,800
open a little bit throughout the trip, which obviously

242
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,520
has some implications.

243
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,560
So cooking up, I think, in the back of our minds

244
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,880
has been, what is the solution?

245
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,760
And I came up with so far, but I'm looking for some input.

246
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,980
Building a little server cabinet,

247
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,440
it doesn't need to be huge, but it needs to be adequate

248
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,480
and needs to hold, I think, a few servers while we're

249
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,720
doing some migrations.

250
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,840
Possibly as many as three servers.

251
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,920
And I wondered if network equipment

252
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,160
could be thrown in there, too, just to clean things up a little.

253
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,120
Probably should be.

254
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,560
You could always go down the Ikea lack route, the lack rack.

255
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,880
So most servers are 19 inches wide,

256
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,680
and a lack table is exactly 19 inches wide.

257
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,440
Well, I was thinking of using real wood,

258
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,080
but I will explore that.

259
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,040
I was thinking of using cardboard.

260
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,240
It's true, he didn't mention cardboard and hot glue.

261
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,280
I'm like, we've got a lot of boxes.

262
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,080
The thing about the lack setup is it's super cheap.

263
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,960
A lack table is like $15, and lumber prices at the moment,

264
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,480
they're almost back to normal.

265
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,120
I think it's a great suggestion, and I'm

266
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,000
at the phase where I'm looking, just scouring for ideas.

267
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,120
So I would love to check that out.

268
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,200
It sounds like the route I should go if I didn't have a brand.

269
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
Mayhaps.

270
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
I mean, I built a rack out of two by fours

271
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,080
that's been sat in my basement now

272
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,320
for the last three or four years working just fine.

273
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,720
I mean, that is the beauty of it.

274
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,480
Once you build it once, it's done forever.

275
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,400
And a lot of guys actually that do Bitcoin mining

276
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,960
build these plywood boxes to put their servers in,

277
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,920
and then they have air filters and stuff

278
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,080
like that on the intakes, and just use passive cooling

279
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,920
to pull the air through and cool it sufficiently.

280
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,520
I think in the winter, passive cooling

281
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,320
would be perfect for this box.

282
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,920
The summer, I think there's an opportunity there.

283
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,920
And Alex, I think this might tickle a few of your fancies.

284
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,880
I think there's an opportunity to maybe connect

285
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,600
some kind of cooling mechanism, so maybe a household air

286
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,200
conditioner, but to also connect that

287
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,960
to something like Home Assistant to control it and have

288
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,960
a look at it while, I don't know, Chris,

289
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,720
you're traveling and such.

290
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,120
Get a few ESP boards involved and measure those metrics

291
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,920
and find out what your parameters are.

292
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,560
Sure.

293
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,120
And why could we not share this design?

294
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,640
I'd like it to be approachable.

295
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,760
I have knowledge in building stuff with wood.

296
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,240
Alex, you've done some furniture building and stuff like that.

297
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,880
We should just do a springtime project out here or something.

298
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,280
You know, Alex was telling me that he's

299
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,560
considering buying a CNC.

300
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,240
So this is really where this conversation is going.

301
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,800
I would like to, but they are so expensive.

302
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,360
You know, I have run into some maker spaces

303
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,520
that have CNC's and stuff.

304
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,160
So maybe we could look up one of those.

305
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,560
But anyways, I'm looking for suggestions.

306
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,000
We want it to be climate controlled.

307
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,600
I think having it on casters might

308
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,320
be kind of neat to move it around.

309
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,560
You know, we could build it into the wall, but maybe.

310
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,840
Casters could be nice.

311
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,120
So that's an idea.

312
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,600
Also, where I was going was thinking

313
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,800
about working on this thing.

314
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,320
If it's a sealed box, it's going to be a pain to work on.

315
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,680
So I'm thinking removable front and back panels.

316
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,360
Sure.

317
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,040
You're going to need some working room from time to time.

318
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,560
That's it.

319
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,080
So even if you're doing a big server migration

320
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,080
or adding something to it, you could just roll it out,

321
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,880
take the front and back panels off,

322
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,440
get some access to all the parts and things.

323
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,000
So that's kind of where I was going.

324
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,960
I think our trickiest thing is going

325
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,280
to be cooling because we don't have like an outside wall.

326
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,240
We can drill a hole for venting.

327
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,680
We do have the roof.

328
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,280
Yeah.

329
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,200
Yeah, we could go out.

330
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,560
We could go out the roof.

331
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,880
There's a crawl area up there we could vent into,

332
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,520
which has some vents.

333
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,560
It's possible, although it gets very hot up there.

334
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,360
I think in general, you'd be surprised

335
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,240
with how little active cooling you would need.

336
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,880
Just a little bit of airflow is probably

337
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,040
so that the air isn't stagnant and just reheating itself.

338
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,240
That's probably all you need.

339
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,440
You need a source of fresh air and then a way to exhaust it.

340
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,040
And probably not even in massive volumes either.

341
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,200
That's probably a good point.

342
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,920
I mean, I'm not an expert in doing this kind of stuff.

343
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
Just getting the hot air out.

344
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,040
The only problem is all of the air in the garage

345
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,080
is very hot because the garage roof is

346
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,720
exposed to the afternoon sun.

347
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,080
So it just really heats up and the door as well.

348
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,960
We could consider a fresh air intake

349
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,760
as well that pokes out of the garage.

350
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,320
So there are possibilities.

351
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,160
But if anyone has some ideas or has even

352
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,800
built something like this, please.

353
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
Linuxonblog.com slash contact would be a great way

354
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,080
to send in your suggestions.

355
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,920
I'm open to receiving photographs and diagrams

356
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,560
and sketches and websites and things.

357
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,200
Things you've tried.

358
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,720
Please.

359
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,880
Hard lessons you've learned.

360
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,360
Please.

361
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,840
Help us keep our servers alive.

362
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,760
Or some crazy thing you want us to try.

363
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,840
Yeah.

364
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,000
Also, I'll just do a mention for extras.show.

365
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,960
Go to extras.show slash subscribe

366
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,400
because we have a couple of things coming up in the feed.

367
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,200
We just published Why Linux Will Win in 20 Years.

368
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,080
That was one of many topics that we covered.

369
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,480
We just had a whole list of topics we were talking about.

370
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,600
We threw them into a randomizer and covered them.

371
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,760
And some stuff that we wouldn't normally think of touching on

372
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,480
came up.

373
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,600
It was good to revisit.

374
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,560
Many of those topics came from listeners in our feedback

375
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,360
forms and were maybe topics that we didn't quite

376
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,040
find a slot for yet in the shows.

377
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
But we just threw them all in there

378
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,560
and hit the random button.

379
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,480
And it was really fun.

380
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,680
Yeah.

381
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,560
So check that out.

382
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,280
That'll be at extras.show already.

383
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,640
And then coming up in a couple of days,

384
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,760
it's our Denver road trip memories.

385
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,240
The secret about the Denver road trip

386
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,440
is during the entire trip, Brent and I were recording.

387
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,320
And we got a ton of audio that we've never

388
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,200
played on air before.

389
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,040
And we're going to start publishing some of that.

390
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,160
And the first one goes out just a couple of days

391
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,440
after this episode is published.

392
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,960
And then a few days after that extra is published,

393
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,400
the tech we used for our road trip will be published.

394
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,640
And that's a deep dive into everything

395
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,200
from the automation systems on the RV to the networking gear

396
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,000
that we use, the power tech that we used,

397
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,240
and obviously the recording stuff that we used as well.

398
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,520
So it's like a whole rundown of everything.

399
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,000
And it goes into the good and bad.

400
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,160
I mean, we had some failures that caused us some issues.

401
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,080
So those are always fun to talk about.

402
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,640
Yeah.

403
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,440
So that'll be published on extras.show in a few days.

404
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,040
It's all coming out over there.

405
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,440
And just a little spat of extra content for you,

406
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,840
because we love you.

407
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,560
Linode.com slash unplugged.

408
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,680
Go there to get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account.

409
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,320
And go there to support the show.

410
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,720
And go there to try out Stream 9.

411
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,160
CentOS Stream 9 is now available on Linode.

412
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,800
You could try it out with one of those systems that has MVME

413
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,600
storage.

414
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,960
I mean, I don't know why.

415
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,320
Because honestly, all their systems are screaming fast.

416
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,800
And the price is great.

417
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,760
This is a great time to go sign up for Linode.

418
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,040
It's the beginning of the year.

419
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,600
If you've been listening to the show for a little while

420
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,760
and you've been thinking about doing it,

421
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,400
why not pull the trigger right here in January?

422
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,320
Kick it off with Linode.

423
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
So go to Linode.com slash unplugged.

424
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,120
Get that $100 and really try it out.

425
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,400
I mean, Linode's giving you real money there to work with,

426
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,520
because they're confident that if they give you

427
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,160
an amount that lets you spend some time,

428
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,240
you're going to love it.

429
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,280
You're going to see why it's better.

430
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,680
You'll see the super fast systems, the easy deploy,

431
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,920
one-click applications.

432
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
I mean, they've been doing this for 18 years.

433
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,960
So as you use the system, you'll start

434
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,280
to appreciate all the small little edge cases

435
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
that the experience has brought them.

436
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,680
And the passion for the technology

437
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,400
that underpins all of this, Linux,

438
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,560
is what brought them into this.

439
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,160
And even 18 years later, you can still

440
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,320
see that DNA in the product.

441
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,640
And Linode has learned that customer support is critical.

442
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,520
So they have invested in the absolute best customer

443
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,160
support in the business.

444
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,840
I get notes from listeners all the time.

445
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,800
In fact, please keep sending them in.

446
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,760
Just go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact

447
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,520
and tell us your story with Linode,

448
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,240
because it's great to hear it.

449
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,760
It really has resonated with our community,

450
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,000
because it hits on all those key points.

451
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,360
Performance, customer support, a Linux culture that runs deep.

452
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,800
They support the community.

453
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,000
They support events.

454
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,200
They support a lot of Linux content creators.

455
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,560
And they support projects and free software

456
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,040
that enable all of this.

457
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,680
They really get investing in the entire ecosystem.

458
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,320
So let's go put everything over the top.

459
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,440
Go grab that $100 in credit and support the show.

460
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,080
Go to linode.com slash unplugged.

461
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,320
Chris, you had the opportunity to sit down with Dave Jones.

462
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,600
And he's working over at the Podcast Index.

463
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,920
And it sounds like they're doing some pretty interesting stuff

464
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,360
over there.

465
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,520
Yeah, they're calling it Podcasting 2.0.

466
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,240
And I like it.

467
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,120
I think it's a great name.

468
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,780
It really describes what they're trying to do.

469
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,720
And I thought, this is a topic that impacts all of us.

470
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,320
They're using open source to try to decentralize and keep

471
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,640
podcasting independent for those who want it, to give listeners

472
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,280
the choice of app and way of listening, however you want.

473
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,720
It's, you know, keep it an RSS feed that you consume.

474
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,320
And so we thought, this is a great moment to sit down,

475
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,320
talk about these challenges, maybe more so right now

476
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
than ever.

477
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,280
Podcasting is in a precarious place right now.

478
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,360
There's a lot of really big interests

479
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,160
that are trying to influence the market.

480
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,160
There's downward pressure on the price of advertising.

481
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,840
And there's just a lot of podcasts.

482
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,040
Not to mention, certain players in the market

483
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,000
are beginning to move forward with agendas that are really

484
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,880
kind of aimed at locking podcasts up into their silos

485
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,080
and monetizing them even further.

486
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,000
So my guest today is Dave Jones.

487
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,200
And along with Adam Curry, they launched their Podcasting 2.0

488
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,640
initiative about a year and a half ago.

489
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,440
It's a platform that has an index and an umbrella

490
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,520
of open source applications and an API.

491
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,840
So we kicked off the conversation

492
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,800
when I asked Dave what sparked the idea

493
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,240
for a decentralized podcast platform in the first place.

494
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,040
I guess the abbreviated version of that

495
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,520
is that a guy I've been working with for a long time,

496
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,960
widely known in podcasting, co-invented podcasting,

497
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,240
is Adam Curry.

498
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,760
And Adam and I had been friends for probably 10 years or more,

499
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,000
working on various projects around RSS

500
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,120
and feed aggregation and OPML.

501
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,320
And we jointly built a show notes

502
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,560
system for his podcast, The No Agenda Show, which is huge.

503
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,360
Got about a million listeners.

504
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,880
And so we had kind of been through the trenches

505
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,040
in aggregation software and RSS.

506
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,720
But he called me about a year and a half ago and said,

507
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,360
maybe a little bit longer back, said, hey,

508
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,360
this whole thing with Apple sort of controlling the default

509
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,680
search, sort of the yellow pages of podcasting, number one,

510
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,440
makes no sense.

511
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,960
And number two, it's concerning with all the deplatforming

512
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,840
going on and all this kind of thing.

513
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,880
And so what you end up with is this

514
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,280
was supposed to be an open, decentralized system

515
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,720
of podcasting built on RSS.

516
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,200
And that's true.

517
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,480
It mostly operates that way.

518
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,800
But then when you look at, in practice,

519
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,400
where do you go to find podcasts and where

520
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,560
do all those things live, everything

521
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,440
goes to Apple, which is literally the largest

522
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,080
company in the world.

523
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,880
So you have this huge dichotomy here

524
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,520
between what podcasting is supposed

525
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,680
to be at a technical level and what it actually

526
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,880
is in practice.

527
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,560
And he's like, we really need to change this.

528
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,360
And we have the chops to do it.

529
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,920
So why don't we get together and create an index

530
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,360
to begin with, an open directory of podcasts,

531
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,840
and then tie an API to it to where any app developer can

532
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,760
write an app and just hook into it for free.

533
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,440
We'll have it be donation-based and not a paid product.

534
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,280
And then we'll do a podcast to go along with it.

535
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,240
And as we build it, we'll just podcast about what we're doing.

536
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,360
And hopefully, we'll get a whole bunch of app developers

537
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,440
on board that are struggling to pay for all the infrastructure

538
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,800
that it takes to run a back end for a podcast app.

539
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,160
We'll make that easier for them.

540
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,560
And in the process, we'll build this alternative directory

541
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,400
to Apple so that we can take that centralization away.

542
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,040
And then in the process, one of the elements of it

543
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,440
will be we'll give the whole database away.

544
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,720
So I was like, hey, that sounds like a challenge.

545
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,360
Sounds fun to do.

546
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,160
Yeah, let's do it.

547
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,280
And so that's kind of where it was born about a year

548
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,360
and a half ago.

549
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,560
It sounds like Apple was definitely a major influencer.

550
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,920
But how much more critical has this idea

551
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,080
become since Spotify has gotten so invested in podcasting?

552
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,840
And I know you're familiar with the fact

553
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,160
that YouTube just announced they want to get involved

554
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,520
with podcasting.

555
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,880
So the idea of a decentralized podcast

556
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,600
index that's essentially just backed

557
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,000
by people who are motivated by podcasts' best interest, right?

558
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,640
I mean, it's great that Adam Curry is involved.

559
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,080
And I sniffed around on the socials and checked out

560
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,400
a couple of the podcasts.

561
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,160
And the motivation is obvious.

562
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,000
You guys want podcast index to be the place that

563
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,160
is sort of a trusted, not connected

564
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,760
to any particular commercial cornering the market interest.

565
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,680
Yeah, that's right.

566
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,960
So we kind of have our motto, if you want to say,

567
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,760
or mission statement, is preserve, protect, and extend

568
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,880
the open podcasting ecosystem in that it's not just words.

569
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,280
There's sort of meaning behind each one of those.

570
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,000
And what you just mentioned was Spotify.

571
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,840
And then later, Apple coming in and beginning

572
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,200
to wall the garden as well with their subscription product

573
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,360
and that kind of thing.

574
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,360
You've always had this effort to wall

575
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,320
the garden around podcasting.

576
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,520
But really, in the last three to four years,

577
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,840
it's gotten to a fever pitch.

578
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,120
And you now have the CEO of Anchor coming out

579
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,880
and saying they're going to actively push their users away

580
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,160
from RSS.

581
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,600
You don't even get an RSS feed when

582
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,760
you start an Anchor podcast unless you request it.

583
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,640
And supposedly, the reasoning behind that is RSS is antiquated

584
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,720
and it can't give the new modern features

585
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,000
that everybody expects from a platform, which

586
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,480
is completely bogus.

587
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,040
But we had this idea to preserve, protect, and extend

588
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,440
podcasting.

589
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,960
And that's really aimed at that.

590
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,680
Where you've got to fend off those walled gardens.

591
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,880
And to do that, you have to have a directory and an API

592
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,240
that everybody can look into that's not

593
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,280
dependent on one of those guys.

594
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,000
And then you decentralize everything.

595
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,840
Don't keep it a single point of failure

596
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,680
because then you're just recreating the same problems

597
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,820
that those guys have.

598
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,280
And then you build around that a vocal group of people

599
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,040
who are like-minded and also are committed

600
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,480
to the open podcasting preservation.

601
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,080
And then finally, you extend it by creating a namespace,

602
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,000
which is what we've done, and just listening and asking

603
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,280
people, what features does everybody want in podcasting?

604
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,440
Technical features and user-facing features.

605
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,000
We've spent the last year just building out

606
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,200
a comprehensive namespace for RSS that has

607
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,440
all of those features in it.

608
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,040
And I can tell you this, there is no silo or walled garden

609
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,080
Spotify, Apple, anybody you want to name

610
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,600
that has anything close to the feature list

611
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,040
that open RSS has at this point.

612
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,000
The podcasting 2.0 tags are killer.

613
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Let's talk about that.

614
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,200
So this is something that, as a content creator that publishes

615
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,800
everything as a podcast, I have felt like this hasn't really

616
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,600
moved much.

617
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,760
And then we started seeing these siloed platforms

618
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,560
introduce their own proprietary features

619
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,680
to go along with podcasting.

620
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,120
But what you guys have done here with this namespace stuff

621
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,320
is super appealing, like really taking podcast chapters

622
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,840
to the next level, for example, allowing images really

623
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,360
to be displayed in line, not necessarily

624
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,800
even with a particular chapter, but with time markers.

625
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,240
And I love the idea of a sound bite

626
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,640
tag that kind of identifies to the podcast player

627
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,240
that the publisher has said this is like a good little preview

628
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,120
sound bite if you'd like to listen to a bit from the show.

629
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,160
I think that's awesome.

630
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,280
I wish we've had that for years.

631
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,400
And that's just like two of a bunch of really good ideas

632
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,160
that are in there.

633
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,440
But it seems to me you've got to get the podcast apps

634
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,120
to support that stuff, right?

635
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah, and that's always the issue.

636
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,720
Whenever you start a project like this, what happens

637
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,640
is immediately people start pelting you from on high

638
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,960
with XKCD comic references.

639
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,680
You know, you've got 13 specs, and you're

640
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,360
going to create a unifying spec, and now you just got 14 specs.

641
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,240
And you just get all this sort of like, not hostility,

642
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,000
but just sort of negativity around, oh, here's

643
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,040
another standard, and they're going to fix everything.

644
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,280
And then you had the chicken and egg problem

645
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,520
of who's going to support it first, the publisher or the app.

646
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,040
And so there's always that kind of thing.

647
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,280
But what we found out was that it's really necessary

648
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,840
to do some of this stuff, even if it slightly recreates

649
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,160
the wheel in some respects.

650
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,800
And I'll give you a perfect example, something

651
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,000
like the funding tag.

652
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,560
Now, you could do this before the podcast namespace funding

653
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,240
tag.

654
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,200
You could have a link to a PayPal.

655
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,760
There's an atom link called rel="payment,"

656
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,360
and you could do that.

657
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,900
And there was some support for it in apps.

658
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,240
It was, I don't know, 50-50.

659
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,400
But you take a thing like that, and then how

660
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,920
do you actually extend it?

661
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,720
There's nowhere to go to talk to the developers

662
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,500
if you needed to tweak that.

663
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,960
Let's say that you're going to try

664
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,200
to tweak something like Dublin Core, which

665
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,640
is another popular namespace extension for RSS.

666
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,080
That committee or working group or whoever had that,

667
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,880
that thing's gone now.

668
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,160
Same with Media RSS, which was part of Yahoo

669
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,240
back a million years ago.

670
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,720
A lot of these things that exist in RSS as namespace extensions,

671
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,480
they have no more leadership anymore.

672
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,640
They have no working groups.

673
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,880
They have no place that you can go

674
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,960
that if you wanted to modify the spec to meet a modern need,

675
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,880
you can't do it, or there's nobody in charge of that thing

676
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,400
anymore.

677
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,520
It's failed.

678
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,560
So what this is is we will recreate the wheel

679
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,200
in some respects with some of these tags,

680
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,280
but they're modern, and there's a group that now exists

681
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,080
that's in control of it.

682
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,800
You can go and say, hey, I think we need this extension

683
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,480
to be tweaked a little bit, or I think

684
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,920
we need this extra attribute on this RSS tag.

685
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,800
And everybody talks about it, and we all

686
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,440
come up with a solution, and it moves forward.

687
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,480
And so one of the things that you talked about

688
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,800
was the soundbite tag.

689
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,120
That didn't come from us.

690
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,800
That came from Buzzsprout, the hosting company.

691
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,720
They had this idea for a soundbite tag for a long time,

692
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,200
and they popped up into the namespace one day and was like,

693
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,760
hey, we've got this soundbite tag.

694
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,400
We're already using it, but no apps have supported it yet.

695
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,440
And so we're like, yeah, this looks great.

696
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Let's formalize it into an actual namespace declaration

697
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,280
and make it happen.

698
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,080
Same with the transcript tag.

699
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,160
We added the transcript tag so you can just

700
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:30,040
take any SRT or WebVTT or JSON-based transcript,

701
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,120
and it's just a URL.

702
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,600
You drop it in your feed item, and you can specify it,

703
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,400
and the app can go look for the transcript

704
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,200
and pull a time code to transcript down

705
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,040
and give you close captioning.

706
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,960
And so it's those types of things

707
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,120
where sometimes we're recreating the wheel.

708
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,920
Sometimes we're creating something new.

709
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,520
But the real purpose of the whole thing

710
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,280
is to have an actual group that exists in perpetuity, that's

711
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,000
open source, that's community-led,

712
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,600
without being dependent on any corporate backing, that

713
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,800
will forever be in charge of this spec

714
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,600
and is purely for the benefit of podcasters.

715
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,440
Finally.

716
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,640
This is my livelihood.

717
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,360
I've been doing this for like 14 years.

718
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,880
I mean, I've been doing it since people

719
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,840
were burning MP3 files to CD-ROMs to listen to my shows.

720
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,240
So I really do appreciate it.

721
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,440
And I know that one of the things we've needed to do

722
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,480
is sort of fill out podcasts a little bit,

723
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,880
give them a little bit richer of an experience.

724
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
They've kind of just been the same for a while.

725
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,040
And I was really worried that some closed ecosystem was

726
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,240
going to be the only way that was going to move forward,

727
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,920
and consumers would move there because of the features.

728
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
But you guys are also doing some other stuff

729
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,600
beyond just the namespace stuff.

730
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,360
Tell me a little bit about Podping,

731
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,840
because that seems like as podcasting gets

732
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,880
way more successful, and you have all these users

733
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,560
with mobile apps and whatnot that are checking in on feeds,

734
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,360
it sounds like Podping is maybe a solution that scales

735
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,360
a little bit better here.

736
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,080
Yeah.

737
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,480
We've tried to, in the second leg of what

738
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,480
we're doing with protecting podcasting,

739
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,520
is decentralizing everything.

740
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,880
So it's really important to decentralize

741
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,200
every bit of our infrastructure so that we don't just become

742
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,160
another single point of failure.

743
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,520
We use IPFS extensively.

744
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,800
We use Activity Pub everywhere we can.

745
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,480
And one of the things we've been doing

746
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
is a lot of blockchain work.

747
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,040
And as sysadmins, which my day job is as a sysadmin

748
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,360
in financial services, is you hear blockchain,

749
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,680
and you roll your eyes, and you're like, oh my god,

750
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,920
here we go again.

751
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,640
And it's like the solution without a problem.

752
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,920
But blockchain does have a very narrow use case,

753
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,560
which it can do that really nothing else can do.

754
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,040
And that's where Podping comes in.

755
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,200
And so this whole web 3.0 world, where these distributed apps

756
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,560
are running on blockchain, we found a blockchain

757
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,240
through a guy who's part of our group, and it's called Hive.

758
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,800
The Hive blockchain.

759
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,480
It produces a new block every three seconds.

760
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,960
And what we've done is created an open piece of software.

761
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,480
It's written in Rust.

762
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,760
And it's basically just a web front end

763
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,000
and a blockchain Hive writer on the back end.

764
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,160
And it just takes an authorization token.

765
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,160
So if you had like Jupiter Broadcasting wanted

766
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,720
to inform the whole world every time you published

767
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,640
a new episode or made a significant change

768
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,200
to your feed, you could call out to Podping

769
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,400
with your auth token and just a simple get request

770
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,600
with the feed URL in it.

771
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,360
And the Podping system will take that URL,

772
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,480
write it to the Hive blockchain, and then everybody

773
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,840
in the world can, since it's a public blockchain,

774
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,520
can just read it with a simple Python script.

775
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,280
And within three seconds, everybody knows, hey,

776
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,040
this podcast has just updated, and you don't have to poll.

777
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,080
You don't have to sit there and hammer your RSS feed 25 times

778
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,600
an hour to see, have you published yet?

779
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,480
Have you published yet?

780
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,440
Over and over.

781
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,240
This is a decentralized blockchain-based push

782
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,160
notification system for podcasting.

783
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,320
So yes, what Podping is.

784
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,000
We're pretty jazzed about it because there's

785
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,600
been attempts to do stuff like this in the past.

786
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,880
The most famous attempt is Websub,

787
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,400
which used to be called PubSubHubbub.

788
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,520
And it works.

789
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,760
But the problem is it's a server-based system.

790
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,400
So if my server is not listening all the time,

791
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,040
I don't get your webhook calls when you publish a new episode.

792
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,480
The other issue with Websub is it's subscription-based.

793
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,720
So if I'm monitoring the podcast index,

794
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,920
we have 4 and 1 half million podcast

795
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,280
feeds in our database, that means

796
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,120
I would have to have 4 and 1 half million Websub

797
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,920
subscriptions that would be resubscribing

798
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,200
every 7 to 15 days.

799
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,420
You'd spend all day just resubscribing to feeds.

800
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,160
So this system is purely push-only.

801
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,800
There's no subscriptions.

802
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,320
It's all just public on the blockchain.

803
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,160
So that's one example of some of the supporting technologies

804
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,000
that go along with the podcast index and the namespace

805
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,560
to flesh out this whole thing and make it decentralized.

806
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,720
The last year and the next year are

807
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,560
going to be totally just change everything kind of situations

808
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,200
for advertising and podcasting.

809
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,080
I have a good sense.

810
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,280
I've been reading the tea leaves,

811
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,000
and there's a lot of downward pressure on the price.

812
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,960
Like the CPM?

813
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,920
Yeah.

814
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,840
And there's certain groups out there

815
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,920
that sort of are establishing themselves

816
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,480
as the authority on podcast advertising.

817
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,440
They're declaring the prices are just

818
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,680
like bottom basement fast food prices for podcast advertising.

819
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,040
And so content creators, podcasters,

820
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,920
we get in this situation where it's like,

821
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,200
well, then I got to just take on more sponsors and more

822
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,680
sponsors.

823
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,080
And you get the shows loaded up.

824
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,960
And then you go to dynamic ad insertion and all that.

825
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,460
Yeah.

826
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah.

827
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,520
Pretty soon you start monetizing the back catalog,

828
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,800
and the ads are hard cut in there.

829
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,000
And it's kind of like you end up these podcasters,

830
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,880
and I've tempted fate with this for a little while.

831
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,680
You end up kind of creating content

832
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,600
to serve the sponsors, not to serve the audience.

833
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,920
And I think that's why I really perked up

834
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,080
when I saw that you guys have adopted and are sort

835
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,240
of encouraging people to use a value for value model

836
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,440
to support podcasters.

837
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,520
And you're building tools in there for them.

838
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,440
Quickly, a value for value model is simply

839
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,600
if you get value from the podcaster, from the content,

840
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,000
you give them the value you think it was worth to you.

841
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,240
Value for value, and it's something

842
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,080
that they practice on the No Agenda Show.

843
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,440
And it's a concept that I think is,

844
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,040
it actually does deserve wider adoption.

845
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,000
So what does this mean for the podcast index?

846
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,840
How is monetizing with value for value,

847
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,120
how does all that come together with something that's

848
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,680
an index for podcasts?

849
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,080
The podcasting 2.0 movement is a little all over the map.

850
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,160
It's a little hard to sort of pin down,

851
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,360
but it's really sort of four parts.

852
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,960
It's the podcast index database and the API.

853
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,040
It's the podcast namespace, and then it's

854
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,880
the infrastructure around it, which

855
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,040
is things you mentioned, like Podping and Helipad

856
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,280
and the podcaster wallet and all this other code.

857
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,160
It's all open source.

858
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,040
It's all in our GitHub repository.

859
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,000
Then it's our show that we do every Friday

860
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,880
called Podcasting 2.0.

861
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,040
And for us, as an example, the Podcasting 2.0 show

862
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,560
is value for value.

863
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,720
And we're purely run on donations.

864
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,400
We don't have any advertising.

865
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,320
And we were sort of the first test case of this new technology

866
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,760
that we wanted to push, which is Bitcoin Lightning streaming

867
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,440
payments.

868
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,960
And so if anybody's not familiar with the Lightning

869
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,360
network on Bitcoin, what it is is this so-called Layer 2

870
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,520
technology.

871
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,400
So the Bitcoin blockchain is fantastic,

872
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:02,320
and we all know why it's trust no one and distributed

873
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,840
and no double spend and all these great things.

874
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,000
But the problem is it's slow.

875
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,760
Transaction times are extremely slow,

876
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,720
and the fees are expensive.

877
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,400
So these Layer 2 technologies have developed Lightning

878
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,560
being the best example.

879
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,960
And so it sits on top of the blockchain

880
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,120
and creates a peer-to-peer distributed network of nodes

881
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,000
that are willing to lock up some funding in channels

882
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,240
between each other.

883
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,120
So what you end up with is a mesh network

884
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,600
of multi-signature wallets, if that makes sense

885
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,560
to anybody listening.

886
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,040
You end up with a mesh network of multi-signature wallets

887
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,520
between nodes so that you can relay payments

888
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,880
between nodes from end to end.

889
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,040
So if I was going to send you, Chris,

890
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,720
if I was going to send you $20 of Bitcoin,

891
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,520
I don't necessarily have to have a direct connection to you.

892
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,880
I could have a connection to three other people who

893
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,200
have a connection to you, and then that payment

894
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,720
can be relayed through the network.

895
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,200
It's awesome technology.

896
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
And it's cheap and fast, too, which is key.

897
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,960
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

898
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,280
The problem with Lightning was it was invoice-based.

899
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,880
So it's like if I was going to pay you,

900
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,000
you would have to send me an invoice for $20,

901
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,440
and then I would scan the QR code of that invoice

902
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,280
or plug in the text invoice number,

903
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,600
and then it would do the payment.

904
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,920
Well, Adam, about a year ago or so,

905
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,200
found a technology called Keysend,

906
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,200
which is a part of the Lightning protocol.

907
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,760
But it just wasn't super widely used.

908
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,880
It basically just allows you to send random invoiceless

909
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,280
payments to another node.

910
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,040
So if I know your node ID on the network,

911
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,760
I can just send you $20.

912
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,120
And you can't even stop me.

913
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,000
It's not like you can say, I don't want it.

914
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,040
You're going to get it.

915
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,840
So this was perfect.

916
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,160
So what we did was we took the name space, the podcast name

917
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:58,040
space, and we put in a new tag called the value tag.

918
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,440
And so what I can do is I can take multiple Lightning nodes

919
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,320
and put those into my RSS feed in this tag structure.

920
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,120
And every time somebody listens to my podcast

921
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,880
on a Podcasting 2.0 app that supports this technology,

922
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,920
it will look at those Lightning node IDs

923
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,520
and begin to send streaming Bitcoin back to the creator.

924
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,960
So I can fill up as a listener, if I'm

925
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,440
using a podcast app like Cast-O-Matic or Fountain

926
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,480
or Podfriend or Podverse or one of these apps that support it,

927
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,840
or Breeze, I can take and load up my Bitcoin wallet

928
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,360
on my podcast app with, let's just say, $20.

929
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,200
And I can set an amount like, let's just say,

930
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,760
50 Satoshis a minute.

931
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,280
And then every time I hit Play, it just

932
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,440
starts streaming 50 Satoshis a minute back

933
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,840
through the Lightning network to that podcaster's Lightning

934
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
node.

935
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,760
It is super cool.

936
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,880
One of the things that's really amazing to watch as a podcaster,

937
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,440
and we see it every week on our show,

938
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,680
is when people are listening, you

939
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,320
can just look at your Lightning node wallet.

940
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,920
And you can just see those Satoshis coming in.

941
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,080
They're just two Satoshis, 20 Satoshis, 40 Satoshis.

942
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,800
It's just every minute, bing, bing, bing, you're getting paid.

943
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,240
And you know people are listening.

944
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,160
There's a few things I love about this, right?

945
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,720
I mean, number one, there's no middleman.

946
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,880
It's decentralized.

947
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,280
There's no PayPal or Patreon or 13% fee or anything like that.

948
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,320
And the other thing that I think is intriguing

949
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,840
is if you do combine it with a podcast app that has some sort

950
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,800
of wallet functionality.

951
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,480
What is great about sending, like you're saying,

952
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,120
some Satoshis, which is just a part of a Bitcoin,

953
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,440
to a podcaster is that is likely going

954
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,080
to be something that over time will appreciate in value.

955
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,200
So you're giving a really small donation.

956
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,960
Maybe it equals $50 over a year, right?

957
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,320
But if that podcaster were to hold on

958
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,160
to those Satoshis for five years,

959
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,960
it could be worth 100% more than it was at the time you gave it

960
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,760
to them, possibly.

961
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,800
Yeah, 100%.

962
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,840
If Bitcoin continues to trend in the direction it has

963
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,560
trended over the last decade.

964
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
And so it's actually giving the podcaster

965
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,240
not only a form of payment that allows

966
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,840
them to bypass advertisers, but it's actually

967
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,440
giving them something that may pay dividends down the road

968
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,780
that they could reinvest in their business

969
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,280
and keep the content creation going.

970
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,840
And it's all done just by following some namespace

971
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,720
standards and then the Bitcoin standard.

972
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,480
I think it's a brilliant system.

973
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,720
And one of the things you guys have done at the podcastindex.org

974
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,360
website is you've highlighted some of the value

975
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,800
for value podcasts there.

976
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,760
And it seems like it's a range.

977
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,640
How much activity are you actually seeing?

978
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,120
Do you get any idea of that?

979
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:52,640
So what we do is we take a 1% fee on anything

980
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,680
that uses our API.

981
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,080
And that way, we can gauge what's going on.

982
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,880
But the technology itself, it's all just RSS.

983
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,520
It's open source.

984
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,640
So there's people out there doing this

985
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,800
that don't involve us at all.

986
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,440
So we can't really have visibility into that.

987
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,760
But the stuff we do have visibility in,

988
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,080
which is that if a podcast app uses us as their back end

989
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,720
and we put that fee on there, that

990
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,060
is something we can calculate.

991
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,160
And the best we can come up with is

992
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,080
there's about a million SATs a day flowing through the Podcast

993
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,840
Lightning landscape.

994
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,120
So I feel pretty comfortable with that number.

995
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,640
That's also based on what we see.

996
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,040
So you mentioned that people are sending small payments.

997
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,840
And the per minute streaming stuff is small.

998
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,000
But there's also this option called a boost.

999
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,680
And so if you're listening, most of these podcasting 2.0 apps

1000
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,080
have a boost button.

1001
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,040
And so you hit the boost.

1002
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,080
And it says, hey, how many SATs do you want to send?

1003
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,520
And it gives you a place to type in a message.

1004
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,000
And so since the Lightning network can also have a payload,

1005
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,080
it can have arbitrary payloads with it,

1006
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,680
we include a JSON message format in there with it.

1007
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,880
This is all part of the spec.

1008
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,600
It's in the open source namespace docs.

1009
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,880
I can be listening to your show.

1010
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,040
I can be listening to code or radio.

1011
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,760
And I can send you a boost.

1012
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,000
And I can say, hey, guys, this episode was awesome.

1013
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,680
And you get those SATs, those Satoshis.

1014
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,400
And you also see my message and my name

1015
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,240
if I choose to show it to you in the sender.

1016
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,000
It's just like PayPal or Patreon or Buy Me a Coffee.

1017
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,040
But there's no middlemen.

1018
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,520
And also, even though the streaming

1019
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,120
SATs per minute are small, we've had boosts on our show.

1020
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,600
We had one a few weeks ago that was 500,000 SATs.

1021
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,960
That's like $250.

1022
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,200
This is not chump change, really.

1023
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,080
People can send large amounts of money, and it works.

1024
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,240
We've had a 500,000 SAT donation.

1025
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,240
We've had a 300,000, a 200,000, and a couple of 100,000s.

1026
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,440
I mean, it's legit money coming through the system.

1027
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,760
And like I said, this is all open spec.

1028
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,880
So you don't need us or the podcast index or any

1029
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,160
of this stuff to make all this work.

1030
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,000
You just stick this stuff in your feed,

1031
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,240
and you're off to the races.

1032
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,680
Yeah, and even if it's not, that's around with Bitcoin.

1033
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,720
I don't want any Bitcoin.

1034
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,080
It might not be for everybody, but it doesn't need to be.

1035
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,640
Because even with some adoption now,

1036
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,960
it'll continue to grow out.

1037
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,640
The feature set will get better.

1038
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,200
It'll get easier to use.

1039
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,640
It'll become more commonplace.

1040
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,960
And then if we got in a scenario where

1041
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,520
it was the best way to fund somebody,

1042
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,000
all of the plumbing has been done.

1043
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,680
So I think that's pretty interesting.

1044
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,880
I want to talk a little bit about the fundamentals.

1045
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,120
So there is some money coming in with maybe some

1046
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,440
of the transactions if they use the API, which I'm assuming

1047
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,800
goes into fund the infrastructure and all of that.

1048
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,440
So there must be a small business

1049
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,360
behind this for the tax and all the stuff

1050
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,360
you have to do for being a business, right?

1051
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,240
Yeah, we decided not to be a non-profit just

1052
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,280
because a lot of that stuff's kind of gross.

1053
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,520
And a lot of work, too.

1054
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,140
Yeah, the 501c3 landscape is just a dumpster fire.

1055
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,880
So we're like, hey, we need something to fund this,

1056
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,440
and we're going to have to have a business because we are all

1057
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,400
hosted at Linode.

1058
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,600
So we're like, we're going to have to pay bills

1059
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,480
and all this stuff.

1060
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,080
So we have an LLC between me and Adam

1061
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,920
and another guy who does our bookkeeping and backend stuff.

1062
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,840
Mostly, it's really just 20 servers running at Linode

1063
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,080
and a whole bunch of elbow grease and manpower

1064
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,760
over the last couple of years, year and a half or so

1065
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,800
to make it work.

1066
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Oh, man, are you managing all those 20 boxes?

1067
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,520
Is that your job?

1068
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,000
Yeah.

1069
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,660
Wow.

1070
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,160
Is this a full-time thing for you?

1071
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,480
No, no, this is no.

1072
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,200
We don't make any money, really.

1073
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,640
We make just enough money in income

1074
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,800
right now to pay the hosting fees and pay our taxes.

1075
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,720
That's about it.

1076
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,360
Yeah.

1077
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,360
That was our goal for the Lightning stuff,

1078
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,360
for the Bitcoin stuff.

1079
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,600
The reason that 1% fee is there is so that we can hopefully

1080
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,800
fund the index in perpetuity without having

1081
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,720
to ever charge for API access and that kind of thing.

1082
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,000
That's really the goal.

1083
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,720
And as long as that happens, I'm happy because it's

1084
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,880
about bigger things than money.

1085
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,000
If the API docs are any indication

1086
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,560
of the actual quality of the API,

1087
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,000
it is probably worth some money.

1088
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,800
I mean, this is some impressive work

1089
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,320
just documenting all of this.

1090
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
This is some serious stuff that developers can use

1091
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,480
to actually build their app.

1092
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,600
That is part of the value for value model.

1093
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,320
The value for value model is not just about money.

1094
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,840
Adam always says it preacher style.

1095
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,720
He says time, talent, and treasure.

1096
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,560
And so it really is about that.

1097
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,360
So the documentation for the API, I wrote all the API,

1098
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,880
but then the documentation for it

1099
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,200
came from a guy named Stephen Crater in the Podcasting 2.0

1100
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,800
Mastodon group.

1101
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,400
And he just popped up and he's like, hey,

1102
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,560
I do this for a living.

1103
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,400
I'm really good with docs.

1104
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,440
I'll do it.

1105
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,400
And so he just jumped on the GitHub,

1106
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,480
did the documentation repo, put it all

1107
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,520
into a nice dynamic format.

1108
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,280
I never did any of that.

1109
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,800
He spent hours putting it all together.

1110
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,920
And that's all work that I didn't have to do.

1111
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,600
And man, that is every bit as valuable as money, every bit.

1112
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,640
That's an idea the open source community can

1113
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,960
wrap their heads around too, which

1114
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,340
is what I like so much about this really

1115
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,800
feels like the open source community's solution

1116
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,080
to solving the centralized podcasting problem.

1117
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,480
And man, am I just so happy to see you guys doing well.

1118
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:39,960
Thank you.

1119
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,680
I made sure this morning, I went through and looked like,

1120
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,100
OK, all of our shows are published.

1121
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,720
One, I think I hadn't submitted yet because I'm an idiot.

1122
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,600
So I made sure I got that submitted.

1123
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,960
And I could tell you guys are putting a lot of work

1124
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,320
into it because we just recently launched a network membership

1125
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,360
donation option.

1126
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,000
And there was a link for Linux Unplugged to go to that.

1127
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,920
Yeah, one thing I was looking at in your shows,

1128
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,280
and this is a reference to the namespace,

1129
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,440
is one of our namespace tags is the alternate enclosure tag.

1130
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,800
And that's a fairly new tag.

1131
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,840
We do this in phases.

1132
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,440
So the namespace, we take submissions

1133
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,360
for tag suggestions.

1134
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,400
And then we hash it out for two or three months

1135
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,400
and then make some decisions and then finalize

1136
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,360
a portion of those proposals.

1137
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,040
And so we go through these phases.

1138
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,360
And the phase three namespace was the most recent one

1139
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,400
that was fully closed.

1140
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,520
And the alternate enclosure tag is

1141
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:37,240
a way to specify multiple enclosures in a single episode

1142
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,000
in a way that you can reference different delivery technologies

1143
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,160
and different formats.

1144
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,760
So if I had a podcast that had an Ogg Vorbis format,

1145
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,200
a video feed, an MP3 feed, and something else,

1146
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,120
you could, instead of having four separate RSS feeds

1147
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,800
for that, you can have one feed.

1148
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,240
And then for each episode, you just

1149
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,880
reference each different item.

1150
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,400
And so from an app's perspective, the app can see,

1151
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,960
OK, this thing has four separate possible enclosures in it.

1152
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,400
And oh, the listener wants to see the video.

1153
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,040
OK, well, I'll switch video on.

1154
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,120
Oh, now they want low bandwidth because they're

1155
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,840
going through a congestion area.

1156
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,640
OK, I'll switch over to the Ogg format.

1157
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,680
And it allows it to do intelligent auto changing

1158
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,680
to the listeners what their listener wants without having

1159
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,200
to have literally four separate feeds

1160
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,200
and publish all those separate feeds

1161
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,240
and have the listener keep track of them all.

1162
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,560
That's one example of what we're doing

1163
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,440
that applies to even something like you because I noticed you

1164
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,560
had a lot of different format feeds.

1165
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,560
Yeah, a lot of legacy feeds, too.

1166
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,920
So you must also then have to be reaching out

1167
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,200
to a lot of the podcast platforms

1168
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,080
because there's a few of them now, like Fireside,

1169
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,760
like the one we use, and try to get those different platforms

1170
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,720
to add support for these namespace features.

1171
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,880
Are y'all on Dan Benjamin's Fireside?

1172
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,480
Yeah.

1173
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,460
Yeah, Dan was an early adopter of the namespace.

1174
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,960
And he's got a few of those things in there.

1175
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,320
He's got, I think, chapters, person.

1176
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,520
Seasons, he has a good amount of them, yeah.

1177
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,560
Yeah, he's a friend of mine.

1178
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,360
And that's an example of the legwork that has to go.

1179
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,480
The technology part is only half the battle.

1180
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,140
You can write all the specs in the world,

1181
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,880
but then you have to go and evangelize them and let

1182
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,440
people know and then show them code, give them example code,

1183
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,360
talk to developers.

1184
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,360
And I think this is where a lot of open source projects

1185
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:44,480
fail, perhaps, is that they're so focused on the tech

1186
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,600
that they forget to do the evangelism part.

1187
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,160
And just build it and they will come is not true.

1188
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,160
That's not how this stuff works.

1189
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,720
You have to build it, and then you have to go to conferences.

1190
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,560
And then you have to talk to people.

1191
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,700
And you have to build relationships

1192
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:03,740
with podcasting hosts and app developers.

1193
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,600
It's a lot of work.

1194
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,000
But the tech and the writing code is really probably less

1195
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,840
than half of what it takes to get a successful project going.

1196
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,760
Well, I do appreciate you doing some of that legwork,

1197
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,400
because I look at this and I think,

1198
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,680
I can't get apps and platforms to adopt this stuff

1199
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,280
fast enough.

1200
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,720
And I know that Apple and Spotify and probably Google

1201
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,200
and YouTube, they're going to be the last to adopt

1202
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,920
some of this stuff, I would think.

1203
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,240
But the nice thing about our audience is they're technical.

1204
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,840
They can go find an app that does support this stuff.

1205
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,880
Do you have a favorite podcast app right now that

1206
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,200
supports some of these features?

1207
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:40,800
I use them all.

1208
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,000
I literally do use them all.

1209
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,600
I've got 10 podcast apps on my phone,

1210
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,320
because every time one of the developers in our group

1211
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,320
comes up with a new app or something new,

1212
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,400
I listen to podcasts in probably four different apps a day.

1213
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,980
I like them all for different reasons.

1214
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,000
They all have different feature sets.

1215
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,920
And one thing about that whole idea of,

1216
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,840
and we hear this a lot is, well, unless Apple and Spotify

1217
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:10,400
support it, we're not going to spend any time developing it.

1218
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,480
You hear that a lot.

1219
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,080
But what we have to remind people,

1220
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,040
and we've been successful with reminding people

1221
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,120
about this in the podcasting world,

1222
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:23,280
is that that is just simply giving your power away

1223
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,520
willingly.

1224
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:29,200
The independent podcast ecosystem collectively

1225
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,160
is much bigger than those platforms.

1226
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,920
Even if those platforms represent 50% of the market

1227
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,960
or 40% of the market, you've got 50% to 60%

1228
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,000
of the decentralized podcast market over here

1229
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,440
on the other side.

1230
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,760
And we can move and innovate much faster than those guys

1231
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,360
can.

1232
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,600
Look at the podcast namespace, really.

1233
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:58,040
In the last year, we have formalized 15 new feature tags

1234
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,240
within RSS.

1235
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,080
And in that same time frame, Spotify

1236
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,560
has given us what exactly?

1237
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,280
More dynamic ads?

1238
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,280
Yeah, more streaming ad insertion.

1239
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,880
That's what I'm saying.

1240
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,200
We went into this thinking, OK, the siloed companies,

1241
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,440
the walled gardens, they're going to move super fast.

1242
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,940
And they're going to innovate quick.

1243
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,440
And we have to innovate fast enough to keep track,

1244
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,240
to keep pace with them, keep feature parity.

1245
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,720
And what we find out really quickly

1246
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,840
was that's actually not true.

1247
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,880
We pass them with the foot down to the floorboard.

1248
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,400
I mean, they move so slow because everything they do

1249
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,360
is about shareholder returns and money.

1250
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,240
And they cannot innovate as fast as a group

1251
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,120
of dedicated open source community members can.

1252
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,840
They're good coders.

1253
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,480
We can beat them all day long.

1254
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,520
And we have.

1255
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,600
And so the typical Podcasting 2.0 app,

1256
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,960
and there's a big list of them.

1257
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,080
If you go to podcastindex.org slash apps,

1258
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,800
there's a big list of all of them.

1259
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,200
A Podcasting 2.0 app blows Spotify out of the water

1260
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,360
with the feature set that it has.

1261
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,440
And that's all just community built.

1262
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,000
And most of those apps are not profitable.

1263
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,720
They're not apps that are where the developer is

1264
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,360
making a living doing it.

1265
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,760
They're apps that are just passion projects.

1266
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,480
And Cast-O-Matic is a perfect example.

1267
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,480
It's a really great iOS app.

1268
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,520
And the developer of that app is a physician in Italy.

1269
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,760
His day job is as a doctor.

1270
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,200
And he just works on this thing part time.

1271
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,440
And it is a high quality, feature rich app.

1272
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,640
And Spotify, last I checked, they don't even have chapters.

1273
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,160
I know.

1274
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,240
That's what I'm saying.

1275
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,840
I mean, it shows this project more than anything else

1276
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,000
I've ever been involved in, shows

1277
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,160
the power of a nimble, talented, open source community.

1278
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,880
Yeah, it couldn't be coming along at a better time either.

1279
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,440
So Dave, thank you for your work.

1280
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,720
Thank you to the pod father and your whole team over there.

1281
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,960
I know it's not a big team.

1282
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,520
So sending a lot of good vibes your guys' way,

1283
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,880
because I hope it grows, actually.

1284
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,600
I hope this becomes a thing and really takes off.

1285
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,880
And I hope to see more and more apps and platforms support it

1286
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,520
too.

1287
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,040
Stay in touch, because I'm on board, man.

1288
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,880
Actually, I want to know how to become a Podcast Index

1289
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,200
premier network.

1290
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,360
Like, how do I go all in?

1291
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,200
So maybe we'll chat more.

1292
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,720
You get the badge, the Podcasting 2.0 Certified Badge,

1293
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:27,920
man.

1294
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,840
We've even got one.

1295
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,720
There you go.

1296
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,520
OK.

1297
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,480
Thanks, Dave.

1298
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,320
Thanks, Chris.

1299
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,360
Just a real quick housekeeping, because we're getting long.

1300
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,360
We're going long, but I just really

1301
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,320
enjoyed that chat with Dave.

1302
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,520
There's a lot to it.

1303
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,920
So we'll do a little follow up.

1304
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,160
But first, I wanted to mention we're

1305
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,500
doing one last run of the Rando swag bags.

1306
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,040
They've got the journal option and the non-journal option.

1307
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,920
We're just going to do it for a little bit longer.

1308
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,720
So that's at jupitergarage.com.

1309
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,480
Also, thank you to our members.

1310
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,320
This is right here, a single sponsor episode.

1311
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,240
So the members are really what's keeping the show going,

1312
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,040
keeping the production going, all of that.

1313
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,360
Our community information, like our matrix, our telegram,

1314
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,800
our contact information, all of that is at linuxhomeplug.com.

1315
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,840
And last but not least, come join us on a Sunday.

1316
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,080
Now, the show is moved over to Sundays.

1317
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,640
We fire up the stream around noon 30 Pacific time

1318
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,280
over at jblive.tv.

1319
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,200
All right, so I'm opening it up now to the virtual lug

1320
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,600
as we chat about this.

1321
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,160
In the show notes today, I'll have some links

1322
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,320
to the podcast index, including those new podcasting apps

1323
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,120
that Dave was chatting about.

1324
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,800
But you know, I was talking to him.

1325
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,880
What just kept looping in the back of my mind

1326
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,880
is like, this has got to be a way where

1327
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,920
we can help free software developers monetize

1328
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,320
some of their work.

1329
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,240
This Lightning Network solution seems like a great way

1330
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,880
to solve one of free software's most common problems.

1331
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,400
I mean, we just saw it with the log for J vulnerability.

1332
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,680
A couple of developers working for over a decade

1333
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,120
never made a dime on something that

1334
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,280
propped up tons of industry.

1335
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,320
It just happened with basically every major vulnerability

1336
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,640
we heard about last year.

1337
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,880
It all came down to, oh, yeah, a couple of developers

1338
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,120
and they never made a buck.

1339
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,840
Like, it seems like maybe it was something

1340
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,240
like the Lightning Network where you could send a Satoshi

1341
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,760
can be less than a penny.

1342
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,160
I mean, these things, I have a link in the show notes.

1343
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,080
If you've never heard this term Sat or Satoshi,

1344
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,960
and you're like, what, 1,000 Sat's?

1345
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,440
That sounds like a lot.

1346
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,200
It's not.

1347
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,280
I think it's something like you can divide a Bitcoin

1348
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,840
100 million times down, and that's what a Satoshi is.

1349
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,840
And so you're talking you could send $0.25,

1350
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,840
but if maybe log for J has 10,000 people,

1351
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,880
send them $0.25, all of a sudden, that matters.

1352
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,400
What was really interesting to me in the podcasting iteration

1353
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,680
of this was that like ticking counter of getting Satoshis

1354
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,080
in as you're listening, and I think there's really

1355
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,360
something to that.

1356
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,200
I don't know how it translates to open source software

1357
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,160
projects.

1358
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,680
We did, I think, touch on this slightly last week.

1359
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,320
Yeah, it's something that's been coming up more and more,

1360
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,160
I think, because of log for J. It's just been on our minds.

1361
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,280
Well, I think it's been on our minds for years,

1362
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,520
but we've never really had a true potential solution for it.

1363
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,320
And what seems unique here is, so the Lightning Network,

1364
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,600
the white paper was published in February of 2015,

1365
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,840
but adoption has been slow until really about this year,

1366
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,440
in combination because Jack Dorsey started upping it

1367
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,640
on Twitter and with his new company,

1368
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,960
but also because El Salvador did like a pilot, Bitcoin pilot,

1369
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,960
and the Lightning Network worked so well for them

1370
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,880
that they've now adopted Bitcoin as a currency in El Salvador.

1371
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,760
That really put a big focus on the Lightning Network,

1372
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,240
and it's really kind of exploded.

1373
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,200
And it's all open source code.

1374
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,200
It's all free software.

1375
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,120
So you've kind of got this decentralized network that's

1376
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:52,760
been built out that allows for super efficient, quick, stupid

1377
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,840
cheap payments, and the entire stack is free software.

1378
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,960
And it's all auditable because it's on a public ledger.

1379
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,440
So you can contribute to a free software project,

1380
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,760
and anyone in the world that has access to the internet

1381
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,360
can audit that.

1382
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,960
This sounds almost like exactly what we've

1383
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,560
been hoping for for a long time.

1384
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,520
It's like so many different ideals

1385
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,520
that I've had festering in my own little brain

1386
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,560
all coming together.

1387
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,720
And I've got to say, you've been really mentoring me

1388
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,560
in some of these concepts this last week or two

1389
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,720
since I've been at the studio.

1390
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,520
And gosh, am I ever excited about it.

1391
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:35,000
I've got to say, I didn't quite do a dive into it previously,

1392
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,200
but I think this podcasting index might be a really nice way

1393
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,680
for many of us to just get our feet wet a little bit

1394
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,520
and start to get interested in the concepts

1395
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,880
and dive a little bit more into how even blockchains could

1396
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,720
solve real problems.

1397
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,640
Without the hype, right?

1398
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,680
Without all of the, it's going to take over the world

1399
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,000
and be a new web, right?

1400
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,800
It's just like, well, this is a thing that works practically.

1401
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,200
And if you apply it in the right application,

1402
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,640
just like every other technology we talk about on the show,

1403
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,680
like ButterFS, like containers, it's like, yeah,

1404
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,000
there's absolutely a use case for that in some workloads.

1405
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,400
The Podping software they talk about,

1406
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,200
that's using the Hive blockchain, which is essentially

1407
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,000
just a decentralized JSON message bus.

1408
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,940
It's like D-Bus for the internet, simpler, obviously.

1409
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:23,120
And so the idea is that the podcast client just

1410
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,560
checks that Hive blockchain, which

1411
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,920
is a super low energy efficient blockchain that

1412
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:33,800
solves the idea of, how do you create a consumable message

1413
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,380
bus for the internet?

1414
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,080
What really struck me in that conversation

1415
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,580
or that bit of the conversation was the efficiency of it.

1416
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,280
So it seems like, OK, we're doing things

1417
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,080
a certain way with the internet right now,

1418
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,480
and then querying servers over and over and over

1419
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,800
to see if there's a new podcast episode.

1420
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,360
It seems like if we can make the internet much more efficient,

1421
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,640
it does tackle some of these things

1422
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,480
that we've been worried about, like energy usage of the internet

1423
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,320
as a whole or some of these cryptocurrencies,

1424
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,080
et cetera, et cetera.

1425
00:58:59,080 --> 00:58:59,840
Yeah.

1426
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,000
Boy, we could make a whole episode out

1427
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,280
of the energy usage thing.

1428
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,920
So what I'll do is I'll put a link

1429
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,840
to the University of Cambridge's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption

1430
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,400
Index.

1431
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,800
It's a real time index that they update of Bitcoin's power usage

1432
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,560
and gives it to you in perspective of household

1433
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,760
consumption and industry consumption.

1434
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,840
And they try to track all of the different metrics,

1435
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,320
including where the mining is happening and all of that.

1436
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,760
So you kind of have an idea of what types of power sources

1437
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,160
are powering that mining.

1438
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,600
And it's probably not perfect, guys,

1439
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,680
because it's a decentralized, anonymized network.

1440
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,960
It's pretty hard to get really good numbers.

1441
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,800
But Cambridge is doing their best.

1442
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,200
And I think when we throw around terms like planet incinerating,

1443
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,560
we should probably try to put it in perspective of things

1444
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,000
like machine learning.

1445
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,440
How much electricity does machine learning take?

1446
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,160
How much electricity does Twitch video game streaming,

1447
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,800
the entire Twitch network of everybody ramping up their GPUs

1448
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,880
and streaming it to everybody whose GPUs are decoding it,

1449
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,920
how much energy use does that take?

1450
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,880
And does a decentralized, open source currency

1451
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,840
built for the internet with no borders so anyone in the world

1452
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,720
can send money to anyone else in the world that's totally

1453
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:13,400
backed by cryptography, what is the value of that?

1454
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,920
What is the value of sound money?

1455
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,280
So I have a link in the show notes

1456
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,160
because I think when we're talking about energy

1457
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,160
use of these different blockchain technologies,

1458
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,520
and there are several kinds.

1459
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,240
Bitcoin is a proof of work.

1460
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,200
But there are many proof of stake, which use much less

1461
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,960
or maybe very little energy usage, depending.

1462
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,280
So all of that's in there.

1463
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,780
It's worth taking a look at just to have that conversation

1464
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:39,080
with people because I think it's an important conversation.

1465
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,480
And so actually having the data and keeping in mind

1466
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,080
there's a lot of things in technology

1467
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,080
we do that use quite a bit of power.

1468
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,680
Right now, we're recording a podcast,

1469
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,000
and the CPUs are burning on all these machines in here.

1470
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,560
How many computers are just near us right now?

1471
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,280
Right.

1472
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,560
We don't really think about it.

1473
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,920
Or how much power would it take if you bought a Tesla

1474
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,480
and you started charging it every night?

1475
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,560
And how much power does it take if your significant other also

1476
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,120
has an electric car and you're charging both of those

1477
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:01,800
every night?

1478
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,800
Is that worth it?

1479
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,880
How much power does it take to use Google Photos?

1480
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,400
Sure.

1481
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,840
And in the case of Bitcoin, there's

1482
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:14,320
the economics that make mining actually more profitable

1483
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,840
the cheaper your energy access is.

1484
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,760
So I think it's all changing, too.

1485
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,000
Like what we consider today as energy use and how it's used

1486
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,680
could be completely different in five years

1487
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,360
as the economics of Bitcoin mining

1488
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,520
drive people to use renewables.

1489
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,000
That, I think, is a conversation for a different show.

1490
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,400
But it all can be practical implementations.

1491
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,600
It doesn't have to be hype.

1492
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,640
It doesn't have to be this huge overthrow

1493
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,480
the system kind of technology.

1494
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,440
It's not an all-some game here, because you

1495
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,320
can see with the podcast index, they're

1496
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,640
using these things in a very rational, very unique way.

1497
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,080
And I took from that chat with Dave

1498
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,560
that I think the free software community needs

1499
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,360
to rethink some of this stuff.

1500
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,240
Like the way we reacted to Mozilla, does that make sense?

1501
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,760
Because what we're really talking about

1502
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,000
is the alternative is something that's

1503
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,960
controlled by banks that are not necessarily

1504
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,920
accessible to everyone who wants to participate

1505
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,880
in free software.

1506
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,840
Kind of the status quo.

1507
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,400
And that's not very exciting, is it?

1508
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:11,640
Right.

1509
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,360
When we're in the West, this is something

1510
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,680
that's hard to really keep in mind,

1511
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,240
but in the Western countries, we've

1512
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:21,720
had a good, stable, reliable state currency for a long time.

1513
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,920
But that is not true for everywhere else in the world.

1514
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,880
And they also don't necessarily get access

1515
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,960
to our banking system because of the volatility

1516
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,840
of their country's economy.

1517
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,000
And so they're really cut off in a lot of major ways.

1518
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,560
And they want to participate too, right?

1519
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,480
And they should be able to get paid as well for their work.

1520
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,440
They deserve that.

1521
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,640
When we're talking about these things,

1522
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,560
and we're talking about their energy usage,

1523
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,140
and what their practical use could be,

1524
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:54,320
and how they don't do anything new, I know it sounds funny.

1525
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,480
And I don't love saying it.

1526
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,840
But we have to consider we may be

1527
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,840
sitting from a position of privilege

1528
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,400
if we live in a Western country where we've never really had

1529
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,880
to worry about these things yet.

1530
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,840
And I think free software could benefit from this technology.

1531
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:10,320
It's weird because the free software community

1532
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,840
sort of feels like it's just kind of become about cloud

1533
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,940
and Linux and not about all the other free software that's

1534
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,160
out there.

1535
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,440
That other people are like, we are shunning some technology now

1536
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,480
and declaring other technologies allowed.

1537
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,840
And we're doing it by Twitter outrage.

1538
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,300
Like what just happened with Mozilla.

1539
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,320
Mozilla reminded people they accept Bitcoin and Doge.

1540
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,640
And the community freaked out.

1541
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,280
Original contributors to Mozilla and Gecko

1542
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,120
lit them on fire for incinerating the planet.

1543
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,040
And all of those people are sitting

1544
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:45,320
from a position of wealth and privilege.

1545
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,040
But they don't even see it.

1546
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,800
And I think when we talk about the energy consumption,

1547
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,840
we have to consider that for some people,

1548
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,360
they don't have sound money.

1549
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,040
And we might not always have sound money.

1550
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,080
Things can change.

1551
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,840
Disasters can happen.

1552
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,520
History can be made.

1553
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,560
And you can also see the practical content

1554
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,080
creators getting paid is going to lead to better content.

1555
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,880
It's going to lead to more accurate content

1556
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,680
when it's funded by the audience.

1557
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,160
That serves everyone that produces the show

1558
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,620
and that listens to the show.

1559
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:18,000
It takes it away from like Spotify or Squarespace.

1560
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,680
And it puts it directly between the audience and the creator

1561
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:27,360
with no one in between, no PayPal, no Patreon, no 5%,

1562
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,360
10% GRIFT.

1563
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:33,460
And it's all on a free software system from top to bottom,

1564
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,480
from the software you can receive the currency

1565
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,440
and to send to the network.

1566
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,320
And it's available to anyone in the world.

1567
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,960
Doesn't matter what political party, what country line.

1568
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,640
If you can get access to the Tor network,

1569
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:46,480
if you can get access to a VPN, if you can get IP routing,

1570
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,840
you can get paid.

1571
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,200
Then I know we've all heard the stories about the protesters

1572
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,960
in China who got shut out of the banking system just recently.

1573
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,520
And then they use the lightning network to raise funds.

1574
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:01,480
And they funded their anti-government protests

1575
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,180
with Bitcoin after being shut out

1576
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,720
by the Chinese financial system, even with China's control

1577
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,000
over the internet.

1578
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
And there's 100 stories of that every day.

1579
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,320
And then you see this technology,

1580
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,160
how it could help something like the podcast

1581
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,920
landscape, which could even be applied to a video platform.

1582
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,720
You could take all of the concepts they have

1583
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,160
with the podcast index and the monetizing and the namespace

1584
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,120
for the RSS feed, and you could build an amazing PeerTube

1585
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,520
community around that.

1586
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,880
And because it's open source and it's an open spec

1587
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,980
and they have amazing documentation and tons

1588
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,240
of sample code and open source apps that have already

1589
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,560
implemented this, it's all there for us to take it.

1590
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:40,320
But I think our own prejudice about a technology

1591
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,800
that we don't understand is preventing us as a community

1592
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,000
from adopting this.

1593
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,400
And I said it on the live stream,

1594
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,200
and I'll say it in the show, this

1595
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,800
is a result of a failure of leadership

1596
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,800
by the Free Software Foundation.

1597
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,960
They should be pioneering a open source free software payment

1598
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,440
system to fund free software development.

1599
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,360
But they're old, and they're out of touch,

1600
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,520
and they're too busy licking their own wounds.

1601
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,640
And there's no other leadership in the community

1602
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,760
that thinks Foundation essentially

1603
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,920
is the centralization of everything else.

1604
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,920
And they don't have any reason to change this.

1605
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,560
They like the way the payment system works.

1606
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,880
They hire the developers they want.

1607
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,000
They get paid to write the code they need.

1608
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
It's a great system for them.

1609
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,520
Oh, somebody got left out?

1610
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,160
We'll create a brand new foundation.

1611
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,720
We'll make sure everything's taken care of for them.

1612
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,840
Problem solved.

1613
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,480
Problem solved.

1614
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,480
No other problems out there.

1615
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:25,960
We did it.

1616
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:26,760
We fixed it, everybody.

1617
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,320
Didn't we do good?

1618
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:27,920
Look at our report.

1619
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,600
Look at this PDF.

1620
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,040
Look how good we did.

1621
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,880
That's the alternative.

1622
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,840
Because no one is in our community in a position

1623
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,760
of leadership championing these ideas,

1624
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,680
typical human prejudice have prevented us

1625
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,280
from adopting this.

1626
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,960
And so things like log4j will just

1627
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,280
keep happening over and over and over again.

1628
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,240
And in part, it's our own fault, because free software

1629
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,920
has become about Linux and the cloud,

1630
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,040
and not everything else out there.

1631
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,440
And when you shut down new things

1632
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,960
because somebody's grifting with an NFT,

1633
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,360
you're participating in the same kind of thought

1634
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:03,280
process and suppression that led to Linux FUD.

1635
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,960
It's just a new generation of FUD.

1636
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,840
So I hope things like the podcast index

1637
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,440
get adopted by at least parts of this, right?

1638
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,720
Some of it's podcast specific.

1639
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,960
I acknowledge that.

1640
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,800
But wouldn't it be great if some parts got

1641
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,040
adopted by a project that we all know and love,

1642
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,440
and we could help those developers live a comfortable

1643
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,200
life just doing free software full time?

1644
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,760
You caught it there in the interview, Brent.

1645
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,440
Dave Jones is helping build this entire decentralized podcast

1646
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,760
index, which is the only alternative to Apple, Spotify,

1647
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,840
and YouTube, and Google.

1648
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,560
The only thing out there that's legitimate and large enough

1649
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,640
and has any adoption and has apps that are supporting it,

1650
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,440
and he's doing it as a part-time job.

1651
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,640
And the funds coming in are only paying for their taxes

1652
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,480
and their 20 Linux, and that's it.

1653
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,920
And podcasting is an entire industry now.

1654
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,400
And we're just doing it over.

1655
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,240
We're doing it to free software developers.

1656
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,800
It's happening to the podcast ecosystem.

1657
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,520
It's because these ginormous rich organizations

1658
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,800
or foundations can distort reality

1659
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,600
and make everyone expect to get everything for free.

1660
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,720
And when it's not easy and when it's something new,

1661
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,360
that's gross.

1662
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,440
What do you mean they don't accept PayPal?

1663
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:15,800
What do you mean they don't?

1664
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,640
No, I'm not doing that.

1665
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:20,200
Until it's inevitable, and it's been rolled out everywhere,

1666
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,600
and then everybody will just pretend

1667
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,720
like it was obvious all along.

1668
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,600
And nobody will own the fact that they were essentially

1669
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,000
blocking the adoption.

1670
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,400
So that's the end of my rant.

1671
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,280
But I thought it was a really thought-provoking conversation

1672
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:30,600
with Dave.

1673
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,480
So thank you to Dave and all the work that's

1674
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,280
happening over at the Podcast Index.

1675
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,680
Whew.

1676
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,960
You know what we'll do is we'll put a couple of links

1677
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,080
in the show notes.

1678
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:43,080
I tried out Fountain, and I just got another one, too.

1679
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,400
I just downloaded Cast-O-Matic, but I haven't tried it yet.

1680
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,320
But I tried out Fountain, which is available for iOS

1681
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:50,240
and for the Android.

1682
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,200
And it took me, I don't know, like a half hour

1683
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,280
to get my sign-up email.

1684
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,640
I don't know what that's about.

1685
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,600
But once I'm in, it's great, man.

1686
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,360
I really like it.

1687
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,520
So you can import from Spotify, which is interesting.

1688
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,200
Oh, that's nice.

1689
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,040
Yeah, this is Fountain.

1690
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,120
So if you just want to get off Spotify and try something else,

1691
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:05,880
you don't have to give it up.

1692
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,760
You could try it, and it'll import it.

1693
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,720
But it'll also import from Apple Podcasts on iOS,

1694
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,360
and it'll search the podcast directory.

1695
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,160
So I toyed around with the lightning support.

1696
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,440
I think I have it turned on.

1697
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,840
I have so much to learn about the lightning network stuff

1698
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,760
still.

1699
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,320
But I love the idea.

1700
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:26,560
And I feel like I want to try to validate it here somehow

1701
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,200
once I figure it all out.

1702
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,280
And then I want to become an advocate

1703
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,400
to monetize free software development with it.

1704
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,360
And I don't mean like monetize in a bad way.

1705
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,920
I mean make it possible for these developers

1706
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,120
not to live on the edge of burnout.

1707
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,200
And OK, OK, I'm sorry.

1708
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,140
I'm going to just one last point.

1709
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,300
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1710
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:47,080
But Brent can attest, this has been eating me alive, hasn't it?

1711
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,220
Only for about a week.

1712
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,640
I want to give Colonel a chance to jump in.

1713
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,680
Colonel, you had a few thoughts on the lightning network.

1714
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,920
This is like an area I'm pretty new on.

1715
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:54,440
So I'd love any insights you have.

1716
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:54,920
Right.

1717
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,120
So it was actually less of the lightning network,

1718
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,340
but almost adapting what they're doing for the podcasts

1719
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:05,240
into funding some of these core technologies that

1720
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,160
are being developed by people in their spare time.

1721
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:13,520
So maybe instead of having a paper while you're listening,

1722
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,920
maybe it's every time somebody does a poll

1723
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,520
against that repository, they can send a few Satoshis.

1724
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,200
Or something like that.

1725
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,840
So again, it's value for value, but it's based

1726
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,160
upon people using that software.

1727
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,360
There's so many ways you could do this, really.

1728
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,960
It could be as dumb as a GNOME extension

1729
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,380
that you put the name of a process

1730
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,480
in and say, every time I'm running this process,

1731
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,540
send five Satoshis to a free software developer.

1732
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,180
It could be as simple as that.

1733
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:46,320
It could be something like the popularity packages in Debian

1734
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,780
that look at what you have installed

1735
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,320
and what you use most often.

1736
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,900
It could give you an output, and then you could have a choice.

1737
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,440
Maybe it's a little GTK app, and you click a few buttons,

1738
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,760
and you send it off.

1739
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,840
And of course, it's written in Rust.

1740
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,720
They're all written in Rust, right?

1741
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,360
Don't you think?

1742
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,360
It almost has to be, I guess.

1743
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,160
All right, we'll just leave it at this.

1744
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:07,840
I could really go on and on about it.

1745
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,960
Just what really gets me is I talk

1746
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,720
to so many of these developers as part of doing the show,

1747
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:18,160
and so many of them are really on the edge of burnout.

1748
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:21,680
They exist the entire time they're doing this.

1749
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,680
Anytime anything gets any kind of traction

1750
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:26,140
in this state of perpetual burnout

1751
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:29,500
and tied by obligations between family and work

1752
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,400
and their community and free software.

1753
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,880
And it can be a really strong pull.

1754
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,400
And it, A, is a fragile dynamic,

1755
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:44,440
and B, it makes a person old, and they can't do it forever.

1756
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,600
And when you have to juggle feeding your family

1757
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,680
and paying your bills and also fulfilling your commitments

1758
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,040
to the free software community,

1759
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,680
it can be really, really difficult.

1760
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:59,680
And a lot of these developers are just one nasty comment

1761
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:04,800
or divorce or marriage or car accident away

1762
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,760
from abandoning their project.

1763
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:14,760
And the ability to solve this in a super efficient way

1764
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,440
that uses free software through and through

1765
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,760
with no middleman has existed since 2015.

1766
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,520
But bigotry and, honestly, misinformation

1767
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,880
and uninformed opinion about potential

1768
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:32,000
planet-incinerating power use has led to a block of adoption.

1769
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,480
And that's why I get so worked up about this,

1770
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,480
because some of the things that we use on a daily basis

1771
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:40,080
are just on the precipice of going away

1772
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,280
because they can't figure out a way to make money

1773
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:44,000
and balance their life.

1774
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,080
So that's why it just, that's why it matters a lot to me.

1775
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:52,080
But I feel optimistic that this stuff lays the groundwork

1776
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,840
for us to solve the problem.

1777
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,160
The technology is there, it's sound, it's safe,

1778
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:02,160
and it's being used by millions of people on a daily basis,

1779
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,960
some of which are just using it to buy bread

1780
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,520
in a market somewhere, and some of which people

1781
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,400
are using it to fund content creators

1782
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,600
or invoicing for a banana.

1783
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,840
I mean, it's a huge range, and it is happening.

1784
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,520
It just is gonna require a mindset change and adoption.

1785
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,840
And looking past things like ape NFTs that are silly,

1786
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,960
it's just gonna take a little time.

1787
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,680
But I hope that maybe we're taking the first step

1788
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,720
with this episode, because I think it can make

1789
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,000
a big difference, and it's something I'd love

1790
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,960
to know more about, I'm still learning.

1791
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,040
So let us know what you think at linuxunplugged.com

1792
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,120
slash contact.

1793
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,560
Don't forget, we do have that Luplug.

1794
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,000
We're getting together on Sundays and Tuesdays now

1795
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,720
at noon Pacific.

1796
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,560
And don't miss Linux Action News.

1797
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,040
Now at a new prime time for the news,

1798
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,640
busting it out towards the end of the week

1799
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,560
with all the stuff that happened

1800
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,480
with Wes Payne and myself.

1801
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:53,960
Brent, thanks for sitting in Wes's seat.

1802
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,120
Oh yeah, he's got some nice butt grooves in this thing.

1803
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:56,960
It's real nice.

1804
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:57,800
I know it.

1805
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,720
He's worked it, you know?

1806
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,560
He works it.

1807
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,840
Every time he sits there, you can just see him.

1808
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:01,680
You can tell because he sits there

1809
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,280
and he bites his lip while he does it.

1810
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,240
So you know he's working it.

1811
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,440
That's how you know.

1812
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,120
Links to a lot of what we talked about today

1813
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,960
at linuxunplugged.com slash four four zero.

1814
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,280
We'd love to have you go through there, peruse it,

1815
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,640
learn a little something today,

1816
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,240
including that power usage from Cambridge

1817
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,080
and more information like podcast index

1818
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,520
and some great apps.

1819
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,960
And you can actually use the podcastindex.org itself

1820
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,320
as a podcast player.

1821
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,160
That's interesting.

1822
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,200
Yeah, they got a player just built right in.

1823
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,040
Of course they do.

1824
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,480
If you want a web player, that's pretty awesome.

1825
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,680
And we have, I think,

1826
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,040
I think we have the Lightning Network set up

1827
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:35,880
for Linux Unplugged now.

1828
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,280
It's a bit of an experiment.

1829
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,480
Test the waters, if you will.

1830
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,080
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

1831
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,440
of the Unplugged program.

1832
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,640
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1833
01:14:44,640 --> 01:15:03,640
This is Unplugged, and we'll see you next week.

1834
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:23,920
All right, we need a title.

1835
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,920
We gotta title this thing.

1836
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,080
We gotta get it out there,

1837
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,560
let people know about the good things

1838
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,840
coming to the world of podcasting.

1839
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,600
So everybody head on over to jbtitles.com.

1840
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,600
JBtitles.com.

1841
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,080
And get your boat in.

1842
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,800
Come on now, y'all.

1843
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,960
Come on in.

1844
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,720
Did we get any ideas in the chat room for our new toy?

1845
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,240
I didn't see any scroll by.

1846
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,400
So for those of you who joined us

1847
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,080
a little bit into the show,

1848
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,760
we got a little piece of hardware

1849
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,400
that came into the studio that we assembled ourselves

1850
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,160
called the Clockwork Pi.

1851
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,600
And we talked about it in the pre-show,

1852
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,840
so I figured we'd end with the post-show with it

1853
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,040
with a little bit of info.

1854
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,520
So like Brent said, it has Armbian.

1855
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,600
The display is running at 480 by 1280.

1856
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,800
So it's a real wide and narrow display.

1857
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,960
Which I think for gameplay,

1858
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,080
because it has these gameplay buttons,

1859
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,680
I think might be actually really interesting.

1860
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,520
Maybe.

1861
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,360
I don't know.

1862
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,200
As long as I'd be playing it,

1863
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,720
I'll be a four by three Super Nintendo game.

1864
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,280
It's got two gigs of RAM in there,

1865
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,880
three USB-A ports like you alluded to,

1866
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,640
a USB-C and a micro HDMI.

1867
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,920
Not to mention a thermal printer.

1868
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,120
Well, yeah, of course, which...

1869
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,320
But the nice thing about this, I think,

1870
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,720
is that there's an opportunity for a lot of expansion.

1871
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,080
I know when I was putting the thing together,

1872
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,920
there's a whole lot of expansion.

1873
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,040
What do you call those?

1874
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:35,920
Connectors and things? Modules?

1875
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,760
Modules, sure.

1876
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,680
Sure.

1877
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,680
So there's a lot of possibility.

1878
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:43,680
I know they have a game-specific add-on to it.

1879
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,640
The name of it is passing me now,

1880
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:49,000
but I think there's a lot of opportunity here.

1881
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,800
I think it's just that we've run out of ideas

1882
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:52,680
for what to do with it.

1883
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:56,160
Oh, Dan, you've got an updated version with more RAM?

1884
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,000
Oh, there's already...

1885
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:57,840
Yeah.

1886
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,800
We just got this.

1887
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,760
Tell me about it.

1888
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,120
Yeah, well, it's about the same device,

1889
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,200
except that it's just a little more powerful.

1890
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,040
Duh!

1891
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,240
That sounds exactly the kind of thing I like.
