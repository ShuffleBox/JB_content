1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
You know, the problem with smartwatches is having notifications buzz my wrist just really isn't enough.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,900
I wish there was a way a guy could have them right up in his face, right in his peepers, Wes.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,400
Oh, well, Bosch has a solution for you with their new smart glasses.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,600
You're probably tired of having to see everyone in the meeting or who you're even talking to or around in the city.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,400
Yeah, I mean, you can totally see when I'm glancing down at my smartphone. It's so inconvenient.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:34,500
Good thing these new smart glasses use a tiny laser array that paints images directly onto your retina.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:45,900
And they have got a really corporate generic video that shows you getting horrible notifications about really unimportant things right on your eyeballs.

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:52,900
Yeah, I mean, just imagine like whatever mundane texts that you get, notifications, emails popping up directly in your vision.

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,900
These are also the ugliest peepers I've ever seen.

10
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:04,300
I mean, I appreciate they're racking a lot of tech into this, but it seems like no coincidence that two hours before we started recording this here podcast,

11
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,500
Google announced that you can get their latest AR glasses for direct purchase.

12
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,100
You don't have to be like a special qualifying business anymore.

13
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,300
And a big difference there, the Bosch versions?

14
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,100
Well, those you have to get custom fitted, not so for Google.

15
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,900
No, but you know, Bosch has that huge developer ecosystem and that app store that's world famous for making all that money.

16
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,000
So I'm sure it's going to work out real good.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hello, friends, and welcome in to Linux Unplugged episode two hundred, no, three hundred and thirty nine.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,700
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Not gonna lie, Wes, it all kind of blurs together.

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Although I am kind of weirdly excited about 340 because, you know, I realized it's not every episode that it's been 10 episodes.

20
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,200
No, no. In fact, it's only one out of ten.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,500
So speaking of things that don't happen too often, this week we're taking a look at Linux Mint,

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:06,700
the latest Linux Mint, which by my rough math hasn't happened since episode one hundred.

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,000
And I had a real moment where I thought, geez, it's been way too long.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,300
This is still a super popular distribution.

25
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,100
And I wanted to give it a real fair shake.

26
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,600
So I said, I'm going all in. I put it here on the production systems for this episode.

27
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
You're running it right now. Yeah.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,600
So we'll give you our take on the absolute latest Linux Mint,

29
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,700
some new developments that are going on there, as well as our community news,

30
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,400
follow up and feedback and all those goodies.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,200
But before we go any further, I got to say time approves greetings to that mumble room.

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,500
Hello, virtual log, time appropriate greetings.

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,400
Hello. Hi there.

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,200
I'm still flabbergasted by this earlier Tuesday showing.

35
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,600
We've really got a great forest.

36
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,600
You know, like I thought for sure when we went to noon on Tuesdays that nobody would show up.

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,200
But this has just been awesome. So thank you, everybody.

38
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,500
We have a bunch of people in the quiet listening to Tyler.

39
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,100
It's great to see you. It's been forever since you've made it for an episode.

40
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,700
You're here for a special one, my friend. Glad to be here.

41
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,300
All right. Well, let's get into some big news.

42
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,700
It's going to really shape the community.

43
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,000
I think we've all been kind of waiting for this shoot to drop.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And this last week it was announced that IBM's CEO was stepping down.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,500
Welcome back. We've got some breaking news on IBM.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,400
And that news is that in April, Chairman and CEO Ginni Rometty will step down as the CEO role,

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,700
at least and remain chairman temporarily.

48
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,200
Of course, been CEO since 2012, been at the company for some 40 years.

49
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,700
Before that, the new CEO that will take over is the current head of the cloud and cognitive software business.

50
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,800
That's Arvind Krishna, who's also seen as quite instrumental behind the acquisition.

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,700
I want to pause here for a second because this has been a common narrative now.

52
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,800
Oh, this was really the guy behind the acquisition.

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,300
So if you think that Red Hat purchase is a good idea, this is your guy.

54
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,700
Which is, I don't know, maybe that's true.

55
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,200
Maybe it's at least partially true because he is directly involved with their cloud stuff.

56
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,300
Right. And that's a lot of where Red Hat's value is coming from.

57
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:12,000
But under Rometty's reign, they acquired 65 different companies, mostly small ones.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,900
And of course, the biggest was that $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat.

59
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,700
Now listen how they're positioning this.

60
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,500
So I paused the clip because I think this is extremely telling.

61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
The market has reacted very positively.

62
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,700
And this is from a market analyst show.

63
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,800
Red Hat, James Whitehurst, who was the CEO of Red Hat, will also be elected to the board

64
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,800
and become IBM president in part of this process.

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,300
But quite a significant move in the share price, Mike, after hours.

66
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,200
Of course, it's underperformed significantly, but up 5% on this news of the transition to a cloud leader.

67
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,100
Did you hear right there, because the guy was over talking at the end,

68
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,900
they're positioning this as a transition to a cloud leader.

69
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,500
Which is, that's a big statement.

70
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,400
Do you just get to say that? Is that how it works?

71
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,700
We're becoming a cloud leader.

72
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,100
Apparently the market, their stock price is up.

73
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,200
So this all will actually go down on April 6th.

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,600
That's when this transition happens.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,300
And you heard in there, the other big part of this

76
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,800
is Jim Whitehurst, the CEO of Red Hat, will become IBM's president on the same day.

77
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,900
I mean, this does seem like a big recognition that Red Hat and some of the roles that it plays,

78
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,700
the industries it's in, kind of need to be the direction that IBM goes and transforms itself to.

79
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,600
There's a lot of speculation too, when that acquisition went down,

80
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,800
that people were thinking maybe Jim would eventually be running IBM.

81
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,300
This is up there.

82
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,700
I mean, it's very, very much in the tradition of IBM to promote from within.

83
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,700
Krishna has been at IBM since 1990.

84
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,700
He has a PhD from the University of Illinois.

85
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,500
He's been a senior vice president at IBM since 2015.

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:52,200
And he is a leader in IBM's cloud computing business division since 2017.

87
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,000
Technical background, has been around the business.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,700
I mean, that's not a bad candidate.

89
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:01,000
And he's not too unfamiliar with the whole open source and Red Hat scene either.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,100
I found a clip of him doing a keynote at Red Hat Summit in 2013.

91
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,800
Good evening, everyone.

92
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,200
So, you know, it's always a tough act to follow.

93
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,700
Not quite a teenager, but you go from 20 years to 102.

94
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,900
So, Jim talked a lot about innovation, about openness,

95
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,200
and I think you'll hear quite a bit of the same from us,

96
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,900
as well as some of IBM's observations on the paradigm shift that's happening in the world.

97
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,500
And how actually open and the innovation, the results from open,

98
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,700
helps all of us deal with that paradigm shift.

99
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,600
Of course, I'll have the entire keynote linked in the show notes,

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,400
but I just play that little introduction there,

101
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,200
because I think it's interesting to see him running a keynote at Red Hat Summit in 2013.

102
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,700
And now we come full circle in 2020.

103
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,700
Post acquisition, it's been a year,

104
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,200
and their CEO is going up to president and he's running the company.

105
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,200
And he was on stage talking about how open source is important for innovation in our industry.

106
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,100
Who knows long term how this guy will play out?

107
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,600
He's got a massive ship. He's got it right now.

108
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,500
Absolutely, but maybe this means good things for the future.

109
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Help of Red Hat as we knew it.

110
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,300
Yeah, and he seems like a sharp individual who is very well spoken

111
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,900
and able to answer a lot of questions that the media throw at him.

112
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,300
I watched a couple of different analyst shows that he went on over the last few years

113
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,800
just to get a sense of the guy and he can immediately overwhelm the reporter sitting at the desk.

114
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
There was one of them, I didn't link it,

115
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,900
but there's one of them where he starts giving an answer

116
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,300
and the reporter didn't realize they're still on the wide shot.

117
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,200
He looks over at the co-anchor and just goes,

118
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,000
oh my gosh, and he rolls his whole face.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,600
And then when they come back, he's trying to recompose

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,700
and he's trying to grasp what the man is telling him.

121
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,500
So he's a very intelligent individual obviously as well.

122
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,000
So I think and that's something I wanted to draw attention to is

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,700
traditionally these leaders at IBM haven't been from an extremely technical background.

124
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,300
In fact, it's been the exact opposite.

125
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,900
They've come from more like the sales background or the business growth background.

126
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,000
He's actually coming, I mean, he's got a degree in engineering.

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,500
He's worked in the engineering area.

128
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,900
So he's actually got an engineering background which is a little unusual

129
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:29,900
for the last few CEOs and even heads IBM's research unit among other duties.

130
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,200
Yeah, so who knows?

131
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Who knows?

132
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,000
But it's one of those things that I think I wanted to touch on

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,900
because I feel like it will have long-term knock-on effects.

134
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,500
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a marker of the next stage for IBM.

135
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:48,600
Yeah, and a lot of pressure on that new guy to show results in services and cloud.

136
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,500
Got to show results.

137
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,600
Now, let's talk about something else that's showing some results.

138
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,400
We talked about this one a little while ago too, although not as long as Linux Mint.

139
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,100
System D, Home D is merged right in.

140
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,700
Now, of course, it's not in a System D that's on a distribution near you yet,

141
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,900
but it will be coming to future versions of System D.

142
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,100
It is in the 2.45 releasing up.

143
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,600
Yeah, if you don't recall, and you might not because we only talked about it,

144
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,500
I mean, just recently back in episode 320, System D, Home D makes it easier to support things

145
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,300
like migratable home directories, self-containment within home directories,

146
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,600
better password and encryption handling, and other modern features.

147
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,300
Now, you should probably check out 320 if you want very in-depth details.

148
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,900
Yeah, we've got some clips from Leonard's talk introducing it.

149
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,600
It's kind of surprising how fast this has been merged.

150
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,600
But as we mentioned, it's an optional feature that's just landing upstream.

151
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,300
So it'll be a while before we see any distros taking advantage of it, I'm sure.

152
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,400
And think of it as like two major pieces.

153
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,500
You have System D, Home D, which is the server for managing the home directories and user accounts.

154
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,600
And then you have a user space tool for interacting with this new service,

155
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,700
which is, surprise, surprise, called Home CTL.

156
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,900
Home Cuddle, isn't that one version?

157
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,100
You got to have a new Cuddle if you have a new server.

158
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,800
I don't like that.

159
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,100
I don't like that at all.

160
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,600
I do not like that.

161
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,300
I like that even less than I like calling QT cute.

162
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
And I hate that.

163
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,300
So we're not called, it's one of the reasons we're not even doing the cute story today.

164
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,900
Because I just hate saying cute.

165
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Anyways, you know how whenever you talk about things that Apple has open sourced and hasn't screwed up,

166
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,100
and then eventually after you talk about WebKit, eventually you get down to CUPS,

167
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
and you're like, oh yeah, remember they bought CUPS?

168
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,200
The common Unix printing server?

169
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Yeah, that one.

170
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Well, more than a decade after Apple acquired the CUPS source code and its lead developer, Michael Sweet,

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
he has left Apple. CUPS' lead developer is moving on.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,100
Yeah, I guess this announcement came just before Christmas.

173
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,700
He'll be taking a break and then plans to begin forming a new business with his wife.

174
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
That's great.

175
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,900
Yeah, and I mean, he's already been busy.

176
00:10:53,900 --> 00:11:02,400
Already since leaving Apple this month, Sweet went on to announce Lprint as a new label printer software package for Linux and Mac OS.

177
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,500
Lprint is a print spooler designed for label printing on hardware like Dymo label makers.

178
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,300
Already, he's been quickly advancing Lprint with a 1.0 release on the horizon soon.

179
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,700
Label printers are the bane of printing, so it's nice to see something that's...

180
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,100
And it is sort of exactly one of those weird use cases where it's probably some horrible Windows program

181
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,100
that you have to load just for this one machine, and of course, there's no Linux support, but hey, maybe now there is.

182
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:33,100
I would like to see some sort of bracketed fight between you, Sweet, and Bacon.

183
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,300
Payne, Sweet, and Bacon.

184
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,200
Which truly is the best DJ name?

185
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,000
And I'd like to see like some sort of bracketed sort of...

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,300
There'll have to be some contests, I think.

187
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,800
I mean, Payne is very hard to beat.

188
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,300
Bacon's good, and Sweet is nice, but Payne...

189
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,700
Payne is like an action hero name, I've always thought.

190
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,200
So like if you ever wanted to get into like rock and roll, Wes Payne bringing you the hits.

191
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,000
You should see my Matrix moves.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,500
Oh, I have Wes Payne. I have indeed.

193
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,900
So now we'll see what happens with cups.

194
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:08,400
Will Apple promote from within or seek somebody outside to take over the reign?

195
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,000
Will Apple decide that printing is so 1990 and then just remove it from its systems and print through the iCloud print service?

196
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,300
Who knows?

197
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,700
I don't think there is an iCloud print service.

198
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,700
Maybe an Apple printer coming soon, huh?

199
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Oh, my gosh.

200
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,500
Yeah, it's going to be $1,000.

201
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,900
And it'll only print special paper.

202
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,700
But very glossy.

203
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:39,500
This last item here is just sort of acknowledging that we received a lot of different types of feedback,

204
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,700
all really good constructive feedback about our burnout discussion in a recent episode.

205
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:55,500
And it seems like we kind of touched on something that's pretty universal and we're left with a sense that there might be more we could do on this topic.

206
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,500
But I struggle to think of what something could be a genuine contribution to people that are struggling with burnout.

207
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,800
Right, we kind of fell on the conversation, but it does seem like there might be more here.

208
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
But what's the right?

209
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,700
Oh, there's definitely more.

210
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
What's the format for this?

211
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,200
And we talked about in the context of open source and free software developers burning out.

212
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:18,100
But from so many people we heard, it was all kinds of system sysadmins and just all types, parents, I mean, all types.

213
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,700
So we are looking for ideas at Linuxonplug.com contact.

214
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Mostly I heard from people on Telegram and Twitter, which is which is great because it was like, OK, we hit on something here.

215
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,700
But then like later when Wes and I wanted to kind of collate it all, we realized it'd be probably pretty good if we got that stuff in email.

216
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, especially for things like like suggestions for content that makes it really easy to go find and reference.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,300
So that's Linuxonplug.com contact to do that.

218
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,900
And I I'm going to I'm going to set a challenge for those of you that are feeling like you're too busy to do anything.

219
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,500
You're burning out. I push you to do something.

220
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,100
Enjoy it for a week just for until the next episode.

221
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,800
When something comes up, consider saying yes to it.

222
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,300
Think of it as like you're forking your thought process for one week only.

223
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,700
So it's not a lifestyle change. It's not something you have to commit to.

224
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,500
But for a week, what I what I what I encourage you to do is break out of that narrative.

225
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,100
Are you thinking to yourself, I wish I could, Chris, but I don't have that luxury. I'm too busy.

226
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,700
Big reports do, man. You're exactly who I'm talking to.

227
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,700
You have to break that narrative. You have to get out of that.

228
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:30,500
I got a couple of links about how glorification of business and being busy impacts the way we think about things and how we kind of frame these thoughts in our head.

229
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,300
Got a link in the show notes for that. Creating the habit of not being busy or just another approach it habits.

230
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,600
I'm doing this myself. I launched chrislast.com, which is a little side project with the Chris Last cast.

231
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
You got to come on there sometime, Wes. That sounds fun.

232
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,100
Talk about anything but Linux. Anything we talk about on work. It's all just like all the other things.

233
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,300
Plenty of other things. Dogs. Oh, you know, I love dogs now.

234
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,100
Just well, I love my dog. Anyways, so I'm doing that.

235
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm going to just do it for a little while. It's like a little side thing because podcasts I started as a hobby.

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,100
Then it became my now it's a career.

237
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,100
And so now it was why I have to do it a certain way in a certain like, you know, all these standards.

238
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,400
We've set it for ourselves. And I was like, well, what if I just wanted to have fun?

239
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,900
Because it's still my preferred way to express myself.

240
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:19,200
And I think that recognition is going to make this a lot more sustainable for me because I feel like a huge weight has been lifted.

241
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,500
That's just it there, right? It's about sustainability.

242
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,700
When you're always, you know, when you don't make time for yourself, then you can't work.

243
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,100
I've never even bothered to set up my own website before because I thought I don't have time for that.

244
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,600
I got to put everything I have in these shows I'm doing every single day.

245
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,800
Like that's what I got to spend my attention on.

246
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,400
But then I realized like I was kind of robbing from Peter to pay Paul.

247
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,100
And if I don't have some sort of creative outlet like that,

248
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,500
it turns into just this total grind fest that I end up resenting and hating and not feeling motivated about.

249
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,100
And it was just sort of a it just took a little bit of a perspective shift.

250
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,900
And that's why I really want to encourage people that if you're feeling burned out,

251
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,100
do something that you are at first are resistant to and just try it for one week until the next episode.

252
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,400
And if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

253
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,300
But just think of it as forking your way of thinking or maybe setting a theme for a week.

254
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,800
I like that. And I mean, that's the thing is it's not easy that you got to you got to be intentional about it.

255
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,300
Yeah. And and the moment you start thinking to yourself, I'm too busy for that.

256
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,300
That's the moment to catch yourself and think or should I just try this for a bit

257
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,400
and just go with it because what's the frickin worst that could happen?

258
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,600
I'm already miserable. Right. So give that a go.

259
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,700
I don't know. We're getting a little meta, but I just it touched me how much feedback we got.

260
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,600
And I felt like Jesus is something people are really struggling with.

261
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,200
And it is something that I myself have cycles and cycles and cycles of experience with now over the years.

262
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,300
And, you know, it comes up in different ways. So maybe it's something we can help a little about.

263
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,700
Maybe that's something I'll do in my side stuff or something. I don't know.

264
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,800
In the meantime, I do know we got some housekeeping. Not a lot this week.

265
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I want to give a shout out to Mr. Cheesy Bacon. You might notice he's not here.

266
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,300
He just went through a let's just say a procedure I wouldn't want to go through.

267
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,900
And he's recovering right now. Like a boss.

268
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,800
He showed up for his weekly meeting.

269
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,200
We tried to kick him out and say go rest, but he was having none of it.

270
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,500
So everybody sends your your get well vibes to Mr. Cheese Bacon. Shout out to Cheesy.

271
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,100
We miss you, buddy. But we know you're here with us.

272
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,200
And you can catch him on Telegram at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash Telegram.

273
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,700
That's been growing great.

274
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,700
One of the things Cheesy helped us do, along with our fricking amazing community,

275
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,500
is implement some bots in some of these channels.

276
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,100
So it's cut down on the spam, which has meant the actual genuine conversations have.

277
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,600
It's amazing. Have really blossomed in there.

278
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
So Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash Telegram for that.

279
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,000
And then last but not least, if you like Linux and you like to know what's going on in this industry, I do.

280
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,700
Do you? Yeah. Well, good news, Wes.

281
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,400
You should check out Linux Headlines at Linux Headlines dot show every single weekday.

282
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,800
That's not like a really long sort of boring news show. Three minutes or less, Wes.

283
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,500
Perfect. Three minutes or less.

284
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:59,300
And it's a fantastic, well-researched breakdown that is vetted by the team before it gets published.

285
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,000
So check that out at Linux Headlines dot show every single weekday in three minutes or less.

286
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,900
Now also publishing to the Jupiter Broadcasting YouTube channel,

287
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,300
YouTube dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

288
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,400
You'll see the most recent Brunch with Brent over there.

289
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, yeah. So Brent just had an incredible Brunch with Peter Adams.

290
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,400
That name sounds familiar.

291
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,100
It's because he is the guy behind the Faces of Open Source project.

292
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,900
What a great chat because it's it's Brent who's a photographer talking with another photographer

293
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,400
about how they both leverage their skills to promote and showcase open source.

294
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,000
I loved it. That could have been a launch episode right there, Brent.

295
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Well, we're hoping to have many more of those coming up.

296
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,600
So we'll have many launch episodes coming, maybe.

297
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,700
Yeah. A lot of good things in the Brunch pipeline.

298
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,100
I'm excited. People are really loving it. Extras dot show for that.

299
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,100
And you can look at the category. There's ways to get feeds just for Brunch.

300
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,900
I mean, maybe one day you won't have to mess with that.

301
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,900
But in the meantime, Extras dot show. Go catch that.

302
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,700
And it's also on the YouTube channel. Peter Adams. Super fascinating guy.

303
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,600
Really well known photographer in the open source community.

304
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,800
And just a great talk. Two of you really hit it off.

305
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,300
And I enjoyed the hell out of that. Extras dot show or YouTube dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

306
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,100
That, my friends, is the totally improv housekeeping.

307
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,600
That wasn't too bad. No, we got through it OK.

308
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,300
So you know what else is unique about episode 100 besides it being the last time we reviewed Linux Mint?

309
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,100
You know what else is unique about that episode?

310
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,300
I could be wrong, but I seem to recall it was Wes Payne's first episode.

311
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,400
That's right. So that was also a post barbecue episode.

312
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,300
I mean, it's snowing outside so it doesn't make sense, but I wish we were barbecuing.

313
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,700
It's really kind of snaning right now. You know, it's snaning, not necessarily snowing.

314
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Yeah, that was a fun episode.

315
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,100
And so we'll link that on the old noteskis if you're interested in our previous take.

316
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:59,100
At the time, though, I was concerned that I didn't feel like it was something you could recommend

317
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,600
because it just seemed more logical to go with Ubuntu proper,

318
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,300
which had Canonical behind it, had hardware vendors in the marketplace,

319
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:12,800
and had an obvious long-term support cycle that you could depend upon.

320
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,700
That was one of my concerns about Mint back then, which, how long ago, when was that?

321
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,800
I got to go look at the date just so we have a reference point here.

322
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,500
That was back on July 7th, 2015.

323
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Linux Mint 17.2, I think we were talking about.

324
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,800
Colonel 3.15? Yeah, 17.2.

325
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,500
Yeah, you're right. Oh my gosh. Look at that.

326
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,200
Anyways, I think those concerns did not bear out. Linux Mint has continued on.

327
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,100
Right. I mean, because they don't have the same sort of control that Ubuntu does

328
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,200
because they're using so much of Ubuntu's packaging.

329
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,900
But you're right. It's not like it's been a super unstable.

330
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,800
We don't hear a lot of complaints about from Linux Mint users.

331
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:59,300
Right. And, you know, they recently received nearly 25,

332
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,100
no, they did receive over $25,000 in a single month of donations.

333
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,400
That's some pretty great support.

334
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,400
And they've just released their latest version last month,

335
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,000
and they've just published a new set of updates to it.

336
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,200
And we thought, all right, it's time to give 19.3 a go.

337
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,900
It's been too long. Let's see what it's like.

338
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,200
And so I wanted to get kind of a pulse from the audience type thing

339
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,500
because a lot of times I think people typecast Linux Mint as,

340
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,100
oh, it's a good Windows replacement or, you know, if you're new to Linux,

341
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,800
you should use Linux Mint. And I hate that.

342
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,600
I hate when we do that because every distro can be for anybody.

343
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,300
Just depends on your approach.

344
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,000
Sure, some distros have a much steeper ramp,

345
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,600
but if you're well-read, willing to do your research, ask questions,

346
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,900
you can basically just about any dang distro going,

347
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,800
no matter what your previous skill level is, with some exceptions.

348
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,400
So when I wanted to get a feel for why people in our audience

349
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,900
were using Linux Mint, here's a little bit of what I got back when I asked.

350
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,600
This comes from at all on Twitter.

351
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,700
He says, I transitioned from Windows 10 to Mint

352
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,300
after I failed to migrate from Windows 7,

353
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,700
and I thought performance was too crappy on Windows 7.

354
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,100
I expected a bit of blowback from usability and other things

355
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,600
arising from migrating to any Linux-based hashtag distro,

356
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,700
but it's been quiet and it's been going for four weeks fine.

357
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,400
So he did it because Windows 10 didn't upgrade properly for him.

358
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,700
So I thought, well, screw this.

359
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,200
That's great.

360
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,000
I mean, yeah, why not?

361
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,300
What you got is broke.

362
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,100
Dave writes in, I donate $15 a month

363
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,600
because it allows me to do pretty much all of my work

364
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,000
without getting in the way.

365
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,500
I look forward to each new release instead of dreading updates.

366
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,300
That's a nice property right there.

367
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,000
And I got a couple of different forms of that that came in.

368
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
The number one sentiment was, it lets me do all of my work

369
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,300
without getting in the way.

370
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,900
And that's worth money to me.

371
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,100
That was what I noticed over and over and over again.

372
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,800
It's actually something we talked about way back in episode 100

373
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,600
because they recently started rebasing on LTS 14.04 at the time.

374
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,200
And that meant that they could have,

375
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,600
you could finally upgrade Linux Mint

376
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,700
without worrying that it would break.

377
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,800
It brought that level of stability.

378
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,100
Right, that used to be a thing.

379
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
I had completely forgotten about this.

380
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,400
Alex wrote in a long time ago, different Alex

381
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,700
than self-hosted Alex.

382
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,000
But he wrote in, I've responded to him offline,

383
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,700
but I wanted to read a bit of this because I thought,

384
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,400
this sort of also shows you a use cases.

385
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,700
I'm a university professor.

386
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,900
And I plan on organizing a new course for my students this fall.

387
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,200
He's pretty excited about it.

388
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,800
The title will be something along the line of Introduction to Linux

389
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,400
and Open Source Software in Geosciences.

390
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,600
Some of the students have never used or installed Linux before.

391
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,400
I've used Ubuntu for many years.

392
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,700
Then last year I switched to Debian

393
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,300
and now back on Ubuntu and Pop OS.

394
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,200
This summer I had some fun distro hopping.

395
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,300
I tried Ubuntu and Kubuntu 18.04, 18.10, and 19.04,

396
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:53,100
OpenSUSE, Fedora, KDE, Neon, and finally Linux Mint 19.1.

397
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,100
That's some first-class distro hopping right there.

398
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,900
It seriously was busy.

399
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,700
After this experience, I switched to Linux Mint for a few weeks.

400
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,800
My main reason was I needed a distro based on Ubuntu,

401
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,600
my habit of command line use,

402
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
and I needed libraries in Ubuntu 18.04

403
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,000
for software that we developed.

404
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,700
And finally, I needed the ability to use the same kernel as Ubuntu 19.04

405
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,000
due to trackpad problems on my Lenovo Carbon X1.

406
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,100
I have to say that Linux Mint is the easiest for newbies.

407
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,900
For example, installing Dropbox, Skype, Melody,

408
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,000
and all kinds of things can be done with one click in the software center.

409
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,200
The backup system snapshots option is fast and easy.

410
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,600
This is something else that was echoed by a couple of people.

411
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,600
It has been a year and I have not done a conventional backup.

412
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,300
Now I'm actually motivated to do so.

413
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,400
So this snapshot system that they integrated,

414
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,400
we got several people that wrote in and liked this.

415
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,800
Like Jeff here said, you asked for opinions about timeshift.

416
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,200
I too had concerns based on the horrible experiences of system restore in Windows.

417
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,900
That's what I was like, is it as bad as Windows restore?

418
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,700
However, timeshift has twice worked successfully on my Mint system

419
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,300
to roll back problematic updates.

420
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,300
I was so impressed that I installed it on my Arch machine

421
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,300
and have used it after I had a problematic update on Arch just a few days ago.

422
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,400
Timeshift appears to be the real deal

423
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,700
and now I consider it vital for any new system I build.

424
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,000
Well, that's a heck of an endorsement.

425
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah.

426
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,400
Yeah, so you can see there's things about Mint that go beyond the Cinnamon, XFCE,

427
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,600
what type of desktop environment that people seem to be really drawn to

428
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,800
so much so that they're willing to put their hard-earned money right where it matters.

429
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,800
And you can see it, I mean, they've got over $25,000 in donation.

430
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,800
So now we're looking at 19.3, which is the latest release, just updated recently.

431
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,000
There's XFCE, Cinnamon and MATE spins.

432
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,600
Because I didn't have a lot of time and I wanted to go all in,

433
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,800
I decided to try out the Cinnamon edition again

434
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,300
because I look at that as sort of the premier flagship Mint.

435
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,900
And, you know, it's the desktop environment they're the most directly involved in.

436
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,500
It's pretty great.

437
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,300
Along with these desktop environment options,

438
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,600
you have Celluloid instead of XPlayer, Gnote instead of Tomboy,

439
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,100
and System Reports, which is able to detect some kind of typical problems

440
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,700
and then give you suggestions.

441
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,600
And there's almost complete, almost complete, high DPI support,

442
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,100
plus a lot more in here, including a more modern version of the Linux kernel.

443
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,800
And this new system tray fix that seems to be kind of working

444
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,100
that they've introduced to try to get all the icons from different apps

445
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,700
at the right size crammed down in the corner like you're used to back in the day.

446
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,100
And everything just worked.

447
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,900
Problem is that some apps are not still working, like Nextcloud.

448
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,000
And NixNote don't work, and the HP printer demon little app thing

449
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,500
doesn't show up down there.

450
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,700
In fact, it can even cause the HP GUI just to crash altogether.

451
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,600
Yeah, so it's not perfect, but they're aware of those issues.

452
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,200
But they're trying to just address some of those things

453
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,700
that I think users come to expect.

454
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,200
Now, as far as my bias is when I went into this,

455
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,800
my opinion of Cinnamon in the past is it's really nice.

456
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,700
It's a lot like a sweet spot between GNOME and Plasma,

457
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,900
but it just misses some refinement.

458
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,900
Just misses like things are a little unstable, things don't seem quite finished.

459
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,800
It's not like seeing its full potential.

460
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,000
I do not feel that way in my usage so far.

461
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:22,000
This release feels like it's carrying forward years of refinement now.

462
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,800
And this version of, so this is Cinnamon 4.45 that ships in this.

463
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,400
And the performance is great.

464
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,600
The experience, I'd say, feels classy.

465
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,700
Feels classy.

466
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,000
Feels refined.

467
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,800
Within seconds, I had my theme set up the way I like.

468
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,000
I had my icons changed over.

469
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,200
And of course, Linux Mint still feels a little bit like one of those,

470
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,700
everything including the kitchen sink distros to a degree.

471
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,100
And so all the themes and icon styles and everything I might want

472
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,600
were already pre-installed.

473
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,700
So it's ready to go.

474
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,600
Firefox ready to go.

475
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,900
The panel was always my biggest niggle in Cinnamon.

476
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,300
And now it feels like one of the most solid panels out there.

477
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,700
I don't think I've really used Linux Mint since then.

478
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,200
You know, maybe checked in here or there.

479
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
And it feels like a whole new panel.

480
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
It's minimal without being too minimal.

481
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Feels very clean.

482
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,000
And honestly, I was very surprised by how snappy everything felt.

483
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,800
And they've brought forward the feature I like the most from the plasma panel

484
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,300
is that's where you go into dedicated edit mode where the UI actually

485
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,000
reflects that you're in a mode to change the panel.

486
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,200
And it kind of has color theme matched highlights that it does,

487
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,400
hotspot areas that it lights up.

488
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,800
And you can toggle that mode.

489
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
And so it's locked in when you're not in that mode.

490
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,700
And it takes up the minimum amount of space.

491
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,400
And it just looks really good.

492
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,900
It functions exactly like you'd expect.

493
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,500
Everything's where you'd want it.

494
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,600
When I sat down and started using Cinnamon,

495
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,900
it was like I had been using it since episode 100.

496
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,200
Like I never stopped.

497
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,200
There has not been a moment yet where I've been hunting for something.

498
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,000
Everything's where I expect it.

499
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,200
It took me seconds to get my displays.

500
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,100
I have multiple displays on this system, get them working.

501
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,600
Absolutely think this has gotten to a point of refinement.

502
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
I really do.

503
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,200
I don't know if it's for me still.

504
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,600
What do you think about that?

505
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,900
Well, one thing that struck me is, you know,

506
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,200
it definitely looks a lot more polished and nice,

507
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,500
but it's not, you know, in the latest Ubuntu and I'm sure 2004,

508
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Ubuntu's got a pop with Yaru looking really great

509
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,100
and sort of the bright colors, the oranges and the purples,

510
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,000
especially on a high DPI screen.

511
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,900
It's just a beautiful desktop these days.

512
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,100
It's gorgeous.

513
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,400
Linux Mint doesn't quite have that, but not, I don't think in a bad way.

514
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,000
It's just, it's just very understated, understated.

515
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,900
Yeah, but it gets out of your way.

516
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,500
It's not trying to capture your attention with itself,

517
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,700
but it also now I think with that polish means

518
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,900
it also doesn't have some of those distracting flaws.

519
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,500
So like you said, you just sit down, you get right to work.

520
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,900
You just get to work.

521
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,100
You're right. And it's the low, it's low key.

522
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,000
It's a low key visual style. That's what it is.

523
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,800
Even the grub menu, which looks nice.

524
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,400
Not a ton of contrast.

525
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah. And you know, you hear in the, when people are writing in you,

526
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,600
what we saw echoed was it just gets out of my way.

527
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,800
And I, I wouldn't be surprised if there is a visual element of,

528
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,400
it's not flashing at me.

529
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,000
Now, you know, I say all that, I kind of like the new looks too.

530
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,200
See, I'm the kind of guy who can appreciate wobbly windows

531
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,800
and I can appreciate a regular setup

532
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,700
where everything snaps to a, to a spot in the screen.

533
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,700
So I have a pretty wide range of tolerance

534
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,900
and I can generally find something I like about all of them.

535
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,500
This Cinnamon setup is a little cliche to say,

536
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,000
but if I had a family member or a friend that was on Windows 7 right now

537
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,200
or Windows 8 and didn't want to go to 10 or God forbid Vista,

538
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,300
I would seriously consider Cinnamon. This is nice.

539
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,500
I think the thing is it works like you would expect.

540
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,700
It's just a very intuitive interface, especially I think to Windows users.

541
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,100
Nemo is a fine looking file manager

542
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,600
and I found the whole experience to be just sort of friendly.

543
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,000
You know, the software was easy to find and install, backups are made quite available.

544
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,400
It feels like it's been thought of for people coming in and starting to use the system.

545
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,900
I want to jump on that for just a second.

546
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,900
It's all right there, like boot repair menu where you can just, you know,

547
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,600
check your bootloader and see if there's something wrong with it and repair it.

548
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,500
Backup is just called system backup.

549
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,700
The driver manager is just called driver manager.

550
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,800
And when you like log in the first time it asks like,

551
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,800
oh, you might need to set up some of your hardware. Here's the driver manager.

552
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,700
Now, it did manage to think that my Intel Wi-Fi needed a thing

553
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,100
and didn't think the device was working.

554
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,700
But the flip side, it's for whatever reason,

555
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,100
joining the Wi-Fi seems way faster on Linux Mint than it has under KDE neon.

556
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,000
I wonder if, I mean, they're using the network manager, I assume, right?

557
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,900
Yeah, I was also very impressed just setting it up to get installed

558
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,000
because on my ThinkPad here, you know, I've got a whole bunch of distros installed

559
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,900
and I like to test things out and see how well does the installer cope

560
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,000
with having other Linux distributions there.

561
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,300
Does it detect it? Does it handle it right? Does it offer?

562
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,000
It did very well. It found all my existing users.

563
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,700
It offered to sort of automatically shrink a partition

564
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,600
and add itself in there without overriding stuff.

565
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,200
And when I mess things up and, you know, I'm disappointed to say that

566
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,200
because it's based on 1804, it still has that bug where if you try to put grub on XFS,

567
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,800
it doesn't work because it doesn't install the XFS module and it can't find grub.

568
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,300
It reinstalled with ext4 and it detected that there was Linux Mint there

569
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,000
and was just perfectly ready to, oh, do you just want to reinstall right over

570
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,600
where you just installed Mint?

571
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,800
That's good. It's perfect.

572
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,900
Not too complicated, easy to sort out.

573
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,800
When you first launch their update manager, it says Linux Mint recommends

574
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,700
you set up automated system snapshots and apply all available updates.

575
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,400
This way, if your computer is always secure and you can go back in time

576
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,700
and recover from any potential regression.

577
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,600
And then it gives you, these are the three types of updates,

578
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,100
security updates, software updates, and system snapshots.

579
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,900
Pretty nice. Brent, do you have some semi recent experience with Mint yourself?

580
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,600
That's probably a really accurate way of describing it.

581
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,400
I actually was a huge Mint user for many, many years before.

582
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,200
Oh, really?

583
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,700
Yeah, it was, you know, if anyone knows my history,

584
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:12,400
I kind of moved from the Mac environment to Zubuntu.

585
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,900
But after a year or two moved to Mint for all of many of the reasons

586
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,600
that you're describing, it's super user-friendly.

587
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,400
Cinnamon was a really nice interface and still is.

588
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,000
And so I probably used it for like three, four years

589
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and recommended it to tons of people and got lots of people on it.

590
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,900
And that was right up until, I'd say about, for me personally,

591
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,400
two and a half years ago,

592
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:40,800
but I've been interacting with friends and family with it up till last year.

593
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,100
And I kept running into these small little issues

594
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:51,900
that were basically based around just some of the software being held back a little bit.

595
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,600
So part of their model is to have a little bit of an older kernel based on,

596
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:03,300
you know, an LTS that's a little bit older as a trade-off to that sustainability, right?

597
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,100
Stability, I should say.

598
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,200
And that ended up causing some problems, you know, that for me, okay,

599
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,600
I'm maybe pushing the envelope a little bit compared to, you know, new users,

600
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,700
but it was even little things like running into issues with KDE Connect,

601
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,900
which I suggest for people who have Android phones to do backups

602
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,800
and access their files and stuff like that.

603
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,400
And things with Nextcloud that it was just, I don't know,

604
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,900
these little tiny bugs that are often referred to as, you know, those paper cuts that just add up.

605
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,900
So even though I loved that distro for many years,

606
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,700
it was just, it just kind of started getting there

607
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,500
where I was just, all these little frustrations added up

608
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,700
and that's kind of what caused me to move away.

609
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,100
So it sounds to me almost like maybe, you know,

610
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:56,100
what Wes described that maybe that hasn't quite been totally surmounted yet.

611
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:03,700
Maybe it's just based on their philosophies of being a little bit slower to have those compromises.

612
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,900
It makes me think there too, Brent.

613
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,500
I mean, way back in episode 100, I'd been a regular Mint user.

614
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,500
It was the distro I was using on my workstation at work.

615
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,400
I wonder if there's like, you know, I think Mint is still great for a lot of use cases,

616
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,200
but it's not, I'm still, even having this great experience right now,

617
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,700
using it and running it right now, I'm still not, I'm not going to switch to it.

618
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,900
It just doesn't, as a sort of advanced tinkerer Linux user,

619
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,000
it's not the right fit for me and in a way that I don't feel necessarily about Ubuntu.

620
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,300
I'm not really sure why.

621
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,900
Maybe it's the server use case, but it just feels like what Linux Mint is doing,

622
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,700
I respect and I like and I enjoy, but I don't need.

623
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,300
I think you just nailed it.

624
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,200
I think that's exactly what it is because on the desktop side,

625
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,800
you can run an Ubuntu interim release that has much fresher packages.

626
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Right.

627
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,800
And on the server side, you're not going to run Linux Mint.

628
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,800
And you do want something that is of a more stable cadence.

629
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,200
And for us, Mint just doesn't fit within that spectrum.

630
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,300
However, if I was using this as a research station to write papers

631
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,400
and to collect information on the web,

632
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,300
or if I was using this as a way to terminal into systems,

633
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,200
or if I wanted to deploy a terminal services environment,

634
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,600
I might go with the Monte edition, but you know what I mean?

635
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,700
Like there are use cases I absolutely could see for Mint

636
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,100
where people would fit within the spectrum use case of it

637
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,500
and that's clearly bared out by the donations.

638
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,800
And I picture it not as newbies, which is I think probably a portion of them.

639
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,300
So I think it's fair to say newbies like Mint.

640
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,800
And it seems to be that like there's some cultural channels

641
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,200
that people find themselves in that sort of push them towards Mint if they're new.

642
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,400
But I also think it's people that just want to get the damn work done.

643
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,100
And I think there's way more of them than we give credit to.

644
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,600
Yes, if you don't need to have the latest desktop software, right?

645
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,100
You're not trying to go find the latest version of KDE Connect

646
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,300
that has the feature you heard about that you want to try.

647
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,200
You just want to make sure that you can get LibreOffice

648
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,600
and you feel like your computer is secure

649
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,400
and you've got the science tools you need or whatever.

650
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,600
It's perfect for that.

651
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,000
It seems like to me Mint too is still that distribution

652
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,300
that promises to shave off a few rough edges

653
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,300
that I think you could argue are there or not.

654
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
So I'll give you an example.

655
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,900
When you launch the Update Manager again,

656
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,500
this is because it's such a great,

657
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,100
their Update Manager is such a great personification

658
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,000
of the distribution's philosophy.

659
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,200
So it's such a great way to just totally encapsulate

660
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,900
the distribution's outlook on things.

661
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,600
So when you open it,

662
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,200
first it gives you that advisory I read earlier.

663
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,500
Then it says, hey, why don't you use a local mirror?

664
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,100
Hit this button here and go get a local mirror

665
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,700
so that way you get the fastest downloads.

666
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,900
Totally possible on any distro, right?

667
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,500
But they're shaving off that 5% extra effort

668
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,600
you'd have to take to go copy-paste to the command line

669
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,000
to do it yourself.

670
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,300
Just making it right there up in front

671
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,300
and discoverable as a result.

672
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,200
Right, that's a huge thing that we don't give credit to.

673
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,000
Then when you're in there in the settings

674
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,300
after you've said, yeah, I want to do that,

675
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,500
they have other things in here that I think,

676
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,900
even if they're not necessary,

677
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,900
promise the user that it's solving problems for you

678
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,500
that you don't want to have to manage.

679
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
And I think we can't understate how important that is

680
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,400
because the operating system is supposed to manage

681
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,600
the computer for you so you can get your work done.

682
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,100
And that's kind of what Mint is promising here.

683
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,900
Like when you go to the maintenance thing,

684
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,500
you can do things like purge residual configuration

685
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,900
or add missing GPG keys or remove a foreign package

686
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,700
or downgrade a foreign package

687
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,000
with these buttons in the software sources application.

688
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,400
They're all things you could do with apt on the command line.

689
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,300
Right, but it's that model that is more similar

690
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,500
to how some of the other operating systems do it.

691
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,600
And I think it fits in with all the bottom models

692
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,900
people already have.

693
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,000
And by putting it in a section called maintenance,

694
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,100
the implication is, is they're handling something for you

695
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,200
that needs to be maintained on the machine

696
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,800
that likely other distributions aren't.

697
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,900
And that has to be valuable to some people when they see that.

698
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,700
When they see something out there that looks like,

699
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,800
okay, it's solving problems for me.

700
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,400
And they've done that across a series of applications on Mint.

701
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,300
And I think when you just kind of look at that sort of,

702
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,000
that one, when you take that one thing in isolation

703
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,600
and look at it, there's a lot to unpack there.

704
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,200
And what I see is a distribution that promises

705
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,500
to get out of your way, let you get your work done,

706
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,400
and save 5% of your time here and there

707
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,600
a couple of times a month.

708
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,500
And when you use something over a year or two

709
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,900
and every couple of months or every couple of weeks, really,

710
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,800
it's saving you 5% of time versus maybe if you were using

711
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,500
Ubuntu proper, right?

712
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,900
I would see building a real fondness for that.

713
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,000
And I could see really appreciating the value that brings

714
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,700
because there's nothing more valuable than time.

715
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,300
And I could see wanting to contribute to keeping that going.

716
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,600
And there's something great about it being an indie project

717
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,300
that is obviously riding on the shoulders of giants,

718
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,500
no doubt about it, but has also created something

719
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,600
beloved themselves.

720
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Yeah, I mean, they've been around for a long time.

721
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,100
They've survived a lot of changes in the desktop Linux ecosystem.

722
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,200
I used to be very concerned about Clem's staying power,

723
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,300
but I think time has spoken.

724
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,100
And here they are still cranking it out.

725
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,900
By my account from a software, I have no idea

726
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,700
how they're doing morally or how they're holding up as a team.

727
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,400
But from an output side, this is the best looking mint

728
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
I've ever seen.

729
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Absolutely.

730
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,100
And that's not a small thing.

731
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:29,100
I can genuinely appreciate the value of this distribution now.

732
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,600
Even if it's not for us, it doesn't

733
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,900
fit within our use case spectrum.

734
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,700
Isn't it great that we have an ecosystem

735
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,100
that this is even possible?

736
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,000
That Canonical and Debian and all the ecosystems

737
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,300
of open source and free software,

738
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,400
that they have an idea, the team has

739
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
a vision for how the desktop can be,

740
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,600
and they're actually able to build that.

741
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah, and I think if you want something

742
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,600
that you can stick on their run for a while, it's great for that.

743
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,600
For me, that's funny, that's the same use case

744
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,800
I attribute to a Manjaro or an Arch,

745
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,600
is I stick it on a machine and I just leave it.

746
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,800
And it just goes and goes and goes for years,

747
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,100
much in the same way Mint does, but solving

748
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,500
two different problems.

749
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,100
Arch is solving the, I like to tinker with software,

750
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,900
I like to have the latest stuff.

751
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,000
It's solving Brent's problem of older things on the system

752
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,500
are incompatible with newer projects that you want to do.

753
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,000
It solves both those problems differently.

754
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,400
It's fascinating to me.

755
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,500
If you were able to just roll with what

756
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,800
comes loaded on Mint forever,

757
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,700
you'd be satisfied as long as 19.3 is supported.

758
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,000
And on Arch, you look back and then you go,

759
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
oh, how can you do that?

760
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,100
It's just so funny.

761
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,600
It's so funny that we're using the same fundamental systems,

762
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,700
we have the same fundamental philosophies,

763
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,800
and yet the two are as far apart

764
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,100
in terms of workflow as you can get.

765
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,600
And it's a real crazy thing to me.

766
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,200
I'm not keeping it on here.

767
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,700
We're going to go back into Kubuntu.

768
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,400
It does make me think it might be,

769
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,900
I sort of forgot about Cinnamon, I'll be honest.

770
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,000
It almost makes me think it's like the XFCE

771
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,100
I could actually use.

772
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:01,600
Yeah, I do feel like I need to give Cinnamon another crack

773
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,100
because I have experienced in the past

774
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,200
when I load Cinnamon up on other distros,

775
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,600
it's not as nice.

776
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,400
That is one.

777
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,000
I don't know, I haven't tried it for a while.

778
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,100
It probably deserves to be tried.

779
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,500
And if you got a spin,

780
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,900
what's that, there's that Ubuntu Cinnamon edition, right?

781
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,200
You know, you got a spin or something

782
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,400
that is designed to run it,

783
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,600
where they've put a little effort

784
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,900
into making that old Cinnamon taste good.

785
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,400
You got to go with Cinnamon, you got to go with that.

786
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,200
Oh, yeah.

787
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Cinnamon and Mint, you know,

788
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,900
there's like a flavor theme going on here.

789
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,100
Maybe a mixed drink.

790
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,300
Yeah, I can see that.

791
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,500
I can see that.

792
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Linux Mint is a bit of a mixed drink.

793
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,700
I did not get a chance to try the XFCE edition.

794
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,700
And that kind of burns me

795
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,600
because the other kind of consistent bit of feedback

796
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
we got in when I asked about this

797
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,600
was it's one of the best XFCE implementations out there.

798
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,000
I think we have some homework, though.

799
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,300
Yeah, yeah, we could.

800
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,400
Yeah, we could do that.

801
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,700
Because I did grab both ISOs.

802
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,000
Which, we don't talk about this anymore,

803
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,300
but some projects still are not great at delivering ISOs.

804
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,600
Other projects like Mint, though,

805
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,200
these ISOs rock down, like boom.

806
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,000
They had a lot of handy mirrors,

807
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,800
or the torrent, plenty of seats.

808
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,700
Yeah, I grabbed the torrent,

809
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,000
and I think they must have had a CDN web seat

810
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,800
on that thing or something

811
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,600
because I downloaded that entire ISO in seconds.

812
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,600
I don't even think it took a minute.

813
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,100
I mean, it was ridiculous.

814
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,000
So, you know, it's funny because sometimes you go try,

815
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,600
even now in 2020, you go download a Linux distro to review it,

816
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,500
and you're getting like just the worst download.

817
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,300
You're like, oh, yeah, it is still hard

818
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,600
to move these large files around sometimes,

819
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,800
but they feel really polished.

820
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,000
As long as you don't go to the website.

821
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,300
Just...

822
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,000
We kid, guys, we kid, we joke.

823
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,100
It's mostly fine.

824
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,400
And I'd love to know what your thoughts are.

825
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,000
Let me know, at ChrisLAS on the old Twitters,

826
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,300
if you've given it a go.

827
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,500
And yes, we did look into the Debian edition.

828
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,800
They do have a new release that's in the works right now.

829
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,800
You know, I have used the Debian edition,

830
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,600
which is kind of their rolling version, if you will,

831
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,000
which was my attempt before moving to Arch

832
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,600
to kind of get the best of both worlds.

833
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,300
And it was pretty slick for a while,

834
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,100
and then it broke very catastrophically.

835
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,800
So mileage may vary.

836
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,800
That was a little while ago,

837
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,200
but it's really cool that they're offering

838
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,700
that sort of testing style of release

839
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,400
that just kind of rolls and rolls and rolls.

840
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,600
Smart.

841
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,700
It's smart to keep that going too.

842
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,900
I think Brent's hooked on rolling.

843
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,600
Yeah.

844
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,800
That could be a podcast name,

845
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Hooked on Rolling.

846
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Because I'll tell you what,

847
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,100
although people wouldn't know what kind of rolling

848
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,800
you're talking about outside the Linux industry.

849
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,900
Got to listen to find out.

850
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:26,900
That's true.

851
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,500
Probably would get a big audience because of it.

852
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,100
Yeah.

853
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,100
I think it's the classy distro.

854
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,100
I think it truly is.

855
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,400
It's like the classy distro.

856
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,700
It's an understated classy distro

857
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,100
that doesn't go out of its way to be super flashy,

858
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,500
but once you start using it, you're like,

859
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,400
oh, there's some charm here.

860
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,600
It's understated, but there's some charm.

861
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,100
If you haven't hopped to it for a while,

862
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,600
it's worth a visit.

863
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,900
Really, I think it is.

864
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,700
19.3, it's only been out for a little bit,

865
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,600
and so it's gotten some fresh updates now.

866
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,600
The one thing we didn't really talk about much

867
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,200
is the system report tool that they launched,

868
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,800
which will help you if you have like missing language packs

869
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,000
or something's not configured correctly,

870
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,800
and that's also something that is hard to appreciate

871
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,100
when you know how to fix those things,

872
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,800
but I think, you know, this is bringing back those feelings

873
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,000
of like when I was, I wouldn't even call myself a newbie.

874
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,300
I'd been using Linux for a while,

875
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,300
but I just didn't understand the Linux desktop, you know?

876
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,800
Like I could do change, you know,

877
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,900
move around the command line,

878
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,700
but there's a lot going on in Dbus,

879
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,300
all the things that make up the Linux desktop,

880
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,000
and you're right, just having things that are friendly,

881
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,900
that pop up, that sort of say like,

882
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,500
look, we got this, there's a way that you can do it.

883
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,600
We'll make it easy.

884
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,400
So check it out.

885
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,300
It doesn't have to be a new users-only distro.

886
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,100
I think it's for people that have used Linux for years,

887
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,200
but just want a nice work environment.

888
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,400
What's that for you, Mumble Room?

889
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,600
I'm curious, anybody want to chime in with their workhorse

890
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,900
distribution of choice?

891
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,700
Neon, without a doubt.

892
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,000
Steve says Neon for sure.

893
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Neon has been really solid, I agree.

894
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,200
What about you, Byte?

895
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,000
Budgie.

896
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,400
Oh, Budgie, very nice.

897
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,300
I could definitely see that.

898
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,500
Tech Mav, do you have one?

899
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,400
I'm on Neon on the main rig,

900
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,300
and then on the hybrid pro, I'm using Manjaro with i3.

901
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,300
What a showing for Neon.

902
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,600
Yeah.

903
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
Yeah, have you all been doing it

904
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,400
since the Plasma Challenge forever ago,

905
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,700
or is it just something you stumbled upon recently?

906
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,300
I've been on Neon for quite some time.

907
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,800
I have, it's rare I switch away from it.

908
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,700
That's great.

909
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,900
Plasma Challenge for me.

910
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

911
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,900
Yeah, since you reviewed it, I've been using it since then.

912
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,200
Yeah, it has, it's stuck with a lot of people.

913
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,900
And one of these machines in the studio is still Neon too.

914
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,400
I just can't keep track anymore.

915
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,200
Tyler, what about you?

916
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,100
Do you have a workhorse distro of choice?

917
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,700
I run Kubuntu on both my machines,

918
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,700
but it's so customized that if I need something quick

919
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,600
and ready to go, I'll actually go with Ubuntu Gnome.

920
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,800
Sure, sure.

921
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,500
Am I mistaken, or has everybody said Plasma

922
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,800
with the exception of i3 as the primary driver?

923
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,700
I think everybody had like-

924
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,200
Wow.

925
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,100
Yeah.

926
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,000
Whoa.

927
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,900
No.

928
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,300
No?

929
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,900
Okay, well, oh, Budgie, right, Budgie.

930
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,700
Budgie, yeah.

931
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,900
Right, right, Budgie, head Budgie.

932
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,900
You know, Tyler's comment there does kind of make me think,

933
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,500
one thing we didn't list here in Cinnamon's favor

934
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,400
is much like Gnome, you can just work with the defaults.

935
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,200
I mean, you customize it a little bit,

936
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,600
but I don't even think you need to, right?

937
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,300
Like if you just needed to get some work done.

938
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,900
Yeah, and I like GTK apps too.

939
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,300
They look good, and the theming's well done.

940
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,300
I like how much you don't want to let yourself admit that.

941
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,700
Well, it's because I do like Plasma,

942
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,800
and I love stupid QT.

943
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,900
You can like both.

944
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,300
I do, and that's my problem,

945
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,300
is I'm torn between lovers.

946
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,700
As soon as I spend too much time with one,

947
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,900
the other says they're getting jealous, Wes.

948
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,900
And most have a lot of needs.

949
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,300
Yeah, they do, including resources, I tell you what.

950
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,000
Anyways, that's it for today, I think.

951
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,300
I think that's all we'll have on Mint.

952
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,700
It was nice to visit it again.

953
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,900
Any thoughts you think we should revisit maybe

954
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,300
in like another two releases or something?

955
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,400
We shouldn't let it go so long.

956
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,100
Right.

957
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,100
No, I think the next major version at least,

958
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,500
or maybe the next time there's a release of the Debian version.

959
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,300
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's sooner than later.

960
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,700
I wouldn't mind looking at the Debian version, actually.

961
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,900
We'll put that on the possibility list.

962
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,000
You know, the only challenge with that

963
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,800
is we're coming up on Fest season, hardcore.

964
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,500
Fest season 2004 is right around the corner.

965
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,100
Right now, we are in the early stage.

966
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,000
Well, just past early stages.

967
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,700
Mid-early.

968
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,800
Mid-early planning stages of Linux Fest Northwest.

969
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,100
I have been looking at barbecue rentals.

970
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,600
So I found for like a hundred and something bucks,

971
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,400
you can get a three-day rental.

972
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,100
It might be a hundred and something bucks a day.

973
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,600
And you can get a three-day rental of a big, long barbecue.

974
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,800
And I'm thinking that's the way to go.

975
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,000
That seems right.

976
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,500
Are we going to need to get like a whole pig then, too?

977
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,900
Oh, man, or at least a lot of brats.

978
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,400
You know, get a lot of brats in there

979
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,800
and get them up to that front of the line.

980
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,400
And we just got the new batteries installed.

981
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,500
So we were off last week.

982
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,800
While you were gallivanting around electrifying yourself.

983
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,400
Yeah.

984
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,800
Got 600 amp hours of lithium ion batteries installed

985
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,100
and 1.2 kilowatts of solar installed on the roof.

986
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,100
That's so cool.

987
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:07,300
So the LadyJoobs is now a mobile battle station,

988
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,100
a mobile workstation with multiple internet connections.

989
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,600
And of course, this is all part of your long-running.

990
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,800
Project Off-Grid, which I've been talking about on Self-Hosted.

991
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,100
And I'll probably talk a little bit on the Chris Lastcast.

992
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:20,900
Chris Lastcast.

993
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,100
It's a big part of your life.

994
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,000
It is.

995
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,700
It was a very big, very big expense, too.

996
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,000
But holy crap is it cool, Wes.

997
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,400
Like, it's totally off-grid.

998
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,300
Even on a bad Pacific Northwest day,

999
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,300
like right now, when it's snating outside,

1000
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,500
I pull in enough solar to run all of my automation

1001
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,400
and Raspberry Pis and all of my smart LED lighting systems.

1002
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,100
Yeah, isn't that amazing?

1003
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,700
I mean, even in the rainy Pacific Northwest,

1004
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,200
solar panels have gotten a lot better.

1005
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:50,900
Yeah.

1006
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,200
So all of the always-running devices are covered by solar now.

1007
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,100
How cool is that?

1008
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,300
So I can't wait to talk more about it on Self-Hosted

1009
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,100
because something I've been wanting to do

1010
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,100
is build a system that ran on Linux.

1011
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,400
It could go totally offline so we could go off-grid.

1012
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,300
I think you might need to record while you're off-grid.

1013
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:09,800
Oh, yeah.

1014
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,500
Test the system.

1015
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,000
Oh, yeah.

1016
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,900
Totally do a podcast on solar.

1017
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,200
Yeah.

1018
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,100
Oh, that's got to happen, for sure, Wes.

1019
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,600
That's totally got to happen.

1020
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,100
Anyways, that'll be in the future.

1021
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,500
Check that out, selfhosted.show.

1022
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,200
And please let us know your thoughts on the Burnout topic

1023
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,900
or anything else we've covered at linuxoneplug.com contact.

1024
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,700
Yeah, I'd love to hear some more about how

1025
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,400
Linux Mint fits in your life.

1026
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:30,900
Yeah.

1027
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,800
It was really helpful.

1028
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,400
I appreciate people that took the time

1029
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,600
to help explain it to us.

1030
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,400
And a note that that Burnout feedback

1031
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,600
is best over the contact form so we can collate it.

1032
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,000
Because that was the challenge this week

1033
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,900
because we were pulling from Twitter and Telegram

1034
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,700
for all this stuff.

1035
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,200
It was just kind of crazy.

1036
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,700
So we'll just make that for the official channel.

1037
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,800
Keep an eye on that.

1038
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,700
Go get more Wes over at techsnap.systems.

1039
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,600
He's rocking over there with Jim Salter.

1040
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,400
Rocking it.

1041
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,200
And of course, brunch with Brent over at extras.show.

1042
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,500
I'm at Chris LAS.

1043
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,600
He's at Westpac.

1044
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,400
Yeah, that's right.

1045
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,000
And the whole network's at Jupiter Signal.

1046
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,800
Thanks for being here.

1047
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,800
We'll see you next Tuesday.

1048
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:45,760
the unplugged program oh thank you everybody JB titles calm let's go vote

1049
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,280
cheese who's here in the chat room just not here on on air because you can't as

1050
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,360
if they work while going down the road and they do what is so cool about going

1051
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:02,560
down the road is not only do the panels still charge the bats but the alternator

1052
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,780
they upgraded as well so I'm going down the road and I'm putting like three to

1053
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,480
four hundred amp hours back into my battery bank as I'm driving that's so

1054
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,000
cool so few hours of driving and I'll recharge the entire bank it's pretty

1055
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:22,400
great it's pretty pretty great I've really been just like I've been really

1056
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,880
kind of adapting to how how nuts it is to have all this all of a sudden after

1057
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,360
so many years of having this RV and not having that bite was asking about the

1058
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:37,920
efficiency of the panels they are 170 watt panels they're tested 184 watts

1059
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:45,240
with a plus minus three percent variance so they just put them at 170 watts and

1060
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:50,040
they're beautiful they are legitimately gorgeous like when I saw them they look

1061
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:56,120
like jewelry and they're made in Bend Oregon oh neat mm-hmm locally made by

1062
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,240
Zamp solar you are so much better prepared for like when we have like the

1063
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,440
big earthquake this region's overdue or the flooding that's happening in Mount

1064
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,320
Vernon right now holy holy crap I've pretty much got all that packed into my

1065
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,720
four-wheel drive and can go off-grid for about two weeks Wow oh yeah man that's

1066
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,920
that is super super sweet the Raspberry Pi running the whole thing and the kids

1067
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:25,440
can pick up streaming movies from MB with an LTA LTE antenna back to my house

1068
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,280
dude we should talk you and I need to talk oh my god we need to like seriously

1069
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,880
you need to Chris Chris last cast it up with me because we need to talk about

1070
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:38,840
this this is oh my god this is totally a melee and I am such an idiot that not

1071
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,040
only would I like to have a huge RS RV but I'd also love to have like an

1072
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,160
off-road like mobile camper too so I'd love to have two different RVs a tiny

1073
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,780
one and a big one how the hell would you afford all this you don't that's why I

1074
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:56,480
don't do it perpetually broke yeah I spend way too much money on vehicles

1075
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,600
it's it's I have a hard time saying no to lady jupes cuz it's my home it's my

1076
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:06,440
family memory machine it's where I work out of like it's it's kind of your whole

1077
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,080
life I don't know why you even have a house I don't I own I own a house but I

1078
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:15,200
don't actually live in it I rent it out to the production I don't actually stay

1079
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:22,960
in studio that does not surprise me even yeah I know yeah that's why I have a

1080
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,320
tent with a small solar panel 12 volts and a brick-sized 12-volt battery with

1081
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:34,880
solar charge in between so when I step out of my tent I put the solar panel on

1082
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,480
my tent walk out do my thing come back in the

1083
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,320
evening put my solar panel back in and I can charge my phone and stuff I used to

1084
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,000
have something very similar when I lived in Mississippi because there was this you

1085
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,440
know fear of hurricanes and then Hurricane Katrina did happen reinforcing

1086
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:55,280
said fear and so we had you know a number of things for supporting well the

1087
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,800
grids gone what do we do when I moved to Connecticut I didn't bring most of that

1088
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:04,240
with me but you're just kind of making me remind myself of all the things that

1089
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:10,080
I should probably have but don't right now yeah I I don't know I am NOT really

1090
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,360
doing it in case you know a Zombo pock or something like that but it is nice to

1091
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,280
have that you know that kind of insurance like if we have a major

1092
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,520
disaster or if I have to leave the junkyard for some reason immediately I'm

1093
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:28,160
not totally so well I still have three backup cellular mobile data connections

1094
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,640
that are that have legacy accounts that can actually like lots more data like

1095
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,360
and so I have a Verizon hotspot I have two extra T mobile lines that give me

1096
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:44,600
that have legacy accounts that give me way more data and in a pinch I can

1097
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:50,120
actually probably operate without you know wireline infrastructure at all for

1098
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,840
including power for about a week because I also have a back I have a UPS that's

1099
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,840
got a humongous battery and if I unplug the computer and plug everything else

1100
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:07,200
and it'll last JB titles so it's only that in Australia if you want to go

1101
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,200
anywhere you're six hours from anything right you need a little bit of

1102
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,060
self-sufficiency this there's no fuel there's no phone connection there's

1103
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:18,500
nothing makes sense so you're okay with this stuff running yeah that that I love

1104
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,320
that you have it though in a nice mobile rig that's that's so great spice it with

1105
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:29,400
mint we did minty fresh for the last one right so we got a the mint mindset look

1106
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:35,420
at you busting that out that's not bad that is not bad I like that for some

1107
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,720
reason why do I like that someone I don't know I actually did it before we

1108
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,720
started the show too so if I remembered what the name of those those Girl Scout

1109
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,120
cookies that are with mints in them I would remember what they're called

1110
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,160
they're so good though yes thin mints yeah although I don't know if I would

1111
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:56,520
attribute thin with mint necessarily not so thin mints yeah yeah you see thin

1112
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:01,040
mint that's the perfect variant for a thin client it's true it's true I wonder

1113
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,160
how that mint box is doing I saw a recent picture of it looks like a nice

1114
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,440
little machine it does it's unfortunately grotesquely underpowered

1115
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:15,680
but it is a it is a nice looking machine yeah dang what is this apple it's

1116
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,640
horrible all right well I kind of want to go with West's and what let's see how

1117
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,000
they because we can't do minty fresh we've done that before everybody loves

1118
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,160
minty fresh it's good I mean it's the pun to end puns it is I'm sure that they

1119
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,160
get that all can you imagine how often the team must Clem gets so tired when

1120
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,360
somebody brings it up I bet this releases the mintiest freshest yet I

1121
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:41,660
mean that must be such oh my gosh cliches are the worst all right let's go

1122
00:57:41,660 --> 00:58:06,280
with a boon to 2004 review yes
