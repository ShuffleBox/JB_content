1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
I want you guys to know I am exercising an intense amount of personal control today because

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,160
I'm still freaking out on the inside.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,560
Yesterday I learned that the city of Miami has created their own cryptocurrency called

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,760
Miami coin and you can mine Miami coin.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,260
So I had to put out an extra about this because I just I feel like I got to have an outlet

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,260
for this.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,240
Otherwise I'm going to end up packing our Linux show full of full of cryptocurrency

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,240
chat.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,680
But after I discovered there's a Miami coin, I just about lost it.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,440
So I had I had an idea.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,560
This is this is my solution.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,920
Kernel helped me create a JB crypto enthusiast discussion channel in the matrix.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,200
And what we'll do is that'll be our crypto bullden.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,400
We'll keep all the enthusiasm and all the chatter there.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,240
So for everybody else out there who couldn't care less, who doesn't want to hear about

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,180
it, they don't have to be inundated with it.

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,320
We'll just keep it all over there.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,280
So that'll be linked in the notes and we'll have it in our matrix room.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:12,840
Yeah, but what we all really want to know is how much Miami coin do you have now?

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,800
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
My name is Chris.

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
My name is Wes.

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
And my name is Brent.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Hello, gentlemen.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,240
I'm glad you brought your JB coin with you today.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,840
Well, you required it for entry.

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,080
I mean, we had to.

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,640
And you must hold.

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
You must hold.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,200
Well, coming up on the show today, our inbox was packed with some rather thought provoking

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,240
emails, including some that push back on a few things we brought up on the show.

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,880
So we'll get to a big batch of those and tell you about some of our upcoming plans we have.

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,920
They're absolutely ridiculous and could potentially blow up on our face.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:52,040
And then because no one should ever try this, I attempt to use CentOS Stream 9 as a desktop.

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,040
So that way you don't have to.

36
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,960
Then we'll round out the show with some great pics and more.

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,200
So before I get any further, before we get into all of that, we got to say time appropriate

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,720
greetings to our virtual lug.

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Hello, Mumble Room.

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Hello, Chris.

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
Hello, Wes.

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Hello, Brent.

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Namaskaram.

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Hello.

45
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,560
You know, I mean, it's 16 people isn't bad, but that's not a high number by a long stretch.

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,640
And this is one of our last Tuesdays that we're going to be live.

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Aww.

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
I know.

49
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
I know.

50
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
Change is hard.

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
It is.

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,560
New year, new server, and a new LUP time.

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,480
It's all starting January 2nd.

54
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,580
We will still have a Tuesday transitionary period where we'll still have some live streams

55
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,840
for a little bit.

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,700
And there'll be some virtual lug action and some Mumble Room action going on on Tuesdays.

57
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,700
So that will still be there.

58
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,240
There'll still be something for people that have a Tuesday availability.

59
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,160
But the show will be moving to Sunday, January 2nd.

60
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,960
And if everything goes as planned, that day we'll have like a potluck brunch.

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,360
That's right.

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,220
And a new server christening party.

63
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,880
And then later in the day, in the afternoon, we'll have our first live LUP.

64
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,500
You'll be welcome to stay here at the studio and listen in the living room, assuming things

65
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,180
are safe and the news hasn't taken a turn for the worse in that regard.

66
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,500
And then shortly after that, we'll also have a new Linux show launching on the network

67
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
as well.

68
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,040
So it's a great time to be sure you're signed up to the all shows feed because then you

69
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,040
get the extra I just released yesterday and you also get the new show when that launches.

70
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
We have a link for that at Jupiter broadcasting dot com.

71
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,640
But there's a lot happening.

72
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,560
If you just listen to the feed and you don't tune into the live show, nothing's going to

73
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,200
really change much for you.

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,040
It's still going to have the same great Joe production and we're probably just going to

75
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,520
be out a little bit earlier.

76
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,460
So perhaps where you listen to land before, you'll now be listening to LUP if that time

77
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,080
slot will just be kind of swapped and we'll have more information about that soon.

78
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,680
But it's all coming up and we'd love to have you here for one of our last live Tuesdays,

79
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,480
which we do have a few more as we round out the year.

80
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,880
And of course, coming up very soon, it's the taxis and our predictions episode.

81
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,840
So those are some really fun episodes to be here live.

82
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,720
But let's talk about stream nine that came out since we gathered together.

83
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,320
And this is the centos I have truly, truly been excited about.

84
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,640
Number one reason it's based on Fedora 34.

85
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,840
That's a great release of Fedora.

86
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,560
They have been for a while, but 34 brought GNOME 40.

87
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,280
Additionally, this is really the centos that was born since the stream announcement that

88
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,760
was built from the beginning as a distribution that's going to be a stream distribution.

89
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:41,740
And I thought to myself, this might be a great way to essentially have an LTS Fedora desktop.

90
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,200
Something that has GNOME 40.4.0, so it's not the latest GNOME, but it's still what some

91
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
distros are shipping.

92
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,040
There's still some current distros that are shipping that, right?

93
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,640
So it's not that old.

94
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,560
It's got Firefox 91.3 ESR.

95
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,240
So this thing's really focused at being kind of a long term supported thing.

96
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,200
So how is this going to work as a desktop?

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,340
And Carl, thank you very much, Carl, he kind of prepared me.

98
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,360
We had a chat, we recorded a great chat with Carl for Linux Action News to talk about the

99
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,840
release to get the actual real details.

100
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,440
But Carl warned me, like, there's a few things in the kernel that are missing between Fedora

101
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,200
and centos.

102
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,100
And ButterFest was one of those.

103
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,880
So that was good to know.

104
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,680
So I didn't go in with the expectation to be able to format my drives with ButterFest

105
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
and stuff like that.

106
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,360
I went in with expectations low.

107
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,140
But you know, during the installation, you get a real nice minimal experience.

108
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,920
It's a lean desktop.

109
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,000
It's just got a black background.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,760
There's not a GNOME extension loaded.

111
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,840
There's no GNOME extensions loaded by default.

112
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,600
And you can kind of then work it up and build it up from there.

113
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,280
It comes with Flatpak preloaded this time.

114
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,760
So that means getting FlatHub up and going is super simple.

115
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,000
And then I had access to every single application on FlatHub.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,360
But it isn't a polished desktop experience.

117
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,960
Like I had this weird problem where GNOME just sort of thought Firefox was perpetually

118
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
launching.

119
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
So I'd launch it.

120
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,880
And then after I closed it, GNOME thought it was still launching.

121
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,360
So you couldn't use the desktop launcher to reopen it.

122
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,480
I had to go to the command line and type Firefox and launch it that way.

123
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,840
And the only way to fix that would be rebooting that I saw or maybe log out.

124
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,000
There's just those little things.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,760
This UI is designed to give you a graphical UI on top of your server.

126
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,280
It's not designed to be a desktop UI.

127
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,480
But I could actually see over time kind of making it work.

128
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,960
And Carl, I wonder if one of those things that would be helpful would be Apple in this

129
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
regard.

130
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,080
We had an ask before the show started to have you explain what Apple is.

131
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,280
And Apple 9, too, I suppose, might as well.

132
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
Because it's a brand new release.

133
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,100
And that's an area you work at now at Red Hat.

134
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,960
So could you kind of give us the elevator pitch on Apple and why people love it?

135
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
Yeah.

136
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
So Apple stands for Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux.

137
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,200
It is a subproject of the Fedora project.

138
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,820
And you mentioned that CentOS Stream 9 is based on Fedora 34.

139
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,640
And while it's based on it, it is only a subset of packages that get ported and brought over

140
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,440
from that Fedora release, a small subset of packages.

141
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,720
There's a lot of packages in Fedora.

142
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,820
And it would be impossible for Red Hat to support all of those for all of RHEL's lifecycle.

143
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:26,200
So that's why they whittle that down to just the things that they feel strongly about supporting

144
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,540
and providing to Red Hat customers.

145
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,760
Every package in Fedora that doesn't get brought into RHEL then becomes eligible to be part

146
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,540
of the Apple repository.

147
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,440
And the same Fedora maintainer can just create another branch and build it and have a RHEL-compatible

148
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,720
package that they just maintain in line with all their other Fedora packages.

149
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,320
So you could see how someone who maybe wants something that's not in that curated set of

150
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,240
packages would find Apple to be kind of a bit of a lifesaver.

151
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,280
So that's great.

152
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,060
Something tells me, like, if we were going to try to use Stream 9 as a studio desktop,

153
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,720
we'd definitely be pulling in some of those Apple packages.

154
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Yes, definitely.

155
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,700
Apple's probably the most popular third-party repository for RHEL.

156
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,880
It's not something new with Stream.

157
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,400
We've been doing it for a long time.

158
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,040
I think Apple 4 was the very first one for RHEL 4.

159
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,600
And it works for RHEL, it works for CentOS and CentOS Stream.

160
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,920
It works for other RHEL derivatives.

161
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,780
And it's quite popular and pretty well respected in the community.

162
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:28,200
Most people just kind of assume when they're using RHEL significantly, or anything related

163
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,080
to RHEL, that they just accept that there's going to be a few things they have to get

164
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
from there.

165
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,720
And those packages are completely unsupported by Red Hat.

166
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,640
But now Red Hat is realizing that even though we're not going to support those packages,

167
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,000
it's in our interest to make sure that Apple is well resourced and stood up and ready for

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,880
the next RHEL major version, which is why now, in a big change, we actually have Apple

169
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,200
9 available now, five, six months, depending on exactly when it launches before RHEL 9.

170
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Right.

171
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
That is really great to see.

172
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
And it shows there's been real progress.

173
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,640
It's a huge change that's only possible because of the CentOS Stream changes with it leading

174
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
RHEL slightly.

175
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,680
Yeah, it's been neat to see a little bit of knock-on effects building on top of each other

176
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
with that change.

177
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,920
It's been a lot of that.

178
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,360
Carl, you joined us on Linux Action News 2.18.

179
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,520
And we went into more detail on Apple, but also the CentOS Stream 9 release.

180
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,620
And it was a great chat.

181
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,660
So be sure to, after you're done listening to this episode, make sure you've listened

182
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,240
to LinuxActionNews.com 2.18 because there's even more stuff in there.

183
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,160
And Carl joined us on a Sunday to help us go through all that.

184
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,200
So double thanks for that.

185
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,520
Of course.

186
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:42,480
Now Wes has been awful quiet behind the scenes because he is working on a big upgrade for

187
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,160
our members right now.

188
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,480
And I'm not ready yet to talk about it because we have more show content we want to get

189
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
to first.

190
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,320
But Wes, like how many minutes out would you say from completion is?

191
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Is everything done?

192
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Is it run now?

193
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,200
Well, it's running currently, but there's at least one of the steps that takes a bit

194
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,400
of time because there's some downloading and some uploading and waiting on some backends.

195
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,800
You know, computer things.

196
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
All right.

197
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Well, then we'll kill a little bit of time.

198
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
We still have a ton of stuff to get to.

199
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,320
We have a packed show.

200
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,000
lino.com slash unplugged.

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,400
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

202
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
show.

203
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,720
Linode is simple, affordable and accessible Linux cloud solutions and services.

204
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,600
Easily deploy cloud compute, storage and networking in seconds with a full featured API, a command

205
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,400
line and a brilliant cloud manager that has a user friendly interface.

206
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,360
And with 11 data centers around the world, Jupiter Broadcasting has been able to locate

207
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,960
systems close to our audience or close to our staff depending on the function of the

208
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
system.

209
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,600
And because Linode is their own ISP, the connections between those data centers and the internet,

210
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,440
well, they're as good as it gets.

211
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,080
And perhaps the very, very best part about Linode, they lead the industry in price to

212
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,620
performance.

213
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:05,600
They have some of the fastest systems in the cloud and they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the

214
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,440
lock you in hyperscalers.

215
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,860
And you always are covered by Linode's outstanding customer support.

216
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,080
No handoffs, 24-7, 365 support you can actually talk to.

217
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,800
Go see why we build every test system on Linode.

218
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,900
We research, we develop, and then we deploy to production on Linode.

219
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,320
We do it all.

220
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,160
Go see why we love it and get $100 to play with it.

221
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,080
Go learn, go try something, go experience Linode, linode.com slash unplugged.

222
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,440
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

223
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,560
show, linode.com slash unplugged.

224
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,720
So we have a lot of email and one came in that I can kind of connect with actually.

225
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,580
I felt like this was a pretty reasonable email and it's one that's been crossing my mind

226
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,020
too.

227
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,720
So I'll start and it came from Jay and he says, guys, I'm a long time listener and I

228
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,200
appreciate the hard work that all of you put into the shows each week.

229
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,840
I was listening to LUP 434 today and that prompted me to write it.

230
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,600
I've been a Linux fan for nearly 13 years, but over the past several months I found myself

231
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,160
growing increasingly frustrated by the entire Linux ecosystem.

232
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,800
My frustration really began when the University of Minnesota's hypocrite commits issue came

233
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,280
up and then continued with release of GNOME 40.

234
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,840
And it kind of accumulated today when I was listening to you guys discuss the state of

235
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,560
Flatpak and software delivery in general.

236
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,480
What I've come to realize is that Linux might not be all that great.

237
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Here's why.

238
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,440
The University of M scandal showed me that Linux as an OS has too many chefs in the kitchen.

239
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,320
As a software engineer myself, I had a different view than most did of that incident.

240
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,200
In my opinion, if someone exposes a flaw in my code, that's on me.

241
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,080
I don't get indignant or angry and blame that person for pointing out my mistake.

242
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,320
I suck it up and I fix it.

243
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,920
To see the kernel development team being so indignant and hostile about the hypocrite

244
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,720
commits was really disappointing.

245
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,760
I was expecting that the OS was being developed by a group of professional developers at best

246
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,340
and a group of adults at least.

247
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,840
They got embarrassed publicly by the scandal, yes, and they responded like petulant children

248
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,440
instead of just taking their lumps and correcting the course.

249
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,960
The simple fact that the commits even made it past QA is embarrassing.

250
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,360
The BSDs don't have this problem.

251
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,960
They have far fewer bugs because they actually seem to care about code review and QA.

252
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Now he wraps it up.

253
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,760
It just keeps going.

254
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,200
In a nutshell, I felt like it was disappointing to see Fedora ship GNOME 40, but Ubuntu and

255
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Pop!

256
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,160
OS hold it back for no other reason than they apparently had more extra work to do to implement

257
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
it.

258
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,880
Ubuntu's offering was mediocre.

259
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,840
Pop shipped Cosmic, which I know I'm in the minority here, he says, but I thought it was

260
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,520
a dreadful experience.

261
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,720
The UI was just a dreadful experience.

262
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,560
That brought me to my overreaching point.

263
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,140
Linux will never be successful as a desktop OS precisely because of the thing that makes

264
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,240
it appealing, the choice it gives users.

265
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,320
Don't get me wrong, I love the freedom to choose, but Linux has reached a saturation

266
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
point in my opinion.

267
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,200
And he talks about all the different solutions we have for the same problem, X or Wayland

268
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,440
or GNOME or Plasma, XFC, Mate, Cosmic.

269
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,880
He says there's serious Unity problems across different teams, no standards, no unified

270
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,680
design language to fall back on, no totally agreed upon standards, which is true in some

271
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,000
regards and not in others, but he wraps it up as he says, final bit here, I fear that

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
without the Unity and a bit of consolidation of development efforts, Linux will never be

273
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,120
anything more than what it is, a semi-polished, cobbled together mess that people enjoy tinkering

274
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,500
with.

275
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,200
That is, Jay, a pretty brutal criticism, and I think it's a kind of understandable position

276
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,240
after the last year of news.

277
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,820
I think it's okay to say too that, you know, like if that, if what the Linux desktop is

278
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,280
providing you isn't working, like there's a lot more to the Linux experience than just

279
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
that.

280
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,160
I don't think we need to force it, you know?

281
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,720
I mean, like I can see some of these flaws, but they don't bother me.

282
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,640
I don't feel like it gets in my way.

283
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,280
I find both GNOME and Plasma to be perfectly functional workstation desktops, whether it's

284
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,800
my personal stuff or development, but I also see how other people have different expectations.

285
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,320
So I think to some extent we need to get comfortable with that too, and we need to talk about what

286
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
our goal is.

287
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,160
Is our goal to take over what remains of the computer desktop space, or is our goal to

288
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,760
make a functional tool for computer enthusiasts?

289
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Yeah, Wes, I think it's interesting you use the choice of words, computer enthusiast,

290
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:37,080
because he mentions that maybe this will never be appealing to the broad computing market,

291
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,520
and maybe that's totally fine.

292
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,320
I don't know if it's realistic to think that we could, you know, be the biggest desktop

293
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,400
around, but we sure are quite good at being interesting to the enthusiast.

294
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,760
And he specifically says the thing that makes it appealing is the choice that it gives users,

295
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:04,160
but that's also what will make it not a successful desktop OS.

296
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
So I'm curious.

297
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,840
You got to compromise a little bit, it sounds like, to sometimes be ahead of the curve and

298
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,120
try some new things that may or may not succeed.

299
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,480
Wes, something you said that struck me here is there's so much more to Linux than the

300
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,760
desktop, and a lot of people in our audience love Linux, think it's great, but they've

301
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,280
decided to use Windows or Mac OS as their main desktop, and then they have a machine

302
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,360
that they SSH into, and they spend so much time in that environment, it's where they

303
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:41,640
spend the bulk of their passion project time is in a Linux environment, but they're connected

304
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,320
from a Windows 10 or Mac box or something.

305
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,320
And I think it's not a bad idea from time to time to take a break from the desktop and

306
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,160
focus on the areas where Linux really kicks ass, and to figure out where that is, just

307
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
follow the money.

308
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,840
Linux is going to kick ass on the server because that's where a ton of money is, and the desktop

309
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,760
is a passion project for a lot of people from a very skilled few who are generous enough

310
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,040
with their time to make something as great as it is, but they don't have the benefit

311
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:19,600
of Samsung, Intel, Western Digital and Google all contributing code to the same subsystem

312
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,640
or something like that, right?

313
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,760
Where the RISC-V people do have that kind of advantage, and it's because that's where

314
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,240
the money is, and so I think there's absolutely nothing wrong with taking a bit of a break

315
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,120
from time to time.

316
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,040
Also, I consider myself a former Linux hype man.

317
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,200
I still see a lot of people out there that do this, a lot of my friends, I used to be

318
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,360
one of them, I mean that's what the Linux Action Show was, it was a lot of excitement

319
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,360
and hype.

320
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,280
I mean, remember that Switch to Linux challenge, anyone?

321
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,800
Yeah, I was just gonna say that.

322
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:57,660
Our mindset was everyone should be running Linux, and now my mindset is there's probably

323
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:04,920
a distribution for everyone, but Linux itself is a power tool, and I know this is such an

324
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:10,440
old tired analogy, but it is, really it holds up, otherwise it would probably have faded

325
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,880
by now, but you don't recommend that people commute to work in trucks or run their errands

326
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,400
in a truck.

327
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,800
A truck is something that has capacity for work, it's something you use as a work vehicle,

328
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,340
and it's not a vehicle for every day, every one.

329
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,160
It is appropriate for some, and we don't sit here and try to sell trucks to everybody all

330
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,560
day long, but when you just come in with this hype that Linux is for everyone and that you

331
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,980
should be able to do a one-to-one swap from your Windows machine to Linux, we're selling

332
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,840
a false hope, and every now and then, we manage to sell that false hope to somebody who has

333
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,920
like a large YouTube channel, and then they go on there, and they call dolphin shit, and

334
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:59,080
they crap on free software efforts, because they're looking at it with a completely distorted

335
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,600
perspective, and maybe one day we could say, yes, it's a one-for-one swap for everybody,

336
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,720
but that's not it.

337
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,800
So take a break, focus on the stuff that does kick ass, and then what you'll find when you

338
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,440
come back in, you'll be really impressed and enthusiastic about the improvements in the

339
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,160
Linux desktop, because it always does keep improving, and so when you take a bit of a

340
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,680
break, even a few months, and come back, it's like, wow, look what they've done, and it's

341
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
fun again.

342
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,280
Hey, I like that approach, you know, focusing on the fun parts.

343
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,600
You don't have to force it.

344
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,280
If it's not working, there's no shame in that.

345
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,080
I think maybe sometimes we attach a little bit too much hype and focus and just, I mean,

346
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,660
I think we all would love to live in a world where the first-class premium desktop experience

347
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,480
was also free software, but if that's not the case, you know, we can still hope for

348
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,040
better things, we can still admire the progress we get, and then also just acknowledge the

349
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,940
state of where things are and be okay with that.

350
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,960
I don't think it's inappropriate at all to think of Linux as a raw material from which

351
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,520
a lot of us are building our own desktop product from, and some of these desktop environments

352
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,880
and some of these distro makers have made it so simple for us to build our own product

353
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,780
that we don't even think of it as that anymore.

354
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:15,160
But if you look at where Linux has been massively successful amongst average users, it's when

355
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,080
a company or a group has come along and taken the stack, they've made selective choices

356
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,400
about what's in that stack, they've curated it, and they've created a product out of it.

357
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,880
Look at Chrome OS, look at Android, and now look at the Steam Deck.

358
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,120
The Steam Deck is a curated product.

359
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,560
Again, they took special effort into making a curated thing from these raw materials,

360
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,520
and that's what we're really doing with our own desktops, we just don't even really realize

361
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
it.

362
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,000
And the end users that have come from something like Mac OS or Windows or Chrome OS, they're

363
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,880
not thinking about it in those terms.

364
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,880
That gets me thinking about, we've had our friend Pope on here once in a while, and he

365
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,600
mentioned that there's a unspeakable number of sort of corporate users who are using Ubuntu,

366
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,360
for instance, and I feel like there are a lot of people who are using it, and we maybe

367
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,080
don't have the visibility there.

368
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,680
But one question I guess I can throw to each of you and maybe even to the Mumble Room would

369
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:18,880
be, Chris, like, do you still get that same giddiness when you use desktop Linux these

370
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,280
days and what keeps you using it on a daily basis?

371
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Hmm.

372
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,560
Yeah, I mean, definitely around new releases, for sure.

373
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,400
I always am after that.

374
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,520
I'm always on the betas before they're released and all that kind of stuff.

375
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,920
So that always manages to still get me.

376
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,340
I was thinking, you know, on my machines that I use, that I tinker with more, I'm bouncing

377
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,560
around all the time, distros, desktops, I still do it all the time.

378
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,200
I think it's just one of the things that appeals to Linux about me.

379
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,320
But on the studio machines, we're going now on what, three?

380
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,840
Yeah, we're kind of on the other side of the spectrum, deploying LTSs.

381
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,040
2018, right?

382
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:01,120
These machines are running Ubuntu 2018 version, whatever the hell that was, 1804.

383
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,160
And we've not changed any of it once.

384
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,520
We haven't changed any of the desktop environments.

385
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,360
We have now, it's kind of funny, we have two plasmas and an XFCE.

386
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,360
And that's what it has been since 2018.

387
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,680
Just by constantly thinking about changing an XFCE, but not quite doing it.

388
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:23,360
But my machine in my office, I mean, it's rare that a desktop environment or distro

389
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,000
makes it three months.

390
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,600
Sometimes it happens.

391
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,240
So it's kind of, for me, it's kind of like it depends on the machine.

392
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,320
One of the things that I have been really enjoying is doing projects on the Raspberry

393
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,200
Pi, Compute Module 4.

394
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,360
And then regardless of what I've done on my machine or what I'm trying, whenever I

395
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,040
want to just try something out, I just SSH into that.

396
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,920
And that's been working really well for me.

397
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,280
Now for another piece of mail, Lily writes in, just writing in about Flatpak.

398
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,240
It has made it much easier for me to choose whatever distro I want.

399
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
I was a long time Ubuntu user who gave Pop!

400
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,160
OS a try and really liked Flatpaks.

401
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,400
Now I'm on Fedora and get to use the same apps the same way.

402
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:11,380
Also one of my most used apps is an older 68k Mac emulator named Bazilisk 2 that is

403
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:17,320
not always included in distro repos and is a royal pain to build from source.

404
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,480
The Flatpak has made it so easy to install and use that emulator for retro games and

405
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,760
distraction-free writing on all my machines.

406
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,220
I don't see myself going back to installing RPMs or Debs for most apps.

407
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,200
Love the shows, have been listening since the days of the Linux action show.

408
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,720
You guys make the best Linux content, period.

409
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
Best Lily.

410
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
P.S.

411
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,160
When I moved to Brooklyn, I got Fios for $60 a month and it is glorious having a symmetrical

412
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,600
500 meg connection over Ethernet.

413
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,640
I think a little poke there at the end.

414
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,760
We're jealous, but we're happy for you.

415
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,600
But I think that really touches on sort of the exploration we've been having with Flatpaks

416
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,900
in that, you know, we heard last episode about Endless OS and the extensive use of Flatpaks

417
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,720
Will is using.

418
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,440
And this is kind of a curious use to me.

419
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,480
I was I was asking you guys, I think off channel, how do I move from distro to distro without

420
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,320
necessarily needing to configure everything all the time?

421
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,640
And do you think this might be one of those answers?

422
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,760
Well, it can help you with the part of getting your applications.

423
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,300
You don't have to worry about different package names or setting up, you know, PPAs or adding

424
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,480
repositories in a different distribution and how you might go about that.

425
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,120
The config stuff, though, some of that will still be on you.

426
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,800
Yeah, I guess the nice thing it does, though, is it enforces a separation of applications

427
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,960
and data, which is already pretty good on Linux.

428
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,120
But this really kind of makes it a hard line.

429
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,400
I think it also touches on our conversation around who objects and who it matters to.

430
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,540
Like, I certainly sympathize with a lot of the recent criticisms of Flatpak and with

431
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,440
containers and just, you know, bloat in software and everything getting more abstract and more

432
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,920
complicated and layers and layers and layers.

433
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,600
But you also see that, you know, for some users who aren't clued into that or just

434
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,920
don't care, like, the experience works.

435
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,400
I think we have to reflect on that too, right?

436
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
That's why this is hard.

437
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,460
And that's why software is so much about these trade offs.

438
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,180
I have to say, I felt like it was a big relief when I got Flathub up and going with zero

439
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,220
effort on Stream 9 because it just meant, oh, well, there's all my applications then.

440
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,000
Even if they're not in the official repo, I just got all my apps that I really need.

441
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
That was nice.

442
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,340
Well, over to the opposite end of the spectrum, Sean writes in wondering about no love for

443
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,340
Slackware.

444
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,040
With a lack of coverage about Slackware pretty much everywhere nowadays, I was surprised

445
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,440
to learn that the project is still alive and kicking.

446
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Why so much silence?

447
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,380
Has it just faded into obscurity over the years?

448
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,720
Has it become the redheaded stepchild of the Linux community?

449
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,080
I call for a Slackware server in the future.

450
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,400
I'm curious to know your opinions on where it stands among the crowd.

451
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,240
I'm not opposed to a Slackware server.

452
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,240
I must hate myself.

453
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
Yeah.

454
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,960
When's the last time you really dove into Slackware?

455
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,000
I mean, we gave it a go on the show a few years ago, but it's probably been at least

456
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
that long, right?

457
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yeah.

458
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah, that's basically it.

459
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,200
You know, Slackware, we really talk about it when people write in asking why we don't

460
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,200
talk about Slackware, and that's almost exclusively it these days.

461
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,360
And the reason for that is, and I mean this with no disrespect, there's just not a lot

462
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
going on, right?

463
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:25,560
I mean, Slackware is a tried and true steady hand, and as a result, there's not a lot of

464
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,480
new things to talk about.

465
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,420
And so with the pace that Slackware moves, you know, it's not really that bad to really

466
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,160
check in every few years and just kind of see how things are going.

467
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,720
So that's about the pace we take it here on the show.

468
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
2017.

469
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,080
That's apparently our last Slackware challenge.

470
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,640
Maybe there's another one since then.

471
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Okay.

472
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
All right.

473
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,120
Well, time flies when you're having fun.

474
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,200
You know, I did a little search too because I was curious when's the last time we mentioned

475
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
it.

476
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,840
And I used our notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com, which I don't think we mentioned enough.

477
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,600
You can sort of search through all the show notes of all the shows, which made it very

478
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
easy for me.

479
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:07,600
But the last mention of it, at least in our show notes on JB, was in Linux Action News

480
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,040
64, which is a little while ago.

481
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:19,360
And the mention was about some potential financial struggles that I'm guessing have been addressed

482
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,200
because that was quite a long time ago.

483
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,440
But you're right.

484
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,380
It doesn't really show up that much, does it?

485
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,160
We need a Slackware investigation.

486
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,160
And then, Brent, you report in like a reporter standing outside of Slackware HQ, which is

487
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,560
probably some guy's house, right?

488
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,160
And then you just got the microphone and you're reporting live from Slackware HQ with an update

489
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,160
on the financial situation.

490
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,360
But first, we'll have to get the news copter to get you out there in the news van so we

491
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
can do the broadcast.

492
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,440
But once we get the copter in the van, then we'll send Brent down to Slackware HQ and

493
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
figure out what's going on.

494
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,520
Live from the scene, still no updates, and I'm being asked to leave.

495
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,600
And it has started to rain.

496
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,980
I don't quite understand what's happening here.

497
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,480
That's all we have today for our Slackware news.

498
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,200
I do think you're right, though, Chris.

499
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,940
Like the value proposition of Slackware has kind of just faded a bit.

500
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
Not that it's bad.

501
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,240
I think we all still have a lot of respect, maybe even love for Slackware.

502
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,880
But you know, there's systems like Gentoo.

503
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
There's things like Nix.

504
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,040
And if you just like want to assemble your system, but still with the help of a package

505
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,800
manager, well, Arch is quite popular.

506
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,420
So I'm just not sure that there's that many users that Slackware is unique enough to really

507
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,880
draw unless you've been using it for a long time.

508
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,720
You know, I am genuinely curious.

509
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,520
I will admit, I don't know Slackware that well.

510
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,360
So could some of you with more experience than I do sort of give me what that proposition,

511
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:39,360
that value proposition really was in Slackware's heyday, if it had such a thing?

512
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,760
Mini-Mech, I know you gave it a go for a bit a little more recently.

513
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
More recently?

514
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
No, I can't really say that.

515
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,400
It was like 10 years ago.

516
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,920
I felt really ready to test all existing distributions that existed.

517
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,680
So I tried Slack, I tried Gentoo and everything.

518
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,440
And Slackware was probably my fastest Linux experience besides Gentoo.

519
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,160
I used Gentoo for like for three weeks and then I gave up because it took too much time

520
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,480
to get my package up to date.

521
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,600
And with Slackware, it was more like the package gap.

522
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,960
If I remember well, I had to import some special repository to have the GNOME desktop because

523
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,880
it was not included as default.

524
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,360
And I was missing some packages, but the experience was really, really good.

525
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,920
I feel like Slackware, it's a good educational experience.

526
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,480
If you really want to get an experience for where Linux has been and how far it's come,

527
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,320
giving Slackware a go, even though it's been modernized as it has, I think is still a pretty

528
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,400
good taste of what that experience is like.

529
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,800
That's not me being dismissive.

530
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:54,140
It's just I don't really have a particular interest to revisit it anymore.

531
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,240
Just like you'll never let us try Linux from scratch.

532
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,560
Well, you can go right ahead.

533
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,720
How about you, Wimpy?

534
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,360
Have you tried out Slackware recently?

535
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,760
No, not recently.

536
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,200
But you're asking, you know, why did I choose Slackware?

537
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,080
And the reason was, is it was the only usable distro that existed at that time, which would

538
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,780
have been 95, something like that.

539
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,880
That's what there was before Debian.

540
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,440
That's why you used it.

541
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Right.

542
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
Yeah.

543
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,320
I don't actually know when Debian started, so that would be an interesting time point.

544
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,640
But certainly, when I was looking for a Linux, my first Linux was Idrassil.

545
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:39,960
And when I moved from that, Slackware was the distro that had the most momentum around

546
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,320
it at that time.

547
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
Debian was 1993.

548
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
Wow.

549
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
There you go.

550
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
Red Hat was 95.

551
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,080
SUSE was 93 as well.

552
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,520
I used Red Hat and Slackware along, you know, side by side on different systems back then.

553
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Right.

554
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,960
Even though I'm not particularly compelled to use it anymore, I would be very sad if

555
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,480
Slackware were to go away.

556
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,040
It feels like a bit of living history.

557
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,960
And so, Patrick and whoever helps him, or maybe it's just Patrick now, whoever keeps

558
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,640
it alive, I am extremely grateful that they continue to do so.

559
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:19,160
And along those lines, OpenSUSE, which I believe very, very early on started life perhaps from

560
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,960
Slackware, has been a topic on the show.

561
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Some of you have noticed sort of a shift in tone.

562
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Kind of funny.

563
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
I didn't grab a clip, Wes.

564
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,320
Did I grab a clip, Wes?

565
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,560
I don't think so.

566
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,600
But we went back and we listened to the first episode of Linux Unplugged of 2021 of the

567
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
current year.

568
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,640
It's us really having a go at SUSE.

569
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,320
I mean, really giving SUSE both barrels.

570
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,640
Not satisfied, not happy.

571
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,160
Very dissatisfied customers.

572
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,360
It was kind of, well, it was a bit rough.

573
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,320
Some of you have noted a bit of a tone shift recently.

574
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,680
And Matt writes in, he says, it did my little lizard heart good to hear all of the OpenSUSE

575
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,900
love.

576
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,800
It was good to hear Chris appreciating the improvements to YAST as well.

577
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,740
I wanted to point out a couple of things.

578
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,720
Number one, YAST is amazing.

579
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,400
But if you're a command line config type sysadmin, all those things are still available in there

580
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,320
right where you would expect them to be.

581
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,780
You can use YAST to change your hostname, but then you can also use hostnamectl like

582
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,940
you would anywhere else.

583
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:25,200
So right there, I got to say for me personally, that's one of the major things that has made

584
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,480
this SUSE transition go so much smoother for me.

585
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,920
Because I decided to learn zipper.

586
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,640
And I've just been like, when I wanted to change my hostname, that was one of the things

587
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,400
I decided to do with hostnamectl.

588
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,400
I still think the experience falls down for me in YAST.

589
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,480
It's better.

590
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
It's cleaner.

591
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,720
It's more focused.

592
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,200
But I legitimately was confused on how I was supposed to change my hostname in YAST.

593
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
I went in there and took a look.

594
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
I think we both were.

595
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
I mean, yeah, right?

596
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Yeah.

597
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
So I just said, screw it.

598
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,960
And I was really grateful that the command line tools were there.

599
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,520
I will say I respect the design of that, that both things work.

600
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,600
It's not like you have to use YAST and YAST tramples on the system necessarily.

601
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,560
So that's appreciated, even if we don't actually opt into really using it much.

602
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,240
It's sort of the perfect sweet spot, isn't it?

603
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,840
Because it means people who do want a tool like that are free to use it.

604
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,720
They can graduate up beyond that if they want.

605
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
They don't have to.

606
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,620
And people who want to use the tools at the command line are not penalized either.

607
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,560
And I think that's been sort of my takeaway as I've kind of, oh, boy, I'm going to lay

608
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,600
it out there.

609
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
I don't know.

610
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,080
This is all subject to change.

611
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,880
It's all subject to change.

612
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:33,920
But right now, if our new Tumbleweed server goes well, the one we're deploying at the

613
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:39,000
start of the new year, if that's smooth, what I think I want to do, and I don't know how

614
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,640
the hell we'd actually do this, but what I'm kind of aiming towards is using this as an

615
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:49,840
opportunity to really get my head around Ansible and then come up with a totally new Linode

616
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,960
infrastructure layout, all based on OpenSUSE Elite.

617
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:00,640
So we're talking a lot of Linodes, and we're talking like wiping it all, because right

618
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,220
now we have a mix of Fedora and Ubuntu and some CentOS.

619
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,720
And I do have a couple of custom VPN boxes that would remain untouched.

620
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,600
But if this Tumbleweed transition we're going to do here on our server goes well, and the

621
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,740
Tumbleweed that I'm testing on this Raspberry Pi continues to go well, I may also go Tumbleweed

622
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,960
on my Pis at home, and if all of those go well, then I'm going to start trying out Leap.

623
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,780
And if Leap goes well, we're going to nuke and pave our Linode infrastructure and move

624
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,540
it all over to Leap and have it deployed with an Ansible playbook.

625
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,740
That's the angle I'm going.

626
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:38,040
That's how much my opinion is shifting on the SUSE stuff.

627
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,880
And a big influencer here is actually the value add that I feel like they bring to the

628
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
tools.

629
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,840
It feels like there's some actual engineering.

630
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,760
Fiverr has been designed in a way that it displays the information to the user in a

631
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,640
very readable format.

632
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,260
It is easy to understand what your next choices are, what the pros and cons are, what they

633
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
suggest you do.

634
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,200
It's all very well laid out.

635
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,360
Your eyes focus on the right part, and it proceeds at a pretty nice pace, and it displays

636
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,600
progress in a nice way.

637
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,960
It feels like a mature setup, you know, from, it seems like, as you, you know, someone who

638
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,900
used to admin a lot of servers, you jumped in, you're like, oh, yeah, this is great.

639
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,000
So friendly and comfy.

640
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I can get stuff done.

641
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,080
Yeah, and it's just enough of, hey, man, you know, you're on Tumbleweed, and you want to

642
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
do an update.

643
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,600
You know, use this command, because, you know, here's a little bit of information about that.

644
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,600
And it's just enough for me to go, oh, OK, so I need to switch over to using this now.

645
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
That's good to know.

646
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Good to know.

647
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,760
Didn't blow up my whole system there.

648
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,840
And there's just that little bits of value added throughout the OS.

649
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,680
I feel very similar about DNF.

650
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,560
I feel like that's a really good tool, and there's a similar kind of engineering and

651
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,560
tooling around the Red Hat and CentOS and Fedora distros.

652
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,600
That's one of the things that's been drawing me in there is I can, as an end user, I can

653
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,960
perceive a bit of the engineering going into it.

654
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,240
And that is not to say Canonical doesn't do the same, because they build some really

655
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,480
cool tools, like the stuff around LexD and, of course, the stuff around some of their

656
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,280
quick VMs and, of course, the snap tooling and all that stuff.

657
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,240
Like, there's a lot of value that they add on top of, like, the centralized management

658
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,800
stuff and the live patching stuff.

659
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,120
So there's genuine value out there, but my type of use of a system, I'm using the command

660
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,560
line package management tools.

661
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
I'm using that stuff.

662
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,840
I'm not using the stuff that, like, enterprises find value that Canonical adds.

663
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,180
It's the tooling for me.

664
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,520
That's what I'm interfacing with.

665
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,960
And that, well, that's built by Debian.

666
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,880
And Debian, they're not particularly motivated to drastically change apt in any particular

667
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,000
way or maybe completely refactor the way it displays its updates or its outputs.

668
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,780
Like, that's just not really on their radar.

669
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,600
And so Ubuntu is not really going to get that.

670
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,820
You know, they're not going to want to replace the built-in tooling that would just go over

671
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,200
like a lead balloon, but SUSE can.

672
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,520
They are their own upstream, right?

673
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,520
They can do that kind of stuff.

674
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,880
And so they have.

675
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,480
And as an end user who appreciates a little bit of nice engineering, I'm seeing that the

676
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,680
more I use it, and that's appealing to me.

677
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,560
Now, snapshots, their early adoption of ButterFS and building the tooling around that, that

678
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,400
also has been appealing to me.

679
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
And so those things I like.

680
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,400
But the one thing we don't talk about in this conversation is the build service.

681
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,080
The open SUSE build service, which Matt points out.

682
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,160
And he says, that's really where it gets great.

683
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,240
It works really nice with Zipper too.

684
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,100
And if anybody's going to scale in March, Matt invites us to stop by the KDE OpenSUSE

685
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,520
NextCloud League of Professional System Admins booth and say hi.

686
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Oh, nice.

687
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
Say hi to Matt.

688
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Yeah.

689
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,240
So, God, I hope scale happens.

690
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
That would be great.

691
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,320
It's so tempting that conference season might just be starting again in a weird, normal

692
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,480
capacity.

693
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,800
We can dream, right?

694
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,980
If you want to hear our old take on Tumbleweed, check out linuxunplugged.com slash 387.

695
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:47,360
While speaking of ButterFS, Marcel writes in, hey Chris, Wes, and sometimes Brent.

696
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,720
My question for you is, why is my ButterFS so slow?

697
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,440
I know you're big fans and even recommended as a root drive for servers.

698
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,800
So I'm hoping maybe you've got some tips.

699
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,400
I switched to ButterFS about six months ago.

700
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,440
And while the snapshots are great and have saved my butt countless times already, the

701
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,460
performance seems pretty bad.

702
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:10,620
This is mostly anecdotal, but if I'm copying files in the background, my UI can freeze

703
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,120
for 30 seconds at a time.

704
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,520
You can probably imagine how frustrating this is when you're trying to get work done.

705
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:21,420
I seek out lightweight software like OpenVox and NeoVim, but still, these usually super

706
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,640
speedy programs just hang.

707
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,800
I read every guide I could and I'm using all the recommended boot flags.

708
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,020
So do you have any ButterFS tips that might not show up in those popular guides?

709
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,940
Is any of this consistent with your experience, or is there something terribly wrong with

710
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,940
my setup?

711
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,780
I know you're not my personal tech support, but I thought maybe other listeners would

712
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,920
be interested in how to go about diagnosing their ButterFS issues.

713
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,320
Doesn't Marcel know no one's allowed to have ButterFS complaints in here?

714
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,680
This is a, no, this is only, we only hype ButterFS.

715
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,680
Strictly hype.

716
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,680
That's all we want here.

717
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Yeah.

718
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
How do you get past the filters anyways?

719
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
I don't know.

720
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
I don't know.

721
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
I don't know.

722
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
So a couple of things.

723
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,520
When I hear about disk activity impacting your graphical applications, I do start wondering

724
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,620
about like your scheduler and I do start going in that direction.

725
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,360
But I was wondering, is LZO, is that the fastest compression available now or would something

726
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,440
like Zstandard be faster and is that usable with ButterFS?

727
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,800
LZO is technically the fastest, but the better balance is Zstandard 1.

728
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,740
We actually did a report for this for turning on compression in Fedora.

729
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,360
So you can look it up in the Fedora Zstandard change for ButterFS.

730
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
All right, great.

731
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,720
It does seem like maybe looking at Fedora's justification for using the Zstandard compression

732
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,600
might be something worth looking at.

733
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,840
But all things being equal to one terabyte SATA SSDs and a RAID 0, you should actually

734
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:47,080
be fine because I've actually done something similar where I have two one terabyte SSDs

735
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:54,040
that are USB and I'm not getting that kind of, yeah, I'm not getting that kind of, kind

736
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
of experience.

737
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,440
So you might look into what's going on just overall in your system.

738
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,860
Maybe have the journal up in a follow mode while you're using your system.

739
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,720
Check in logs, maybe install something like NetData so you can see if there's anomalous

740
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,780
stuff going on with your disks.

741
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,320
Take a look at the health of your disks.

742
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,280
And then I'm also just curious, what kernel version are you on?

743
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,240
Are you running a new or somewhat new ButterFS?

744
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,760
All of that would be helpful diagnostically.

745
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,640
Yeah, we also got an email in just as a tip for those of you who've been using Nebula since

746
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
we talked about it.

747
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,480
Joe wanted you to know that, not Joe that edits our show, but listener Joe, that Nebula

748
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,320
certs by default do expire after a year.

749
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,740
So prepare yourselves for that.

750
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,340
Just a little bit of housekeeping on your Nebula VPNs.

751
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,400
That is a mesh VPN that we've talked about before that we like a lot, but I'll take our

752
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
last email.

753
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,700
Well, this will probably be our last one.

754
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,600
This is a good one I think to end on.

755
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:51,440
So our good friend, Tim Kanem from JPL, former guest on the show wrote in and he said, I

756
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,800
got a good chuckle at your command line episode, since as you can guess, the command line rules

757
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,280
on Mars, GUIs aren't much help there.

758
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,060
As we've learned how the helicopter likes to operate on Mars, we've actually been learning

759
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,940
more command line tricks to help things go more smoothly.

760
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:13,200
We're using task set dash C to put operations on other cores so they don't interfere with

761
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,780
the core that has the critical timing on it.

762
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:22,020
And chrt tach O, which is C-H-R-T tach O, to lower the priority of those tasks relative

763
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,620
to the critical cores.

764
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,080
But as a general comment, I agreed with Wimpy that the distinctive thing of Linux is the

765
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,240
command line.

766
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,400
So much that even though most of my day is spent in Windows because of the office centric

767
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:43,040
business world, I do almost all of my development work on a Linux machine or in WSL2 under Windows.

768
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,920
Once JPL is open again, by the way, it'd be so fun to organize a tour of JPL for the L.A.

769
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,200
area Linux unplugged listeners will be in touch.

770
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:58,280
How awesome would that be to do a meet up at JPL in the L.A. area and get a tour of

771
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,080
the Mars base HQ for the little rover and helicopter?

772
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
Oh, wow.

773
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,800
That's, I just can't even.

774
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,800
It's so great Tim's listening.

775
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
I love that.

776
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
And he's got a great point.

777
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,000
Like you're not going to be using the GUI on Mars.

778
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,200
There are a lot of industrial applications where the command line is going to be your

779
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
only bet.

780
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,080
It doesn't mean it's the only way you should be able to do things, but there will be times

781
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,120
where there's no avoiding it.

782
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,200
OK, all right.

783
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Are you ready, Wes?

784
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,200
All right.

785
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,200
How are you feeling?

786
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,720
I mean, I feel like we could do it, even if it's not even if we're not 100 percent yet.

787
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,080
Yeah, I think we have to because I'm still running into some issues on the backend side.

788
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,360
We'll just ask for grace.

789
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,080
We'll just ask for grace.

790
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:44,420
Behind the scenes, Wes has been working diligently to plumb together every single member version

791
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:52,180
of the show into one master membership feed so you can subscribe to one place and get

792
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:58,220
access to all the member benefits for every show, support the entire network.

793
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:02,520
And it's also now giftable for the holidays.

794
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,460
So if you'd like to join a Jupiter Broadcasting Network membership, it's really simple.

795
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,080
It's just the price of two memberships, but you'll get access to four special feeds plus

796
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,800
whatever new stuff that we add in the future.

797
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,440
So you sign up at Jupiter.party.

798
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,520
That's where you can go to get it for yourself or you can go there if you'd like to gift

799
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
it to someone.

800
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,240
That's been a big request we've had and now we've made it happen.

801
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,240
Come join our party.

802
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,240
Yeah, come join our party.

803
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,340
It took some paperwork.

804
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,800
It took some technical work.

805
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:36,560
It's been in the works, but it means now you get every show completely ad-free.

806
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,140
Not limited ads, completely ad-free.

807
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,560
That same upgrade is going out to every existing membership.

808
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,960
So if you're a member of just a single podcast, it's going 100% ad-free for you.

809
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,320
If it hasn't yet, it will soon with maybe just one or two things you'll find out.

810
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,920
But it's all coming together right now where we've been working very diligently on this.

811
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,920
If you sign up for the Jupiter.party whole network membership, you get access to the

812
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,920
unplugged full live stream.

813
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,120
That's what we're going to be putting in that feed.

814
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,060
You get self-hosted with the member post-show.

815
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,900
You get Coder Radio ad-free and the Coderly report.

816
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,520
It's all just for 16 bucks a month.

817
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,360
That's just the cost of two memberships.

818
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,520
But because it's the holidays, I'm taking $2 off for a year if you use the promo code

819
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,960
TheSignal.

820
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,000
One word, TheSignal.

821
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,160
These memberships, they keep our production going in a time right now where we've, actually

822
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,120
for quite a while, we've only had Linode now sponsoring the show.

823
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,080
Without these memberships, one sponsor, that just wouldn't, that wouldn't, that wouldn't

824
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,080
work.

825
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,080
They just couldn't do it.

826
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
It wouldn't make business sense to run the show.

827
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,440
But our members, they give us the choice to wait for the right sponsorship.

828
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,400
And it takes a long time to find the right sponsor and to work out a relationship that's

829
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,920
equitable and that makes sense and that's fair to everybody.

830
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,840
But that stuff, it takes sometimes six months for a single deal that you'll hear for a single

831
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,840
read you'll hear on air.

832
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,960
I mean, it's unbelievable.

833
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,280
And the memberships, they give us that lifeline to be picky.

834
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,440
So you're not hearing every single mattress ad or a box meal.

835
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,220
The ones that we hear a lot from are like the Loot Crate type stuff where you can sign

836
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,220
up and get a box full of junk.

837
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,560
We don't have to take those.

838
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,400
We can be picky about who we work with and choose the right sponsor.

839
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,080
Our members help us do that.

840
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,080
They help us when it's lean.

841
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,080
They help us stay independent.

842
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:30,600
I mean, it's a really big deal when independent content like this is funded from its audience.

843
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,240
You just look at what's going on in the media today and I think you can appreciate how important

844
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,280
that is.

845
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,500
So go over to Jupiter.party to sign up.

846
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,460
If you're a Jupiter Signal patron on our Patreon, you're already set.

847
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,460
You're just going to have to claim your feed.

848
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,960
There's a process for that and we'll do a Patreon post for that.

849
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,840
It's just a limitations of APIs and tech platforms.

850
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,000
But Jupiter Signal patrons, you're already good to go.

851
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,400
You're going to get access to this stuff.

852
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,320
As we talk right now, Wes is going through and backfilling the feed with all of the previous

853
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,860
membership releases for every show.

854
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,520
So if you've never been a member before, you can now get access to everything in one feed,

855
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,520
one spot.

856
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,880
You'll also get access to exclusive.

857
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,720
If you don't want that, you can go into the membership portal and just download the things

858
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,600
you do want from time to time so you don't actually have to take the feed if you don't

859
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
want it.

860
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,600
You can still just support us.

861
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,600
That's all you have to do.

862
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,600
All the great content.

863
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,600
None of the ads.

864
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,520
And I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't a few kinks we work out with the feed stuff

865
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:32,720
just as we're importing like these live stream recordings are super huge files, really long.

866
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,120
So it's a lot of processing, but it's all happening right now.

867
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,200
And when you go to Jupiter.party and you sign up, you'll get an RSS feed and you'll see

868
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,760
that start populating.

869
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:46,660
And you can use promo code The Signal to take two bucks off that membership for a year.

870
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,160
So not only is it a great deal because it's the cost of two memberships and you're getting

871
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,240
access to all the shows, but then if you use the promo code The Signal, which is only going

872
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,360
to be active for a few weeks, you get two bucks off every month for a year.

873
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,360
Jupiter.party, promo code The Signal, network wide membership is here.

874
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,820
It's been a massively requested feature.

875
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,720
And it was one of these where I had to figure out some business stuff because, you know,

876
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,320
I mean, going completely ad free, that takes some work.

877
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,760
You know, that's why it was limited ads before.

878
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,260
And then, of course, there's back end plumbing we have to do for our publishing system.

879
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:24,880
And then we have different platforms like Patreon that we had to connect.

880
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,000
It turns out when you publish your podcast to every possible place, it gets complicated.

881
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It does.

882
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It does.

883
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,380
So I'm very excited for that.

884
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,480
And thank you, everybody who signs up.

885
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,680
Thank you, Wes, for the hard work.

886
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,680
Let's give them another round of applause.

887
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,420
Jupiter.party.

888
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,200
And you can gift it now, which when I first set up the memberships, I thought I didn't

889
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,200
even cross my mind, actually.

890
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,120
I never even thought about it.

891
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,480
But then as the year went on, people were like, I'd like to gift it.

892
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,640
Every holiday season they would come up.

893
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,760
I'm probably a little late.

894
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,760
Hopefully not, though.

895
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,760
You know what?

896
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,900
Digital gift you can always get at the last minute.

897
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,900
So there's that, too.

898
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,900
Yeah, that's right.

899
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,900
You forgot.

900
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,900
You forgot what your spouse wanted.

901
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,900
Maybe they want this.

902
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,760
I also have a popcorn knot update.

903
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,480
So I got this little tiny popcorn computer.

904
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:14,000
It's a really neat little device with a QWERTY keyboard and a 1080p screen and SD card, four

905
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,280
USB-C ports, HDMI.

906
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,040
It's no bigger than a phablet.

907
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:24,200
But you know, it's early days, and I don't think it's ready for a review so much as it

908
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,620
is it's going to be in the lab in experimentation mode for a bit.

909
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:33,440
There's a post-market OS image that boots now, and you can even get as far up as to

910
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,440
a graphical environment.

911
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,340
But there's not a lot else going on on this thing right now, and there's still some fundamental

912
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,440
hardware that needs drivers and stuff like that.

913
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,880
So I'm holding off on a full opinion right now, and I'll continue to play with it.

914
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,500
And I'm doing a reach out to anybody in the community who has one of these and has some

915
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:55,420
experience and would like to sync up with me, chris at jupyterbroadcasting.com for that.

916
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:58,480
Well before we go, I think we've got time for a pick.

917
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,700
And this one, Chris, oh, it's interesting to you and I because it's an editor for spoken

918
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:09,520
word audio with automatic transcription, something to maybe make editing those podcasts just

919
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,360
a little bit easier.

920
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,360
It's called Adopolis.

921
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,000
Okay, I'm glad you said that.

922
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,160
That's not how I would have said it.

923
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,640
I'm not sure why I would have said it.

924
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,640
I would have said Adopolis.

925
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,640
And that's stupid.

926
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,440
There's no pfff in there.

927
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:28,180
So yeah, this is neat, and it's competing with a commercial application that has a monthly

928
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,400
subscription to do all of this.

929
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,580
It's early days.

930
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:38,800
It's an electron app where you import a video file, an audio file, and then it downloads

931
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,060
a model, they have different options, and then it transcribes it.

932
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,080
And you can go in there and actually highlight sentences.

933
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,040
Now I'll give you, here's a great example of how this would be useful.

934
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:55,080
Maybe there was a talk on YouTube, maybe an event, and it's like a four-hour YouTube video.

935
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,600
You know how they sometimes just kind of like, they just sometimes kind of slot them all

936
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,600
together?

937
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,480
Publish the rooms video for the whole darn day.

938
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,340
Yeah, and it's like a six-hour video.

939
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,960
You could download something like that, run it through this thing, and then you could

940
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,760
search for the actual words that you're looking for, and then cut it to that.

941
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,040
Because when you make cuts and changes in here, it can make cuts and changes to the

942
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,200
video file, or you can export just that section.

943
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:24,180
So this is an incredible way to take something that is a visual medium and convert it to

944
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,180
a written medium.

945
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:31,200
And it gives you a word processor-like experience for media editing, which is just so cool.

946
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,480
And no cloud required.

947
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,680
I never thought I'd see this in a non-commercial capacity.

948
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,480
I mean, this thing's AGPL.

949
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,200
Yes, you can get it on those commercial platforms like Windows and Mac OS, but there's also

950
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,800
an app image available if you just want to play with it on good old GNU slash Linux.

951
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,800
That's just, wow.

952
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,680
I mean, okay, it's definitely really early days.

953
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,920
They stressed that in the readme, and from my quick playing with it, that should be stressed.

954
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,160
But it's pretty slick so far, and it seems like it has a lot of promise.

955
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,160
We all three tried it.

956
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,520
I think, Brent, you probably had the roughest go at it.

957
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,800
I did have an issue running the app image.

958
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,880
It may not be associated with the program, but I got it working via the command line,

959
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,120
which was fine.

960
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,840
And then I got really excited.

961
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,520
It was very, very neat what it was doing.

962
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,440
And like you mentioned, it's early days, so it wasn't quite perfect, but just perfect

963
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:21,400
enough that it got me all tingly, and it was really, really great, actually, to see when

964
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,000
you hit the play button after it transcribes everything, you can just kind of watch it

965
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,440
read the words with the audio as it follows, which is really cool.

966
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:35,200
I just used like an Alan Watts speech that I found online, and it even had a little music

967
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,000
symbol for when the piano came in between his words, because you know how he speaks

968
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,740
with gaps in his tone and stuff.

969
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,920
So that was great.

970
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:49,720
But I did then, just as I was writing my excitement to you guys, it sort of crashed my entire

971
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,720
system.

972
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,720
At least your display server, right?

973
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah, you had a sense of what was going on, so it kind of kicked me out into the terminal,

974
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,960
and I tried my very best to get back and never could without a reboot.

975
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,840
So that felt a little disappointing, but hopefully we can help them with that, or they're working

976
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,120
on it, something like that.

977
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,700
So good and bad.

978
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,360
So we're saying it's early days with this piece of software.

979
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,120
It's early days still.

980
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:19,520
They are funded, it seems, until February 2022, so hopefully they'll get funding again,

981
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,840
because there's still a lot of work to do here.

982
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,980
But this is one of those pieces of software that's truly a game changer, and if it hasn't

983
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,000
clicked for you why this is so incredible, you probably should go try it.

984
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,040
It's revolutionary.

985
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,800
To be able to edit audio and video as if it was a written text document, that's next level.

986
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:42,120
And to have it be free software, this is something that's worth, I think, more attention.

987
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,120
And so even though it's very early days, we wanted to give it that attention on the show

988
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,920
in hopes that maybe it encourages funding past February 2022.

989
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,920
Yeah, go try it out.

990
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,120
We'll have a link in the show notes button.

991
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,800
If you want it spelled, it's A-U-D-A-P-O-L-I-S.

992
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,600
I could see that being a tool we use a lot, you know, for getting clips.

993
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,560
And we were just talking about, oh, it would have been great if we would have got a clip

994
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,160
of some of our original Seuss criticism.

995
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,880
Well, imagine a process like that.

996
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,960
You got to sit there and listen through it.

997
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,980
You got to find all of that, and which is fine, and we do it.

998
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:18,000
But if we could load it up into a document and just search for the words, open Seuss

999
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,840
a tumbleweed, and then go right to that and make a cut out of that, that's pretty great.

1000
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,960
Yeah, seems really nice for finding things.

1001
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,320
And also, I could see it maybe using it for content cleanup before you do a final pass

1002
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,720
to really dial it in, but just to remove all the extra fluff that you're going to have

1003
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,720
to cut anyway.

1004
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,440
I wonder how good it would be at transcribing all of our Linux-specific program names and

1005
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,440
such.

1006
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,440
I mean, Chris can't even do it most days.

1007
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,680
Well, there's only one way to find out.

1008
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,920
Who would fare better, Chris or the AI?

1009
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,080
We should try to find out.

1010
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,000
Yes, it is hammer time.

1011
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,200
We should get out of here.

1012
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,120
I do want to say thank you to those of you who support the show directly.

1013
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,080
I mean, you've been here since the beginning.

1014
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,240
And if this is the show that you're here for, this membership, it's not going anywhere.

1015
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,240
In fact, it's just going to get better.

1016
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,360
We'll have two options for you.

1017
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,760
You'll still have the ad-free version, which has all of the Joe production on it, or you

1018
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,480
still have the complete live version.

1019
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,440
That's available to you as well with all of our screw-ups, what we cut, and more.

1020
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,780
And thank you to the unplugged core.com members who have been there and validated this membership

1021
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:26,040
approach and have literally kept the show on the air for the last, I don't know, I mean,

1022
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,760
how long has it been now since we've only had just Linode?

1023
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,200
It's been a while, months.

1024
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,200
It's huge.

1025
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,480
I mean, that membership made the difference.

1026
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,680
So thank you.

1027
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,140
And it's still available at unpluggedcore.com.

1028
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,920
If you have any feedback or ideas or thoughts maybe that the show provoked within you, some

1029
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,680
feels Linuxunplugged.com slash contact, we'd love to hear that.

1030
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,040
Don't forget, we are cooking up that meetup at the beginning of the year on January 2nd.

1031
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,040
That's a Sunday.

1032
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,240
So if you're in our area or you can get out to the Pacific Northwest, we'd love to have

1033
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
you there.

1034
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,900
And we do have that new crypto enthusiast room as well as lots of other conversations

1035
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,760
going on in our matrix community at Linuxunplugged.com slash matrix.

1036
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,800
Man, that's a lot of stuff.

1037
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,280
I'm trying to come up with a new outro here.

1038
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:12,840
I admit this is a new, this is me attempting a new outro because I'm done with the Twitter

1039
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
plugs.

1040
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,260
I just feel done with it.

1041
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,200
I've been debating it for weeks and I'm done.

1042
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,200
So I'm trying it out.

1043
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,660
I'm trying out something different.

1044
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,400
And the problem is there's like a hundred things I would like you guys to know about

1045
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,480
because there's so much you can do and there's so many ways to interact.

1046
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,720
And if it just wasn't such a great experience, I wouldn't be mentioning all of these things.

1047
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,240
And so what ends up happening, there's like a dozen things I gotta mention and I'm still

1048
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,240
sorting it out.

1049
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,500
I tried not doing housekeeping this week.

1050
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,080
So this is what we're getting, so I apologize.

1051
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,160
I should have like some long outro that's just playing us out, I suppose.

1052
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,020
And these could just be credits at the end of the show.

1053
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,980
Consider these the show credits, I suppose.

1054
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,760
For God's sakes.

1055
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,080
Also we got a lug that happens on Sundays.

1056
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,080
I think it's good.

1057
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,620
I think it's another thing you should try.

1058
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,620
You should go.

1059
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,620
Noon Pacific.

1060
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:01,080
Get it in your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1061
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,720
We have details on our website.

1062
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,800
And last but not least, we'd love to have you join us live.

1063
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,800
See you next week.

1064
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,400
Same bad time, same bad station.

1065
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,400
I'm exhausted.

1066
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,400
This is too much.

1067
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,880
We gotta have less stuff at the end of the show.

1068
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,360
Some of these weeks I just want to end the show.

1069
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,360
Boom.

1070
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,360
It's done.

1071
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,360
The no outro show.

1072
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,360
Whoa.

1073
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,360
No more Tuesday.

1074
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,120
No more links.

1075
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,920
But we do have links at linuxunplug.com slash 435 for everything we talked about today

1076
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,560
if you'd like to get those.

1077
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,440
And of course we'd love to have you join us on a Tuesday.

1078
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,120
We only have a few more Live Tuesdays at Noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern at jblive.tv.

1079
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,080
All right, I can't help but tell you about these things.

1080
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,080
I love you.

1081
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,600
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1082
00:56:44,600 --> 00:57:11,800
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1083
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:27,800
It's for people who like to mess with computers, and you know who you are, if you're somebody

1084
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,800
who doesn't want to mess with computers.

1085
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,800
I just want to surf the...

1086
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:34,560
I just want to buy something on Amazon, send an email to my kids, look at some websites.

1087
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,520
If that's you, you don't want to mess with it, probably not a good choice.

1088
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:43,880
All right, jbtitles.com, everybody go boat.

1089
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,200
I am legit a little wiped out from that.

1090
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:50,160
I just, you know, I made a few tweaks to the show with the housekeeping and the links.

1091
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,400
I make a few small tweaks, and now I feel like I need a nap.

1092
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,720
The whole thing went off the rails.

1093
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,200
Yeah, you don't appreciate how much of that you've just internalized over the years.

1094
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:05,640
Oh, I just felt like, I'm not kidding, I've been on the fence about not plugging the Twitter

1095
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:11,240
because I think the reality is the majority of our audience, the vast majority of our

1096
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:16,800
audience is not on Twitter, but there is some of them, but they're out there now.

1097
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,120
Like if they're going to get on Twitter, they've done it.

1098
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,400
And me mentioning the Twitter handle, it's pointless at this point.

1099
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,840
If people aren't following, they're not going to follow anymore.

1100
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,840
It's good.

1101
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,840
But then, you know, Jack Dorsey left Twitter and I'm like, well, why the hell am I promoting

1102
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,840
it?

1103
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,840
The damn CEO's out, right?

1104
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,840
They're like, I'm out.

1105
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,840
I'm out.

1106
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,840
I'm done.

1107
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,840
I'm done with it.

1108
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,840
I'm still on there, but I'm done promoting it.

1109
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,200
I guess if we get a, see a feedback saying, is the network on Twitter, are you guys on

1110
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,200
Twitter?

1111
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,200
We can address it then.

1112
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,200
There you go.

1113
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,080
That'll be our, that'll be our data point in the meantime, I'm just going to work it

1114
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,080
out.

1115
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,080
I'll streamline it.

1116
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,080
I'll get there.

1117
00:58:48,080 --> 00:59:15,000
That was my first attempt and it was real bad.
