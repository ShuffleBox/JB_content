1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hey, welcome. I'm Linus Torvalds, and I started Linux in 1991.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,640
One of the more interesting parts about Linux is how it turns out in the most unexpected places.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,840
Wait a minute. Is he doing our bit? Is he doing our run's Linux bit? Is Linus still in our bit?

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,160
So when I started Linux, I needed an operating system for my own use.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,440
And today you find Linux everywhere in small embedded devices, supercomputers.

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,520
This technology allows you to expand into many different niches.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,480
This is Linux Unplugged episode 144 for May 10th, 2016.

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,280
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's stealing the Unix mindshare.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
Every single week. My name is Chris.

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,320
My name is Wes.

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,360
Right, Wes? That feels about right.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,120
I think so. That's our mission.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
Now this week on the Unplugged program, we have a heck of a show for you.

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,520
We're doing a heck of a job for you this week, guys, because guess what?

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,240
We have big updates from some of our favorite open source projects.

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,240
I might be a little cranky. I don't know. So we'll see how that turns out on this week's episode.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,040
Always an adventure.

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,400
There's some of these updates, Wes, that I just have a strong opinion about.

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,480
Some good, some bad.

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,280
Later on in the show, we're going to talk a little more about Linux Mint.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,760
Also, an early look at Fedora 24, a few things you might be interested in.

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,680
And one of our favorite open source projects has launched at Kickstarter.

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,760
We'll talk about that as well, Wes, as a few other surprises mixed in there.

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,160
Yeah.

25
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Mixed in there. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,240
Episode 144, for those of you who don't know, is a lucky podcast number.

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,720
And so Wes was feeling fired up and brought us something from Caldera.

28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
No, not Linux. It's beer.

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,960
Opportunity Knox, IPA.

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,320
Brewed in Ashland, Oregon.

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,040
Yeah. From Oregon. An India Pale Ale.

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,680
An Indian Pale...

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,160
Okay, here we go.

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,160
Now this bad boy is rocking in at 6.8% APV.

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,560
You know, and then first on the ingredient list, Mountain Water.

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
Not regular water. This is Mountain Beer, folks.

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,840
All right. So I also... I don't want to bury the lead this week.

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
We're doing something really important.

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
This is important work.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,520
We're bringing in one of my favorite all-time computers into the sick bay.

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,040
Bring it over here.

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,680
We got the Apollo here.

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,760
Now over the weekend, PCI SSD in this thing gave up the ghost.

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't know if it's even more useful to you now.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,040
I don't know if it's the port.

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know if it is the card itself or the what.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
So I thought, Wes, as the show goes on, we take the pants off the Apollo.

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,440
Yeah.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
Try a little troubleshooting.

50
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,680
Maybe the card's just loose.

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,200
And maybe we can stick it in.

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,840
Jam it right in there.

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
Right. So we've brought... Hold on. Where's our sick bay noise?

54
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,160
Wait. So we've brought it... I say we've brought it... There we go.

55
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,280
We've brought it into the sick bay.

56
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,240
We also have a backup, like one of these PCI SSDs that came with it.

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,320
So this is the one that came with the Apollo that has Ubuntu 4.04.

58
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,240
Or I'm sorry, 16.04.

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:21,920
But the one in here, Aftermarket, has Antargos installed, which would be my preferred OS.

60
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,800
So also, Wes, as we get along here, I brought... Hold on, Wes.

61
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,040
There we go.

62
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,640
Thank you. I need that.

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah, you do. You do.

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:33,920
I just do.

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,760
Because we're in the PC sick bay.

66
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,680
Hey, I spent a long time finding this loop.

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,160
I've got to use it.

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,880
Yes.

69
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,480
I have your weapon, sir.

70
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
Your repair kit, as it were.

71
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,800
So we'll just... Maybe we'll just check in throughout the show.

72
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,960
Bump your microphone a few times as you're going, so that way we know you're working.

73
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,440
Absolutely.

74
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,920
And then we can swap back and forth if we need to, too.

75
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,480
It's not all on you, but I'll just let you start as I get us rolling here.

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,040
That sounds good.

77
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,840
Because before we go too much further, and now that our loop has ran out one more time,

78
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,880
it's absolutely time to bring in our mumble room, our virtual lug.

79
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

80
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,080
Hello.

81
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,480
Hello.

82
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,040
Hello.

83
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,440
Hello.

84
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:09,760
Hello.

85
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,240
Hello.

86
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,640
Hello.

87
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,840
Hello here.

88
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,480
Whoa.

89
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
Look at that, dear Wes.

90
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,120
We got ourselves a nice turnout.

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,160
Hello, everybody.

92
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,520
It is good to see you.

93
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,440
It's good to see you, our dear friends on the Unplugged program joining us.

94
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,880
Now, I don't know how many of you out there have a PlayStation 4.

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,080
I don't.

96
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,560
I've never been particularly interested, but that might just be changing.

97
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,680
And maybe booting up a PlayStation 4 in the not too distant future,

98
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,560
because it looks like it may be possible to run Linux on one of these bad mama jamas.

99
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,280
Now, this is sort of like a layered hack.

100
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,960
It starts with a jailbreak that happened back in December.

101
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,800
Now, for those of you who are not familiar, the PlayStation 4 runs like Orbis OS.

102
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,160
Did you know about this, Orbis OS?

103
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,960
Only a little.

104
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,560
Yeah, it's based on FreeBSD.

105
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,600
The BSD Now guys will make sure you know that if you watch that show.

106
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,320
And Gadget reports that there's a bug in WebKit.

107
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,640
Now, you're able to gain access to the kernel via this bug.

108
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,280
Oh, now here's the catch, though, as like all of these things.

109
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:17,840
It only works on Orbis 1.74, which is a much older version than the 3.11 that is out right now.

110
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,320
The hardest part about getting Linux on a PlayStation 4 is finding one that...

111
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,240
Hello, hi there, hi, hello, hi, hi, the hardest thing about finding or getting Linux on this,

112
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,040
the hardest thing about this hack is getting an older version of PlayStation.

113
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,560
So it uses this jailbreak.

114
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,240
And now the Cobra team is working on another thing, too, that's going to make it even easier.

115
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,840
It's like a full Linux distro ready to go.

116
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,920
So you've got a jailbreak, then you've got another team that's working on the Linux thing specifically.

117
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,520
And they've been demoing like software running on the PS4 using hardware.

118
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,880
And then on top of that, you got another team that's working on packaging it all up and making it super easy to use.

119
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,840
Oh, that's cool.

120
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,600
Yeah, so there is a lot coming down the pipe for the PlayStation 4,

121
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:05,200
making it possibly a really cool little powerful Linux compute machine, all thanks to a jailbreak found back in December.

122
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,400
Just one more computer you can run Linux on and not play games.

123
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
No, that's mean.

124
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
No, it's about dead on here, right?

125
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
About that.

126
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Damn it, Wes, damn it.

127
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Is Josh in the virtual log this week?

128
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
I don't see him in there, you son of a gun.

129
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,600
I was going to ask him just how much he, how does he get so much damn attention for Solace?

130
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
You know, I've been thinking about this.

131
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
We go through the headlines every single week.

132
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
In fact, I said 30 on the pre-show.

133
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:43,200
I bet you it was damn near 50 links that between you, myself, and the beard, we went through damn near 50 links, different stories.

134
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:50,160
And we do like four project updates at the top of Linux Unplugged and we go through like 50 stories to figure out which of the four we're going to put in the show.

135
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,800
And we're just like, you know, which ones do we even feel like talking about?

136
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,800
That's really what's good for us to talk about, what's going to make a good discussion, what's good for the audience to know about.

137
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,800
And one that's always in the news feeds, like almost on a damn weekly basis, you would think, right?

138
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Like out of all the distributions out there, Ubuntu and Linux Mint and OpenSUSE and Arch and Fedora,

139
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
if I'm going to tell you one of these distributions in the news every week, you're going to say, oh, well, it's Ubuntu.

140
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,600
Well, maybe.

141
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,600
But one that is surprisingly in the news every single damn week practically is Solace.

142
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,400
And Josh was doing a post over at Solace, they have This Week in Solace, the 28th edition actually,

143
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,400
where he talks about the entire project getting a rebrand in a sense.

144
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,600
A rebrand of a consistent brand, I guess I should say.

145
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,600
And something else, they talk about a brand new software center.

146
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,600
There's no getting around the fact that the software center in Solace 1.1 sucks, Josh writes.

147
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,400
Software discoverability and ease of use for installation of software is incredibly important to us and we want to tackle it with urgency.

148
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
So we're doing something about it now.

149
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,400
This cycle. And it's going to be amazing.

150
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Now, is it the way they talk? Is that why we cover, well, not necessarily we, we cover only some of what gets reported on.

151
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Yeah, I mean, it's that combination, like, they have opinions and they're moving fast.

152
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Our current thing sucks and we acknowledge it.

153
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Instead of being all hoity-toity about it and being like, well, there's a lot of priorities.

154
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,400
They're so new. They don't have a lot of image and ego yet.

155
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,400
But their image almost is like, yeah, we'll just tell it like it is.

156
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Yeah, straightforward. I mean, we've talked to them and they are straightforward.

157
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Yeah, we have.

158
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Josh is great.

159
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
And so is Ike.

160
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
I don't know.

161
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm trying to wrap my head around this project though.

162
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Because for an upstart distro built from scratch that's building its own software center from scratch,

163
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,400
we don't talk about it like it's this crazy project that has no chance of succeeding,

164
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
that eventually the developers will just burn out and will go away.

165
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,400
We talk about it like it's like in the top ten of distro watch or something.

166
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
I don't know. I find it to be fascinating.

167
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
What do you think, Rod and Corpse?

168
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
We were kind of chatting about an offline a little bit.

169
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
I'm curious your thoughts about it.

170
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Yeah, I think it's because they do something that a lot of distros don't do, which is talk about it.

171
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,400
We talk about Solus because Solus talks about Solus.

172
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Like how often do people talk about OpenSUSE?

173
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
I don't know.

174
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I mean, OpenSUSE has paid PR people.

175
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,400
OpenSUSE pays to be part of opensource.com.

176
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,400
They have Richard who's on here often and Richard who's all over Reddit during comments.

177
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
I mean, they have people out there talking.

178
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,400
In fact, I'd say OpenSUSE has people talking a lot about OpenSUSE.

179
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Yeah, starting last six months ago, probably.

180
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Actually, not even that much, really.

181
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Like when they started talking about the new Leap and the new Tumbleweed stuff,

182
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
then it started picking up and people talked about it.

183
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Before that, no one talked about OpenSUSE because they didn't.

184
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Now they're talking about it.

185
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Now Richard is more active in Reddit and here and a lot of places.

186
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,400
But if you look at other distros, how often do they talk about anything?

187
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Like for example, Clem has never done an interview ever.

188
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Right.

189
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
No, I guess I see your point to an extent.

190
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
They only talk about it when they make a release and that's it.

191
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,400
And so you think it's really just a matter of frequent, hyper-frequent updates?

192
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Well, just the fact that they're open about it and they're – like Wimpy is for Ubuntu Monte.

193
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
He's constantly talking about it.

194
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,400
He's available to talk to if you want to in like forums and stuff.

195
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,400
And with Solus, you can go to the Google Plus group or community

196
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
and you can talk to them anytime you want to.

197
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,400
And they're more accessible and they're more active in the discussion.

198
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
You don't think that delivering, too, also has something to do with it?

199
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Like actually delivering on?

200
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Well, yeah, it's definitely – the way they talk is also interesting

201
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,400
and the way that they're consistently releasing new things

202
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
and they're showing you that they are being consistent about it.

203
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,400
But I think it's because that they're more open and transparent about all of the stuff they're doing

204
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:09,400
gets you more interested in talking to them about it and using it and stuff like that.

205
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,400
So, all right, here we are and we're taking the bottom off the Apollo right now.

206
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Here's what I'm thinking.

207
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,400
I don't think it's loose because the drive is screwed down.

208
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,400
I mean, the little PCI SSD is screwed down with a screw right there.

209
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,400
So it's not a matter of being loose. It's possible it died.

210
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Well, I was hoping it was just not in the slot.

211
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Right, that would be the ideal case.

212
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
I mean, maybe it's a little cattywampus.

213
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,400
What do you think, Wes? Is it a little cattywampus in the slot?

214
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Maybe just a little bit?

215
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
It could be.

216
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Oh, man, it would save me so much time if I didn't have to reload that machine.

217
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:54,400
I just reloaded that machine to Arch about a week or two ago.

218
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Well, good point, Rotten, and I say good on them,

219
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,400
and I say good on Josh and all of them for doing a good job with it

220
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
because it's still fascinating to follow.

221
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I wasn't trying to make it seem like they weren't doing something good.

222
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,400
It's fantastic. I just want more distros to do it.

223
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Speaking of things that distros should do,

224
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,400
there's not a nice way to talk about this next story.

225
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Manjaro, their SSL certificate expired again.

226
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Can we just set a date to remind ourselves?

227
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Didn't it just happen a year ago?

228
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Just use calendar.

229
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Yeah, I know, right?

230
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Nagios is also very good at this.

231
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Ten days before, just set a reminder.

232
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Yeah, I agree, NorthRanger.

233
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,400
I likely did not dislodge the m.drive, but you never know.

234
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Or maybe they can switch to Let's Encrypt going forward.

235
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Yeah, they say they might switch to Let's Encrypt.

236
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
They apologize for the outage.

237
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
There's actually a free service you can sign up for

238
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,400
that will notify you just for this particular situation for certificates.

239
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,400
You know what? It's funny.

240
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
The Manjaro guy is good on them.

241
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
They've built something that people like.

242
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
But I got an email or a tweet.

243
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
I can't remember what it was now because it all runs together.

244
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
But I just got a note just before the show started saying,

246
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:18,400
hey, I love Linux Unplugged, and I switched over to Manjaro because of you guys.

247
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
And I thought, oh, close.

248
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Close.

249
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Yeah.

250
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
No cigar.

251
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Yeah, I thought, okay.

252
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
All right.

253
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Well, that's fine.

254
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
You know what? It's great.

255
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
And I hope you have fun playing with Arch.

256
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
And Manjaro can be whatever you want it.

257
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
I think, Ham, aren't you a Manjaro user?

258
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Are you still in the Mumble Room there, Ham?

259
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
I can't remember if he – I think he left.

260
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,400
But I know when he was up here for editing, he was a pretty big fan of Manjaro.

261
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
He actually likes the slightly delayed updates.

262
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
That's one of the things he actually prefers about it.

263
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Okay. Interesting.

264
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
I hadn't heard that before.

265
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Yeah.

266
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Yeah, North Ranger.

267
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
I don't know what show they listen to.

268
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
I thought that was kind of funny, though.

269
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
I did like that.

270
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Hey, while we're at it, while we're talking about things that are funny,

271
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
you know what's funny?

272
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
How much I freaking love DigitalOcean.

273
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Oh, my gosh.

274
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
I'm starting to wonder if it's some sort of disorder, Wes.

275
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
It's getting embarrassing up in here.

276
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
We have been building systems like nuts over DigitalOcean.

277
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Hey, are you still experimenting with the 16.04 over there on the DO?

278
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Oh, yeah, with LexD.

279
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Heck, yeah.

280
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
It's great.

281
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Are you using LexD on DigitalOcean?

282
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Yeah.

283
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Oh, that's pretty nice.

284
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
It's very convenient.

285
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
You can spin up maybe like a $10 rig and just put a bunch of containers on it.

286
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
No kidding.

287
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Yeah, it's funny.

288
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
When we talk about containers these days, we mostly talk about Docker,

289
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
but that's out there and it's ready to go.

290
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,400
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider that is dedicated to offering

291
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,400
the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up your rig up on their great systems.

292
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,400
They're all SSDs, tier one bandwidth, data centers all over the world,

293
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,400
and if you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, all one word lowercase,

294
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
you get a $10 credit.

295
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,400
That $10 credit will let you try out that $5 rig, two months, absolutely for free.

296
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
They have hourly pricing if you just want to try something out for a bit.

297
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,400
If you're watching this live right now, you're watching it through a DigitalOcean droplet.

298
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,400
If you're in our Mumble Room right now, you're on a DigitalOcean droplet.

299
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,400
If you reply to me in the chat, you're replying to me from a DigitalOcean droplet.

300
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,400
And it's just so convenient, you can get them near you in a minute or less.

301
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Yep, yep. And whatever size you need, and if you need to upgrade later,

302
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
it's a straightforward process.

303
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Backups and snapshots couldn't be easier because their interface is cray-cray easy.

304
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
It's like seriously slick.

305
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
They have an API to match it.

306
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,400
And then on top of all of that, redonkly good documentation.

307
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
They have senior editors that they have on staff.

308
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Their job is to vet this stuff.

309
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,400
And when community members who are often going to be brilliant,

310
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,400
which probably because a lot of them are you guys, they edit it.

311
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
They check it. They vet it.

312
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,400
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

313
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Go spin up your next machine on DigitalOcean.

314
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
It is fantastic.

315
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
One of the things I love too about it now is I have multiple droplets,

316
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,400
many droplets over there, and just managing all of it is so straightforward.

317
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,400
It's nice having it all under one house. Love it.

318
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Clean UI.

319
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Even though I have them in different parts of the world.

320
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
This is really cool.

321
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,400
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

322
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

323
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Okay, Wes, did it boot Ubuntu?

324
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
No, it did not.

325
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Oh, no. Really?

326
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
So it might be the slot in the motherboard.

327
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Oh, no.

328
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
That is a bummer.

329
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,400
I mean, I'm sure Entroware would be up for fixing it,

330
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,400
but the idea of being out without a computer for a couple of weeks is a major bummer,

331
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
especially because I just got all those cool stickers on it.

332
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Wait, wait. Let me try.

333
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Are you going into the boot menu right now?

334
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Oh, Wes, this is tight. I don't know what to do.

335
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Mumble room, can someone in there console me?

336
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Come on, tell me it's going to be all right because I'm starting to worry.

337
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Oh, we have Ubuntu.

338
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Oh, okay. So the slot works. Okay. All right.

339
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
I haven't screwed on the bottom.

340
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Yeah, that's it. Okay, good.

341
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
So should I try the other one again?

342
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I would try shutting it down and putting the other one back in there.

343
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Maybe it just got dislodged.

344
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Right.

345
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,400
What I was talking to Wes about before the show is how great it would be to go out

346
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,400
and do unplugged on location and do OBS from the Apollo.

347
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Have some beers.

348
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Yeah.

349
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Oh, man.

350
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I think that Skylake CPU in there could handle it, but we will find out.

351
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Now, let's shift gears completely and talk about Unity 8.

352
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
There's been –

353
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
We have to, Chris.

354
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Just a real quick one.

355
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
An interesting development, just we'll move on from this,

356
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
but Michael Hall, a canonical employee, as most of you know,

357
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,400
has been dogfooding Unity 8, actually trying it out on his own computer,

358
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,400
and he has been blogging his journey.

359
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
And it sounds mostly positive.

360
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
He talks about the pros and cons, and I'll leave it to you to read it,

361
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
including how to get it all installed if you want to try it

362
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,400
and all of that good stuff and using traditional apps.

363
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
But here's what he wrote.

364
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Whenever you have a new desktop environment, which, of course,

365
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Unity 8 effectively is, and the latest UI toolkit, Qt5,

366
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
you have to be concerned about performance and resource use.

367
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,400
And given the bleeding nature of Unity 8 on the desktop,

368
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,400
I was expecting to sacrifice some CPU cycles, battery life, and RAM.

369
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
The opposite was the case.

370
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,400
I get at least as many hours on my battery as I do with Unity 7,

371
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
and I was using less than half the RAM I typically do.

372
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
That sounds nice.

373
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
It does, doesn't it?

374
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Moreover, things I was expecting to cause me problems surprisingly didn't.

375
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
I was able to use Google Hangouts for my video conferences,

376
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
which I knew had to be enabled in the browser,

377
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,400
and I fully expected Suspend and Resume to have trouble with Mir,

378
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
given the years I spent with X11 in the past,

379
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
but it worked nearly flawlessly.

380
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
He has some details below.

381
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Here's a couple things that didn't work.

382
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Unity 8 is still very bleeding edge as a desktop shell,

383
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
and if you want to use it, you need to be prepared for some pain.

384
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
It hasn't been bad enough to stop him yet,

385
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
but he has issues like middle click pace doesn't work

386
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
when you have highlighted text,

387
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
which you kind of realize how much you become dependent on that

388
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
once you don't have it.

389
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Yes, you do. Oh, man.

390
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Yeah, you can't copy between Mir and XMir windows yet,

391
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
which makes it super not easy.

392
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,400
And Unity 8 itself doesn't super support multiple windows per application,

393
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
one app per app, one window per app.

394
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Okay.

395
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,400
But, yeah, otherwise, he's using it.

396
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Unity 8 is being used right now.

397
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Anybody in the Mamba Room trying it?

398
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Come on, somebody.

399
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Nobody?

400
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Oh, come on.

401
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Well, Wes, you know what that means.

402
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
You should try it.

403
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
I have to try it.

404
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Oh, man. All right.

405
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
I'm just kidding.

406
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
If there's some good instructions for it, I mean, I'll do it.

407
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
All right.

408
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
So, here, I'll take over.

409
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Here, let me take over because I want to hear your thoughts

410
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
about Fedora 24 here in a moment.

411
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,400
I'll batten down the hatches.

412
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Here, hand me the screwdriver.

413
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,400
And you, sir, pretty much damn near every week,

414
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
although this week is an exception,

415
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,400
have been formatting your rig and trying out distros

416
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
so you can give us impressions here on this show,

417
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,400
stuff that we might not normally dedicate an entire review segment to,

418
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
but ones that we thought, hey, let's just check in on

419
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,400
and see what Wes thinks.

420
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,400
So, Wes, you've been trying out Fedora 24 Beta

421
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
or attempting to try out Fedora 24.

422
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Tell me how it's been going.

423
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Well, okay, to be fair, I do format or partition this hard drive a lot.

424
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,400
So, at this point, there's probably, like, three or four operating systems on there,

425
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
and it kind of changes all the time.

426
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
I don't always have a good index of, like, what's on here or not,

427
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
but it's kind of a good test, too, because I'm never, like,

428
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I almost never wipe the entire drive.

429
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,400
I have some kind of document on here I want or a system I was playing with.

430
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
So, Fedora did have that stacked against them.

431
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,400
So, they get their own flash drive, boot it into it,

432
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
and, you know, go to set it up like normal, click through it at first,

433
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
and it looks very nice, and I always appreciate, like, Fedora's boot up.

434
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
They have a very nice, usually it's pretty polished.

435
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Consistent.

436
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Gnome is good. They know what they're doing.

437
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Yeah, exactly, and they usually have, like, Plymouth enabled,

438
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,400
and, you know, the entire boot up experience is pleasant.

439
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,400
But once I got into the installer, I just,

440
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,400
the Anaconda, like, partitioning and, you know, file system selection screen,

441
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
I just can't.

442
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Laravel says that they've mucked up Anaconda again over on Ferronix.

443
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Yeah, I mean, I don't know what the state it was in before.

444
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
It's always changing.

445
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,400
It's never been my favorite installer, but it's just, as Chris saw,

446
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,400
I was trying to just install it, root, you know, everything into one partition,

447
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,400
ext4, simple, install grub on the main drive.

448
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
There's only one drive in the machine,

449
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,400
and it's telling me I need to make a boot slash EFI partition,

450
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,400
but it's not EFI. It's not GPT.

451
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,400
It's just MBR BIOS. It's very strange.

452
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,400
So I would really like to play with it more.

453
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Here's a pretty vanilla setup.

454
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
The hard drive just fell out of the bottom of it.

455
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Oh, boy.

456
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Well, let's see.

457
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Watch as Chris breaks the Librem here, folks.

458
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
No, this is the Apollo.

459
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Oh, the Apollo. Excuse me.

460
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,400
All right. So I put the PCI SSD in that has Antergos in there,

461
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,400
and survey says we're not booting.

462
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,400
So that sucker...

463
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
Oh, man.

464
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
And it was selected, that one in the BIOS?

465
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
I mean, it should be.

466
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

467
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,400
I should probably put the hard drive that fell out back in, but...

468
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Ah.

469
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Yeah.

470
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Oh, man, that's rough.

471
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Yeah, dude.

472
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I wonder why that would just drop dead.

473
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
You know, and the thing about Newegg...

474
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
There is no why.

475
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,400
...is I have gotten burned several times now by Newegg on returns,

476
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
and I don't like to do returns because who has the time?

477
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Right.

478
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Ain't nobody got time for that, Wes.

479
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,400
But we had a machine that we got that was no good,

480
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
and it was one of these things where I literally,

481
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
I bought it on Newegg because Newegg takes Bitcoin,

482
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
and that was like the reason I got it.

483
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
I have Bitcoin.

484
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Yes.

485
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
And I needed a machine.

486
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
And so the machine came in, and like the CPU was dead.

487
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Bad CPU.

488
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Or the motherboard or something.

489
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Of course, it's a completely built machine, so we just send it back,

490
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
and they rejected our return for whatever reason.

491
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,400
So I don't know.

492
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
So with this, this was bought on Newegg as well.

493
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Classic Newegg.

494
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Yeah, I don't know.

495
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
I feel super defeated.

496
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,400
I feel like a bit of a fool for getting into buying parts anymore.

497
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
I should just buy computers that have everything soldered on

498
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
because apparently that's the only thing that works.

499
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
No, no, no.

500
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Just buy from Amazon.

501
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
They don't care what you return to them.

502
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Yeah, sure.

503
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
No, that's fine.

504
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Get Amazon to take Bitcoin.

505
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
You know, Mac OS X, that's Unix, Chris.

506
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
That might be a nice MacBook.

507
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
You'll have no complaints.

508
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Got your back shell, whatever.

509
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Oh, geez.

510
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
So you weren't able to get too far in the Fedora 24 process, huh?

511
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
No, not really.

512
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
I'm sorry.

513
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I mean, I'll play with it more, and when Fedora 24 comes out,

514
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
I'll install it.

515
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Yeah, absolutely.

516
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
It's nothing against it.

517
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
It's more just like, I don't like how in the Ubuntu installer,

518
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,400
it's really easy to just pick your partition, tell it to format it,

519
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
make it root, and go.

520
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,400
And this, it's a little unclear because it kind of lists your other

521
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Linux installations, but it doesn't give you...

522
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Maybe it's better for new users.

523
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm not sure, but as someone who understands disk partitioning,

524
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,400
it's frustrating to not have a real representation of what the disk

525
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,400
looks like and be able to understand that or have an accounting of

526
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
how much free space is on the disk or, you know, it's like,

527
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,400
you just want gparted and do it and be done with it.

528
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
That's probably the way to go then.

529
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Yeah, that's what I'll probably do.

530
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
All right, so I'm thinking we should probably swap back to the...

531
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Yeah, pop that back in.

532
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Which is a bummer.

533
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,400
See, this is a 256, and that's a 120.

534
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
And that's why I wanted to go to this.

535
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
And this is a Samsung 850.

536
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
And this is a Kingston.

537
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,400
You'd think this would be the higher quality part, but...

538
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
That's a nice drive.

539
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
But it's...

540
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Geez.

541
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
So anyways, that's just sort of depressing because that means

542
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
I have to reload my machine for like a third time.

543
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Should we just put Fedora 24 beta in here while we're doing this?

544
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Yeah, that should be great.

545
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
See if it can handle the M2.

546
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Now we've got wallpapers available for Fedora 24.

547
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Extra wallpapers in there.

548
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Actually pretty nice.

549
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Yeah, some of these are pretty nice.

550
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
I normally don't mention this kind of stuff because I know you guys are like,

551
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
oh, it doesn't really matter.

552
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
But I actually think they're pretty cool.

553
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
So we'll link to them in the show notes.

554
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
I didn't love the default background of the stars,

555
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
like the starry thing that they have.

556
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
I said it was okay, actually.

557
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I mean, I don't know.

558
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
All right, that's just me.

559
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
Yeah, you're right.

560
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
It's a little underwhelming, I guess,

561
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,400
because that's it right there if you're watching the video version.

562
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
It's okay.

563
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I feel like real stars would have been prettier though.

564
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Ooh.

565
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Yeah, that's true.

566
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
That's true.

567
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
That's true.

568
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
So I guess the lesson learned there is just wait.

569
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Although if you're able to get it and try it out.

570
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Yes, I'll see if I can get a good shot next week.

571
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
There's a bunch of really kind of interesting spins releasing right now too

572
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
on Ubuntu 16.04.

573
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
I've been noticing a lot of distros like Easy Linux

574
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,400
and a couple other ones that have come out recently

575
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
that are all based on Ubuntu 16.04.

576
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
So now is the time when an avalanche of those is landing.

577
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
And there's also been a lot of Linux Mint news,

578
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,400
which we're going to get to more Linux Mint stuff here in a bit.

579
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Yes, there has.

580
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,400
But yeah, I'm looking for the name of the...

581
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Oh, yeah.

582
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Okay, here's the other one.

583
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
This was the other one.

584
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
It's called Urk Linux or something like this.

585
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
It was launched.

586
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
A Rook?

587
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
A Rook, yes.

588
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Did you hear about this?

589
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Yeah, it was based on TriSQL, right?

590
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Yeah, or Trisco.

591
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,400
But now it's based on Ubuntu 16.04.

592
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
Oh.

593
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Yeah.

594
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,400
So, yeah.

595
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
And so, yeah, there you go.

596
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
A real-time follow-up from BC in the chat room

597
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
talking about using Bitcoin with Amazon.

598
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Oh, it's back.

599
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
Oh, look at that.

600
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Gift had actually...

601
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Gift had been disabled to purchase Amazon gift cards with Bitcoin.

602
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
That is a little workaround.

603
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
If you have some Bitcoin and you want to buy on Amazon,

604
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
you can buy gift cards.

605
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
Oh, that's nice.

606
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Yeah, except for at the beginning of May,

607
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
they weren't accepting Bitcoin for Amazon, so I couldn't do that.

608
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
They had shut down for a while.

609
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
It was bad timing.

610
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
It was bad timing.

611
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
That's why I seriously, like, on last one,

612
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
I was pleading with System76 to accept Bitcoin.

613
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
I mean it.

614
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
I really do mean it.

615
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Just please.

616
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Please, I love this Apollo,

617
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,400
and it's not the Apollo's fault that the Samsung drive died.

618
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
No.

619
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
You know, it's not, but...

620
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Oh, it's a bit of a setback.

621
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I still...

622
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
It's my condolences, Chris.

623
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
It's not like I spilled beer all over it or anything.

624
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
At least you have a backup.

625
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Yeah, that's true.

626
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
That's true.

627
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
And it could have been worse.

628
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
It could have gotten beer spilled all over it.

629
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
Speaking of which, how are you enjoying the beer?

630
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
It's good.

631
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Yeah.

632
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
It's quite hoppy.

633
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Yeah, it is.

634
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
It is, really.

635
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
I'm about halfway done with mine.

636
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Not my favorite IPA, but it's enjoyable.

637
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,400
So I guess we're already done with the...

638
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Hold on, let me bring it back.

639
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
We're already done with the Apollo sickbay.

640
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,400
We've figured out that it is indeed the drive,

641
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,400
and that problem solved,

642
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,400
and I can either just use Ubuntu again or reload that with Arch.

643
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
Wipe it and reload.

644
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
I expected that to take us the entire episode.

645
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Good job, Wes.

646
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
We're an efficient pair.

647
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,400
It's because Noah's not here, I think.

648
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Hello, everybody.

649
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
There you go.

650
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
That's a good one.

651
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
I like that.

652
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Okay.

653
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
So we have to talk about Mint.

654
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Everyone else is.

655
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Right.

656
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,400
When I said earlier in the show that I was getting kind of grumpy and cranky,

657
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,400
I actually think it's because of the stuff I was talking about with Mint

658
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
on the Linux action show.

659
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
And I do want to make a correction to my coverage.

660
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
So really briefly, for those of you who didn't see last week's episode,

661
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,400
because I'm sure that's plenty of you,

662
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,400
I sort of took the position and argument that Mint is entering into an era

663
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,400
of unprecedented technical debt for a project their size

664
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,400
with their continuation of MATE based on GTK2,

665
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,400
with their forking of many standard desktop apps to XApps,

666
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:47,400
with their themes with Cinnamon and the MATE project in general,

667
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,400
I kind of was trying to build the case that there's a technical debt

668
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
that they're entering here.

669
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Now, I did make the inaccurate statement that the XApps were based on GTK2.

670
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
That is not true.

671
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
They're based on GTK3.

672
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Right.

673
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
That's kind of part of the point of them.

674
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Right.

675
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Yeah.

676
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,400
And I think that's mostly because I just don't really care about that point

677
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
because that's not really my point.

678
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
That's not your problem with it.

679
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Yeah, exactly.

680
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
These apps are being forged.

681
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
I should be accurate when I'm talking about it.

682
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,400
So I apologize for that mistake.

683
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
So I kind of wanted to get your thoughts on it.

684
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I know you've been a – are you running Mint right there on that laptop now?

685
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
It's one of the partitions.

686
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Yeah.

687
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
And you're running Mint right there on the Bonobo.

688
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Yes.

689
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,400
And I just want to give the virtual log a chance to talk about this issue in general.

690
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,400
And maybe we could talk wider too about the – well,

691
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,400
one of the things that offends me about this entire Mint situation,

692
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
and I think the biggest part is the XApps.

693
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,400
I feel like that was the line that was too far.

694
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
And I don't know why.

695
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,400
I just feel like that was sort of the line that felt like there was a bit of curmudgeon stick in the mud.

696
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
We can do this better than other people.

697
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,400
And then it was all sold to us in a these will be for all distributions rallying cry,

698
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,400
which is so often the rallying cry of the random forker.

699
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Oh, this is for all when in reality it's for your own project.

700
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,400
And so the arrogance of it sort of smacked me in the face.

701
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,400
And so that was sort of a line that they crossed as a project with me that made me sort of reevaluate

702
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,400
sort of the long-term realistic viability I think they have as a project.

703
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,400
And so I tried to sort of talk about that on Sunday's show,

704
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,400
but it was in the context of covering the news, and it just wasn't really the best place to do it.

705
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,400
So I and I and I want to see if maybe you guys think I got something wrong and maybe I should walk it back a bit.

706
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,400
So we're going to talk about that just for a moment in the show.

707
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Because in the in the show notes, I put it as.

708
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Is meant too big to fail.

709
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Sort of, you know, obviously tongue in cheek play on the banks, but like when you have it,

710
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,400
when you have a distribution, I just I just read this the stupid blog post from one of these random text sites

711
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,400
that gets some traffic. Top 10 Linux distributions of 2016.

712
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:07,400
OK. Yep. One of those. Yeah. Number one distro Linux Mint number one distro.

713
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,400
And they're always like this distro watch top of the list Linux Mint.

714
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:21,400
There is a position of public perception that Linux Mint enjoys that only Ubuntu rivals.

715
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:30,400
And likely surpasses. And so the idea that Linux Mint could collapse.

716
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Probably a lot of it seems, oh, that's impossible. That's impossible.

717
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,400
There is a staple in the community. But is it more like because if they did collapse,

718
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,400
we would look like such a such a bunch of clown shoes as a community that we can't even fathom it?

719
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Because it seems like that's where we're headed. So maybe I'm getting worked up here.

720
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,400
But I want to talk about that with you guys and why I think it's a huge deal more

721
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,400
and maybe better state my case. So I'm going to start by mentioning Ting.

722
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Let's start right here by mentioning Ting. Everybody right now. Linux.ting.com.

723
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Let's all go there like a group mind. We don't need the Borg to act as one group mind.

724
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Linux.ting.com. You go there, you get a discount, you support this show.

725
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,400
If you got a phone, Ting is going to give you a credit. If you don't have a phone

726
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,400
and you might have a phone that works, you should check it out because they got CDMA and GSM.

727
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,400
But if you don't have a phone, they give you twenty five dollars to buy something nice.

728
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,400
They got a bunch of great unlocked phones you can get directly or you can go get really.

729
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I mean there's all these great phones at Ting. Everything from the budget like

730
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,400
you can just get the SIM card or like a feature phone for sixty bucks or all the way up to the Cadillacs.

731
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,400
You know the S7s and the internet phone 6s and the 6Ps and whatnot.

732
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:37,400
But I really am a huge fan of the 5x if you can afford it.

733
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,400
I think it's a great budget phone. You can get it from Ting or Google Play

734
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,400
and you can just bring it over right now. It's you know perfect in that sense on Ting

735
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,400
because you have an unlocked device getting Google updates directly on a pay for what you use

736
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:57,400
mobile service provider and the 5x supports GSM or CDMA.

737
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,400
It's the perfect situation. You can pop in the SIM and activate on their website.

738
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Never talk to human being if you want although they have great customer service.

739
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,400
You pay for what you use on all their devices. Unlimited devices just six dollars a month for the line

740
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,400
and then whatever you got to pay Uncle Sam and then you just pay for your usage.

741
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,400
It's brilliant. You want a hotspot or tethering? Turn it on.

742
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Before I had Ting I had to call my mobile service provider and say I would like to get a hotspot.

743
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:28,400
I would like to be able to use the hotspot checkbox that's built into my operating system.

744
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Oh okay well Mr. Fisher you need to sign up for our family share plan or well we can give you an extra two gigs a month.

745
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,400
It was redonkulous. I hated it. Not with Ting.

746
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Plus they have great tools to give you total control over your account on your phone or through any device through the web.

747
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,400
People love Ting and Ting is great. Go check them out.

748
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,400
From SIM cards starting at nine dollars. The Ansotel One Touch Fling sixty three dollars.

749
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Now you can get into a LG Volt 2 for sixty six bucks. What?

750
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Linux.ting.com go there and try them out. The Ansotel One Touch Idol 3 is also a great phone for under two hundred dollars.

751
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:09,400
The original OG Nexus 5. Again a Google experience phone. Unlocked. CDMA or GSM.

752
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Right on the Ting network for under two hundred bucks.

753
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,400
You know what we forgot to mention about this? All these phones? They're running Linux.

754
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,400
That is cool huh? That is really something. Except for that internet phone right there.

755
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Right right.

756
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,400
They're running that thing that Alan likes though so you got to give them something I suppose.

757
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Tomato. Tomato. The Note 5 is. Boy you know if I was in the market right now and I was.

758
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,400
That Note 5 has such a killer camera and they just added the S7.

759
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,400
You can get these phones also on your own and then bring them over to Ting as well.

760
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
That's one of the best parts about Ting.

761
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the show and thanks to you guys who listen and go there.

762
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Because you taking that couple of minutes out of your day keeps the show on the air.

763
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Linux.ting.com go learn more about them.

764
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
So let's start with the positive stuff.

765
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,400
There is I think a pretty nice look coming to Linux Mint 18.

766
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,400
This is their new flatter Mint Y theme.

767
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,400
So Mint X will be the default theme in Sara. That's the next release.

768
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,400
And Mint Y is going to be this new Arc Boca based theme thing.

769
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,400
And I think it looks pretty sharp. I think it looks good. I'll give credit where credit is due.

770
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
I think they're doing a good job. I like the way they're rolling this out.

771
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,400
I like all of it. I do. I like all of it.

772
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,400
I want to read you though a little verbiage in the introduction of the new theme.

773
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,400
And maybe I'm parsing words but you know words matter.

774
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Because I think they reflect quite a bit.

775
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,400
So when Clem was writing about this new theme.

776
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,400
We talked about a new theme and we noticed.

777
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
This is Clem.

778
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Some of you were also scared of the changes this would introduce.

779
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,400
And I think the words using the word scared right there is particularly interesting.

780
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I think it reveals a little bit into how he perceives his user base.

781
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,400
We don't want to change styles just because we think it might look better.

782
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
We'll provide both styles to you which I think that's a great way to go.

783
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Eventually if the day comes where a huge majority prefer the new theme.

784
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Then we'll follow that and start using it as a new default.

785
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Also I really like the way he says that.

786
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,400
So I'm you know I just want to hear scared though.

787
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,400
I don't know if that almost sounds demeaning a little bit.

788
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,400
And so it goes as we continue on.

789
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Linux Mint 18 will also drop multimedia support.

790
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
No more codecs installations.

791
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,400
And it sounds like mostly because OEMs and magazines wanted the no codecs CD.

792
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,400
And because making two sets of CDs.

793
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Which is multiples there's multiple skews of those.

794
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Was a lot of work instead of just not having a no codecs version.

795
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
They're going to have an.

796
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
That's the only version.

797
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
That's the only version.

798
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Yeah.

799
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,400
Which leads me to my next and final question before I toss it to you in the mobile room.

800
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,400
What the hell is the point of Linux Mint now.

801
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
That's a good question.

802
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Because you know when I trolled around on the Internet.

803
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,400
And I found a few people that had answers.

804
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Before before some of these decisions.

805
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
One answer was well I dislike unity.

806
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,400
And I just want something that's not unity by default really quick.

807
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,400
And this is well before a lot of Ubuntu flavors were established.

808
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Another common answer.

809
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Easy ability to play DVDs.

810
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Very relevant.

811
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Yeah not super relevant anymore and not hard to fix under Ubuntu anymore.

812
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
And then this is another common one.

813
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Wanting to give Shuttleworth the middle finger for cramming unity down my throat.

814
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,400
But that middle finger has been extended for long enough.

815
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
And I actually think that last one.

816
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
Is very telling.

817
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
People were pissed about Ubuntu.

818
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
People were pissed about unity.

819
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
They were.

820
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
They were pissed about.

821
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
I was one of the ones that kind of fled from Ubuntu.

822
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
And you know what.

823
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
That rage has started to fade.

824
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,400
And so there and now that is no longer a reason to use Mint.

825
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,400
And now Ubuntu Mate has taken many reasons away from using Mint.

826
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
And now last but not least.

827
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Removing the codex seems like it takes yet another set of reasons.

828
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
So what's left.

829
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Is it an old implementation of Mate.

830
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Is it their one off cinnamon island.

831
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,400
Is it them not installing security updates.

832
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Is it improper web administration.

833
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
What is the big feature left for using Mint.

834
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
And you use Mint so you tell me Wes.

835
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,400
You know I think I do have Mint installed.

836
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,400
But I don't see myself installing any new Mint.

837
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,400
I think that it really was like them removing the codex.

838
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,400
It doesn't like that actual loss of value isn't that much these days.

839
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,400
But I feel like it's very telling and like it reminds me of why I came to Mint.

840
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Or like why when it was first popular.

841
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,400
I was an Ubuntu user I had friends using Mint and that was like a huge reason for them.

842
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,400
It was just it was Ubuntu but you know maybe they like the interface better.

843
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,400
And it looked a little better and it wasn't so you know Ubuntu.

844
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,400
And now you know there's lots of times where it's like oh Gnome was changing.

845
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,400
And Cinnamon or before you know Linux Mint was a very stable place.

846
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
It just worked.

847
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
You had the stuff you need.

848
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
You could install it anywhere you knew you had VLC.

849
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
You could just play whatever you wanted.

850
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
It was really easy.

851
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,400
But these days Ubuntu isn't hard and there's so many options.

852
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,400
There is Ubuntu MATE and Linux Mint kind of lags behind as well.

853
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Like there's all this excitement right now about 16.04.

854
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,400
And like you can get 16.04 MATE right now and have a great experience.

855
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
But where's Linux Mint 18?

856
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
We're waiting for that.

857
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Yeah and why are we waiting?

858
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Why are we waiting for that?

859
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Because it's not like they were pumping out a bunch of intermediary releases.

860
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,400
And I also feel like you're right that they are taking on a lot.

861
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,400
And it's not like clearly they do some things well and I like Cinnamon.

862
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
And there are parts about it that I will always think that's good.

863
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
I would argue that this is why we're waiting.

864
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
But this is why we're waiting.

865
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,400
And it's also I don't know that like some of the things they're doing is not necessarily what they should be doing.

866
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,400
And I worry that one of the things I always liked about Linux Mint and what you liked about when we reviewed 17.3 is like the attention to the detail.

867
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,400
The nice like oh the integration with the music.

868
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Those are things where like they really do I think understand a certain subset of Linux users and what they want.

869
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
I think they know that.

870
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400
Yeah they'll sound like elementary OS users.

871
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Right.

872
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,400
And if they don't focus on that like the other parts like I don't know if like yeah.

873
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:15,400
And at the same time it's like well I don't know if I want them making these universal apps when there are also other people making individual apps that maybe have more design experience or app experience or just more experience in general.

874
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Yeah well put Wes.

875
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Anybody in the Mumble Room want to jump in with their thoughts on the state of Mint?

876
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Anybody have a counter take?

877
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
You're welcome to jump in too.

878
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
I'd love to hear that argument.

879
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Because to me it's seeming like it's becoming case closed and I hate to think that way because you know Clem and team have worked very hard on this for a long time.

880
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,400
I know Ladies Night 62 in there had some similar thoughts.

881
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Did you want to jump in?

882
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Mr. Night?

883
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
No.

884
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Hmm.

885
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
All right.

886
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Well Poppy I noticed you joined in.

887
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I wonder if you wanted to show.

888
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,400
In the past you and I have chatted about sort of Mint as an overall contributor and citizen to the open source community.

889
00:39:51,400 --> 00:40:00,400
Do you feel like their stance there has begun to catch up with them?

890
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Oh sorry.

891
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
There you go.

892
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Sorry Poppy I had you muted like a jerk.

893
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
I'm sorry.

894
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,400
That's fine.

895
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Jerk.

896
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
I don't know.

897
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,400
I kind of think the whole codec thing is overblown.

898
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,400
I think maybe eight years ago that was a thing like you know I need my DivX codecs.

899
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
I need my codec pack.

900
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Like the people who ran Windows whatever back then would go hunting down the best codec pack and oh no you get the green screen on your video playback or you get vertical lines or whatever.

901
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Oh you need the latest codecs.

902
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
This is 2016 people.

903
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,400
You don't need a shonky codec.

904
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
I used to pay for mine from Fluendo.

905
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Remember that?

906
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Oh wow right.

907
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
It's a lunacy.

908
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
It's 2016 right.

909
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:53,400
Codec things are not an issue now unless you get your shonky video from like off the back of a lorry or something but that's not an issue.

910
00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:01,400
So I actually don't think it's a big problem that they're stopping distributing a version of the ISO that has the codecs bundled in.

911
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,400
I think that's the right thing to do because I don't think legally they probably.

912
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
Yeah I agree.

913
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,400
I don't think they had the permission to do that in the first place and I think this makes them a better upstanding citizen for doing that.

914
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
So I think that's actually the right thing to do.

915
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
But I don't see how that's a problem.

916
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,400
I don't think that's a rock that we need to throw at them.

917
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:32,400
I think there are other things that I would worry about with Mint but they have a very wide and diverse user base and they have a lot of people contributing monetarily to the product.

918
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
I know we have a lot of fans in the audience.

919
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:45,400
No I think the reason why the codec things come up is because it's sort of like the temperature in the boiling water just got turned up a lot.

920
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,400
And people are like wait a minute where does Mint fit in now exactly?

921
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,400
For a lot of people it was oh this is how I get my codecs.

922
00:41:51,400 --> 00:42:01,400
And as each one of these different categories gets filled in by either another distro or by their decisions I think more and more people kind of wake up and go well now wait a minute.

923
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,400
And I guess I turn my question back to you.

924
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:20,400
If it's not their security practices and sort of forking their own applications and things like that what is it in your estimation that I guess put very frankly Popey prevents you from installing Mint.

925
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Why don't you run Linux Mint?

926
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Because I'm one of those perverse people who actually like Unity.

927
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,400
All right.

928
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
I don't believe you.

929
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Actually there's a surprising number of us out there you know.

930
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,400
And despite what everyone might say and sticking the finger to Mark well done.

931
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:50,400
But actually there's still a whole load of us who quite like using this thing and it hasn't moved a lot in years and it's you know you could argue it's stale and it needs a refresh here and there and fair enough.

932
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
I accept all those arguments.

933
00:42:52,400 --> 00:43:03,400
But I guess it's not a component of sour grapes is it I mean it's not competitive that he was able to take that product and then branch off a whole bunch of separate users that found it to be a superior product.

934
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:15,400
Personally no I think I think it's fantastic that someone could take the Ubuntu base and create a derivative distribution that has a huge number of users.

935
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:23,400
I'm not happy about certain things like the you know the security model that they have I've never been a big fan of holding back updates from users.

936
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,400
But that's their choice that they've chosen for their user base and their user base seem to be accepting of that.

937
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Many of the users technically inclined users will defend the position that Clem has taken with the way Linux Mint distributes their updates and makes their system defaults and that's fine.

938
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
And they have a wide and diverse user base.

939
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,400
They've got lots of people who give their hard earned cash voluntarily.

940
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:56,400
You know it's not a subscription service they voluntarily give their money to Linux Mint to say thank you to Clem for creating what he's done.

941
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,400
So he must have done something right for all these people to be using it and for people to give him the money.

942
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:14,400
Technically minded folks technically minded folks Popey says so Wimpy as a technically minded folk are you are you looking at the X apps as a possibility.

943
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,400
I don't know people people may not realize Wimpy has a Mate based desktop distribution that he is familiar with.

944
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:28,400
And I'm just curious as somebody who's familiar with the Mate based desktop are the X apps appealing to you in any way.

945
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Most of the X apps are stripped down versions of the Marte desktop application with the desktop integration removed and built against GTK three.

946
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,400
So right. So Puma has been recalled as Zed or X ed.

947
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,400
I have known is now called X viewer X reader is a truly totem is called X player etc etc.

948
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,400
These are the X apps.

949
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,400
Yeah. And yeah and some of those that you've mentioned are the desktop apps.

950
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:13,400
And so Marte has its suite of tools and applications and then we found other utilities to fill the gaps for you know media playback and stuff.

951
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,400
So now I'm not going to be using the X apps.

952
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:25,400
So what what what is the what what what is the niche they're following filling. Can you help just in your opinion give me an understanding of that.

953
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,400
Why do I need X player over totem or VLC.

954
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:35,400
What's the if I'm if I'm if I'm using these if I'm using these X apps I must need this over.

955
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
So what is it that it's doing exactly.

956
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,400
What's it enabling.

957
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:47,400
I think this is more a development focused decision rather than an end user focused decision by forking these applications.

958
00:45:47,400 --> 00:46:03,400
You can choose what toolkit version to target when you build them and then you have a degree of predictability about how they're going to behave against the targeted toolkit over their two year period.

959
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:16,400
So that way that just sounds like you're planning for obsolescence you're planning to use old code you're planning to be stale or planning to be predictable.

960
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:33,400
You know it's Clem's decision and I think it's a development decision to streamline the development process as much as possible so there aren't going to be any unexpected changes throughout the course of that version's lifecycle.

961
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,400
You know people have also said the same thing about the way security updates are handled.

962
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:48,400
Is it it's for the users it's for the end users is it or is it so that way there's not a whole bunch of support issues somewhere in the in between probably.

963
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,400
It's probably not.

964
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:56,400
I've never been a fan of the update model in Linux Mint.

965
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:16,400
So yeah I think I think it's more about not not introducing change that might introduce support issues and if you read back through some of the Mint release notes the words sort of reinforce that mindset that you know if it if it's not broken don't update it.

966
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
Yeah.

967
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,400
I suppose I suppose like Aiki says is Aiki in the is he in the model room?

968
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,400
He should be because like he just said it reminds him of what Cinnamon is in general.

969
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,400
I suppose that's a good point.

970
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,400
So West Jeff too asked in the chat room.

971
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,400
He says are the X apps just applicable to Mint Mate.

972
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Essentially that's the only place they're going to get used.

973
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
That's so functionally.

974
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,400
They're intended to be everywhere.

975
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:53,400
Yeah they're going to the Cinnamon version and the Xubuntu version as well I think maybe not the KDE version.

976
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,400
I mean I don't follow those particularly closely.

977
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,400
But why would why would any other project use these.

978
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,400
I guess that's what I'm not what am I not understanding about this.

979
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,400
It seems like it seems like these would have very very minimal appeal.

980
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
I could see Xubuntu using them for a release cycle.

981
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,400
I guess that makes sense.

982
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,400
Yeah that's true.

983
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:17,400
But I wouldn't want to still using X of C's which is still GTK2 so they might have a benefit.

984
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,400
But in general right.

985
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:31,400
I guess what I what I here's where this this sounds like we are we are introducing in a very minute level of fragmentation everywhere.

986
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:41,400
When we have Puma and we have Zed and we have G edit and we have Kate and we have K right and we have Nano and we have Vim and we have Emacs and we have.

987
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
I mean the list goes on and on.

988
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,400
We have.

989
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,400
You're making me dizzy over here.

990
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,400
So so it's.

991
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,400
You forgot the Electron stuff too.

992
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,400
Which drives me.

993
00:48:48,400 --> 00:49:00,400
What drives me crazy right now is I could install Ubuntu Mate and I could get one text editor and then I install Linux Mint Mate and I get an entirely different text editor even though I'm choosing the Mate desktop.

994
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,400
And as an end user how the hell am I supposed to keep that straight.

995
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,400
Oh sure maybe we can keep it straight.

996
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:13,400
I mean maybe maybe or maybe I will forget it after this episode and I can't I won't be able to remember which distribution has what.

997
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,400
I just find it to be what I find it to be is typical.

998
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,400
I find it to be disappointing and typical of the Linux community.

999
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,400
This is the typical crap that we do that makes it completely confusing to new users to come to Linux.

1000
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,400
And you have to be like Leo Laporte and spend three months and have 22 flash drives to try out different distributions or you have to be like.

1001
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,400
Find the one that works.

1002
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Or you have to be like Chase Nunes and have an entire show built around you deciding which distribution to use because there's so much damn choice.

1003
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,400
And then we say when we pat ourselves on the back and we say good job everybody.

1004
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
Now we've got choice.

1005
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,400
Good job.

1006
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,400
Well good job everybody.

1007
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
This is a good one.

1008
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,400
And it's it's ridiculous that we have our text editors.

1009
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,400
It's our text editors that are this fragmented now.

1010
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,400
It's like all this stuff.

1011
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
How many file managers do we need.

1012
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,400
I know this is an old horse that I don't need to keep kicking so I'll move on.

1013
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,400
But it's just as frustrating sometimes.

1014
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,400
I guess I saw.

1015
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:10,400
Here's why I guess I'm kind of upset about it is I guess I sort of saw a point with with butter F.S.

1016
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:26,400
and containers and GTK three and system D and everybody now being on a modern Linux for kernel so much of the Linux landscape sort of began to coalesce in a way that have a standard Linux.

1017
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:38,400
Well not even a standard but a platform that is reasonable and rational to target with that was beginning to emerge a rational target for a developer a rational target for somebody to build a product around.

1018
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:49,400
Something that didn't need something like Android that was something that was your as a product manager you're able to wrap your head around something that just look nice and simple and uneasy to understand.

1019
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:56,400
And here we are now midway on not even midway into 2016 and it's a total clown show.

1020
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,400
All right.

1021
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,400
And of Rand I'm just going to disagree.

1022
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,400
I don't think this is an example of the clown show.

1023
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:09,400
I mean yeah with the is it's an excessive amount of applications that really don't need to exist.

1024
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,400
And I don't think anybody has a reason why men would do that.

1025
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,400
But that's just an example of a bad decision by one distro.

1026
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:31,400
So like if someone builds an app image or the snap a snap package or whatever it can be spread across a lot of places like app images everywhere you can run that anywhere you want to.

1027
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,400
But like even snappy is only better.

1028
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:40,400
It's not even been around a month yet and you can run it on every pretty much every official flavor of a bunty you want to.

1029
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:49,400
That'll probably be the best way to install applications on mint 18 because it's going to be the best thing about mint 18 is it'll be based on 1604.

1030
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,400
Yeah.

1031
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,400
And I think they'll probably they'll probably iron out some of the rough edges that know what was going on about again this week on.

1032
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,400
Pretty soon we're just not going to have anything to complain about.

1033
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,400
Good.

1034
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,400
I don't like you.

1035
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,400
People don't like it when I get grumpy.

1036
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
They don't like it.

1037
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,400
I don't like it.

1038
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,400
You have to defend yourself.

1039
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,400
It's a whole thing.

1040
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,400
Well and this mint stuff and this mint stuff in particular has me particularly grumpy.

1041
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
So it's OK.

1042
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,400
It's all right.

1043
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,400
I'll be all right.

1044
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,400
But there's an interesting benefit of the new 1604 releases.

1045
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:22,400
You know how the the issue of the Nome software fork not working with local devs.

1046
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:30,400
It actually brought to light that the new version of apt has a built in local dev install.

1047
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:37,400
So you just do pseudo apt install and then put the path to the dev and it just installs it and handles.

1048
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,400
That is nice to know.

1049
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,400
Good tip.

1050
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Good tip.

1051
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,400
Anybody else have thoughts on mint.

1052
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:51,400
Anybody want to take a counter because I know we have a lot of mint fans and I I say all these things and then I install mint and I do kind of get it like that machine right there is running it.

1053
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,400
It's been running mint since we reviewed it in last.

1054
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,400
I stay true to my word.

1055
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,400
I've been running production now for months and it's a rock solid rig.

1056
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,400
Really. Yeah.

1057
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,400
I mean but I don't do anything with it.

1058
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,400
I just run you know mumble and web browsers and that's it.

1059
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,400
But that's pretty much my situation as well.

1060
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,400
So I when I when I use mint I do kind of grok where he's going with it Clem.

1061
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,400
I do kind of grok where he's going with it.

1062
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,400
And I but then when I look at it from a broader ecosystem perspective I get real frustrated.

1063
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:29,400
And I the reason why I particularly have a lot of momentum behind this frustration is I really feel like they're an important important position.

1064
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
Like I got these I got these.

1065
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,400
They have a lot of goodwill and you know the residents in the Linux community especially for newcomers.

1066
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,400
And a lot of attention.

1067
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,400
Yeah.

1068
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:42,400
And I mean I just I feel like we got a little taste of it when that security thing went down.

1069
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,400
When that security thing went down we got a little taste of it Wes.

1070
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,400
And I just don't.

1071
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,400
Dude they're still number one on distro watch.

1072
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,400
Yes of course of course they have been for a long time haven't they.

1073
00:53:53,400 --> 00:54:00,400
It's kind of weird how they're out there number one when every version of mint is actually included all in the same result.

1074
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,400
And at the same time they don't even have their own user agents that they press.

1075
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,400
So like how does how does distro watch actually get that information.

1076
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,400
I've actually asked them and they won't tell me.

1077
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,400
Like that's that's you know proprietary information.

1078
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:23,400
Well it's based on it's the the the the charts are generated on interest on the distro watch site.

1079
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:29,400
So the people that are visiting the district they're not saying is it just the actual page or is it a user agent.

1080
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,400
But it can't really be a user agent.

1081
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,400
So like how are they getting it.

1082
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,400
And they said they have like multiple factors that use but they won't tell me what that was.

1083
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,400
Yeah I don't buy that.

1084
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,400
I don't buy that the number one page getting hit on distro watch dot com is mint Linux that doesn't seem.

1085
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,400
I did just say that as a joke.

1086
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:52,400
So just so you know I know but it is a thing and it does get quoted all the time all the time.

1087
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,400
Yeah yeah as if it's a fact that it's the best because of that.

1088
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:04,400
And if you go to any if you go to any conference and somebody does a talk about Linux distribution share they always always always cite distro watch always.

1089
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:10,400
And I don't it's like it but distro watch numbers are just simply reflective of traffic within distro watch.

1090
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:17,400
So a lot of people think I'll make a make a collection of here's what MIT has and then here's all the official flavors of Bantu and see what the differences.

1091
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,400
I would bet it's a massively for the Bantu.

1092
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,400
Yeah well OK.

1093
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,400
All right so closing thoughts from the night ladies night.

1094
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,400
Did you want to jump in with your thoughts before we wrapped up.

1095
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,400
Because I know you did you were muted earlier.

1096
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,400
Sure I kind of just agreed with what you guys said.

1097
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,400
I don't personally use mint.

1098
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:50,400
I don't know at this point I think in the past they were you know really popular and still are popular but I think they've kind of been replaced or at least there's other distros that provide the same thing that they're offering.

1099
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
And so they're not unique anymore.

1100
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:58,400
Oh man Jesus is the episode everybody's going to hate because all the mint listeners are going to listen in and they're going to hate us.

1101
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,400
I feel really bad about it.

1102
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,400
So listen next week if you want to do a little follow up you are totally welcome.

1103
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:14,400
You listen out there to join us in the Mamba room and tell us where we've gotten things wrong because I was really hoping somebody in the Mamba room would step up and defend mint because I didn't want it to be a total mint hate session.

1104
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,400
That's not hate.

1105
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,400
It's just we're just questioning what's happening.

1106
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,400
User experience in the sense of like the updates that they have the structured things like the one.

1107
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,400
Yes one through five thing.

1108
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
I mean that's nice for some people.

1109
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:32,400
Not the kind of people on mint that you know enjoy that because it's really easy to deal with and then you don't have to worry about something breaking.

1110
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,400
So I guess there's that.

1111
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:41,400
Yeah and speed testing the mirrors totally solid really awesome and going to be completely made irrelevant by snap packages.

1112
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Ubuntu does that as well.

1113
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:54,400
Yeah I think the I don't know I think the updater and the PPA manager built into mint are kind of nice but I'm not joking when I say when we can when we switch over to snap packages.

1114
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,400
You won't be using those tools to update your system anymore.

1115
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:03,400
So that's a short term win.

1116
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,400
I know I'm sorry I didn't.

1117
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,400
I think I was trying to end on a positive note.

1118
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:21,400
But on the upside on the upside there is one positive thing that one of the releases on the news they did say that they're going to use a 1.14 and at least and might even do 1.16.

1119
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,400
So they're not necessarily staying back on the old versions of Monte.

1120
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,400
That would be good.

1121
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:33,400
I don't totally see I for me and maybe when we can you clear it up for me I don't understand where the line is with Monte.

1122
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:40,400
I don't as for me I know there's like a there's one version that's GT more GTK one version GTK 3 when GTK 2.

1123
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,400
I don't what or how do I as a as a sort of a made observer I'm a observer.

1124
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,400
How do I keep it straight.

1125
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:55,400
Right. So all of Monte can be built by the distro maintain it against the toolkit that they choose.

1126
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,400
So there is one version of Monte.

1127
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,400
The current version is 1.14.

1128
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:08,400
You can choose to compile that against GTK 2 or you can choose to compile it against GTK 3.

1129
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Some distributions are going to start building it against GTK 3 because we now feel that it's ready.

1130
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:22,400
And some distributions will continue to build it against GTK 2 because they feel it needs a bit longer.

1131
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:28,400
I see. And by some distributions is it other is it Zubuntu and no not Zubuntu because it's Mate.

1132
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,400
So it's Linux Mint Mate that's not going to.

1133
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:39,400
As I understand it Linux Mint 18 is going to build Monte against GTK 2.

1134
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,400
So we're going to have sort of a split is what is kind of what I'm seeing here.

1135
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,400
And I don't understand I don't I don't I don't quite understand what the impact of that is.

1136
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,400
Well I think it will remain to be seen.

1137
00:58:52,400 --> 00:59:04,400
I think the impact will be that in the Marte 1.14 development cycle almost exclusively all of the development effort was focused on GTK 3 support improving GTK 3 support.

1138
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,400
And some of the components in Marte only build against GTK 3 now.

1139
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:21,400
Subsequent development cycles will continue to be focused on GTK 3 with the eventual goal to decommission GTK 2 stuff.

1140
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:29,400
That's not going to happen in 1.16 probably not in 1.18 because we'll keep it around long enough for people to transition.

1141
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,400
But the other thing there's also pressure coming from distributions themselves.

1142
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:47,400
So for example Arch Linux Fedora Debian all have bugs open about libraries they are seeking to deprecate because they're old and unmaintained.

1143
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:54,400
And they raise bugs against the other software that uses these old deprecated.

1144
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,400
I would imagine that's just the tip of the iceberg too.

1145
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:08,400
Yeah so there's been pressure for some time to move Marte to GTK 3 so that we can adopt the newer implementations of common libraries.

1146
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,400
So things like the GTK source view for the editors and stuff.

1147
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Lib VTE for the terminals.

1148
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,400
I can't remember all of them but there's a collection.

1149
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:27,400
So we are not being pressured or strong armed but there is some gentle pressure to sort of move people along to the newer supported technologies.

1150
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:34,400
For example some of the stuff some of the libraries have security vulnerabilities and aren't maintained anymore.

1151
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:45,400
So you have to move to the newer versions of the libraries in order to get to the current version that is being security patched.

1152
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:50,400
You know what solves that? Snappy.

1153
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:58,400
Interesting. I guess yeah that was I got a tweet that said why would you want Marte to go to GTK 3?

1154
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:04,400
That's the whole point of Marte is to be like Gnome 2 resurrected.

1155
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:10,400
And so that sort of explains that it's mostly there's just a lot of other ecosystem pressures and advantages.

1156
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:18,400
So realistically that point I get a lot so let's just make that absolutely clear.

1157
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,400
GTK 3 is not Gnome 3.

1158
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,400
A lot of people don't seem to be able to unpick those two things.

1159
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,400
They seem to think that GTK 3 means that you get some new desktop paradigm.

1160
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,400
That's not what it means at all.

1161
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:42,400
Unless you're a really observant Marte user if you run Marte 1.14 with the default Marte theme.

1162
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:52,400
So not the Ubuntu Marte theme the default theme that we developed in Marte on GTK 2 and you have another VM with it running the GTK 3 version.

1163
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,400
They are almost indistinguishable from one another.

1164
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,400
Right. We're just talking the toolkit here that the applications are using.

1165
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:13,400
Exactly. But the thing that's important about GTK 3 and the thing that's most important for me not personally but the thing I think is most important is GTK 3 opens the gateway to high DPI.

1166
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,400
Oh yes.

1167
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,400
And GTK 2 doesn't do that.

1168
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:25,400
And the other benefit and this is a longer term goal is GTK 3 opens the door to things like Wayland and Mir and GTK 2 doesn't.

1169
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:35,400
So in order for the traditional desktop to remain relevant we have to adopt the technologies that allow us to support the new technology.

1170
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,400
The light at the end of the tunnel is a fast approaching train called Wayland.

1171
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,400
I mean that is that is sort of the bottom line right there.

1172
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:49,400
But see when I and this is where I went off the rails I think for a lot of people in last but where because I can't help but come from a security angle.

1173
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:58,400
And I think to myself rationally all of the money energy effort time is being spent now on GTK 3.

1174
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:05,400
And so if if you want things that are secure and updated and maintained you have to you have to move to GTK 3.

1175
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,400
Do you agree with that assessment Wimpy.

1176
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,400
Yeah I do.

1177
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:21,400
And that's where I think again I mean so security isn't just managing your Web site installation correctly it isn't just properly verifying ISO's.

1178
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:37,400
Security is a layered thing that happens at all layers from from from shipping your system with updated secure software that continues to be maintained and updated for security purposes.

1179
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,400
That is part of a responsible secure desktop.

1180
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,400
It's not it's not just one thing to do if you're shipping software to a lot of people.

1181
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,400
Yeah OK.

1182
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,400
So that's good insight Wimpy.

1183
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,400
Thank you.

1184
01:03:50,400 --> 01:04:05,400
I I was I was not understanding fully and I and I guess the other part I don't fully understand is there are going to be some things that don't work with Matei built against GTK 3 which would probably be the biggest reason Clem would have not to use it.

1185
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:10,400
Because he wouldn't want to scare the users with features not existing all of a sudden.

1186
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:17,400
Yeah so Mint and Ubuntu Matei are at different points in their release cycle at the moment.

1187
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:24,400
Clem is just about to embark on another LTS effectively what we've just done with Ubuntu 16.04.

1188
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,400
So he's going to pick stable tried and true because that's his shtick.

1189
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,400
So that's what he's going to go for.

1190
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,400
I've just entered into the Ubuntu 16.10 development cycle.

1191
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,400
We've got a solid LTS behind us.

1192
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:44,400
Now is the time to break all the toys and to try out all the new stuff.

1193
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,400
Sure.

1194
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:49,400
And spend the next two years building towards the next LTS.

1195
01:04:49,400 --> 01:05:04,400
And with regards to what isn't going to work there are some plugins and extensions for Matei in particular for the image viewer and plume of the text editor that are written in Python and use PyGTK2.

1196
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,400
That's the underlying library.

1197
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,400
PyGTK2 is not simply not compatible with GTK 3.

1198
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,400
Can't be done.

1199
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,400
So those plugins that are written using those libraries are disabled.

1200
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:20,400
In fact I patched them out and there's maybe I don't know six or seven of them.

1201
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,400
And then there are some third party panel applets.

1202
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:36,400
So panel applets that aren't maintained by the Matei desktop team that are maintained by community contributors that are currently only targeting GTK2.

1203
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:42,400
Now I've contacted all of the authors of that software and told them that this change is coming.

1204
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:51,400
And I've given them some pointers about how they can either make the transition to GTK3 or how they can dual support both toolkits.

1205
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:56,400
So some of that work we're going to have to do within the Matei desktop team.

1206
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,400
Some of that work is going to be on the shoulders of the people that develop and maintain that software.

1207
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:17,400
And what I'm going to try and do is use the donations that the Ubuntu Matei community have made to Ubuntu Matei to help those developers complete that work over maybe the next year.

1208
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:23,400
With the intention I would assume to have things sort of shaped up and ready to ship by the next LTS.

1209
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,400
Yes that's the idea.

1210
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:34,400
So I think probably Ubuntu Matei 16.10 is going to be a bit of a bumpy release because we are breaking all the toys.

1211
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:43,400
We're almost going back to sort of square one and starting again with a new toolkit.

1212
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:52,400
Now it's not quite square one because we've learned an awful lot in the last two years and developed a lot of integration pieces that we will be able to carry through.

1213
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:58,400
Because everything that I've worked on in Ubuntu Matei in the last two years has been GTK3.

1214
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,400
So that's all good to go.

1215
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,400
So I just wanted a point of clarification.

1216
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:11,400
So your patrons got an update from you and where you talked a little bit about collaborating a lot more with the Fedora project.

1217
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,400
That's a hell of a tease.

1218
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:18,400
I mean do you understand that you are a Linux distro and they are a Linux distro.

1219
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,400
These kinds of things just aren't done.

1220
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:26,400
Yeah you're not supposed to. You're supposed to create your own applications with your own theme and your own release cycles.

1221
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,400
This I don't understand. Is there any clarifications because my world is spinning.

1222
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,400
What does Ubuntu Matei working closely with the Fedora project mean? I'm lost.

1223
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:41,400
Well Matei desktop in itself is made up. The team members are made up of a cross distribution group of people.

1224
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:52,400
So Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Slackware, Arch, BSD. There's a whole range of people working on different distributions.

1225
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,400
But working towards making the Matei desktop work in those distributions.

1226
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:04,400
It just so happens that the Ubuntu and Fedora release cycles are very closely aligned with one another.

1227
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:14,400
I know we joke about Fedora delaying and what have you but despite that within a few weeks they're very close to one another.

1228
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:23,400
So Wolfgang Albrecht who's a Matei desktop developer and is also the maintainer for Matei in Fedora.

1229
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:30,400
He is a highly skilled theme developer for GTK 2 and GTK 3.

1230
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:40,400
He does all of the theme maintainership for the Matei themes that we ship as part of the Matei upstream project.

1231
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:52,400
But he has helped out other distributions and other spins of Fedora that are now using versions of the Matei themes in Fedora and other distributions.

1232
01:08:52,400 --> 01:09:02,400
Because it's about the best GTK 3.20 theme implementation you can get outside of what comes from GNOME.

1233
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:07,400
And it's got that dual theming for GTK 2 and GTK 3.

1234
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:16,400
So he's very experienced and highly skilled and I don't know that theming stuff particularly well.

1235
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:27,400
So I'm going to be working with Wolfgang to build on his skill and experience to bring that work into the Ubuntu Matei themes for Matei.

1236
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:33,400
But more importantly I've spoken to some of the developers for Ubuntu.

1237
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:46,400
And we're going to try and then, because the Matei themes, the Ubuntu Matei themes are very very closely linked to the versions, the Ubuntu light themes.

1238
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,400
You know, ambience and radiance and what have you.

1239
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:57,400
And I'm going to try and see if we can give back some merge proposals from the Ubuntu Matei themes back to upstream Ubuntu.

1240
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:03,400
So that they get the GTK 3.20 support in the Ubuntu themes.

1241
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:14,400
And so it's actually going to be a sort of Ubuntu, Ubuntu, Matei, Fedora sort of cross collaboration effort to sort of bring everything up to GTK 3.20.

1242
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,400
That's really cool.

1243
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,400
Yeah.

1244
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:21,400
So now just a real talk Wimpy, just you and me, nobody else is here just for a moment.

1245
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:26,400
You think Unity 8 is going to be just a boon for Ubuntu Matei edition?

1246
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,400
What do you think?

1247
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,400
I don't know.

1248
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,400
Come on, I was trying to be, you must say yes.

1249
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:46,400
No, because Mark Shuttleworth made it clear some years ago that there wouldn't be a switch to Unity 8 unless the community wanted it.

1250
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,400
You know, when the community was ready for that transition then that's when it would happen.

1251
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,400
And until that happens there's Unity 7.

1252
01:10:54,400 --> 01:11:00,400
As we've discussed earlier, there's an awful lot of people that like and use Unity 7.

1253
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,400
Hello.

1254
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,400
They've got their safe harbor.

1255
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,400
Yeah.

1256
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:16,400
You know, here's my response to that, which is completely unjustified and based in no reality or fact and does not represent the present at all.

1257
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,400
So that's my disclaimer before I say this.

1258
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:24,400
Because Popeye's world is the reality right now where there's people out there using Unity and, goll darn it, they love it.

1259
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,400
Getting their job done.

1260
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:35,400
A lot of these are probably like people that got computers put in front of them, you know, like the millions of Dells that got deployed and all these different places.

1261
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,400
I have a dream.

1262
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:44,400
I have a vision that the next wave of Linux users are exhausted Mac users and exhausted Windows users.

1263
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,400
And I believe that's not going to come in a huge, huge, huge shift.

1264
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:53,400
I believe it's just going to be a ramp that continues to accelerate up and up and up more people.

1265
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,400
They'll be exasperated by Apple.

1266
01:11:55,400 --> 01:12:05,400
And I could, the list of why you, as somebody who has to be, who has a couple of Macs left in production and has to deal with their limitations, I promise you,

1267
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:13,400
while they are great machines for way more people than there are Linux users and will be for a really long time,

1268
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:20,400
for a certain audience, the exact kind of audience that Linux is appealing to, they are extremely frustrating.

1269
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:27,400
And there is a huge percentage that will be a massive growth for Linux coming over from them, from Windows 10 users,

1270
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,400
especially as Steam OS grows and games are more and more supported on Linux.

1271
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,400
There is going to be a new wave, I believe, of Linux users.

1272
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,400
And it's not all at once, like I said, but ramping up and they will be making an educated choice.

1273
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,400
And I, you know what?

1274
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,400
I'll give it to them.

1275
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,400
I have given the man a hard time for a long time.

1276
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,400
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

1277
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:55,400
But I actually think Leo legitimately represents the cutting wave of tech enthusiasts.

1278
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:01,400
People who are, and I know, I'm saying this about somebody who is, by most people's account, now a little out of date.

1279
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,400
But I actually think he's on to something here.

1280
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:09,400
He today, today is experimenting with Debian on his Google Pixel.

1281
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,400
And, you know, he's talking about getting the external...

1282
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,400
That's pretty cool.

1283
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,400
Yeah, and he's talking about how the trackpad works and all.

1284
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,400
I mean, he is legitimately all in on this.

1285
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:24,400
And I think he represents somebody, I think Chase does as well, somebody who is actually educated on this stuff

1286
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:30,400
and enjoys computers and is enthusiastic about hardware, is enthusiastic about software,

1287
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,400
wants to use their computer to its fullest.

1288
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,400
Windows and the Mac no longer offer this.

1289
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,400
And this is just the beginning of it.

1290
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,400
It's just going to get worse.

1291
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,400
And I think these people will be coming to Linux.

1292
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:49,400
And I don't think a desktop environment that looks like it was designed eight years ago

1293
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:53,400
by a company that's put it on life support will be appealing to a lot of these people.

1294
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,400
I think some of them will choose Unity.

1295
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,400
But I think for most of them, Unity 7 will look like yesterday's game.

1296
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,400
And I think Unity 8 won't be ready yet.

1297
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,400
So for most of them, they're just going to go with something easy, practical.

1298
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,400
Boom, and it works.

1299
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,400
What do you think?

1300
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,400
Hmm.

1301
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,400
You think I'm crazy?

1302
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:15,400
No, I'm not sure how many Mac users are going to be brought over

1303
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,400
because they've paid a premium for that whole Apple experience.

1304
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,400
There is, yeah, that's true.

1305
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:29,400
It will only be potentially developers that have got Mac hardware that would be prepared to make that switch, I think.

1306
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,400
But that is literally, that's millions.

1307
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:42,400
Yeah, and anecdotally, I don't see that many people switching to Ubuntu that are using Mac hardware,

1308
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:50,400
unless it's quite old Mac hardware and they're looking to extend the life of their computer

1309
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:54,400
because the version of Mac OS X that they can run on their machine is...

1310
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,400
No, you know, I'll tell you about the Mac user that I'm picturing.

1311
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,400
I'm picturing a Mac user that buys a ThinkPad.

1312
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,400
I'm picturing a Mac user that buys an Intraware Apollo

1313
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:08,400
because part of becoming a frustrated Mac user is becoming frustrated with the hardware options

1314
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:12,400
because literally the worst thing Apple has going for it right now is its hardware.

1315
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:17,400
All of the graphics cards in all Macs are an absolute and total joke.

1316
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,400
All of the storage options are a total joke in terms of cost.

1317
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,400
They have been doing nothing with the MacBook line.

1318
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,400
The Mac mini hasn't been updated in 200 years.

1319
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:31,400
The Trashcan has a video card that's now three generations at least out of date.

1320
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,400
I mean, the Mac hardware is in a bad state.

1321
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,400
And so I think one of the number one things, I think it's well built.

1322
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,400
I think it lasts a long time.

1323
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,400
It's still pretty.

1324
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:46,400
And I think there should be more attention, energy, and effort spent on making Linux work just super well on Mac hardware,

1325
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,400
including figuring out the SMC controller so we can manage thermals.

1326
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,400
I think that would be a huge thing to get more people,

1327
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:59,400
but I don't think it's a number one priority because I think this type of user just gets sick and tired of it.

1328
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:06,400
They go out there and they look what they can buy in a ThinkPad or an Apollo for $1,000 less,

1329
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,400
and they think, well, I'm just going to switch.

1330
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,400
And then they don't drop the Mac.

1331
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,400
They keep the Mac around.

1332
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1333
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,400
And some people have, you know, yeah, you are right.

1334
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,400
There are Mac users out there who will make a switch.

1335
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,400
I'm not sure they're the majority of Mac users.

1336
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:30,400
I think disgruntled Windows users is a larger potential market.

1337
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,400
And in the last, I don't know, three or four years,

1338
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:50,400
Microsoft have dropped the ball a couple of times when if Linux or a major Linux distribution was more ready to absorb those disgruntled Windows users,

1339
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,400
I think we could have seen more people coming over.

1340
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,400
So there are choices.

1341
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,400
There is Linux Mint, and there is Ubuntu Mate, and there is Ubuntu proper.

1342
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:04,400
So just as another anecdote, and I don't know, this is one of the things I love about our lug,

1343
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:13,400
but so my lady friend, Hadia, has her own practice that she runs a business, and she has a couple of computers there.

1344
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:20,400
And so she has a Lenovo that runs Ubuntu Mate 14.

1345
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,400
I can't actually remember which one it runs.

1346
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,400
I hope she pays someone else for IT, Chris.

1347
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,400
Oh, no, no, I do remember.

1348
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,400
It's 1510, actually.

1349
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,400
It's 1510.

1350
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:38,400
And Wimby, she has been so impressed with it that the other computers in her office which run Windows 7,

1351
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:45,400
she's just been offended by the whole prompts to upgrade to Windows 10 the whole time and interrupting her and all of that,

1352
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:51,400
that she just wants to replace all of them with – she's looking at – what is she – I think they're called HP Stream.

1353
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,400
Is that something – is that –

1354
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1355
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:58,400
She's looking at HP Streams and wants to know if I'll install Ubuntu Mate on them and just replace the other terminals.

1356
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,400
And how does that make you feel, Chris?

1357
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,400
Well, I think it's amazing, and it's not even prompted by me at all.

1358
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:10,400
It's just that she's like, well, this has been problem-free on my laptop, and it's – she's now using her personal laptop to do like data entry sometimes.

1359
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:14,400
And she's like, so now I made this my work machine, and now I want to put all of my work machines on Linux.

1360
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,400
And the security just happens to be –

1361
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,400
Yeah, especially if you're someone like that where you can kind of control all of your business stuff, right?

1362
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,400
Then you can just go wholeheartedly to Linux, and it just works great.

1363
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,400
It was interesting.

1364
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,400
She went from like, this is my personal computer that I write onto.

1365
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,400
Well, now this is my work computer, and I keep it at work because I like working on Linux more.

1366
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:37,400
And I think – what I found interesting about that is she's not doing it from an advocate's position.

1367
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,400
She's doing it from a practical decision for her business.

1368
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,400
Business owner.

1369
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,400
Yeah.

1370
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:48,400
And that is also a huge area for a very practical desktop like Mate.

1371
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:54,400
You'd already be fine, too, but for her, the transition over to Mate is literally like no transition at all.

1372
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,400
Welcome screen.

1373
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:56,400
Yeah.

1374
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,400
Yeah.

1375
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:06,400
And what you've just described is consistent with what I've learned talking to small business owners in my local community.

1376
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:13,400
There's a frightening amount of small businesses that are one or two or three employees,

1377
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:19,400
so homegrown businesses that are still running their operation on Windows XP.

1378
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:25,400
Some of the companies I've spoken to have actually bought new computers a couple of years ago,

1379
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:34,400
but don't have the wherewithal to make the transition from one Windows computer to the next Windows computer.

1380
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,400
Right.

1381
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:41,400
Don't really understand it, and they need people to come in and actually help them do those transitions.

1382
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:47,400
But when you look at what they're using, they're not using a lot of the facilities of Windows.

1383
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,400
A lot of them are very disgruntled with Windows because they buy a new computer.

1384
01:19:51,400 --> 01:20:00,400
They expect it to be faster than their old computer, and invariably it isn't because they're buying budget computers running a modern version of Windows,

1385
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,400
and it's actually slower than their old computer that's running Windows XP.

1386
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,400
The number of people unhappy with Windows XP is just amazing, surprising and amazing to me.

1387
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:14,400
So a lot of small business owners I hear are really cheesed off with Windows, and they really want to make the switch.

1388
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:21,400
And what people know about, when they start researching, they find two things.

1389
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:30,400
They find either Mac OS X, which is quite often economically not viable, or they find Ubuntu.

1390
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,400
And those are the two things that these businesses find.

1391
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:38,400
So when I talk to people, they've found out about Ubuntu, and then I start the conversation about,

1392
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:45,400
well, if you're familiar with Windows and you want to use a computer in a way that's familiar to you, you could use this.

1393
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:51,400
But if you want to use this version, then it works slightly differently, and this is how it looks.

1394
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,400
And I sort of explain those differences.

1395
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:58,400
But there's a lot of local businesses around here that are making the switch to Linux.

1396
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,400
Do you find people are doing more research about this than they used to?

1397
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:07,400
Yeah, and the other thing I found is that they're actually trying to find local companies

1398
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:15,400
who can support them running Linux, and I'm struggling to find people that can do that in my local area.

1399
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,400
So I'm in Hampshire in the UK.

1400
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:23,400
So if you're listening to this, and you're in Hampshire in the UK, and you offer Linux support services,

1401
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:28,400
let me know, because I'll hand out your business details to these people when I speak to them.

1402
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,400
Fine, Wimpy. Tell him.

1403
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:36,400
Yeah, okay, we totally went off on a sidebar, but I think it's interesting that our two experiences have lined up.

1404
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:43,400
So there is a business group that I have attended several times that's just local businesses,

1405
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:50,400
and so the way this business group works is only one person from each profession can go there.

1406
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,400
Oh, funny.

1407
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,400
And Hadi is the one that introduced me to it.

1408
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,400
B&I?

1409
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,400
What's that?

1410
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,400
Is it called B&I?

1411
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:02,400
No. That sounds like a dirty thing you do.

1412
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,400
Come on, Rob.

1413
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,400
Get out of here, Rob.

1414
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,400
It's just Networking International.

1415
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,400
Come on, Ron.

1416
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,400
They have the exact same model.

1417
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,400
Okay, because for a second there, I – okay, for a second.

1418
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,400
Get it out of here.

1419
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,400
True. It does sound weird.

1420
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:21,400
And yeah, they have a web developer in the group, and the web developer uses Linux.

1421
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:27,400
And he talks about it sometimes with the group, and it's very fascinating to see different people who just get into –

1422
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:30,400
now looking into something a little bit further than they used to in the past.

1423
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,400
It felt like people would just take the PC and whatever it came with.

1424
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:39,400
But something about – and I think – I'm not saying it's a big – I'm not saying it's like this huge movement,

1425
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,400
but I think in part for some people, like the Windows 10 prompting to get you to upgrade

1426
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:47,400
and the way Microsoft has handled this has really pissed off a lot of business owners

1427
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,400
who the one thing they want out of their PCs is they want predictability.

1428
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,400
That is an effing tool.

1429
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,400
I pay my staff to do their work here, not mess with the computer.

1430
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,400
And that thing needs to work the way I expect it to.

1431
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,400
I mean, it's the same as a copy.

1432
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,400
You just want it to work.

1433
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,400
You bought it to work.

1434
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,400
Right.

1435
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:07,400
And I can tell you as somebody who used to fix business machines for his living as a contractor,

1436
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:12,400
I bore the brunt of the anger from the business owner when that effing computer wasn't working.

1437
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:18,400
And he wanted to understand why it wasn't working as a damn tool because he spent $600 or something like that on it.

1438
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:26,400
So the idea now that some people – and I – I don't want to make a big deal out of this,

1439
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:30,400
but do you find there – do you find it to be people that are maybe in their 30s and 40s

1440
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:35,400
that are now business owners that are just sort of more of an internet savvy generation?

1441
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,400
Because that was my experience is that these people are just now getting a generation of people

1442
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,400
that are going to be business owners that know how to use Google.

1443
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,400
Right.

1444
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:50,400
And have also – have also been using Windows for 15 years or more in some cases

1445
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:55,400
and are really sick to the back teeth of it, really ready for change.

1446
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,400
I hear those words quite frequently that they're ready for a change.

1447
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,400
Yeah.

1448
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,400
And it's really because they just – they're at their wits end.

1449
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:05,400
They feel that any change can't be worse.

1450
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,400
Yeah.

1451
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,400
Exactly.

1452
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,400
Wow.

1453
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,400
Okay.

1454
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,400
Well, so that was a bit of a sidebar, but I want to keep going on.

1455
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,400
I want to give a special mention to one of our favorite open source projects who's doing a Kickstarter right now.

1456
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:18,400
But first I'm going to give a real special mention to Linux Academy.

1457
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:22,400
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to support the show and get yourself a discount.

1458
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,400
Nine dollars for the first 30 days over at Linux Academy.

1459
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,400
That is such a deal.

1460
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,400
Holy smokes, man.

1461
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,400
You got to check them out.

1462
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:33,400
They have so many great self-paced courses, 2,389 as of this here recording,

1463
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,400
but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

1464
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,400
They've got downloadable comprehensive study guides.

1465
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:40,400
They've got a whole bunch of distros you can choose from that automatically adjust the courseware

1466
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,400
and the virtual machines that they'll spin up on demand and give you SSH access.

1467
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:50,400
I think what I like about Linux Academy though the most isn't their killer, killer, killer, killer dashboard

1468
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:54,400
that really helped me quantify how long it takes to do certain things into just hours.

1469
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:59,400
I mean that was great, but what I really like about it is the people that run Linux Academy.

1470
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:04,400
I started communicating with Linux Academy way before they were ever a sponsor.

1471
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,400
Really?

1472
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,400
I've never told this story.

1473
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,400
Linux Unplugged special folks.

1474
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,400
Yeah.

1475
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:16,400
I should tell this story because it tells you really more about Linux Academy as a company.

1476
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:20,400
We started talking to Linux Academy before we announced how to Linux,

1477
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:29,400
however long ago that was to the public as a way to try to figure out how to amp up our show segments.

1478
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:34,400
Like here's something you could do to spin up a server, but if you want to know more go do this

1479
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:39,400
and then we were going to replicate essentially the exact steps you could follow that we did on the show

1480
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:45,400
in their virtual environment and then they would take it up from there and tell you to do more things.

1481
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,400
This is when they were just experimenting with the technology

1482
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:55,400
because they really came from an angle of how can we show more people in the community at large

1483
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:59,400
how to use Linux properly and like even people who are self-taught

1484
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:04,400
or people who want to get into it to help support it for small businesses or for their company or for whatever

1485
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,400
or people that just want to make a buck off it and build off the technology around Linux

1486
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:14,400
and maybe properly use those things and that's everything from Amazon Web Services to Android to OpenStack

1487
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:20,400
and Ruby on Rails and PHP, all the technology around it, how to use that properly.

1488
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:25,400
And that properly, you can learn a lot from a lot of places how to do a basic configuration,

1489
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:30,400
get it working on one machine, but if you have to suddenly support like 50 or 500 machines

1490
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,400
then Linux Academy is really what you need.

1491
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:37,400
Man, the thing that's great about Linux Academy too is when you've got to go into a whole new world

1492
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:41,400
that feels like a different language and a different way of thinking about things,

1493
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:46,400
the fact that they can break down like getting through that barrier into amount of time for me

1494
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:50,400
and the fact that they have an availability planner where I'll go say, okay, I've got this much time this week,

1495
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:54,400
which is often not much, and they still manage to make it worth my time.

1496
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,400
And you learn something.

1497
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,400
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, they've got detailed notes, they've got practice exams,

1498
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,400
they've got instructor mentoring when you need it and they've got a community stacked

1499
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,400
full of Jupyter Broadcasting members.

1500
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,400
A big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program now.

1501
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:13,400
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, go there, support the show and find out more.

1502
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:17,400
So Corita is an application we talk about a lot.

1503
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:22,400
Mr. Westra, you are in the mumble room, so I don't make a jerk face out of myself.

1504
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,400
How do I properly describe what type of application Corita is?

1505
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:31,400
It's a drawing app, but that seems like calling it, that sounds like paint.

1506
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,400
I mean, it's way more than a drawing app.

1507
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:37,400
What is Corita and how do you use it?

1508
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,400
Westra, go.

1509
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,400
I don't hear, did he leave?

1510
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,400
That was such a good buildup.

1511
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,400
Did you like my buildup?

1512
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:43,400
Oh, absolutely.

1513
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:47,400
Yeah, I felt like that was, I felt like I could tweet that buildup.

1514
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,400
I could tweet that, that was so good.

1515
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,400
I almost wish I could play it back immediately and hear my own buildup.

1516
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,400
I enjoyed that so much.

1517
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,400
I enjoyed it so much.

1518
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,400
I would just play the Corita video that would tell you.

1519
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,400
Yeah, let's do it.

1520
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,400
But you know what, all they have is music.

1521
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:04,400
You know, you remember a couple of weeks ago when I said you need to have music and I said,

1522
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:09,400
here's an example of like a little tune you could play to jazz up your...

1523
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,400
Jazz it up.

1524
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,400
Yeah, you just give it a little oomph.

1525
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,400
You could, you know, you could talk about anything and you got this playing.

1526
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,400
Oh, yeah, flats.

1527
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,400
I'll buy whatever you're selling.

1528
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,400
Well, the Corita project took that...

1529
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,400
Let me tell you about Windows 10, Chris.

1530
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,400
They took that too far.

1531
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:27,400
So everybody, if you're watching the show, close your eyes for a second.

1532
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:31,400
I want you to experience the show like our vast audio audience does,

1533
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:35,400
because if you think about it from that perspective,

1534
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:39,400
this has got to be one of the worst Kickstarter project videos ever.

1535
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:42,400
So imagine you're listening to the show if you're watching right now.

1536
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,400
Almost an opposite of what we often do.

1537
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,400
So if you are watching the show, you're at a disadvantage, close your eyes and listen.

1538
01:28:48,400 --> 01:29:05,400
This video is going to tell you all about this Corita Kickstarter.

1539
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:33,400
I think you get the idea.

1540
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:38,400
That's why I'm saying not a great Kickstarter video to describe what the...

1541
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,400
I'm just...

1542
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,400
Here's why.

1543
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,400
I'm not...

1544
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:45,400
I sound like I'm being a jerk, but what I'm doing is I'm giving away consulting services.

1545
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,400
Instead of charging you $100 an hour, I'm just giving this away for free right here.

1546
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,400
So if Corita Project, if you're listening, voiceovers.

1547
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,400
You know who's got a great voice?

1548
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,400
That Popeye guy's got a great voice.

1549
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:00,400
I mean, I know he's busy, but I would just like, you know, maybe tweet him.

1550
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,400
He's probably ready to secretly use Corita as well.

1551
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1552
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,400
He might be ready to secretly use Corita.

1553
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,400
So just poke him and say, hey, Popeye, would you...

1554
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:14,400
In fact, if all the Kickstarter projects out there would just tweet Popeye

1555
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,400
and ask him, he would do the voiceover.

1556
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,400
Stop it, Wes.

1557
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:21,400
You're making it hard for me to say it.

1558
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,400
I just think that would be a really good idea.

1559
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,400
So anyways, back on track.

1560
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:29,400
The Corita Project, Corita 2016, let's make text and vector art awesome.

1561
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,400
It's got 317 backers.

1562
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:32,400
A noble goal.

1563
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,400
I mean, it's already a great program.

1564
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:37,400
They've got a goal of $34,215.

1565
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:42,400
They've only raised $11,907 at the moment, but they have 28 days to go.

1566
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,400
So you can go over there and find out more about it.

1567
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,400
I think it would be pretty cool.

1568
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,400
They'll support SVGs now.

1569
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,400
Yeah, I'm really excited.

1570
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,400
I agree, yeah.

1571
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,400
And look, Wes, they are distributing an app image, which is fascinating.

1572
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,400
Oh, cool.

1573
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:01,400
Yeah, they have one here for CentOS 6 and Ubuntu 12.04.

1574
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:05,400
Ubuntu 12.04.

1575
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,400
What is that about?

1576
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,400
And then they just have a general app image.

1577
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,400
Hey, everyone, all the cool kids are still on Ubuntu 12.04, Chris.

1578
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,400
Yeah, that is true.

1579
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,400
I wonder if anybody –

1580
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,400
Upstart.

1581
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,400
So, Corita Project, trying to raise a little bit of funds.

1582
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:22,400
Wes, your thoughts – actually, this is really kind of what I want to talk about.

1583
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,400
What do you think about the idea of booster funding?

1584
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:26,400
So you've got a project –

1585
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,400
They're kind of doing it in their own way.

1586
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:30,400
Yeah, about once a year –

1587
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,400
It seems to be working, though.

1588
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:35,400
Once a year, you raise about $30,000, $40,000, let's say.

1589
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:38,400
The idea that an open source project could once a year come out and say,

1590
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,400
hey, would you mind funding us?

1591
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,400
This is what we'd like to accomplish this year.

1592
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,400
That seems like kind of a solid idea.

1593
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,400
It does seem like a good idea.

1594
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:48,400
Especially if you – I mean, I agree the video could be better,

1595
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:52,400
but if you lay out a good set of achievable goals

1596
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:56,400
and once you get a good track record of meeting those goals, which they have.

1597
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,400
I mean, they've improved their program a lot.

1598
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,400
I could see myself as someone who uses Corita

1599
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,400
and wants some of these vector capabilities in a program I know.

1600
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,400
I would pay for that.

1601
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,400
Even as somebody who's now been burned by a couple of different fundraisers,

1602
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:11,400
I feel like there's a couple of Kickstarters that are going to deliver.

1603
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,400
Like when Pebble comes to Kickstarter and they say,

1604
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,400
you know, you fund us and we'll ship a round watch,

1605
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,400
I actually, even if I'm not interested in that product,

1606
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,400
I believe they're going to do it.

1607
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,400
I know they're going to deliver on that.

1608
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:24,400
Corita, this isn't their first time doing this,

1609
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:29,400
and if they come and say, you fund us and we're going to fund 2016, I buy that.

1610
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,400
And I could see other ways.

1611
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,400
I mean, we've talked a lot about Patreon, but I could see this as a solid way.

1612
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,400
So I don't know, I'm curious what you guys think in the Mumble Room.

1613
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:43,400
Does anybody have a counter about using Kickstarter to fund open source?

1614
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:46,400
Like a project that goes to the well about once a year and asks for funding.

1615
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,400
It says, hello, everybody.

1616
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,400
We would like funding.

1617
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,400
Anybody?

1618
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:51,400
What do you think about that?

1619
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,400
It seems to work for NPR.

1620
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,400
Yeah?

1621
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,400
Yeah, that's true.

1622
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,400
Like a pledge drive.

1623
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,400
Huh.

1624
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,400
That is a good point.

1625
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,400
If anything, less annoying.

1626
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,400
Yeah, they are super annoying, aren't they?

1627
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:10,400
That's why it seems, and also it seems, you know, now that I think about this,

1628
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:14,400
it actually seems like a really horrible idea.

1629
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:19,400
Yeah, because I could see what it creates is...

1630
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,400
Oh, Python scripting plugin.

1631
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,400
That sounds cool.

1632
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:25,400
Maybe I'll just, I don't even use it, but maybe I'll give them some money.

1633
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,400
That sounds great.

1634
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,400
I actually think this is a horrible idea.

1635
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:32,400
I think it creates sort of a false deadline to have to hit,

1636
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,400
and certain things you have to do that maybe you commit to,

1637
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,400
that you get to down at the end of the year,

1638
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,400
and you're like, this is not what we should have been spending our time on,

1639
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,400
or this is not what we can spend our time on,

1640
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,400
then all of a sudden you're not delivering on your Kickstarter.

1641
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:46,400
So perhaps the penguin is saying Patreon's a better way?

1642
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,400
That seems like a more sustainable method,

1643
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,400
because then you're not trying to do a big splash.

1644
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,400
Don't have those deadlines, yeah.

1645
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,400
And it reminds me of like the Apple Keynotes

1646
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:57,400
where they have to have a product announcement every WWDC.

1647
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,400
Even if it isn't a real product.

1648
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,400
Yeah.

1649
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:04,400
Even if it's just another Apple TV that's a little thicker or something.

1650
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,400
Yeah.

1651
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:06,400
Yeah.

1652
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,400
So I actually don't know if I actually bounty.

1653
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,400
And Alex Vada asked about BountySource,

1654
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:14,400
and boy, the elementary OS guys will sure tell you BountySource.

1655
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,400
BountySource, $15,000 BountySource.

1656
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,400
I don't know, man.

1657
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,400
I'm not seeing it.

1658
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,400
I decided to put my money where my mouth was,

1659
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,400
and I gave I think like $100 or something like that

1660
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,400
to the elementary OS BountySource.

1661
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,400
I don't know what happened to that.

1662
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,400
And I tell you what else,

1663
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,400
I think if BountySource was going to be a success,

1664
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,400
it would have happened by now.

1665
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,400
It's been around for ages,

1666
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,400
and it just doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

1667
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,400
I see developers go on and off it.

1668
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,400
The elementary OS though seems to use it to some success,

1669
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,400
but it doesn't seem to be a big thing.

1670
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,400
Just like Flatter hasn't become a big thing,

1671
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,400
and bit tipping hasn't become a big thing,

1672
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,400
and YouTube tips haven't become a big thing.

1673
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,400
There's just a certain resistance to it.

1674
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,400
Oh yeah, Flatter.

1675
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:59,400
Yeah, so I don't know.

1676
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,400
Rod, you had a discussion with someone at Krita about Patreon.

1677
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,400
How did that go?

1678
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,400
They were saying that they couldn't think of any of the rewards.

1679
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,400
That's why they haven't tried it.

1680
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,400
So I gave them examples of what they could do,

1681
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,400
and they said after the Kickstarter,

1682
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,400
they're going to look into starting a Patreon.

1683
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,400
Yeah, I'll tell you, the rewards are the real son of a bitch.

1684
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,400
And we've missed them on all of ours,

1685
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,400
and we're reworking ours right now.

1686
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:25,400
That's funny too, because as a person who uses Patreon for other things,

1687
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,400
I don't care about the rewards.

1688
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,400
I just want to give the people money.

1689
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:31,400
That's the thing, but as creators,

1690
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:33,400
we get super mental about these rewards.

1691
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,400
They're like this big psychological thing,

1692
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,400
and the reality is,

1693
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,400
then you want to make them worth something.

1694
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:44,400
So you aim big, but the reality is,

1695
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,400
you're so damn busy just working on the everyday product.

1696
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,400
If you had time to go off and do these big side projects,

1697
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,400
You'd have a second business already.

1698
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:56,400
And that is something I struggle with.

1699
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,400
With Unfilter right now, I'm struggling with that.

1700
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:02,400
We have something we're ready to roll out for our Unfilter supporters,

1701
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:06,400
and the Unfilter news cycle is so crazy right now.

1702
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,400
I'm so busy doing the show.

1703
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,400
I don't have time to do anything else.

1704
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:14,400
Patreon.com today, by the way, go fund our network,

1705
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:18,400
because holy smokes, we are so slammed right now.

1706
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:22,400
It's starting to feel like we're barely treading water.

1707
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:26,400
There's so many things I am turning down right now.

1708
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,400
It's rough out there.

1709
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:32,400
And I honestly think this is a more sustainable method

1710
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,400
than the Kickstarter sort of boop, boop, boop every year.

1711
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:38,400
And the milestone thing is a really difficult thing,

1712
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:44,400
so Rotten, tell them just be easy on themselves.

1713
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,400
I showed them examples of projects

1714
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,400
that are currently running Patreon

1715
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,400
that don't have that very good rewards or even any at all.

1716
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,400
And then I showed them an example of a good project

1717
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:56,400
that has pretty well thought out rewards,

1718
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,400
even though it's a sulfur product.

1719
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:02,400
And it's also, even some of the rewards are funny,

1720
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,400
and that's Ubuntu MATE.

1721
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:08,400
Well, here's what I'll tell you from my experience too.

1722
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,400
So let's see, how many people?

1723
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,400
We have 578 people.

1724
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,400
Okay, so there's 500.

1725
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,400
That's awesome.

1726
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,400
Wow, thank you.

1727
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:18,400
578 people over at patreon.com slash today.

1728
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,400
Heck yeah.

1729
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:23,400
Man, that feels really good, and that is really super cool.

1730
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:26,400
So let me look through here to find the last time

1731
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:30,400
I did an exclusive, okay, perfect example.

1732
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:35,400
For episode 143 of Unplugged, so last week's episode,

1733
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:39,400
I published a complete live stream version of the show

1734
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,400
from the moment we went on the air to the moment we ended,

1735
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,400
like stuff that didn't go in the final edit.

1736
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,400
Naughty, naughty Chris.

1737
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:51,400
Right, so I said there's 578 patrons, 80 people watched that.

1738
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:55,400
So I guess what I would say to those open source projects

1739
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:59,400
out there that are looking at Patreon as a funding model,

1740
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,400
don't kill yourself over the rewards,

1741
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:03,400
because I work my butt off sometimes,

1742
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:09,400
and then out of 578 people, 80 people watched the thing.

1743
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:12,400
And that is just the reality of it,

1744
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,400
because what they really want is the thing you're already doing.

1745
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,400
That's why they're supporting you.

1746
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:20,400
Which, if you think about it, is super rewarding.

1747
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,400
That's the coolest part.

1748
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:23,400
That is exactly the coolest part.

1749
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:25,400
So don't kill yourself on the rewards,

1750
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,400
but try to deliver on what you commit to,

1751
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,400
which is what I struggle with.

1752
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,400
Do your best.

1753
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:34,400
Do your damn best, which we were reviewing our milestones,

1754
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,400
by the way, on the Patreon.

1755
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,400
We have exceeded some of them.

1756
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,400
I wonder if anybody has noticed,

1757
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,400
but there's some things we've done recently that exceed some.

1758
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:46,400
But anyways, to the Creator Project and others,

1759
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,400
I would just, as my experience would go,

1760
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:52,400
and this reflects not just the Patreon for today,

1761
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,400
this also reflects my experience with the Unfilter.

1762
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:57,400
Right.

1763
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:58,400
The same thing.

1764
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,400
Double-dipping.

1765
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,400
I stopped producing a separate show for the patrons

1766
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,400
because that was good content

1767
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,400
that the rest of the audience could benefit from,

1768
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:09,400
and 30 or 40, 60 people were downloading it

1769
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:13,400
from the supporters out of way more than that

1770
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,400
that support the show.

1771
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:19,400
So well over 400 people that support the show,

1772
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:22,400
and 30 or 40 of them would download the extra shows

1773
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,400
that I was staying till midnight to edit and produce and upload.

1774
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,400
So it just didn't make sense.

1775
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,400
So I scaled it back, but now I'm trying to come up

1776
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,400
to another area that still gives them value,

1777
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,400
and that's still a really tight line to walk,

1778
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,400
and so you've got to find it and do it.

1779
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,400
But I would say to the Creator Project,

1780
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,400
it could be something as simple as every now and then

1781
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,400
doing a Google Hangout with your community

1782
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,400
and chatting with them and just answering questions.

1783
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:46,400
It doesn't have to be a big to-do.

1784
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,400
That's a great idea.

1785
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,400
Now we get to go a little fancy because over the years

1786
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,400
we've established like swag partners and stuff like that.

1787
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,400
So for us, we can do swag levels and things like that.

1788
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:57,400
But you don't have to do that stuff.

1789
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:59,400
You don't have to go that far.

1790
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,400
You can just connect with your community

1791
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,400
or spend an afternoon in the IRC room.

1792
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,400
Like, don't even have to do a Hangout.

1793
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,400
It doesn't have to be super complicated stuff.

1794
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:12,400
And I think the reason why I want to mention Patreon

1795
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:19,400
is it is fundamentally rewarding to be working

1796
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,400
for your audience and not for somebody

1797
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,400
who's sponsoring you or giving you money.

1798
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,400
Now, we still make more money from our sponsors

1799
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,400
than we do from our Patreon,

1800
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:32,400
but if I had one goal in 2016, it would be to flop that now.

1801
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,400
That would be hard.

1802
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:37,400
But having now created shows,

1803
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,400
and this has I think got to be the same thing

1804
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:40,400
when creating software,

1805
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,400
having created shows from the perspective of

1806
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,400
what's the best way to sponsor this?

1807
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:48,400
Like, how do we format this so a sponsor fits in here

1808
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:52,400
versus how do I format this so my patrons like it?

1809
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:53,400
That's totally different.

1810
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:57,400
And the questions I answer and the ideas I come up with

1811
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:59,400
are really different when I'm starting

1812
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,400
from those two different premises.

1813
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,400
And I think it's got to be the same

1814
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:03,400
for people who create software.

1815
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:07,400
And so I think not only does it benefit the creator,

1816
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:10,400
but I think it ultimately greatly benefits the end user

1817
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:14,400
for having that model.

1818
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,400
There you go.

1819
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:16,400
That's my thoughts on it.

1820
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,400
Well said.

1821
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:18,400
Yeah.

1822
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,400
See, I told you 144.

1823
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:21,400
Lucky 144.

1824
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,400
A lot of different paths.

1825
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:24,400
But in the meantime,

1826
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,400
Creator Project is still seeking funding on their Kickstarter.

1827
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:28,400
Check them out.

1828
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,400
It would be really nice to see them.

1829
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:31,400
I mean, if this is how they're choosing to do it,

1830
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:33,400
it would be really nice to see them be successful

1831
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:36,400
because we have more and more these days,

1832
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,400
sort of these iconic open source applications

1833
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:42,400
that are absolutely competitive with closed source solutions

1834
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,400
or as competitive as they need to be.

1835
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:44,400
They deserve our support.

1836
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:45,400
And they do.

1837
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:46,400
This is one of them.

1838
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,400
And if you have the money to spare,

1839
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:50,400
hey, look, they just gained another one.

1840
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:51,400
If you have the money to spare, check them out.

1841
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:53,400
We'll have a link in the show notes.

1842
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,400
Or just go search for Creator 2016 on the Kickstarter.

1843
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,400
I was going to have Mr. Westra talk about it

1844
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:01,400
because he does commissioned artwork and stuff

1845
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:03,400
and I'm pretty sure he uses Corita.

1846
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,400
That's awesome.

1847
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,400
All right, Mumble Room,

1848
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,400
this is your last chance before we go.

1849
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,400
I secretly use Arch Linux.

1850
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:12,400
Oh, okay, great.

1851
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,400
Well, there was the input from Popey.

1852
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:14,400
No one asked.

1853
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,400
He just likes to mention it though.

1854
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,400
That does sound like an Arch user.

1855
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:18,400
Yeah.

1856
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:21,400
All right.

1857
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:24,400
Well, that brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1858
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,400
If you want to join us live, go to jplive.tv.

1859
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,400
That's so true.

1860
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:32,400
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for when we do this S live.

1861
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,400
My son said, Dad, why do you say S?

1862
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,400
I say S now in real life.

1863
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,400
You're so polite.

1864
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,400
It's these damn shows.

1865
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:42,400
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash context.

1866
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,400
You mean these D shows.

1867
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,400
Yeah.

1868
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,400
Also, LinuxActionShow.reddit.com for feedback,

1869
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,400
topic ideas, things like that.

1870
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,400
We'd love to have you live

1871
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,400
and join us in our virtual lug next week.

1872
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:52,400
Won't you join us, neighbor?

1873
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,400
See you right back here next Tuesday.

1874
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,400
All right.

1875
01:42:55,400 --> 01:43:22,400
Hit it, everybody.

1876
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:47,400
Man, did you notice how Noah totally blew starting the titles?

1877
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:48,400
That's super embarrassing.

1878
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,400
Why doesn't he do those things?

1879
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,400
I don't know.

1880
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,400
I guess he's probably doing stuff.

1881
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:53,400
Anyways, thank you, Mumble Room.

1882
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,400
Great discussion today.

1883
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,400
Yeah, absolutely.

1884
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:56,400
Oh, hey, look.

1885
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,400
And she says she updated the Patreon.

1886
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,400
Oh, boy.

1887
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,400
I'll check that out.

1888
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:02,400
Oh, what's going on over there?

1889
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,400
Anyways, Mumble Room, I love you.

1890
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:05,400
Thank you for being here.

1891
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:06,400
There we go.

1892
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,400
Look at that.

1893
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:10,400
That is that is fancy looking.

1894
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,400
Somebody say something because we haven't heard you for like five minutes.

1895
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,400
There we go.

1896
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:16,400
Thank you.

1897
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,400
But it's a good show.

1898
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:18,400
Thank you for being here.

1899
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:19,400
Thank you.

1900
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:20,400
Thank you.

1901
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,400
Thank you.

1902
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,400
Now I'm off of it.

1903
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,400
I feel like actually it was actually very good.

1904
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,400
I got it out there.

1905
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,400
I got my concerns on the record.

1906
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,400
Yes.

1907
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:28,400
Mm hmm.

1908
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:29,400
And there's really nothing else to say.

1909
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:30,400
We can move on.

1910
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,400
I really feel like that is the case.

1911
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:32,400
Like there I've said what I need to say.

1912
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:35,400
There's just a lot in the air that needed to be.

1913
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:41,400
Well, I actually what I realized was going on is I have I have been doing more and more

1914
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:47,400
self-censoring lately because I got it in my head from this show that people don't like

1915
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:49,400
it when I complain.

1916
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:52,400
So I have stopped complaining and I got it.

1917
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:56,600
I just I have been observing things about different projects and different things and

1918
01:44:56,600 --> 01:45:01,640
I've just haven't been voicing my concerns because people don't like it when Chris complains.

1919
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:05,280
So I stopped complaining and we had a whole bunch of happy shows and everybody's great

1920
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,280
and everything.

1921
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:07,280
But then, you know what?

1922
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:10,720
Turns out, no, I feel a little righteous because I think I'm right about this and I do want

1923
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:11,940
to talk about it.

1924
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:15,360
And so I think I just crossed that line.

1925
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:18,680
And now the problem is the floodgates open and now I'm want to complain about.

1926
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:19,880
Let's see how far we go.

1927
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:23,520
I want to complain about Anaconda being crap and getting screwed up every single damn release.

1928
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:26,040
I want to complain about Unity looking like it's last year's game.

1929
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:28,800
I want to complain about every single thing.

1930
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:34,960
Yeah, that's all content, baby.

1931
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,240
That's what happens when I hold it in.

1932
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:38,440
I hold it in because nobody likes it.

1933
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:39,520
Nobody wants grumpy Chris.

1934
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:40,520
Well, guess what?

1935
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:41,520
Now?

1936
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:42,520
Now?

1937
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,520
Now?

1938
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:44,520
Guess what?

1939
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:45,520
Are you saying everybody hates Chris?

1940
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:46,520
No.

1941
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:53,000
The problem is I think what it is is a conspiracy by the lawn maintenance community.

1942
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,960
I'm having the worst luck during the weekdays.

1943
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,120
I really am.

1944
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:59,120
It's actually making me think about like, well, there's two options.

1945
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:03,560
Is either I get that window taken out and that wall re-insulated, which seems crazy,

1946
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:04,560
or we move.

1947
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:05,560
Right.

1948
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:12,000
And the window's nice in the summer when it's, you know.

1949
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
I just don't know.

1950
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:19,160
Like, how many weeks in a row am I going to sit here and bitch about the lawn mower?

1951
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:24,320
And here's what's really sort of alarming about it, and this is really what gets me,

1952
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:30,040
is I could make this mistake again because if I came here and looked at the amount of

1953
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:36,160
yard here, I would go, oh, they'll do this once a month, and they'll be here for two,

1954
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:39,600
three hours, and they'll be done, and the whole place will be done.

1955
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,600
I would never have thought it would be three days a week every week because there's just

1956
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,840
literally, there's no yard here.

1957
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:46,840
No, there's really not.

1958
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:47,840
There's like nothing.

1959
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:48,840
Yeah.

1960
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:55,000
Well, I did kind of shout during TechSnap last week, and I think the guy heard me.

1961
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Oh, snap.

1962
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,720
TechSnap, that is.

1963
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:02,120
And you can hear it, you can hear it just a little bit, but you have to be listening

1964
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:04,840
because you only hear it while my face is making noise.

1965
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:11,440
As soon as my face stops making noise, our system cuts it out.

1966
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,480
So that's why you're not hearing it.

1967
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:17,360
So here's the problem, is I hear it all the time.

1968
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,760
I constantly hear it, and so it distracts me, and I'm...

1969
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,720
And then Rekai will edit the show, and then he'll play it for Chris, and Chris will hear

1970
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:23,720
it again.

1971
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:24,720
Yes, I do.

1972
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:25,720
He'll criticize Rekai on barely.

1973
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:26,720
I do.

1974
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,160
I do listen to the shows on playback, and I'm like, fuck, you can't hear it.

1975
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:32,760
The chat room says you can't hear it, I can sherry shit hear it.

1976
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:33,760
That actually happens.

1977
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,520
Oh, it's so frustrating.

1978
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:41,440
If you guys look in here, if you look, you can barely see up in the corner of that shot,

1979
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,720
the ceiling is even insulated.

1980
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:45,440
Up there, there is sound insulation.

1981
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,200
We are surrounded in sound insulation.

1982
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,920
All of the walls have that on it, all of it.

1983
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:58,280
And still yet, the weaponized lawn equipment is what it is, and it is the bane.

1984
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:00,560
I mean, boy, I can really hear that.

1985
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,520
No regard for anyone else's sound space.

1986
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:04,520
I think noise.

1987
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:05,520
Yeah, go ahead.

1988
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,000
Yeah, it might be cheaper to just buy your neighbor the electric lawnmower.

1989
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,520
Yeah, I'm never convinced.

1990
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:14,680
Here's what it is, too, right?

1991
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:17,600
It's a couple of things.

1992
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,360
It's the yard, the grounds, I should say, the grounds.

1993
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:27,240
And when I say grounds, I mean there are patches of greenish, mostly brown grass between cement,

1994
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:29,320
and then there are people's yards.

1995
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:34,000
And when I say yard, I mean something that's about seven by seven, maybe seven by six.

1996
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,560
I mean, they're very small yards, like not even large enough to have a gazebo in it.

1997
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:40,560
They're small yards.

1998
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,200
They're very small yards.

1999
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:46,820
And so what you have is a collection of tiny, small public shared spaces, which are maintained

2000
01:48:46,820 --> 01:48:53,760
by aggressive contractors who milk this little housing community for everything.

2001
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:59,040
And then you have these very strictly enforced yard rules, so that way everybody's tiny brown

2002
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:05,560
yards are up to standard, or else you get fined $60.

2003
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:09,060
And because nobody's on the same schedule, there's just enough people here taking care

2004
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:13,360
of all of their tiny little brown patches of ugly ground at different times that it

2005
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:16,520
seems to impact all of my shows.

2006
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:19,960
Even on Sundays, or I'm here on the off hours.

2007
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:22,440
I shouldn't get this upset about this, but it's like...

2008
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:25,640
60 bucks, yikes.

2009
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:28,640
You move into a place, and here's the thing, too.

2010
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:32,240
Okay, so just, and then I'm done, and this is why it upsets me, and then I'm done.

2011
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,240
Two things.

2012
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:37,200
I would make this mistake again, because I would evaluate the yard here.

2013
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:38,200
You've learned nothing.

2014
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:40,560
And I look and I go, obviously this doesn't require maintenance.

2015
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:41,840
This is a great way to go.

2016
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,560
One of the reasons we are here, legitimately, is because there's such low yard maintenance.

2017
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:46,560
Right.

2018
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,560
Like, I'm here to podcast.

2019
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:48,560
It's just a studio, exactly.

2020
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,560
Yeah.

2021
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:50,560
Okay.

2022
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:51,560
So I could make the same mistake again.

2023
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:58,040
Number two, though, and I cannot see how I could have foreseen this, I used to live here.

2024
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:04,680
I lived in this house for like years, and this was never a thing.

2025
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:09,280
Then I moved out for like five or six years, and they got new housing authority and all

2026
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:10,280
of that.

2027
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:13,500
Like the entire community got replaced, and now this is how it's been.

2028
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:19,960
But I didn't know that before I came back, but this very house, I lived in it, and then

2029
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:20,960
I rented it out.

2030
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:21,960
Sounds like some Twilight Zone shit, Chris.

2031
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:22,960
For like five or six years.

2032
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:23,960
The whole community replaced.

2033
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:24,960
No, just the management.

2034
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:25,960
Now there's no very noisy.

2035
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:32,040
Like, at the time, not only did I know what the sound was like here, I podcasted here

2036
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,040
before.

2037
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:36,440
So I have recorded shows in this building before, and this was not a problem in the

2038
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:37,440
past.

2039
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:39,120
So I did not ever consider it would be a problem.

2040
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:42,480
You know, you come in, you invest money in a place, you get all the stuff done, you get

2041
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:45,680
the studio set up, and then this.

2042
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:47,680
Oh, man.

2043
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:49,200
You've been betrayed.

2044
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,680
I'm gonna check my blood.

2045
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:53,680
I got the watch on right here, I'm gonna check my heart rate right now to see what my heart

2046
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:56,160
rate is before, then we're gonna start the show.

2047
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:59,160
Either Chris is going to the hospital or we're starting the show.

2048
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:00,160
We don't know which.

2049
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:01,160
It's difficult.

2050
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:02,160
No way to tell.

2051
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,160
It's difficult.

2052
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:07,160
Like, I can't, if I would, what I would like to be able to do, Wes, is I'd like to be able

2053
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:10,500
to go back in time and go, this is where I made the mistake.

2054
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:13,480
And if dummy Chris hadn't just done this dumb thing, he wouldn't be in this problem.

2055
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:14,480
He would be in this situation now.

2056
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,120
Oh, dummy Chris causes you all kinds of problems.

2057
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:19,880
I know, past Chris is usually a D-bag, and I can figure, oh, that's where he screwed

2058
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:20,880
up.

2059
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,720
Like, I, well, it says I'm only 69 beats per minute, I don't know if that, how could that

2060
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,720
possibly be?

2061
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,920
I'm gonna tighten this thing up one more notch.

2062
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,760
I'll tell you what, Wes, I'll tell you what.

2063
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:49,360
All right, well, that's clearly not high enough, someone say something Chris hates.

2064
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:53,240
That was really good, Wes, that's funny.
