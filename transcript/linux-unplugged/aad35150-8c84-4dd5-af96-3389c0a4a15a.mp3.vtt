This is Linux Unplugged Episode 9 for October 8th, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.000
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, the weekly Linux podcast that never shuts down,

00:41.000 --> 00:46.200
despite what those slackers in Washington are up to. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey Matt,

00:46.200 --> 00:52.880
welcome to Episode 9, buddy. Thanks for having me. Nine weeks. Ten's cool, man, ten's cool,

00:52.880 --> 00:57.400
but nine, that's like hipster cool, right? Exactly. Nine weeks in a row is pretty cool,

00:57.400 --> 01:01.560
and we've gotten a ton of good feedback on the show. People are loving it. I'm really excited.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.680
I think we're gonna have a good discussion today because there's been something, it's been on my

01:05.680 --> 01:11.920
mind, Matt, and I can't shake it. It's Ubuntu 13.10. Oh my. Our review's coming up this Sunday on the

01:11.920 --> 01:17.480
Linux Action Show, and it's a big event. It's a big event, and I gotta tell you, I've been struggling

01:17.480 --> 01:21.600
this week, so I want to talk a little bit about a couple of concepts I'm kicking around that after

01:21.600 --> 01:26.280
we kind of, I don't know, maybe kind of talk through them, it'll help me inform my review

01:26.280 --> 01:29.680
for this Sunday. I think I'll be ready after this week's episode. I'm just trying to wrap my brain

01:29.680 --> 01:35.920
around a few things. Mainly, Ubuntu 13.10 looks almost certainly to be the most boring Ubuntu

01:35.920 --> 01:40.720
release we've ever seen. We've gotten too comfortable, you know? I wonder if maybe Ubuntu

01:40.720 --> 01:46.120
is becoming the Windows XP of Linux, but not in the insecure way. Not in the insecure way. I'll

01:46.120 --> 01:50.720
explain what I mean if it's the XP of Linux, and maybe that's not a bad thing. Maybe that's exactly

01:50.720 --> 01:53.880
what the market needs. I think there could be an argument for that, too, and we'll bring in the

01:53.880 --> 01:56.960
mumble room. We'll kick it around and get their opinions, too, because I know we've got some

01:56.960 --> 02:01.920
Ubuntu users in there and some Ubuntu converts. Oh, yes. Like that. You know, this morning I was

02:01.920 --> 02:06.480
out getting meat, Matt. You were out getting meat? Okay. Yeah, I went out and went to the local

02:06.480 --> 02:10.000
Savannah Meats, got a little meat. I don't actually get my bacon there too often, but,

02:10.000 --> 02:17.840
so, you know, I took my son, and my son Dylan is four years old, and we walked in there, and it was

02:17.840 --> 02:21.080
kind of early, so they were still kind of setting up in the morning. I wanted to, I like to get in

02:21.080 --> 02:24.600
there early, because then all of the crew is in a good mood. Oh, sure. You see, when you go to

02:24.600 --> 02:28.120
Savannah Meats in the afternoon, sometimes they're not in good moods. I guess maybe it's something

02:28.120 --> 02:31.920
to do with cutting up animals all day, and then, you know, dealing with pain in the butt customers.

02:31.920 --> 02:38.120
I'm in a cave, man. Yeah, exactly. So, we get there, and they have on big hooks, and with,

02:38.120 --> 02:42.480
like, a chain conveyor belt system in their ceiling, they're moving, you know, slaughtered

02:42.480 --> 02:47.080
cows through the back, and my four-year-old son just, like, sees them. It's the first time he's

02:47.080 --> 02:50.200
ever seen anything like that. I'm sure that's quite a shock. I wasn't sure, like, you know,

02:50.200 --> 02:53.320
is he gonna, like, get really grossed out, you know, what's gonna happen, but he was more,

02:53.320 --> 02:56.600
he was fascinated. He's like, you know, are those cows? He asked me, and I just kind of started

02:56.600 --> 03:00.120
explaining it to him, and the lady behind the counter hears me explaining it to him. She's like,

03:00.120 --> 03:04.240
would you like to go see our, our, our, she calls me, she said, would you like to go see the cows?

03:04.240 --> 03:08.840
I'm thinking, these are live cows, right? I'm thinking, these are cows. Like a Dexter rerun.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.600
Like, maybe somebody just dropped off, like, a shipment of live cows, and, like,

03:11.600 --> 03:15.800
to have the meat super fresh or something, you know? So, I'm like, okay, let's go look at cows.

03:15.800 --> 03:20.280
Yeah, sure. DIY. So, I hold Dylan by his hand, and she brings us back into the cutter, cut place,

03:20.280 --> 03:25.080
where they're, you know, cutting up the dead animals, and she opens up the huge freezer.

03:25.080 --> 03:29.160
So, come on in. I'm like, well, this is not looking good. These probably aren't alive,

03:29.160 --> 03:33.800
and then I'm thinking, are these, you know, we get in there, and it's just this huge room full of

03:33.800 --> 03:39.240
hanging skinned cows. It was disgusting, but he thought it was fascinating. He thought it was

03:39.240 --> 03:42.920
so cool, and then, like, he totally was, he totally connected, like, when I bought, like,

03:42.920 --> 03:46.120
some wrapped meat, you know, to butcher's paper. He's like, oh, that's from the cow. I was like,

03:46.120 --> 03:48.440
oh, well, he doesn't seem to be affected by it, but I was.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Well, here's what I think's interesting, and I think this translates into the Linux space as

03:53.000 --> 03:58.120
well, is that if you walk into a situation or an operating system without a preconceived notion,

03:58.120 --> 04:01.160
a lot of times, the reaction might surprise the people around you.

04:01.160 --> 04:04.600
You know, it's so interesting you say that, because we're going to talk,

04:04.600 --> 04:06.920
we're going to get a little more into this Ubuntu thing, and, of course,

04:06.920 --> 04:09.960
Unity is one of the first topics that comes up when you talk about Ubuntu,

04:09.960 --> 04:14.200
and I think there's so many strong, polarizing opinions. It's such a polarizing topic,

04:15.080 --> 04:20.200
and there has been a couple circumstances in my personal, you know, experience, but also,

04:20.200 --> 04:23.960
I was talking with Michael Domic from Coder Radio. He switched a couple people on his team

04:24.520 --> 04:32.360
over to Ubuntu this week, and their immediate response was, like, delight and fascination.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.960
Like, they didn't have any of the baggage of, well, Unity used to be like this, and then they

04:35.960 --> 04:40.280
broke it. Like, none of that was there, right? And so they were just enjoying it, which is,

04:40.280 --> 04:43.720
which was an interesting thing, and so I want to talk about that a little bit, but I thought first

04:43.720 --> 04:48.840
we should get into some follow-up from last week's show. I like to, we have a mail sack towards the

04:48.840 --> 04:52.280
end, but I like to do a little follow-up just to kind of keep the thread of continuity between

04:52.280 --> 04:56.360
episodes, and our first plan, thank you, sir, our first one came in from Jameson.

04:56.360 --> 05:00.200
All right. Now, last week, I said that I was managing my photos by using G+, because they

05:00.200 --> 05:05.080
have a really good photo management system where you just take the picture in the G+,

05:05.080 --> 05:10.600
app, uploads them to Google+, privately, and then Google+, like, has face detection. They

05:10.600 --> 05:14.760
auto-enhance pictures. They figure out which ones are in the best focus and sort of highlight them.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.880
Like, there's a whole bunch of, there's a whole array of features that Google+, has. It's really

05:17.880 --> 05:23.880
nice. Now, Jameson didn't have a replacement for all of that kind of stuff, but he did say,

05:23.880 --> 05:28.600
I'm not sure about the management capabilities of G+, but the own cloud Android client does

05:28.600 --> 05:33.160
auto-upload, and you can have it go up to own cloud, then you can view the library,

05:33.160 --> 05:37.400
the gallery, on your own cloud installation. He says he's completely replaced using Dropbox doing

05:37.400 --> 05:41.720
that. That's interesting. You know, the more I read about stuff like this, and people that are

05:41.720 --> 05:46.600
kind of migrating to that, the more I think, what types of own cloud companies and services are out

05:46.600 --> 05:51.080
there providing services for people that just want that experience, but maybe in a self-contained,

05:51.080 --> 05:55.320
pre-ready-to-go box. See, this is, I was trying to talk Alan into, now he's just too busy,

05:55.320 --> 05:58.920
so I totally understand why he hasn't done it, but I was telling Alan, like, this could be a

05:58.920 --> 06:03.560
business for scale engine. Exactly. That's what I was thinking. You toss up a VM, or in his case,

06:03.560 --> 06:10.440
a jail, of an own cloud instance, because there are downsides to having it on your own connection,

06:10.440 --> 06:14.360
especially for people who have more restrictive ISPs, bandwidth caps, you know, all the dynamic

06:14.360 --> 06:18.600
IP, all that kind of stuff. That's an excellent point, yes. I really think there could be somebody

06:18.600 --> 06:23.400
who's just like, here, we'll just roll you an own cloud instance. We'll update the security patches

06:23.400 --> 06:27.480
for you, we'll deploy it for you, we'll give you a login, and then you own it. If only there were

06:27.480 --> 06:32.440
more Linux and BSD administrators out there, right? Only me, Matt. We need more in this world.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.360
All right. Well, Pedro writes in on a little bit of the KDE topic. He says,

06:36.360 --> 06:39.480
hi, Chris and Matt. I really love the recent shows for both last and unplugged.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.720
Finding in a good alternatives to cloud-based services is something I think many of us will

06:43.720 --> 06:48.600
find very important these days. Now, here's, I feel like there should be a but here. In the last

06:48.600 --> 06:53.720
show, you said that your KDE config broke again, but you are moving, and you are moving to know.

06:53.720 --> 07:00.600
I've been very happy KDE Plasma user for some months, and won't desktop environment hop again

07:00.600 --> 07:04.760
in the near future. But what you said about the GNOME guys integrating these cool Linux-specific

07:04.760 --> 07:09.400
technologies got me thinking about how KDE is going to approach these changes. They are also

07:09.400 --> 07:13.480
going to have some pretty significant changes soon with Framework 5 and Plasma Workspaces 2,

07:14.360 --> 07:19.080
which sound very exciting. I was wondering if you could get somebody from the KDE camp,

07:19.080 --> 07:25.080
like Aaron or Joss, on the show to discuss it with them, and also the Wayland transition,

07:25.080 --> 07:31.240
maybe even your recent config troubles, ugly defaults, etc. Good luck and keep up the big

07:31.240 --> 07:39.800
shows, Pedro. I kind of like that idea. One thing I really would love to get the community's help on

07:39.800 --> 07:46.440
is if anybody out there has experience with, I don't know, with radio or podcast where they have

07:46.440 --> 07:53.080
lined up interviews with folks, we'd love to talk. Certainly. I think Matt and I have great ideas,

07:53.080 --> 07:57.080
but there's just a lot of things we have to do during the week, and interviews just take up a

07:57.080 --> 08:01.400
little bit extra time to line up, and I would love to have them much more frequently on the Linux

08:01.400 --> 08:04.040
Action Show. So if anybody out there has some work with that, shoot me an email,

08:04.040 --> 08:08.360
chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com, and we'll chat some more. Maybe there's an arrangement we can

08:08.360 --> 08:12.680
work out, maybe a few Bitcoins or even a few PayPal dollars we can throw your way if you can

08:12.680 --> 08:18.200
help line up a series of great interviews. And some of them, like Aaron, I'm sure we could probably

08:18.200 --> 08:21.240
just ping Aaron and just figure out a time that works for him and bring him on, but there's a

08:21.240 --> 08:26.200
whole array of folks that I'd love to have on the Linux Action Show, and I'd love to have more

08:26.200 --> 08:30.680
interviews on that show. Well, and I definitely would echo the whole timing scheme of it is that

08:30.680 --> 08:33.960
I've been trying to track down a couple of people, and it's just trying to make sure that we're on

08:33.960 --> 08:37.880
the same page as far as date and time and whether that works and whether they have things going on.

08:37.880 --> 08:43.960
Yeah, it definitely could use some help there. Yeah, you know, it's one of those things where

08:43.960 --> 08:48.280
it's hard to, there's always ways to record it when we're not like doing a regular show,

08:48.280 --> 08:52.200
which is with seven shows now it's hard to find a time when we're not doing another show,

08:52.200 --> 08:57.160
but that's always possible. It'd be great whenever we can. Also, we could do things where people just

08:57.160 --> 09:02.120
join us on mumble here during this show. You know, they just come on and chat with us. Which is cool.

09:02.120 --> 09:08.360
Yeah, like for example, if you just had a new distro release or if you had something come out,

09:08.360 --> 09:10.840
come on in here and tell us about it. We're not going to yell at you for coming on and

09:10.840 --> 09:14.360
tell us about the cool open source software you're working on. Join our mumble server,

09:14.360 --> 09:18.280
you know, join our mumble server. In fact, if somebody would paste the mumble server info into

09:18.280 --> 09:23.000
the chat room right now, that'd be helpful. All right, so last bit of follow up before we

09:23.000 --> 09:26.040
move into the meat, as it were, I guess the main course.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.880
Main course. Yeah, I say main course sounds good. Brandon writes in, he says,

09:29.880 --> 09:32.920
Hi, Chris and Matt, I wanted to share some thoughts about the comments you guys had about

09:32.920 --> 09:35.880
these kids these days who don't understand what's going on behind the screen. Now,

09:35.880 --> 09:39.720
we got a lot of feedback about this. So we got one more in the mail sack, but this was a popular

09:39.720 --> 09:44.200
topic. He says, I'm not denying it. You're totally right about it. I just don't necessarily see it as

09:44.200 --> 09:48.280
a horrible thing. Now, remember what we said is these kids today, the damn kids on our lawn,

09:48.280 --> 09:51.560
didn't know how it works behind the touchscreen. Like they were touching the screens and clicking

09:51.560 --> 09:55.320
the mice, but they had no idea what any of the context behind it. So don't get me wrong,

09:55.320 --> 09:58.840
we obviously need some younger kids to get into computers to keep things going along,

09:58.840 --> 10:04.120
keep going long term. But there isn't any need for every kid to get into it. Computers these days are

10:04.120 --> 10:07.640
going through the same cycles that all big new technologies in history have over time.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.760
For example, when ancient civilizations first discovered how to create metal items in the

10:12.760 --> 10:18.200
bronze age, they had far more blacksmiths than latter iron age civilizations. For a lot of

10:18.200 --> 10:22.520
reasons, it was a new amazing technology that was making revolutionary changes in their lives. And

10:22.520 --> 10:27.000
everyone wanted to replace their stone tools with metal ones. In some ancient cultures,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.800
it was a rite of passage for boys to create their own metal weapons.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.960
Okay. All right. Okay. I see where he's going. That's actually kind of cool to know.

10:33.960 --> 10:39.080
Yeah. And it also, you know, remember my argument was, is this is more important than your average

10:40.200 --> 10:43.320
passing technology because it's so integrated in all of our lives. Well, you know, what's

10:43.320 --> 10:46.200
our metals and plastics and things like that. This is true. This is true.

10:47.320 --> 10:53.400
He goes on to say, we live in a very specialized world. Things have grown so advanced and complex

10:53.400 --> 10:56.840
that for everyone to understand how everything they use in their daily life works would be

10:56.840 --> 11:00.920
impossible. For example, sure, you may know how your computer works, but you know how much,

11:00.920 --> 11:06.680
do you know much about how your car or your home air conditioner or your own body work for that

11:06.680 --> 11:10.760
matter? Any of the other dozens of things you use every single day. Sure, these kinds, sure,

11:10.760 --> 11:14.680
these kids today might not know what's going on behind their computer screens, but they are going

11:14.680 --> 11:19.160
to grow up and learn all kinds of things that you don't know. One of these kids may grow up to become

11:19.160 --> 11:23.480
a general contractor. He won't know how to build a website for his business. So he'll hire someone

11:23.480 --> 11:28.200
that does. In turn, someone that can build a website may hire him to add a deck to the back

11:28.200 --> 11:33.640
of their house. That's just how modern society works. Thanks, Brandon. I would expand on that

11:33.640 --> 11:36.680
with the following. First of all, I totally hear what he's saying as far as, you know,

11:36.680 --> 11:39.640
the kids obviously are going to go into their own specialty and find their own way. And I think

11:39.640 --> 11:43.080
that's great, but I think it's important to realize myself is a good example of this.

11:43.880 --> 11:48.040
I have worked as a machine operator. I can lay carpet. I can do vinyl. I know how to

11:48.040 --> 11:52.040
change my oil and change my tires. I'm not great at it, but I can do it. And I also know a lot of

11:52.040 --> 11:57.160
this Linux-y stuff that I'm always talking about. And I can also do some minor electrical work as

11:57.160 --> 12:01.720
well. So I've tried to widen my range a little bit, and I think it wouldn't kill kids to perhaps

12:01.720 --> 12:06.520
consider doing the same thing, both in tech and other areas as well, maybe a little carpentry,

12:06.520 --> 12:11.000
maybe a little this, little hands-on stuff, you know, wouldn't kill them. Most kids today can't

12:11.000 --> 12:16.840
do squat. They can watch, you know, SpongeBob and text on their phone. That's been my experience.

12:16.840 --> 12:20.920
I'm living with one right now, and it's driving me nuts. So it's kind of a – it's frustrating

12:20.920 --> 12:23.800
because I don't see a lot of that – boy, you know –

12:23.800 --> 12:25.240
Passion or desire to learn.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.800
Yeah, a lot of the passion and the desire just seems to be like vacuum

12:27.800 --> 12:28.680
packed right out of the room.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.600
Muhtar Django in our chat room says,

12:31.480 --> 12:36.600
if you don't know how it works, you don't own it. It's interesting. I could see that. I agree

12:36.600 --> 12:41.320
with you. I think there's always – I always strive to – so like the examples you cited,

12:41.320 --> 12:45.400
like I have a pretty good idea how I would change the oil on my truck. I just don't ever want to do

12:45.400 --> 12:45.720
it.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.440
Oh, same here. No, I assume – I'll pay someone else to do it.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.760
I do know how my air conditioner works. And I also try to, you know, very closely pay

12:52.760 --> 12:55.960
attention to how my body works, even though I suck at it quite badly. It's a learning process.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.080
Yeah, I just don't care.

12:58.600 --> 13:03.560
I know what it has to say. I just don't want to listen. But I think at the same time,

13:04.200 --> 13:07.560
I still want to make the argument, although maybe just less emphatically,

13:08.120 --> 13:13.160
that computers represent a new kind of technology. Because, you see, what I see happening more so

13:13.160 --> 13:18.200
than just not knowing how they work is they're being perverted into consumption driving machines,

13:18.200 --> 13:24.120
right? All of these apps that want you to buy things and Amazon mobile apps and this and that,

13:24.120 --> 13:29.880
they're consumption machines. But they can also be information machines and tools and learning

13:29.880 --> 13:34.360
and empowerment machines, right? I mean, the greatest thing about an Android device is that

13:34.360 --> 13:38.920
it can give you Wikipedia and Google at your fingertips anywhere in the world. And at the

13:38.920 --> 13:42.840
same time, it can also be used to sell you crap you don't need, track you, and all these kinds of

13:42.840 --> 13:50.120
things. And I just I fear that because they are so capable of a broad range of either benefits

13:50.120 --> 13:54.920
or abuses, it becomes incumbent upon the person to have a better understanding so that way they're

13:54.920 --> 13:59.560
not being taken advantage of. It just seems like there's more possibility for abuse.

14:00.440 --> 14:04.440
And I think also, again, kind of bouncing off of that a little bit. The only way I see

14:04.440 --> 14:09.960
overcoming this is we come up with apps that essentially make Wikipedia some anime thing

14:09.960 --> 14:13.880
that's like lots of flashing and lots of stuff going on. I mean, like turn everything into a-

14:13.880 --> 14:15.080
Like a 3D game.

14:15.080 --> 14:18.760
A 3D game, multiplayer, who can change the oil the fastest, the best?

14:18.760 --> 14:21.240
No, what you need is Wikipedia, you can text, right?

14:21.240 --> 14:25.640
Oh yeah. I just changed my oil. It's like Instagram, your oil change. I mean, I don't

14:25.640 --> 14:28.840
know. I mean, I've got to figure out a way to like sex this up for the kids so they're more

14:28.840 --> 14:30.040
interested, I guess. I don't know.

14:30.040 --> 14:35.720
I think we'll find, I don't know, something in me tells me we might find an equilibrium here

14:35.720 --> 14:40.680
somewhere. The only thing is we're also moving down to a period where it's like my- So I

14:40.680 --> 14:43.400
mentioned I have two vehicles. I mentioned I think I could change the oil in my truck.

14:43.960 --> 14:47.160
I don't think I could change the oil in my car because when I open the hood of my car,

14:47.160 --> 14:49.000
it's got a plastic covering over the whole damn thing.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.040
No kidding, right?

14:50.040 --> 14:53.160
That's what the smartphone and the tablet is now. It's that same thing.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.200
I think you're exactly it. Yep. That's the plastic cover. And it's like working on cars.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.720
It's the same thing. I'm not a- My brother's more of a mechanic than I am, but I think that

15:00.280 --> 15:04.280
older cars have always been considered easier versus the newer cars, which have all the computer

15:04.280 --> 15:08.760
crap and all that stuff put into it that takes special certifications and whatnot. Yeah, I think

15:08.760 --> 15:12.600
that definitely presents a challenge, but I think just finding, learning how various things work and

15:12.600 --> 15:15.800
finding a way to make that interesting to kids because you are competing with those media

15:15.800 --> 15:20.680
consumption boxes. How do you- Trying to present it outside of that media consumption box is not

15:20.680 --> 15:24.840
going to happen. I think we've established that. My 16-year-old nephew is going to definitely

15:24.840 --> 15:27.960
testify to that. I've been dealing with that unbelievably because every time I turn around,

15:27.960 --> 15:29.480
he's got his face buried in his phone.

15:29.480 --> 15:34.680
I think as people learn that can be tools to express an opinion or a view or as they become

15:34.680 --> 15:41.720
more communication devices, some of that might change. The flip side of this is that that means

15:41.720 --> 15:46.040
the remaining people who take the time and the trouble and jump through the hoops to educate

15:46.040 --> 15:52.520
themselves. And let's not even talk about today. Let's talk about when my kid is in his 30s,

15:52.520 --> 15:56.360
what's that going to be like? What's the difference going to be like? And if he goes

15:56.360 --> 16:01.160
through all of the hoops to become an expert in these things, he could potentially be a niche

16:01.160 --> 16:07.720
skill. And maybe that means he's got a well-paying gig, that kind of thing. So there's potentially

16:07.720 --> 16:08.600
positives to this too.

16:08.600 --> 16:13.880
Absolutely. I definitely think that centralizing your skill set is definitely it. But I also like

16:13.880 --> 16:18.520
the idea of just knowing how to pull a toilet and replace it. I think that's mandatory.

16:18.520 --> 16:28.040
And like Brandon says, when we live in a society where these monkeys without hair

16:28.040 --> 16:33.560
now have 3000 pound vehicles that can go 80 miles per hour, we have all of these things that were

16:33.560 --> 16:39.240
never originally envisioned by evolution. You really can't expect us to keep track of everything.

16:39.240 --> 16:43.720
It's just not in our nature. So you do need technology to sort of relieve the burden

16:43.720 --> 16:46.280
a little bit. So I don't want to sit here and say,

16:46.280 --> 16:50.440
you are worthless if you don't know how this stuff works. I just want to say you need to be aware of

16:50.440 --> 16:53.960
what you could be getting taken advantage of. You need to be aware of the downsides.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.160
Absolutely. How to spot a contractor coming in and saying he's going to give you a quote and

16:57.160 --> 17:01.400
how to call bullshit on it. How to actually know when he's pulling one over your eyes. Just little

17:01.400 --> 17:05.480
things that around the house. Doesn't have to be anything great or extravagant. Even just house

17:05.480 --> 17:08.200
maintenance stuff, like you said with the air conditioner. Little things like that can save

17:08.200 --> 17:08.760
you a lot of heartache.

17:08.760 --> 17:14.600
And I'm going to get controversial here, but I say we have this play out in the medical industry,

17:14.600 --> 17:19.240
right? People like Brandon said, have no idea how their bodies work. They have no idea what role

17:19.240 --> 17:23.640
nutrition plays. They have no idea how to properly take care of themselves. So they go to the doctor

17:23.640 --> 17:27.880
in the costume, you know, the white coat costume that he wears, where he makes a bunch of money

17:27.880 --> 17:31.880
and all of the office ladies that he works with are completely scared of him. And then he tells

17:31.880 --> 17:35.640
you what to do and you say, okay, thank you, master. And you go home and you do it because

17:35.640 --> 17:40.120
you've never educated yourself about health. Right? Exactly. This is true. I just don't want

17:40.120 --> 17:42.520
that to happen in computers, but it already has, hasn't it?

17:42.520 --> 17:45.640
It has happened to computers. And I think, you know, coming back full circle, back into the

17:45.640 --> 17:50.200
whole technology side of things is that I think that's what Linux provides us with an opportunity

17:50.200 --> 17:55.320
to have. It allows us to see cause and effect. It allows us to see how our actions can actually

17:55.320 --> 18:00.840
generate an actual reaction that we can visualize, experience and enjoy.

18:00.840 --> 18:06.840
It allows you to go as deep as you want, right? You can grab Ubuntu, burn it to a disk or a USB

18:06.840 --> 18:11.800
drive and install it and maybe go six months before you have to open up the terminal, right?

18:11.800 --> 18:16.680
Or you can do Linux from scratch. Like you've got that whole range or, you know, you can be an end

18:16.680 --> 18:22.600
user or you can create code and develop for it. And actually, you know, so it, it does, again,

18:22.600 --> 18:25.800
I think this is going to be another huge advantage to Linux down the road is.

18:25.800 --> 18:26.440
I think so.

18:26.440 --> 18:32.200
As these, as, as we get mobilized on all of the commercial platforms and everything goes to the

18:32.200 --> 18:36.600
cloud, there's still going to be Linux. And if you want to just learn how something works from top

18:36.600 --> 18:41.480
to bottom, it's like the track you're going to get on, you're not going to go to college and take a

18:41.480 --> 18:45.640
Windows nine course on Metro, right? Cause that's not going to teach you any of the fundamentals.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.280
You're going to go to a class and you're going to, they're going to be using Linux.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.280
It's just going to become one more use case for Linux.

18:50.840 --> 18:54.680
That's true. And I know Windows admins that are experiencing that now that they're beginning to

18:54.680 --> 18:58.200
find themselves. I, one of them actually had to deal with CentOS here recently. And actually

18:58.200 --> 19:01.560
we talked a little bit about that. And it's interesting that even no matter how hard you try,

19:02.120 --> 19:05.240
even if you're in a Windows world, you're still going to be dealing with it. It's going to happen.

19:05.240 --> 19:09.480
Oh, and more and more so Matt. And we actually get contacts from, you know, a lot of guys,

19:09.480 --> 19:14.040
Hey, I'm a Windows guy. Hey, you know, I need a lot of the, cause you don't want tech snap.

19:14.040 --> 19:17.880
We take a lot of like IT sysadmin questions for people that are trying to solve a problem

19:17.880 --> 19:22.680
with their gig or whatever. And we hear from a lot of people who run Windows shops that are

19:22.680 --> 19:29.000
moving to Linux or moving to BSD because they need X and they need Y. And it's, it seems to

19:29.000 --> 19:33.480
be a trend and ZFS. I mean, this is why I harp on Linux action show and unplug so much about ZFS is

19:33.480 --> 19:38.200
because every week, you know, we get a dozen emails about people switching to BSD because

19:38.200 --> 19:43.800
they want native ZFS support. And I'm not exaggerating at all. It is, I have watched

19:43.800 --> 19:51.160
trends happen as I do these shows and the migration to ZFS and BSD too is real and it's

19:51.160 --> 19:56.360
happening and it's happening in the enterprise too. It's happening at the small and medium

19:56.360 --> 20:01.080
business level too. And it's like the ZFS has these wider range of features that Microsoft

20:01.080 --> 20:04.920
is trying to catch up to in Server 2012. And they have some good stuff in Server 2012,

20:04.920 --> 20:08.840
but at the end of the day, it's still NTFS and it's still their black magic and people get

20:08.840 --> 20:13.080
uncomfortable with that. That's true. That's true. But now here's the question I would ask you,

20:13.080 --> 20:17.320
would you gauge this as more of an IT driven thing or is this just a bunch of excited home users?

20:17.320 --> 20:24.760
You know what it is, is that, no, if anything, it's more on the IT side because we actually,

20:24.760 --> 20:32.120
we talked about this in last week's TechSnap is ZFS was created really with enterprise in mind.

20:32.120 --> 20:36.680
Like if you want to add a drive, you want to add some space to an array in ZFS in a pool,

20:37.960 --> 20:41.880
you're in two drives minimum before you even are comfortably expanding that array. And really,

20:41.880 --> 20:46.680
you should probably do three or five drives at a time. So I mean, it's a serious production

20:47.240 --> 20:54.440
system and that's why it allows you to get the features and abilities of these massive

20:54.440 --> 21:03.800
$50,000, $60,000, $70,000 EMC arrays on your own fiber attached storage that's hanging off the back

21:03.800 --> 21:09.480
of a free BSD box. So it's allowing for this huge set of advantages without all that overhead of

21:09.480 --> 21:14.440
that proprietary enclosure and software. That sounds real. Just from your description,

21:14.440 --> 21:18.120
that's quite appealing. I can definitely see why IT would be jumping all over that.

21:18.120 --> 21:22.280
Yeah. Yeah. And it's just logical. It's like you would be stupid not to.

21:22.280 --> 21:27.800
It's another trend away from sort of the, even in big window shops, because that's where our

21:27.800 --> 21:30.440
emails are coming from too, is guys that, well, we're windows here, we're windows here,

21:30.440 --> 21:34.120
but we're doing a ZFS array here for our storage. How do we integrate these two things?

21:34.120 --> 21:35.560
Oh, wow. Wow.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.240
It's going to be a crazy world.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.440
It's going to be something to watch, I think, in 14. I really do.

21:40.440 --> 21:45.000
All right, Matt. Well, before we jump into our main topic du jour this week, I want to thank

21:45.800 --> 21:49.880
our sponsor. That is Ting.com. And Ting is mobile. It makes sense. Now,

21:49.880 --> 21:54.680
Ting is an MVNO of the Nationwide Sprint Network. So that means if you've got good sprint coverage,

21:54.680 --> 21:58.920
you're going to get great Ting service in your area. And for me, now I'm lucky. I don't know

21:58.920 --> 22:05.400
where this is for everybody, but in my neck of the woods, I get LTE, 3G, and YMAC. So I have like

22:05.400 --> 22:10.040
the pick of the spectrum for myself. And the thing that's beautiful about that is I only pay

22:10.040 --> 22:13.960
for what I use. So I don't have to get into these complicated data programs. I don't have to get

22:13.960 --> 22:18.440
into these complicated contracts. It's no contracts, no early termination, no bundling

22:18.440 --> 22:22.840
or ride-along services. You just pay for what you use at the end of the month. However, minutes,

22:22.840 --> 22:27.800
megabytes, and messages, it all gets added into a bucket. And then pow, Bob's your uncle. That's

22:27.800 --> 22:32.360
what you end up paying. The average Ting bill is like $21. I think I've been using some Waze

22:32.360 --> 22:36.760
this month. Oh, yeah. Good stuff. I think mine's like 18 bucks right now.

22:36.760 --> 22:42.760
Yeah. Yeah. That's not bad. No, for the amount of data. Plus, it's one of those things where like,

22:42.760 --> 22:46.200
oh, I left my Wi-Fi off for a day. Well, no big deal. It's not really a big deal. I don't have to

22:46.200 --> 22:50.280
worry about it. And with no add-on charges, you get voicemail, caller ID, tethering, hotspot,

22:50.280 --> 22:53.640
three-way calling, call forwarding, and other features that are all just part of the service.

22:53.640 --> 22:58.280
You don't have to have add-on. No mysterious line items on your bill. It's really simple billing.

22:58.280 --> 23:03.880
Fantastic website. Makes it crazy easy to manage. Unlimited devices on one plan. Yeah, go ahead.

23:03.880 --> 23:08.200
Well, I was going to say what's cool is with mine, I oftentimes forget whether I'm on Wi-Fi or I'm

23:08.200 --> 23:12.760
on the 4G network because I set alerts to alert me of anything I care about through the Ting

23:12.760 --> 23:17.000
control panel. So, you know, it's great because I don't have to worry about it. I know my bill's

23:17.000 --> 23:20.440
going to be ridiculously cheap and I'll probably be getting the coin from it from my couch.

23:20.440 --> 23:25.960
Yeah, I know, right? And you know what's so wild about LTE now is, and WiMAX is like this too,

23:27.640 --> 23:32.760
in some areas, it is faster than some folks' broadband. Their physical connection. Yeah.

23:32.760 --> 23:36.200
And like Matt said, that powerful online control panel lets you take control of your account. You

23:36.200 --> 23:40.760
get your usage information, your bills. You can activate and deactivate devices. And of course,

23:40.760 --> 23:44.040
if you get stuck at any time, they have a no-hold customer support. You just call them.

23:44.040 --> 23:49.560
1-855-TING-FTW. And that's any time between 8am or 8pm and a real person answers the phone. You

23:49.560 --> 23:53.000
can also go to help.ting.com if you're a do-it-yourselfer. They've got forms over there.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.440
Also at ting.com slash hangout or hangouts. I gotta look that up. They do, they do hangouts

23:58.440 --> 24:01.640
and it's just they have an embed spot. So you always go to the same spot on their site, which

24:01.640 --> 24:04.520
I didn't even know you could do that with hangouts. You always go to the same spot on their

24:04.520 --> 24:08.120
website and they have a live Q&A. If you've got some questions, you can ask them. Of course,

24:08.120 --> 24:11.160
they've also got active Twitter and Facebook accounts where they're answering questions,

24:11.160 --> 24:16.760
along with that 1-855-TING-FTW. It's pretty great stuff. I've been rocking an HTC One. First,

24:16.760 --> 24:21.640
I got an Evo with my Ting service. I brought my own Evo. And so that meant my first month of

24:21.640 --> 24:26.120
Ting was totally free because if you go to linux.ting.com, you're going to save $25 off

24:26.120 --> 24:29.640
your first month of service if you bring your own device. If you don't have a device yet,

24:29.640 --> 24:34.200
they're going to take $25 off it when you go to linux.ting.com. So I brought my own. I got my

24:34.200 --> 24:39.000
first month for free. Yeah, even though we're a sponsor, I pay for my service. I just want to put

24:39.000 --> 24:43.960
that up front. I've paid for all my devices and I pay for my service. And much like now,

24:43.960 --> 24:48.600
I make my choice based on the license of a software. I make my choice on if Ting supports

24:48.600 --> 24:54.040
that device because Ting is the carrier that respects their users. Ting is a mobile ISP. You

24:54.040 --> 24:58.120
guys know how those other companies are taking advantage of you and Ting doesn't do that. People

24:58.120 --> 25:02.840
love Ting and you're people. So think about that. It's a match made in heaven. So go over to Linux

25:02.840 --> 25:08.360
dot ting.com, save $25. The sooner you start, the more you will save. And I think you're going to

25:08.360 --> 25:12.600
be really impressed. And you know, they got some great device like the kind of what the Moto X

25:12.600 --> 25:16.680
kind of what the next just a little bit want it. Yeah, you've been like just drooling over it like

25:16.680 --> 25:21.000
fine at your screen. I'm waiting. I'm waiting for the final report from from Mr. Dominic. And if

25:21.000 --> 25:24.600
when he gives me the thumbs up or thumbs down, then it might be a Christmas present. I'm just

25:24.600 --> 25:29.240
kind of waiting to see if the Nexus 5 comes around on the Ting service because it's got to be on

25:29.240 --> 25:32.840
the Ting service because it's got to be on Ting if I'm going to get it because I only use Ting. So

25:32.840 --> 25:38.520
thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Okay, man, I wanted to I was I was trying to

25:38.520 --> 25:45.960
put my thoughts together. And here's what I came up with. So I think last. So the last time we

25:45.960 --> 25:50.200
reviewed Ubuntu, we hadn't tried the arch challenge yet. And I think this might have kind of brought

25:50.200 --> 25:57.320
it on. But we titled Ubuntu 13.04 best but boring. Right now, essentially, it was a big meh, right?

25:57.320 --> 26:01.400
And that was kind of the whole thing of it. It really wasn't anything to speak of that was exciting

26:01.400 --> 26:07.560
or new. Right. But it wasn't horrible. It just it just was. So I would propose to you that perhaps

26:07.560 --> 26:13.400
Ubuntu 13.10 could be the most boring Ubuntu release ever. But that's hard to gauge, right?

26:13.400 --> 26:18.200
Yeah. But boring helped Windows XP become the widest deployed Windows desktop OS in history.

26:18.200 --> 26:22.360
It's still used today by 31 percent of Windows users, according to Wikipedia.

26:22.360 --> 26:28.360
But what's practical? Okay, so let's back up from there. So if I was Miguel Itacasa, I would argue

26:28.360 --> 26:32.920
that Linux could have used more boring back in the day. And because we weren't boring enough,

26:32.920 --> 26:38.760
he believes that a lot of a lot of the changing of the back ends and APIs and things like that

26:38.760 --> 26:43.960
hurt commercial adoption by large scale development shops. Right. I would agree with that. And so,

26:44.520 --> 26:48.920
whereas, you know, if you are a little more steady than the people building apps around you

26:48.920 --> 26:52.440
are able to target you better. But what's the practical cost of being boring? Stagnation,

26:52.440 --> 26:55.880
really. Right. When you're boring, it means you might be stagnating a little bit.

26:56.840 --> 27:00.440
I would say I'm actually beginning to see evidence of that with some of my Ubuntu articles,

27:00.440 --> 27:03.720
the article and also just with articles I've written for other people that we're seeing

27:03.720 --> 27:08.440
tremendous traffic. We've seen huge drops and people aren't searching for it anymore. And I

27:08.440 --> 27:11.960
don't know if that's because this stuff's not a problem or because people are going to other

27:11.960 --> 27:15.960
distros or what exactly is happening. Yeah. I mean, you know, stagnation, you know,

27:15.960 --> 27:21.960
maybe as a platform, stagnation has some benefits. You know, you could argue XP stagnation came at

27:21.960 --> 27:28.440
the time where the Windows market was relatively mature, whereas Windows, you know, that's Linux

27:28.440 --> 27:33.640
is not really in that same space. Ubuntu is not really in that same position. They might not ever

27:33.640 --> 27:38.760
be. So I think, I don't know, I think stagnation, I think stagnation hurts in this case. I think

27:38.760 --> 27:43.560
it's too early for them to be stagnant. I mean, there's a time where you can stagnate for a period

27:43.560 --> 27:48.280
before the next big thing. And that's okay. But I feel like that they stagnated early and it's

27:48.280 --> 27:52.440
happening for a too long, a lengthy of a period of time. And then of course, with the whole mirror

27:52.440 --> 27:57.560
situation in the next release, not happening, that's not really helping either. And of course,

27:57.560 --> 28:02.040
there's all, there's the Nvidia, you know, stuff going back and forth as to what's going on with

28:02.040 --> 28:05.720
that. How's it going to be affecting with others? You know, lots and lots of stuff behind doors.

28:05.720 --> 28:12.520
We don't know what's really going on. Yeah. And I would argue too, like maybe this is the

28:12.520 --> 28:16.920
case for maybe they should have gone rolling. Remember when that whole debate came up and we

28:16.920 --> 28:22.200
were like, ah, I don't know about rolling, but I thought about it, you know, after using, I'm going

28:22.200 --> 28:26.680
to say it, but after using Arch for a while, Linux is a constantly evolving beast. The collective

28:26.680 --> 28:31.000
output, it's the collective output of tens of thousands of developers taking their ideas and

28:31.000 --> 28:36.920
turning it into code. And it happens every single hour of every single day. So stagnation is not

28:36.920 --> 28:41.960
inherent to this evolving beast, right? It is the opposite of what Linux is. It's a whole different

28:41.960 --> 28:47.800
solution to what Linux is. It's a forced solution that's grafted. They're taking an old style, like

28:47.800 --> 28:52.040
sell your software in CDs in the store. And they're trying to graft it on top of an always

28:52.040 --> 28:57.960
moving, evolving beast to make some sort of model from, but the two things are not really that

28:57.960 --> 29:03.960
compatible. And I wonder if, I wonder if now we're seeing like the strain of that model here with,

29:03.960 --> 29:09.480
cause we have these expectations built up around these six month cycles. We have like, you know,

29:09.480 --> 29:14.360
deadline feature that we used to see all the time. And that's the problem is that because they're

29:14.360 --> 29:18.840
dumping so much of the resources into all this, quite frankly, behind the scenes stuff that for

29:18.840 --> 29:22.840
the front end user really isn't all that exciting to hear about. It's more exciting for the geeks

29:22.840 --> 29:27.320
and less exciting for just casual folks. I think they really will need to go to a rolling release

29:27.320 --> 29:31.800
because quite honestly, all the distros that I'm really drawn to, I don't care what it is. You

29:31.800 --> 29:35.960
know, I find myself more excited about a rolling distro than I do a stagnant. Yeah. And to your

29:35.960 --> 29:44.680
point. So, um, today I updated my arch installation and I got gnome 310. Ooh, I'll see. There you go.

29:44.680 --> 29:51.560
In 10 minutes on my machine on arch in the morning, in one series of updates, I got more

29:51.560 --> 29:56.760
features and changes than I feel like I'm seeing in a six month product cycle in 1310. I feel like

29:56.760 --> 30:03.640
in one update on arch, I have more of a revolutionary change than, than the collective 1310 entire

30:03.640 --> 30:08.760
distribution. Exactly. And I, I, I wonder if distribution should maybe trans transition to

30:08.760 --> 30:13.880
more to like, instead of being where they snapshot a moment in time and then they quality check and

30:13.880 --> 30:17.960
they roll that all up and they shoot and they ship it. Uh, maybe they could, you know, and each and

30:17.960 --> 30:23.320
you consider this, maybe they could instead just move to like caretakers of a, of a, of a safe

30:23.320 --> 30:27.320
rolling distro. Like each major distro is building up all these sophisticated automated testing

30:27.320 --> 30:33.480
systems. And while they're not perfect, you know, if you have more people using rolling software,

30:33.480 --> 30:37.400
if you have more people using more current open source software, then that's going to make the

30:37.400 --> 30:41.880
upstream software better. And then that has cascading effects across the entire Linux

30:41.880 --> 30:45.880
ecosystem because then everybody is submitting bugs on the same upstream code. Everybody's

30:45.880 --> 30:49.400
getting the patches, everybody's fixing. I know this is a utopia, but it could have a

30:49.400 --> 30:53.080
dramatic adoption improvement on the adoption of fresh open source software, which could,

30:53.080 --> 30:57.320
which could then drive a whole new, you know, momentum around software development.

30:57.960 --> 31:02.200
Well, and there are distros that are already do that. Manjaro is fairly close to that in that you

31:02.200 --> 31:05.480
have your stay. I hate to say, I know I keep plugging it, but it's true. Uh, they, you know,

31:05.480 --> 31:09.320
you have your stable, which is basically very periodic snapshots, probably about once a month,

31:09.320 --> 31:12.600
no big deal. Not really. It's kind of a stagnant rolling kind of thing and it's safe and it's

31:12.600 --> 31:16.680
stable and whatever. And then you've got your, uh, unstable repos that you can go to, which are

31:16.680 --> 31:21.000
quite frequent. Uh, there's a lot going on there. And so if you want to experience more of a, uh,

31:21.000 --> 31:25.720
rapid experience, you can do that too. So I see other distribut- distributions of being, uh,

31:25.720 --> 31:29.560
looking into that. I see Ubuntu should look into something like that. You have your long-term release

31:29.560 --> 31:34.280
that is basically just bam, here it is. It's not changing like it is now. And oh, hey, by the way,

31:34.280 --> 31:37.960
the other one is constantly evolving. That would solve the problem, I think.

31:37.960 --> 31:42.840
Yeah. I kind of feel like maybe there's a bit of like a bias. I feel like people are afraid of

31:42.840 --> 31:46.840
upstream fresh code. Like we have a culture of fear that something's going to break, even if-

31:46.840 --> 31:47.400
It's long term.

31:47.400 --> 31:52.120
And even if something hasn't broken yet, oh, it's going to break. Just you wait, it's going to break.

31:52.120 --> 31:55.720
Um, but I wonder if we couldn't maybe have a discussion around, like, there's gotta be

31:55.720 --> 32:00.760
a middle ground here because it, I don't, I don't think this, well, at least for Canonical,

32:00.760 --> 32:02.200
it's just not working. I mean, I don't want to-

32:02.200 --> 32:05.800
And even just snapshotting that they don't have to go full art style. They just need to actually

32:05.800 --> 32:09.480
have monthly snapshots. That's all they have to do. Just whatever it is. They can still do a rolling

32:09.480 --> 32:13.640
release in their, in their typical, uh, dynamic, you know, release. And then of course their long-term

32:13.640 --> 32:17.880
releases as it is now, then they're not totally just every single day, new stuff, new stuff,

32:17.880 --> 32:21.400
new stuff. Cause that would just be anarchy on the forums for a bit too big of a change.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.080
But I think snapshots would work for them.

32:24.440 --> 32:29.480
Yeah. Yeah. I'll ask the mumble room. I mean, what do you guys think? Do you think that, uh,

32:29.480 --> 32:35.320
we are sort of seeing the, the end of, we live in a world now where when there's a new version

32:35.320 --> 32:39.160
of Google docs, Google just pushes it to your web browser. When there's a new version of Yahoo mail,

32:39.160 --> 32:43.320
you just log in one day and you get it. Are we now living in a world where we should just be

32:43.320 --> 32:49.160
getting new things, push to our machines from time to time and going with these big snapshots?

32:49.160 --> 32:55.720
Is this awkward? I'm not sure that's a good thing. I think we're looking at this completely wrong.

32:55.720 --> 33:00.840
All right. Give it to me. Google has their own distribution in-house. The government has their

33:00.840 --> 33:06.760
own distribution in-house police departments. Everyone has their own distribution, which they

33:06.760 --> 33:14.600
actually maintain themselves. There is actually no need for an upstream distribution to do what

33:14.600 --> 33:19.160
the companies are going to do anyway. So why couldn't then canonical say,

33:19.160 --> 33:23.960
all right, Ubuntu is a rolling release. Here's LTSs. If you want to take those and fork those,

33:23.960 --> 33:25.800
have at it, you know, you go make gubuntu.

33:29.480 --> 33:36.280
Yeah. You're assuming that the rolling releases are by default good and they always work and

33:36.280 --> 33:41.480
they will work. But see, I asked you this, would you use Arch in a production environment

33:41.480 --> 33:44.280
or would you use a more stable distribution like Debian or something?

33:44.280 --> 33:49.000
Well, I do use it for media production. I was considering rolling a home server running it.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.960
I don't know. I like the idea of an LTS for a server.

33:51.960 --> 33:56.200
Yeah. That was my point is that, yeah, it's not going to be appropriate to put that into a big

33:56.200 --> 34:02.200
time important role. But if you have long-term releases that exist as they do now, that literally

34:02.200 --> 34:05.000
has no effect on it. I just feel like we should.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.680
I feel like technology should be good enough that we could all be just be using rolling releases.

34:08.680 --> 34:13.000
Like let's get testing done. Let's write software so that it doesn't break after an update.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.680
It's not the technology, it's the people.

34:14.680 --> 34:20.760
I think Arch is fine in a production environment. The only time I've ever had

34:20.760 --> 34:26.200
issues with Arch was something I did, something I screwed up. So if you know what you're doing,

34:26.200 --> 34:31.320
Arch is fine. That said, I mean, that could be said about any distribution. If you don't know

34:31.320 --> 34:40.280
what you're doing, you can completely screw up. You also got to realize that Arch is community

34:40.280 --> 34:47.480
driven, right? That there's not a team behind it, really, except for just, you know, the very,

34:47.480 --> 34:52.360
very minimal stuff. But it's mostly community driven.

34:52.360 --> 35:04.280
There is a very horrible bug in KDE which does not copy files and doesn't tell you about it. And

35:04.280 --> 35:09.080
this has been a bug for five years, meaning if you copy from one location to another,

35:09.960 --> 35:15.320
it will create the folders, but it won't actually copy the files. This has been a bug for five

35:15.320 --> 35:21.560
years. This is one of the biggest projects in Linux. And this is a very critical bug.

35:21.560 --> 35:28.360
And it has not been even addressed in three or four years. Now, imagine this. Imagine if this

35:28.360 --> 35:36.200
bug is not an exception. Imagine if such bugs exist in all big projects, like GNOME, Ubuntu,

35:36.200 --> 35:43.080
Unity, KDE, so on and so forth. Now, if we are ignoring such horrible bugs in favor of new

35:43.080 --> 35:48.120
features, I don't actually personally believe that that's a good way forward. You know, yes,

35:48.120 --> 35:53.960
the idea of a rolling release and new updates is very nice. On the other hand, if there's still

35:53.960 --> 35:59.640
a lot of serious work to be done on older releases, maybe that should be the focus.

36:00.200 --> 36:08.040
Well, so your point is sort of what I was... So one of the reasons I like using Arch is because

36:08.040 --> 36:13.720
I want to... Because there are a lot of open source programs are missing some features that

36:13.720 --> 36:17.880
I would consider fundamental. I know I shouldn't get on this soapbox, but let's look at Smuxy.

36:17.880 --> 36:25.000
I love Smuxy IRC client. It's great. It just needs one checkbox, one checkbox, and that's

36:25.000 --> 36:30.280
hide join and part messages. I know I can set up a filter. I shouldn't have to custom design a

36:30.280 --> 36:35.080
filter where I go Google search the syntax to put into a filter so I don't have to see the

36:35.080 --> 36:40.600
join and part messages. Every other IRC client on the planet can hide join and part messages.

36:40.600 --> 36:45.640
So maybe one day the Smuxy guy is going to add that. So here's my thought. I want to be on a

36:45.640 --> 36:51.320
distribution that the moment that Smuxy gets updated, I got it. So the other last week when

36:51.320 --> 36:58.120
VLC got an update, I saw the headline and you know what? I did an update on my system and I

36:58.120 --> 37:04.040
had it. I had that new VLC that had those new features. I had it immediately. And as I sit here

37:04.040 --> 37:08.680
and I set up an Ubuntu box and I download a dab and I downloaded dab and I have six or seven

37:08.680 --> 37:12.360
dabs downloaded so I can get something installed and I think, well, great. Now I'm just going to

37:12.360 --> 37:16.760
sit at these crappy versions that probably have some sort of bug. It's stupid. It's a system that

37:16.760 --> 37:21.080
doesn't work anymore. It's not taking advantage of the fact that we have thousands of people out

37:21.080 --> 37:26.200
there creating grand features for us every single hour and we never get any of them. We never get

37:26.200 --> 37:32.280
any of them when we have these snapshots. I think a rolling release would be perfect

37:32.840 --> 37:39.560
because it's stable, but it still could be bleeding edge as you want. The only problem

37:39.560 --> 37:49.800
with that, it's very hard to get used to. But I know it is good for companies and the family.

37:49.800 --> 37:54.680
You know, you're going to have to teach them how to keep their system updated or you can just give

37:54.680 --> 38:04.520
them one that is, you know, ready to go. You guys got to get your mics worked out.

38:04.520 --> 38:10.760
Jesus, that was awful. It sounds like speaker and mic. Yeah. All right. So anyways, you know,

38:11.880 --> 38:18.120
my conclusion is that we kind of just have to adjust our expectations on some of this stuff and

38:18.120 --> 38:24.120
it's becoming maybe less about the flash and it's going to become more about what can get done,

38:24.120 --> 38:31.000
right? And how you do it and what you can do. Like, you know, so I'm running Ubuntu 13.10 this week

38:31.000 --> 38:35.320
to give us, to get, you know, my just so I am living in it. And there's been a couple of things

38:35.320 --> 38:40.520
that have worked for me that didn't work under Arch. And there are certain benefits to having

38:40.520 --> 38:47.480
something that's a little more targetable. F.Lux is a program I use that automatically adjusts the

38:47.480 --> 38:51.800
color temperature of my screens when the sun sets. It's kind of, oh yes, it's neat, right?

38:51.800 --> 38:56.120
Never works under Arch for me. It just never works. I've never had it work under Arch or

38:56.120 --> 39:03.240
Manjaro. Yeah. Works just fine under Ubuntu. Just fine. Works just fine. Super Frog HD from Steam

39:03.880 --> 39:08.440
never even starts under Arch. I don't know why I've deleted and reinstalled it. I've,

39:08.440 --> 39:11.720
I've Googled around to see if like I need some libraries that I don't know about.

39:11.720 --> 39:17.000
Never could get it working under Arch. I install it one click under Ubuntu starts right up. First

39:17.000 --> 39:21.720
try. Interesting. Yeah. It's, it's fascinating. And you know, and going back to what we were

39:21.720 --> 39:25.160
talking about, uh, just, you know, what works where and how all that sort of stuff,

39:25.160 --> 39:28.520
I think the big picture stuff here is that, and I want to make sure everybody understands that

39:28.520 --> 39:32.920
we're not saying that you should get rid of long-term releases and just go nothing but

39:32.920 --> 39:36.440
rolling, at least I'm not. And we're not going with nothing but rolling releases. I'm saying

39:36.440 --> 39:40.840
have the option of either or so that you've got your regular folks actually using the rolling

39:40.840 --> 39:44.600
releases, finding the bugs, being active in that environment. But the enterprise folks,

39:44.600 --> 39:49.960
if they choose to still have a long-term release from which to work with, and then everybody wins.

39:49.960 --> 39:55.240
That's all I'm saying. Cause the current model right now on Ubuntu sucks. It sucks hard and it

39:55.240 --> 39:59.480
needs to be fixed. I mean, that's just reality. I think it's suffering from the focus on mobile. So

39:59.480 --> 40:04.760
one of the things that I was going to mention was that there was a post in the development

40:04.760 --> 40:08.200
mailing list that got a lot of people upset and we didn't really get a chance to talk about it

40:08.200 --> 40:13.000
on last, but I thought maybe I'd bring it up here just because it's sort of, it's sort of,

40:13.000 --> 40:17.880
it fits with what we're talking about in terms of focus. So, uh, there was a post that was made by

40:17.880 --> 40:23.640
Sebastian Basher. I don't know how you say the last name. I'm going to give it a shot. Okay. And

40:23.640 --> 40:30.840
he noted that in, uh, they're planning in 1404. So we're talking post 1310, 1404, uh, they plan to

40:30.840 --> 40:36.040
stick with GTK, Gnome 3.8. Now that he lists several reasons for this. Cause now if you figure

40:36.040 --> 40:41.560
3.10 is hitting now, right? Right. And it includes introduces a lot of nice new features, but they're

40:41.560 --> 40:47.000
going to stick with 3.8 even in 1404, which that means. So it's going to be like a five-year

40:47.000 --> 40:52.760
release that they're going to be using this older version of GTK. Number one reason we, uh, Ubuntu

40:52.760 --> 40:57.160
desktop are currently most happy with what we have. Okay. That's a good reason actually. All right.

40:57.160 --> 41:02.920
Number two reason the focus on Ubuntu desktop team is likely to continue to be Ubuntu touch

41:02.920 --> 41:08.760
slash phone next cycle. Yeah. Shocker due to the previous factor, we're going to be limited in

41:08.760 --> 41:13.960
resources to do desktop work. Now he goes on to say there's some other good things too. Uh,

41:13.960 --> 41:19.400
the 310, 3.10 depocates of several things that they need. Uh, and it looks like red hat enterprise

41:19.400 --> 41:23.160
edition might also be going with Gnome 3.8. So that way they'd be kind of compatible with the

41:23.160 --> 41:27.080
other long-term support guy in the business. That's good. Uh, so there's other, there's other

41:27.080 --> 41:31.560
logistical reasons too, but I sure don't like those, uh, first, uh, those first ones there

41:31.560 --> 41:36.200
where they say it's because the desktop team is likely to be continued to focus on touch.

41:36.200 --> 41:40.600
I know this is a horse that I beat, but I think this is a tactical error. And I know they think

41:40.600 --> 41:44.520
they have a purpose and a mission and an opportunity to seize. And I think they're

41:44.520 --> 41:47.640
completely missing the purpose and admission and the opportunity to seize that is actually

41:47.640 --> 41:52.600
happening all around them right now. It's like, I believe canonicals grand vision of having a

41:52.600 --> 41:58.040
boon to be like this, this island of salvation, whereas all of the rats flee windows and Mac,

41:58.760 --> 42:04.120
they finally are there. And it is, I am seeing a boon to deployed in them craziest. Like there

42:04.120 --> 42:10.440
was a thread in our subreddit that guy started a job at a amazon.com and he walks into amazon.com

42:10.440 --> 42:15.160
and all of the machines in his department run a bone to 1204, which is crazy, right?

42:15.160 --> 42:18.760
It's happening everywhere, but there it is. It's the longterm release. And I think the reason for

42:18.760 --> 42:23.240
that and the whole known three, uh, three dot eight thing too, is that the big picture stuff

42:23.240 --> 42:27.320
we got to remember is that people are in these environments looking for a stable and stable

42:27.320 --> 42:33.400
situation. And so I think that if we do continue to see people distro hop and they will, and we'll

42:33.400 --> 42:38.440
see less regular people using, uh, Linux and probably more of the enterprise and more of the

42:38.440 --> 42:41.720
schools and such jumping onto the boon to situation. I don't know. I, it's going to be

42:41.720 --> 42:45.400
interesting as to where it all plays out, but I think in the long run it's, it's not necessarily

42:45.400 --> 42:48.760
a bad thing. I think it's just a shift in viewership or users. So here's what I think. I

42:48.760 --> 42:53.000
think, and I'm, you know, I, I'm going to have a lot to say on Sunday about 1310. There's a lot of

42:53.000 --> 42:56.600
things I've picked up on. We're going to, we're going to cover that, but I think the, the, the

42:56.600 --> 43:02.280
release to really watch will be 1404 because if they just nail it as another good steady release,

43:02.280 --> 43:06.680
folks can use that for years while they work out the mirror stuff, the unity eight stuff that they

43:06.680 --> 43:10.840
are, you know, all this kind of all these hitches they're going to have. They can work those out for

43:10.840 --> 43:14.760
a few years with an L with a good LTS release out there. And then maybe things will work,

43:15.480 --> 43:18.920
work out for them. I don't know. I'm, I still think it's, I think it's damn risky. I think

43:18.920 --> 43:23.320
they're playing it. They have, they have a huge gamble here and I think 1310 is going to suffer

43:23.320 --> 43:28.120
from it. I don't want to blow the review because I, you know, I'm trying to change my set of

43:28.120 --> 43:33.080
parameters in which that I look at it. I'm trying to, I'm trying to adjust that and look at it from

43:33.080 --> 43:38.360
a different angle. And that'll be my attempt for the review on Sunday, but I don't know.

43:38.360 --> 43:42.360
Well, you know, I don't know. I mean, for me, it's like I have, you know, I have both my cutting

43:42.360 --> 43:46.840
edge bleeding edge desktop. And then I also have my aboon two desktop on a separate computer that

43:46.840 --> 43:51.080
I use for a very stable environment. And I think that speaks a lot to it. I think at the end of the

43:51.080 --> 43:55.960
day, different strokes for different folks for myself, if they come out with a really boring,

43:55.960 --> 43:59.560
stable release, I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing, but I do think it's going to

43:59.560 --> 44:03.160
lose its news line appeal. I think that's probably where it's going to hit the most,

44:03.160 --> 44:06.680
but I think we're still going to see a lot of people, especially with all the NSA garbage

44:06.680 --> 44:10.040
going on. I think we're going to see a lot of people off shore adopting a boon too, and perhaps

44:10.040 --> 44:14.200
jumping onto other distros as well. So interesting. You know, you mentioned you see it too, in terms

44:14.200 --> 44:19.400
of like article traffic and things like that. Oh yeah. Big time. Huge. Yeah. I wonder what that

44:19.400 --> 44:23.320
might be something to dig into. Well, uh, before we get into the mail sack this week, we've got

44:23.320 --> 44:26.760
some good emails. I just want to mention an affiliate that we had joined the Jupiter broadcast.

44:26.760 --> 44:31.960
We've mentioned them once before on the Unplugged show, and that is ProXPN. Now, ProXPN is a VPN

44:31.960 --> 44:36.360
service provider. They support open VPN, and they also have an Android app that makes it pretty

44:36.360 --> 44:40.680
convenient to get a VPN with your, with your Android apps. And if you go to ProXPN, they've

44:40.680 --> 44:47.720
got a deal where if you use the code JBLIVE, you're going to save 20% off the ProXPN service

44:47.720 --> 44:52.760
for life. 20% off ProXPN service for life. Now, I'm not going to tell you why you might need a

44:52.760 --> 44:57.720
VPN. I've got, I got a few ideas and suggestions why you might need a VPN. I know we have folks

44:57.720 --> 45:01.880
that live outside the US that would like to get access to US services. We also have people who

45:01.880 --> 45:07.240
just like to use Wi-Fi a lot at public locations, and there's plenty of legitimate reasons to use

45:07.240 --> 45:12.440
a VPN there. In fact, I would recommend you use a VPN, and I believe the ProXPN prices are pretty

45:12.440 --> 45:16.840
outrageously low. Like, I couldn't believe it when I saw it, and they have some, they have like a

45:16.840 --> 45:24.040
free trial you can sign up for too. The, the 100% free though, they, they don't support PPTP. So if

45:24.040 --> 45:28.600
you need the PPTP, you're going to have to, also the app, but I just kid about the PPTP.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.640
And it's fun to say that.

45:29.640 --> 45:32.360
The premium is $6.25 a month.

45:32.360 --> 45:32.760
Okay.

45:32.760 --> 45:36.760
And our deal is going to give you 25% off for life when you use the code JBLIVE.

45:36.760 --> 45:37.160
How about that?

45:37.160 --> 45:38.920
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

45:38.920 --> 45:42.920
That's ProXPN and use the code JBLIVE to get 20% off.

45:43.560 --> 45:44.360
Good stuff.

45:44.360 --> 45:48.680
All right. So let's move on to the emails now. So you can email us linuxactionshow

45:48.680 --> 45:52.520
at jupiterbroadcasting.com. Or if you want to send it specifically for the unplugged show,

45:52.520 --> 45:56.920
which we've been getting more of those, you can just email, go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

45:56.920 --> 46:01.080
and click on the contact link at the top of our website and then choose unplugged

46:01.080 --> 46:04.280
from the dropdown. Or you can also join our mumble, but if you join our mumble server,

46:04.280 --> 46:07.560
wear headphones. That way we don't have horrible echo and then have to hang up on the room.

46:07.560 --> 46:10.120
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes.

46:10.120 --> 46:14.600
All right. Our first email today came in for our, I guess not their first,

46:14.600 --> 46:17.560
but our first email in the email section from Noah. He says,

46:17.560 --> 46:21.960
I'm one of the few young Linux users. I'm 14. I've been using Linux for about a year.

46:21.960 --> 46:25.400
It's amazing how little my generation knows about computers.

46:25.400 --> 46:27.240
Oh, ouch, ouch.

46:27.240 --> 46:30.280
He's right. And good for you, Noah. And thank you on two fronts for using Linux

46:30.280 --> 46:31.320
and acknowledging that.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.240
Yeah. And for writing in when he's 14. That's cool too.

46:33.240 --> 46:34.200
Yeah. Awesome.

46:34.200 --> 46:39.240
So Noah goes on to say that I've been following Jupiter Broadcasting for a little while and I

46:39.240 --> 46:42.920
really enjoy your videos. I remember you talking about how kids really don't know computers,

46:42.920 --> 46:49.160
cloud services, servers, networks, et cetera. He says, this is true and not, and this is true,

46:49.160 --> 46:54.440
and not many want to learn, but I want to know more about these things myself. Oftentimes on

46:54.440 --> 46:58.520
the show when you start talking about servers or something, I really get lost. I was wondering if

46:58.520 --> 47:02.840
you could do a show or give some pointers to young people that want to expand their knowledge on

47:02.840 --> 47:06.840
Linux servers and networking. I would love to know more about these things. Even if you could

47:06.840 --> 47:10.840
give a website or advice, that would be great. Can't wait till the roll your own email server

47:10.840 --> 47:12.200
episode. Thanks, Noah.

47:12.840 --> 47:16.760
Awesome. What a great question and what a great point. I think that's an excellent point that

47:16.760 --> 47:19.080
maybe we do need to touch on that more, you know?

47:19.080 --> 47:22.360
Let's ask the mumble room. Do you guys have any tips for kids that want to learn

47:22.360 --> 47:25.960
computers and networking and Linux? What's a good way they could get started preferably online?

47:27.720 --> 47:32.360
As a 15 year old on Linux, just jump into it.

47:33.240 --> 47:34.520
There you go.

47:34.520 --> 47:38.440
Look for a free PDF. There are some out there that will basically start with the essentials

47:39.160 --> 47:46.120
and then start reading that and then use your own distribution. Use it and start using it and

47:46.120 --> 47:48.440
keep using it and then just throw away Windows.

47:48.440 --> 47:51.800
No one's going to say listen to podcasts?

47:52.520 --> 47:53.160
Well, there is that.

47:54.360 --> 47:55.480
Of course, that's a given.

47:56.920 --> 48:02.360
But then again, your podcast doesn't really go into the how to do it like BSD does.

48:02.360 --> 48:05.560
Right. Yeah. Well, I've always kind of had the philosophy of

48:07.080 --> 48:10.760
so our audience is so diverse. There's people who don't know anything.

48:10.760 --> 48:13.320
And then there's people who know way, way, way more than we do.

48:13.320 --> 48:17.240
So I've always felt like try to cut it down the middle and give people enough information

48:17.240 --> 48:20.920
that if they care, they're inspired to go out and learn. And if they don't care,

48:20.920 --> 48:23.480
they've at least picked up a little bit about something they didn't know about.

48:23.480 --> 48:24.520
And they can just move on.

48:24.520 --> 48:25.560
So I kind of try to walk out.

48:25.560 --> 48:29.080
But last isn't really about, you know, the technical side of things, is it?

48:29.080 --> 48:34.600
Yeah. Well, it can be, you know, it can be like I gave you the API call names of WebRTC last week.

48:34.600 --> 48:35.480
That's pretty technical.

48:36.440 --> 48:41.240
Well, the way I tell them to get into something is to rip open an old computer,

48:41.240 --> 48:46.600
because way back in the day, we always used to have to mod probe our own modules into our kernels.

48:46.600 --> 48:47.560
That's right.

48:47.560 --> 48:52.200
We have to know what our hardware is in order to get our kernels to run correctly.

48:52.200 --> 48:58.600
A good way, it's hands on, is to just rip apart a computer and just get Linux running on that.

48:58.600 --> 49:01.640
Yeah, you know, when I installed Gentoo, I sure learned a heck of a lot back in the day.

49:01.640 --> 49:08.520
Here's how I started. I started with just a year of Ubuntu.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.920
And then after a while, I decided, hey, let's try Arch.

49:10.920 --> 49:12.120
So I switched to Arch.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.240
And I haven't looked back since.

49:15.240 --> 49:19.000
But that's the way I learned that as far as it comes to networking and computers.

49:19.000 --> 49:23.720
I was part of a class back in high school. Of course, we're talking mid 90s here.

49:23.720 --> 49:30.040
And it really helps to learn the hardware and the software and not only that,

49:30.040 --> 49:34.760
but I really got my first look at Linux at the time, too.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.240
Of course, that was Slackware at an early age.

49:37.240 --> 49:42.280
But at the same time, if you start networking with people you know, you're going to find out.

49:42.840 --> 49:46.680
There's a lot of people out there who know this stuff who'd be willing to take you under their wing.

49:47.240 --> 49:48.200
That's exactly what I did.

49:48.200 --> 49:53.160
Yeah, I think the Arch wiki actually has a lot of good stuff in networking, too.

49:53.160 --> 49:56.520
And so does the GenC wiki if you're actually looking at the right sections.

49:57.160 --> 50:00.120
Yeah, the software is directly related to the hardware.

50:00.120 --> 50:05.960
If you want to know exactly how the disks use their blocks or file systems function,

50:05.960 --> 50:08.840
or how the network file system does its protocols,

50:08.840 --> 50:13.560
or how the kernel has locking or has rings to do virtual machines,

50:13.560 --> 50:19.080
it's all based on the hardware and you can do CPU extensions, RAM,

50:19.640 --> 50:23.960
it's all software is built on top of the hardware to make the hardware.

50:23.960 --> 50:30.600
You know what, I think this generation has it.

50:30.600 --> 50:35.800
I mean, thing is, when I was 17, like five, six years ago, and I was using

50:35.800 --> 50:43.640
Soos 11.1 and Ubuntu 8.04. Now, those were very, I mean, for me, they were very unstable.

50:43.640 --> 50:48.600
They had a lot of problems for me, and so getting into it was a lot harder than it is now.

50:49.080 --> 50:54.520
That ties into the whole stability conversation where if you have a stable distro,

50:54.520 --> 51:00.200
if you have something that someone can rely on, someone can trust, someone new

51:00.200 --> 51:07.000
can actually play with and get used to, then maybe they can learn more about it much easier than they could before.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.600
Yeah, instead of throwing them into the fire of a rolling distro.

51:10.600 --> 51:15.080
You know, you touch on something that I kind of didn't really end cap that conversation with,

51:15.080 --> 51:20.840
but you mentioned it made me realize, like, I called Ubuntu, is it the XP of Linux?

51:20.840 --> 51:24.440
But I actually think Windows XP, while it had all of its problems,

51:24.440 --> 51:33.400
it was, like, a huge, huge advantage for Windows because it, like, it allowed so many people to target one thing.

51:33.400 --> 51:38.120
And I wonder if, like, maybe when we talk about Ubuntu and we talk about average users,

51:38.760 --> 51:44.280
we shouldn't even talk about the dot releases. Maybe we should only be talking in the context of LTS releases.

51:44.280 --> 51:46.280
Good point. Yeah, that's a very good point.

51:46.280 --> 51:51.480
Because if somebody can't trust their computer to work when something is critical,

51:51.480 --> 51:57.480
or somebody can't rely on a computer to be stable, they can't really be interested in learning it now, can they?

51:57.480 --> 51:58.440
Hmm.

51:58.440 --> 52:00.920
Ask Ubuntu, it was a great help.

52:00.920 --> 52:07.320
Personally, I wouldn't see Ubuntu as the XP of Linux. I'd see it more as the Windows 8.

52:07.320 --> 52:07.960
Hmm.

52:07.960 --> 52:09.560
What do you think of that?

52:09.560 --> 52:11.480
I don't know, I feel like that's being a little hard.

52:11.480 --> 52:12.680
I like it.

52:12.680 --> 52:17.400
It is, because it is trying to use the whole touch interface, and it's like,

52:17.400 --> 52:19.720
yeah, it doesn't work on desktops, and come on.

52:19.720 --> 52:26.920
That's why I'm interested in that. Are we still talking about a teenager learning about computers, or have we moved on from that?

52:26.920 --> 52:28.440
It seems like we've kind of branched out.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.280
I want to move on. Yeah, I want to move on from that.

52:30.280 --> 52:37.160
The point was, like the chairman pointed out, there's howtoforge, commandlinefu.com,

52:37.160 --> 52:43.560
but I think what the room has touched on is, you know, dig in, and if you want to learn the application,

52:43.560 --> 52:47.800
so if you want to learn the lower level stuff, there's lots of ways to do that, there's wikis to dig into,

52:47.800 --> 52:52.040
but if you want to learn the application level stuff, what the mumble room is saying, and I agree with them,

52:52.040 --> 52:59.160
is stick to a stable distro, that way you're not fighting quirks, you're just able to focus on the learning experience of it.

52:59.160 --> 53:03.480
I would add on one last thing, and then I'll let it go, and that's something that's not been touched on yet,

53:03.480 --> 53:05.560
is create a problem, find a solution.

53:05.560 --> 53:10.040
Figure out what task you're trying to do, I want to make a mail server, I want to set up a web server,

53:10.040 --> 53:13.720
I want to play with, you know, it's not so much about just diving into what,

53:13.720 --> 53:16.120
I mean, they have to have an identifiable thing to dive into.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.960
And then you'll figure out the pieces in between.

53:17.960 --> 53:19.160
Bingo, that's it.

53:19.160 --> 53:24.040
I think using Linux gave me a whole new outlook on how to do things,

53:24.040 --> 53:27.320
I mean, it's a whole new thought process to try to solve my own problems.

53:27.320 --> 53:28.280
Right, yeah.

53:28.280 --> 53:32.680
You know, there are very good YouTube videos about this, Dan's courses, for example,

53:32.680 --> 53:38.360
Eli, the computer guy, they have really, really good Linux introductions, especially for beginners.

53:38.360 --> 53:39.320
Yeah, yeah.

53:39.320 --> 53:42.680
I was going to say, if you're doing something on Windows, and you move up to Linux,

53:42.680 --> 53:45.160
try and find the Linux version of whatever it was you were doing,

53:45.160 --> 53:46.360
bingo.

53:46.360 --> 53:47.800
Yeah, yeah.

53:47.800 --> 53:49.080
All right, good stuff.

53:49.080 --> 53:51.960
Stand by, we'll read the next email, then we'll see if we need to get any.

53:51.960 --> 53:56.120
Oh, well, this one, I'm just getting beat up a little bit, came in from G, says,

53:56.120 --> 53:57.480
Hey, Chris and Matt.

53:57.480 --> 53:58.440
Well, hey, G.

53:58.440 --> 54:01.640
He says, I'm liking the new show and the format.

54:01.640 --> 54:03.800
Well, I'm not sure if it was intentional.

54:03.800 --> 54:07.640
It seems that Linux Unplugged can be where you all, pardon my Texas speak,

54:07.640 --> 54:10.920
editorialize and take it out of last.

54:10.920 --> 54:14.120
Now, with the pleasantries done, I must share some constructive feedback.

54:14.120 --> 54:17.880
Chris, you have bitched about how you nuked your KDE configuration.

54:17.880 --> 54:21.720
As a credible system administrator, you blasted KDE with no backups?

54:21.720 --> 54:23.400
No backups?

54:23.400 --> 54:24.680
I say, shame on you, sir.

54:24.680 --> 54:27.080
No matter the application, you should have backups.

54:27.080 --> 54:29.480
Even a responsible end user knows you need backups.

54:29.480 --> 54:33.400
I have to admit that I have been burned by a lack of backups, so I can't be too critical.

54:33.400 --> 54:36.120
I started taking daily backups with the following script,

54:36.120 --> 54:38.360
and I've even started to adopt them on my laptop.

54:38.360 --> 54:42.760
So he provided the bash script that he uses, using some rsync foo.

54:42.760 --> 54:47.240
And he says, I'm sure several other ways, and better ways to do it than I have in this script.

54:47.240 --> 54:50.040
I do it like a com- I don't like the compliment sandwich,

54:50.040 --> 54:51.000
but keep up the great work.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.240
Thanks for all the hard work, G7.

54:53.240 --> 54:56.280
So I admitted to that, that I should have had backups.

54:56.280 --> 54:57.000
I do admit.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.480
Well, and I pointed that out to you, Walter, twice myself.

54:59.480 --> 55:02.920
But I also know that you have a lot going on, and truly, you know,

55:02.920 --> 55:04.200
you do have other things going on.

55:04.200 --> 55:07.160
Right, and I even said, like, during the ramp up to the arch challenges,

55:07.160 --> 55:09.560
like, well, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to take snapshots.

55:09.560 --> 55:10.840
That's why I went butter FS.

55:10.840 --> 55:12.280
And I- and I agree.

55:12.280 --> 55:12.760
I agree.

55:12.760 --> 55:16.120
I really have no defense other than- other than- other than-

55:16.680 --> 55:19.320
I- I didn't intend to do anything.

55:19.320 --> 55:21.640
Like, I- all I was doing was I logged out.

55:21.640 --> 55:23.000
I logged into GNOME.

55:23.000 --> 55:26.360
I thought, hmm, I'm going to- I'm going to launch my Plasma Active widgets here,

55:26.360 --> 55:28.840
and just see how that looks, because I've read you can do that.

55:28.840 --> 55:31.960
And all they did was type in Plasma Active, or whatever the command was,

55:32.840 --> 55:35.880
ran it, and that's what destroyed my KDE configuration.

55:35.880 --> 55:39.640
Didn't even cross my mind that I should run a backup before I do that, right?

55:39.640 --> 55:42.120
Because it wasn't true- because you weren't running an update.

55:42.120 --> 55:44.600
You literally just changed desktops and ran Plasma Active.

55:44.600 --> 55:47.960
Yeah, and I've- like, I logged into KDE and ran Nautilus a million times.

55:47.960 --> 55:51.400
So to me, it just- I didn't really appreciate it, I guess.

55:51.400 --> 55:54.840
I didn't appreciate what I was doing, and I had a backup,

55:54.840 --> 56:00.040
but it was, like, two weeks old, and I just felt like, you know, it just wasn't worth it.

56:00.040 --> 56:01.640
And that's why I don't use KDE at all.

56:01.640 --> 56:03.000
I just put that out there.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.320
I- I mean, I admit it was my bad.

56:05.320 --> 56:06.040
It was my bad.

56:06.040 --> 56:07.400
I'm a bad person, I guess.

56:07.400 --> 56:08.040
I should be punished.

56:08.040 --> 56:10.200
But I am really enjoying, uh, Gnome 3.10.

56:10.200 --> 56:13.960
And I'll have my thoughts on Unity, too, which, uh, I won't say anything more.

56:13.960 --> 56:14.520
Because I've already said too much.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.720
No, you gotta save that.

56:15.720 --> 56:16.520
Save that for the big show.

56:16.520 --> 56:17.160
I've already said too much.

56:17.160 --> 56:18.200
I've said too much.

56:18.200 --> 56:21.560
All right, our last email for the day comes in from Mirko.

56:21.560 --> 56:24.360
Mirko, dear Chris and Matt, I'm a longtime fan of LAS.

56:24.360 --> 56:29.880
A Linux user, I use Arch with XFCE and a developer of the game, Boss Constructor,

56:29.880 --> 56:33.080
which is about building and flying your own spaceship.

56:33.080 --> 56:36.120
Based on the games you have covered so far and your sci-fi preferences,

56:36.120 --> 56:38.760
I thought you guys might like this and be interested in the game.

56:38.760 --> 56:42.760
It'd be fantastic if you could mention a link to my Greenlight campaign on the show.

56:42.760 --> 56:45.000
The page includes screenshots and the trailer video.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.320
So, uh, this- how cool is this?

56:47.320 --> 56:47.960
So here's what I love.

56:47.960 --> 56:48.520
Wow.

56:48.520 --> 56:51.480
I love- I'm loving these guys getting their stuff in the Greenlight.

56:51.480 --> 56:57.080
Because it gives these guys a chance to- to, uh, you know, make something that, uh,

56:57.080 --> 56:58.760
it's not- it's not like Kickstarter.

56:58.760 --> 57:00.840
I actually kind of like it better than Kickstarter in some ways.

57:00.840 --> 57:01.320
Oh, yeah?

57:01.320 --> 57:04.360
Uh, because you get- you- uh, and depending on how it works,

57:04.360 --> 57:07.320
you get early access to the game as a contributor.

57:07.320 --> 57:09.800
So it's sort of like the game's already been in development.

57:09.800 --> 57:13.480
So it's not like you're- I don't believe you're funding it from Inception.

57:13.480 --> 57:16.440
You're funding it when it's at a work enough point that Valve says,

57:16.440 --> 57:17.400
all right, put this on here.

57:17.400 --> 57:21.400
And then if it gets Greenlit, I think if you Greenlight the campaign and you fund it,

57:21.400 --> 57:22.920
you get access to the game.

57:22.920 --> 57:24.040
Oh, that's interesting.

57:24.040 --> 57:27.560
And I'm watching this video here of you putting together what looks like a, uh-

57:27.560 --> 57:28.200
Spaceship.

57:28.200 --> 57:28.680
Yeah.

57:28.680 --> 57:29.320
It looks cool.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.600
It looks cool, doesn't it?

57:30.600 --> 57:31.480
Looks very cool.

57:31.480 --> 57:31.720
Yeah.

57:31.720 --> 57:34.120
This is- this is his, uh, game, Boss Constructor.

57:34.120 --> 57:36.760
It's going to be available, of course, for Linux.

57:36.760 --> 57:40.360
And it looks like as you, uh, build it and the- depending on how you build it,

57:40.360 --> 57:42.840
of course, affects its performance, its ability to fly and whatnot.

57:42.840 --> 57:43.400
That's cool.

57:43.400 --> 57:43.640
Yeah.

57:43.640 --> 57:44.120
Yeah.

57:44.120 --> 57:44.520
Yeah.

57:44.520 --> 57:45.480
Uh, oh, cool.

57:45.480 --> 57:49.800
Void- uh, Bowtide Dynamite in the chat room says he voted for this game last night.

57:49.800 --> 57:50.440
Nice.

57:50.440 --> 57:50.680
Yeah.

57:50.680 --> 57:52.920
So guys, go look for Boss Constructor.

57:52.920 --> 57:56.520
Uh, one of our fellow last audience members is creating it and just got on Greenlight.

57:56.520 --> 57:59.880
That- that must be really exciting when you've been working on something and it hits that.

57:59.880 --> 58:02.280
Because if it hits Greenlight and you actually get Greenlit,

58:02.280 --> 58:07.000
then it ends up on Steam and then it's available for sale on the Steam store.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.280
That's got to be really exciting.

58:08.280 --> 58:11.160
Kind of- it reminds me of the, uh, when you end up like with your own infomercial

58:11.160 --> 58:11.880
kind of situation.

58:11.880 --> 58:14.520
It's got to feel like that where you're like, I'm going to be a millionaire.

58:14.520 --> 58:17.880
You know, it's like, how much would you pay for this great game?

58:17.880 --> 58:18.600
Absolutely, right?

58:18.600 --> 58:18.920
Yeah.

58:18.920 --> 58:19.720
I'm not kidding.

58:19.720 --> 58:22.280
So, uh, good luck to you on that one, Mirko.

58:22.280 --> 58:26.440
And, uh, if you guys want to go find, uh, Boss Constructor and give it a- a light.

58:26.440 --> 58:27.800
I guess that's how that works.

58:27.800 --> 58:28.680
I don't- I don't know.

58:28.680 --> 58:32.280
Also, I'll just give a- I'll just give a plug for Super Frog HD, that's a ton of fun.

58:32.280 --> 58:34.360
It's a side-scrolling platformer, so you got to like those.

58:34.920 --> 58:37.480
But, uh, I loaded that up on my machine last night.

58:37.480 --> 58:38.680
And, uh, I totally love that.

58:38.680 --> 58:40.040
All right, I'm going to jump into the mumble channel.

58:40.040 --> 58:40.920
Guys, one last chance.

58:40.920 --> 58:43.480
Anything anybody wants to touch on before we wrap up this episode?

58:45.320 --> 58:45.960
Run down the list.

58:45.960 --> 58:46.520
Last chance.

58:46.520 --> 58:47.240
Clock's running.

58:47.240 --> 58:52.760
No, just the fact that, you know, uh, again, I'd just like to say if there are very, very

58:52.760 --> 58:58.200
serious bugs that you are ignoring in terms of features, then I don't think that should

58:58.200 --> 58:59.960
be something people should do.

59:00.600 --> 59:06.040
Meaning, you know, if you want to push, say, uh, own cloud integration, but not work on

59:06.040 --> 59:10.840
a very serious bug that has existed for, like, God knows how long, then that's a long thing

59:10.840 --> 59:12.200
to do, but that's my opinion.

59:12.200 --> 59:12.760
Yeah.

59:12.760 --> 59:17.240
You are- you are butting up against a complex issue, my friend, because it's an open source,

59:17.240 --> 59:20.280
and so you have people working on the things they want to work on, and sometimes the guy

59:20.280 --> 59:23.880
that might have implemented something that has the bug no longer is on the project anymore.

59:23.880 --> 59:24.760
That happens a lot, actually.

59:24.760 --> 59:25.260
Yeah.

59:25.260 --> 59:31.820
I would argue about the LTS as well, because LTS is a great idea for stability, but when

59:31.820 --> 59:36.940
you take into account the LTS of the apps, that's irrelevant, because there shouldn't

59:36.940 --> 59:38.780
be a lockdown on the apps.

59:38.780 --> 59:42.620
There should be a lockdown on the security, the maintenance, the kernel, stuff like that,

59:42.620 --> 59:44.940
but the app should be freely open.

59:44.940 --> 59:48.220
Yeah, this is what I would think too, Rotten Corps, is I feel like there's a place for

59:48.220 --> 59:53.180
LTS at the underlying underpinning stuff, and then, uh, because, I mean, let's be honest,

59:53.180 --> 59:56.540
we can all sit here all day long and talk about LTS releases, but everyone in this room,

59:56.540 --> 01:00:00.380
if you were stuck with an LTS release, you'd have that thing so PPA'd up in six months

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.900
it'd be ridiculous, right?

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.340
Half the repos your app get checking would probably fail because they'd all been shut

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:05.900
down, right?

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:11.580
I mean, I've been on 13.10 literally for, what, three days, and two of the repos already

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.020
giving me 404 errors.

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.540
It's, I mean-

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.040
Wow.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.820
My project- I have a project that's in the Ubuntu Software Center that hasn't been updated

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:23.660
in a year and a half, because they just won't update it for some reason.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:24.620
That's like-

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:31.180
If the 13.10 has the newest version, whereas every other one has, uh, two stable versions

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:31.740
back.

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.580
What product is that?

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:36.620
Uh, you get Download Manager.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:47.100
It's, uh, 12.04, 12.10, and 13.04 all have 1.8 stable, and we've been on 1.10 for a year.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:52.860
The Ubuntu Software Center is a mess on its best day, in my opinion.

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:54.380
It's a terrible, terrible mess.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.580
Has anyone tried AppGrid?

01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:57.660
Yeah, I've looked at it.

01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:58.300
I haven't tried it yet.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:58.860
Have you tried it?

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:01.260
I mean, the performance is great.

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:06.220
It's closed source, but, uh, it works a hell of a lot better than the Ubuntu Software Center.

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:07.980
Isn't AppGrid being created by Canonical?

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.380
I don't think so.

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.540
Well, I read that it was closed source.

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.500
Well, look at that.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:20.380
Yeah, AppGrid is supposed to be, uh, the replacement for, uh, uh, the software center.

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.660
I thought, I thought they were...

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:25.900
So I'm looking at the maintainer is PGG on, uh, on Launchpad.

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:28.060
I'm looking for a license.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.100
Uh, yeah, you're right.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:29.820
Proprietary.

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.220
You're right.

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.820
It's got a Launchpad 30-day trial commu- uh, commu- commercial license.

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.260
Um, the project's license is proprietary.

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:38.860
Oh, man.

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:42.700
I wonder if this is beta or something and it's keeping it, uh, closed until it launches.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.500
I hope it goes open source.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:45.980
It's great.

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:47.420
Interesting.

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.860
Well, I'll give, I'll give AppGrid a check.

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.300
Now, what, what, uh, distro are you running?

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.820
Are you running on, uh, 1304?

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:55.900
I, uh, used it when I was still on Ubuntu.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:59.340
Now, uh, based on Matt's recommendation, I'm on Manjaro.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.540
Oh, how do you like Manjaro?

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.700
I, I think it's great.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.940
I love, uh, the Arch user repository.

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.440
Yeah.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.500
I wouldn't go back.

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:08.700
Yeah.

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:12.300
The only piece of advice I have there, it's going to keep you from dealing with a lot of people.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.380
Say it's not stable and it's going to break.

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:15.340
That's crap.

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.060
To be honest with you.

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.260
Cause I've been running it for no problems.

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.460
But the main thing is every time there's an update, go to their blog and check what's

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.500
going on before you update.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.700
That's the only piece of advice I have.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.780
Just in case there's something funky you need to be aware of.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:25.900
But otherwise it's pretty cool.

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:28.780
You know, forms are surprisingly active.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.100
Oh yeah.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:29.820
They're quite active.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:30.540
Yeah.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:35.900
You know, I've been using Mint for only a day and now I'm heading back to Arch because it was just

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.260
that bad for me.

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.020
What, what was, what was rough for you?

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:39.180
Yeah.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.220
You got to be specific.

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:40.700
So I understand.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:46.060
It, just the fact that I don't have anything really up to date.

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:48.060
It's very, it's actually slower.

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.660
Ways, but way slower.

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.620
And it's just, I can't stand it.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:57.020
I would give you the package age is definitely different because of the freeze releases.

01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:00.780
And it's definitely absolutely not bleeding edge by any stretch of the imagination.

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.460
But slower.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.340
And I don't know, I can't, I have Arch on another partition.

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.740
I've not, I've not noticed that.

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.060
Yeah.

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.580
No, I meant, I meant Mint as a, Mint is slower.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.300
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:12.540
Mint.

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:12.860
Oh yeah.

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.380
Mint's a total, total.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.340
So I want to go back.

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.260
So this is, this is my thing.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:22.060
So I guess, you know, one of the things about XP was that you could update all of the

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:26.060
applications, but it was the system that, and see, this is not true.

01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:31.340
This, this is where the analogy falls down is so much of this stuff is integrated with the

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.420
repositories that also don't get updated.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:37.500
And I think this is really where it falls down for me because I could actually run,

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:42.380
like I wouldn't want to, but like I could run Ubuntu 12.04 if all of the user land stuff

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.100
stayed up to date.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:48.860
And I'm talking video driver too in that, in that context, but Chromium, Firefox, they,

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:52.620
those are like really the, some of the things that they do manage to stay up to date.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.700
But I'm talking everything, Pidgin, VLC.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.620
I want everything up to date and then you can keep the lower level stuff.

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.500
And, and I wouldn't just argue that might work.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.900
I would argue we've seen that work in the marketplace.

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:05.420
We've seen it work in the enterprise.

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.020
We've seen it work all over the place.

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.540
We've seen that model work.

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:12.380
And I don't understand why we, why maybe we can't break it out a little bit.

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:16.780
You know, break it up, say this, this, this top part of Ubuntu would be rolling.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.340
This lower part would be static and non-changing.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:22.300
And maybe we'd do service packs and things like that.

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:23.900
Those are exactly my thoughts.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.060
I was thinking the exact same thing.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:31.340
I was thinking keep the core stable and frozen, but roll the drivers and the apps.

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.860
That would be a perfect world.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:35.500
Sadly, I don't see too many Linux distributions doing that.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.460
It seems to be all or nothing.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:42.780
Well, it just doesn't work that way because the issue is just, just look at the kernel

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.980
and the kernel guys.

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:49.180
And from that point to every other point in the chain up to the desktop, they're all separate

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:49.820
projects.

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:54.060
They all have their separate agendas and they all have their need to work on the stuff

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:54.700
all the time.

01:04:54.700 --> 01:05:00.060
You just can't say to them, please stop developing your stuff, make it stable.

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:05.100
And next year you can come up with another new version, but please stop developing new

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:05.500
versions.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.780
You just can't do that.

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:09.260
But see, it'll never work in open source.

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:12.540
That'll never work because then they'll say, they'll give you the middle finger and they'll

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:12.860
walk.

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:17.980
So what your alternative is, is to hope that in the process forward, they iterate and make

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.540
it better.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.580
That's kind of our best hope.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:31.020
Our kernel and Gnome are three great examples of an entire vertical stack, which are almost

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:34.860
linked and dependent upon each other.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:42.860
All evolving at the same time to put an old kernel underneath a new Gnome with system

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:43.500
B.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.620
It's going to be real tricky.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.580
Well, that might be a good example of where you have to draw the line.

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:51.980
But then all you really would have to do is say, all right, well, what's the minimum version

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:52.620
we have to get to?

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.220
And then we stay there.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:06:00.060
Although, I think we should probably bring up click packages as Mika too just said in

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:00.540
the chat room.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:06.620
Click packages from Canonical could change up this game a little bit, sort of like PBIs.

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:10.460
Click packages are the new type of installer that are really right now being designed for

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.140
mobile Ubuntu.

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:16.140
But eventually, they could become the new type of installation packages on Ubuntu,

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:20.540
where you download a click package, you click it, and it installs a new version of the

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:21.420
application.

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:29.100
I seem to remember a click package specifically, I think it was KLIK, if I'm not mistaken,

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:29.900
or something like that.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:33.740
And basically, it was distro-independent, and it was self-contained packages, basically

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:37.020
mimicking themselves after the OS X way of doing things.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:38.700
And that was pretty old hat.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.740
And it was dismissed at the time as being stupid, and they were never up to date, and

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.020
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.740
Is that essentially what we're seeing with Ubuntu adopting?

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.700
I mean, is that kind of what we're...

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.500
I don't know if you guys are familiar with that, but it's pretty old school stuff.

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.860
Yeah, I'm going to try and Google it.

01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:00.060
Yeah, I'm going to try and get a URL for you here, if I can find it.

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.460
It was very popular for a while.

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:03.100
Let's see, KLIK.

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:06.540
Oh, that package is already almost like that.

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:10.700
I mean, all you have to do is just go to GW, or something like that.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:10.940
Right.

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:14.300
But this literally was like, I mean, had nothing to do with what...

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:15.260
I mean, oh my God.

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:17.180
Yeah, it was completely on its own.

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:17.820
On its own.

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:18.780
Let me see if I can find it.

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:23.740
To me, this is just Ubuntu or Canonical doing what they do to everything, trying to bring

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:27.580
everything in-house and just recreate the wheel over and over again.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.820
They don't have package dependencies.

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:34.060
They're making a solution for a problem that doesn't need a solution.

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:35.260
Just like me.

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.620
Yeah, that has got a point.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.420
Going along with that.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.380
PBIs have a really good purpose.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:41.260
They're built from...

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.060
Like it's a source distribution in pre-BSD.

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.220
Portable Linux apps is one thing.

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:46.700
Like that.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:50.860
Going along with that is completely different.

01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:54.380
I think that...

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.580
Well, that's a good point.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:08:01.660
I mean, they're going off on their own direction, and I think you could make the argument that,

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:06.860
yes, they're going off in their own direction again, but I don't know if PBIs would work

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:07.180
for them.

01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:09.420
It would be interesting if they could apply something like PBIs.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:11.100
So that's a good point you just made there.

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:16.620
And that's, again, there's a lot of ways to solve this, but we're not there yet.

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:20.060
At least they're talking about going in that direction, right?

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.420
I mean, at least it's not like they apparently are aware of the problem.

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.460
I mean, Click Packages right there very much indicates they're aware of this issue.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.340
Well, here's what pisses me off about all this canonical stuff.

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.820
It's like, oh, we've invented the software center.

01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:36.060
No, you guys went and hired people from Linspire, the guys that used to do the CNR packages.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.260
You didn't invent Squat.

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.500
Now we're doing it again with the Click Packages stuff.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:40.620
This is old hat.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.300
I just sent Chris a link on Skype.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:47.260
I don't know if you're able to get to it or not, but basically it's like they're not inventing

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:47.820
anything.

01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:49.180
They're not really even innovating anything.

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.020
They're basically pretending like they are.

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.900
PortableLinuxApps.org, visit it.

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:54.460
Check it out.

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.260
This is old stuff.

01:08:55.260 --> 01:09:03.340
Yeah, I feel like that same argument is lobbied at Apple, that Apple didn't invent anything.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.780
They're just repackaging it.

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.700
Well, and if they could do it better, that's great, but they didn't.

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:11.900
CNR, quite frankly, as much as people hated Linspire, is better than the software center

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.820
by leaps and bounds.

01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.260
It was just a better experience.

01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:17.100
Linspire sucked, don't get me wrong.

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:17.980
It was horrible.

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:23.180
But CNR, back at the 4.5, 5.0 days, was actually pretty good before they broke it out for all

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:23.980
the distros.

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:25.340
It was actually pretty reasonable.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:30.220
I could have an entire software aisle installed on any machine I wanted by logging in, clicking

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.540
install aisle, and going to have a cup of coffee.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:33.980
It was really simple.

01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:35.980
Yeah, it was a good system.

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:37.660
It was just apt on the back end.

01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:41.340
But again, but now you've got the software center, which is like you've got to jump through

01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:44.620
hoops and hope to God your payment stuff works, and it's horrible.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:49.820
It really frustrates me because I want it to be successful, I really do.

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.780
I care about Ubuntu, but they're not doing it for me right now.

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:54.700
Yeah, I don't use the software center anymore.

01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.060
I don't use it anymore.

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:56.540
No one does.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.060
It's not even in my launch bar.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.700
Yeah, and the packages are out of date.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:04.780
The for-profit stuff is even worse because the folks are sending them the stuff, but as

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.620
it was pointed out in the Mumble Room, it's not being updated.

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:08.700
It's a problem.

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:14.380
Yeah, I think we as Linux users have a tendency to look at the negatives here, and we want

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:18.460
it fixed because we see the problem and we see it for a while.

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:23.660
But I think when you look at the actual strategy that's at play here with these LTS releases,

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:24.860
and those are what we see in Deploy.

01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:25.420
That's what we see.

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:27.420
Ubuntu based on that's what Amazon's running.

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.900
That's what all these people are running is 12.04.

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:34.860
And if you're looking at two different types, there's two different games here.

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:39.660
There's the interim release game that all of the enthusiasts follow and upgrade to,

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:41.100
and there's the LTS game.

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.900
And it's almost like there's two different Ubuntus.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:48.620
There's stable, steady as it goes Ubuntu that's supported for a while, and there's

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:52.540
crazy Ubuntu that's pissing everybody off that does all these kinds of things that nobody

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.500
likes or doesn't do enough, and it's either or.

01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.660
But I have a great thought.

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:04.300
It seems like a problem that only affects probably the niche of the niche.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.820
Well, and for me, I just want to put the tough love out there because I'm not doing it because

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:12.300
I want to see them fail or have a bad day or ruin someone's hard work.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:17.580
I want the people that are making the decisions, not the developers, but the hierarchy further

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:20.940
up the chain to really understand where we're coming from.

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.420
Stop screwing up hard work of your developers.

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:25.660
These guys are doing tremendously awesome stuff.

01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:28.540
And then you guys kind of poo poo it with crap that no one cares about.

01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.620
The software centers was a great example of that.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.580
It was a great idea.

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:32.380
And they did the worst.

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.140
I couldn't have done worse myself.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:34.940
It was horrible.

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:35.900
It's just it's terrible.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.900
I don't even know how they consider that usable.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:48.380
You know, I was trying to end it on a positive note, but I will just point out that if they

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:50.940
hadn't gone off in their own direction with Unity, if like.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:53.260
Sure, and that I agree with you on that.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:53.740
I agree.

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:56.780
I understand there was there's political things that happened.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.700
There was, you know, vision that they needed to execute.

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:03.980
But I believe one of the original one of the original ideas behind Unity was the same UI

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.020
across all these devices.

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:08.380
Now they're kind of custom building you eyes for the TV, for the tablet, for the phone,

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:09.420
for the desktop.

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:14.940
But going back like if somehow like the planets aligned and they hadn't had that break and

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:18.860
like they just like the politics worked out so that way, the known project was cool working

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.740
with them and they were cool with the known project, which I acknowledge was never going

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:22.460
to happen.

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:24.860
It's just, you know, too many alpha dogs in the room.

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:31.740
But now if they were still hitched to that wagon, they could essentially disengage from

01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:35.660
the desktop and completely focus on mobile like they're doing.

01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:40.300
And as long as they packaged everything up, applied a nice theme and worked out some bugs,

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.100
we'd all get brand new toys with our updates.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.300
We'd all get the new stuff.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.420
We'd all get 310.

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.260
We'd all get all this great new stuff.

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:50.940
And they would have they would they wouldn't have to have built an entire desktop.

01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:57.660
And that arguably may have been better initially, but as their focus wanes and Gnome and KDE

01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:03.980
and XFCE and MATE and Cinnamon all progress forward at, you know, with their with their

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:08.300
main focus with what their primary task is, as they all move forward with those things,

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:12.860
they eventually will outpace what has happened or have already outpaced Unity.

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:16.620
And if they weren't even attached to that right now, they'd be reaping those rewards.

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:17.900
That's true.

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:18.460
That's true.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:22.380
And I've come to I mean, well, with Unity, I've been harsh on Unity in the past.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:25.020
You know, I don't necessarily have a problem with it now.

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:29.340
I mean, it's not my go to desktop, but it's it isn't it's not ugly.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:29.980
It really isn't.

01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:31.260
It's not an ugly desktop.

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.620
It's actually quite attractive.

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:36.460
There's some usability paper cuts here and there, but for the most part, I'm OK with it.

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:37.900
You know, I don't have a real problem with it.

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:38.940
I give that a ding, Matt.

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:43.340
Well, I will we'll leave that as a cliffhanger right there because that's where my thoughts

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:48.700
will pick up on the review is now that I've been running KDE and Gnome and I'm now back

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.300
on Unity for the week.

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.700
We'll give our thoughts in the review on Sunday.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:53.020
Oh, yeah.

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.700
This week's Linux action show.

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:58.140
So we'll end it right there because I think that's a good that's a good like jumping off

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:02.060
point for the show kind of sets the stage for Sunday's episode of the Linux action show

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:02.860
right there, Matt.

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:03.820
Well, that's right there.

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.420
I have shaken my fist at the clouds.

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:06.060
I have spoken.

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:06.940
All right.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:10.220
If you want to get a hold of us, emails Linux action show Jupiter broadcasting dot com or

show dot reddit dot com.

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:21.900
Make some noise, make some votes because that that sort of tweaks it molds what we cover.

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.260
It impacts our coverage.

01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:25.420
Plus, we take all of your comments in the context.

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:28.140
So even just tossing your thoughts in a thread help out, too.

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:30.620
Don't forget, you can join us on Tuesdays at two p.m.

Pacific over at JBLive.TV.

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:33.340
Thanks for our mumble room for joining us.

01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:34.220
And Matt, have a great week.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.260
I'll see you on Sunday.

01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:35.740
Sounds good.

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:36.380
See you then.

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:36.860
All right, everyone.

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:40.060
Thanks so much for this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.660
See you right back here next week.

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:53.020
We should have recorded this because I got a question for you guys.

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:56.860
OK, so if if Linux is this ocean of activity.

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:57.260
Right.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:01.980
And Ubuntu is the island that sits above it, that all of the regular consumers see.

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:04.460
And that's where they land on when they find Linux.

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:08.540
And if and if the island's ruined, who steps up?

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.740
Who steps up next?

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.220
Who's it?

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:10.860
SteamOS.

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:11.180
Mint.

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:14.060
Mint and SteamOS.

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:16.700
Why does anyone have to step up?

01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:18.540
I think it's going to be Mint.

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:21.020
It's got to be because they got Cinnamon 2.0 coming out.

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.100
It's going to be, I don't know.

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.780
What about elementary OS?

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.300
What about elementary OS?

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.100
Elementary OS doesn't have enough of an existing base.

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:32.780
And as far as the why someone needs to step up, I think it's a matter of we would have

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:37.980
a void like we did before Ubuntu and post Linspire with the news outlets that those

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:38.940
news outlets matter.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:42.700
If you want to appeal to those news outlets, you damn well better be noober friendly or

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:43.740
newbie friendly.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.780
I don't think elementary gets enough press, honestly.

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:50.300
If they got more press, then perhaps people would be more turned on.

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.380
But, you know, yeah.

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.380
For non-geek people, yes.

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:59.980
But the problem with elementary is that it has...

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.980
It's not going to be Mint or elementary OS.

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:03.260
I think it's going to be SteamOS.

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:06.300
And I think the reason why it's going to be SteamOS is because of Valve.

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.540
Just like Android took off because of Google.

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:12.620
And the reason why even Ubuntu sees the success, the reason why Valve picked Ubuntu is because

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:13.580
of canonical, right?

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:17.100
Because business trusts business, right?

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:21.260
And the problem with both elementary and Mint is while they're fantastic, they're LLCs at

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:21.980
best.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:23.820
You know, one or two guy else.

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.020
Yeah, it's just not simple.

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.500
Whereas SteamOS I think will be.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:33.180
But I think that's going to be a loss because Ubuntu is a full-fledged desktop with your

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:36.860
office suite on there, with a browser, messenger.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:41.740
If we're only looking at a replacement, then SteamOS is probably first in line.

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:45.900
But if anything, I want frigging Ubuntu to fix their frigging problem.

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.660
Swallow their pride and fix their shit.

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:49.500
I would disagree.

01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:55.100
I would say that, you know, Fedora, OpenSUSE, maybe even Arch.

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.460
And I'm saying other distros are...

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.860
But the budget doesn't have to be a pain in the ass.

01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:00.140
It's doing it by choice.

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:01.980
And other distros.

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:05.100
I'm saying other distros are good enough to replace Ubuntu at any time.

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:09.580
Ubuntu is not the only one with stability and with reliability now.

01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:10.380
True.

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:14.380
Now OpenSUSE and Fedora and all of them are very, very good.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.300
So they're perfect alternatives in my opinion.

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:19.660
But the funny thing about all of those you've listed, they've been around longer than Ubuntu

01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:22.540
and none of them have been able to achieve the popularity that Ubuntu did.

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:28.380
Whatever, either it's execution of what their offering is or it's the marketing or whatever

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:33.500
it is, all of those examples were around before Ubuntu and will, yeah, be around after Ubuntu.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.260
But it doesn't mean they're going to get any attention.

01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:41.020
They didn't approach the distro idea like the way Ubuntu did where they want to make

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:42.140
it as easy as possible.

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:42.540
That's right.

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:46.700
They wanted to give as much customization and control as possible.

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:49.100
Whereas people who are coming from Windows do not care.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:57.740
One thing I want to point out is that if anything is going to succeed, it's got to be Ubuntu

01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:02.540
because Mint, Elementary, SteamOS, they all kind of ride on their coattails because they're

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:03.980
all built on Ubuntu.

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.900
So if Ubuntu dies, where do they all go?

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:09.660
I see Mint going to Debian, but I don't know about anything else.

01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:10.460
Elementary dies.

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:17.180
But can we even account SteamOS because SteamOS, it is meant for a living room.

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:22.460
That can't be a replacement for Ubuntu.

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.220
It's gaming focused.

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:28.940
Yeah, it can be a replacement.

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:34.620
So who is the reigning champion, the desktop island of salvation for the fleeing rats,

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:35.660
when Ubuntu sinks?

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.580
I think whatever it is, it has to be pretty.

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:45.980
That's something that a lot of people look over, but when I was first starting on Linux,

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.100
I looked around.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:51.340
I barely knew what distribution was, but I saw this pretty little sidebar and I was like,

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:52.380
ooh, that looks cool.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:55.500
What if it is Chrome OS?

01:18:56.220 --> 01:19:00.540
I think a lot of people are just going to go to a distro and pop and check out what's

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:00.860
out there.

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.420
I don't think there's going to be any one specific distro that's going to fill that

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.180
niche because a lot of people used to serve it.

01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:08.060
If you can't offer a turnkey answer to that, I think you're going to turn away a lot of

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:08.460
switchers.

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:09.020
Oh, you are.

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:10.780
There's going to be a lot of people that are going to go back.

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:12.540
I have a turnkey answer.

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:19.740
It's basically the reason why Ubuntu became such a huge thing is because they took Gnome

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:20.700
and made it really simple.

01:19:21.820 --> 01:19:24.780
That's what Gnome is trying to do by themselves.

01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:31.660
So if Ubuntu dies, the one that's going to take over, it could be a new one, it could

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:35.740
be just one of them that existed, but they're just going to take Gnome and make it just

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:38.540
as easy as Ubuntu was trying to in the first place.

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:41.900
It's about the desktop environment, actually.

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:46.780
Honestly, forget the desktop environment.

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:51.100
It's whatever's the most simple, and the most simple for the majority of people is

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:55.420
the web browser, and then that goes back to Google Chrome and Chrome OS.

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:55.980
I agree.

01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.060
Chrome OS has got the most press right now.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.780
They're going to get all the popularity.

01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:02.060
They're in the stores.

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:03.580
And they're going to add more features.

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:08.300
So by the time this singularity happens, it'll have more desktop,

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.660
like, functionality, I'm sure.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:14.940
They've just presented Chrome OS as a full C, but it doesn't even have an office to it.

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.420
It does.

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:16.620
It's got Google Docs.

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.820
Yeah, it's all going in the web browser.

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:24.780
Speaking of Chrome OS, did you guys see that they had a new Chromebook?

01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:26.380
Yes, I did, and I want it.

01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:29.020
It charges with a micro USB cord.

01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:29.980
That's how you charge it.

01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:30.620
That's crazy.

01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:31.500
What?

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:34.540
As far as it being popular or not popular, let me put this in perspective.

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:37.020
Go to Amazon.com and look up their most popular notebook.

01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.380
It's the Chromebook.

01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:38.940
It's the Chromebook.

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:40.380
Sounds some serious stuff.

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:41.500
Chrome OS is going to be it.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.820
I really think, unfortunately, you know.

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.420
Yeah, there's going to be a replacement.

01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:49.100
It helps that the price is pretty good as well.

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:50.060
Yeah, it does.

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:52.140
Amazon is not where most people go to get their Netflix anyway.

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:54.060
We need to get Linux on hardware.

01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:54.780
That's the issue.

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:56.140
We need to get Linux on hardware.

01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:00.140
What you guys are all really saying is Gen 2 is the winner.

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:01.180
Absolutely.

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:13.660
So, oh yeah, totally.
