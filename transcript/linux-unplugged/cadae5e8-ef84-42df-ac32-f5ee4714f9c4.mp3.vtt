WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
I totally don't mean to be like a Chrome hipster but I am really getting to the point where

00:04.320 --> 00:05.840
it feels like Chrome is way too big.

00:05.840 --> 00:09.000
It's getting – there's way too much stuff and Google doesn't seem to be slowing down

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
at all.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.880
Like they're adding in payments, APIs to the desktop browser in Chrome 60.

00:13.880 --> 00:18.200
They are making it – they're re-engineering the way that it handles your mouse cursor

00:18.200 --> 00:21.720
and they're just – they're doing a lot of improvements so I got to give them credit.

00:21.720 --> 00:25.880
Like it's making steady progress but it's getting a little ridiculous as to the amount

00:25.880 --> 00:30.440
of things that Chrome can do and it's – the versioning is just getting out of control.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.880
It's like version 60 is the new beta.

00:32.880 --> 00:36.240
It's nuts and not that Firefox is too much better.

00:36.240 --> 00:40.520
As we record, they just released version 54 this morning but this is what's awesome

00:40.520 --> 00:46.280
about 54 and maybe Wes, maybe – I know you were joking about switching back to Firefox

00:46.280 --> 00:53.340
but this could be it here because they're bringing the multiple process system to other

00:53.340 --> 00:55.920
operating systems besides Windows.

00:55.920 --> 00:56.920
Hey, that's exciting.

00:56.920 --> 00:57.920
Yeah.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
So it's like –

00:58.920 --> 00:59.920
I have been waiting for that.

00:59.920 --> 01:00.920
Me too.

01:00.920 --> 01:01.920
Me too.

01:01.920 --> 01:02.920
Me too very much.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.440
So it's like I'm looking at – while I'm looking at Chrome right now and I'm going

01:04.440 --> 01:09.560
– there's some extensions like template is just such an awesome extension for composing

01:09.560 --> 01:10.560
our show notes.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.560
It's so great.

01:11.560 --> 01:12.560
What does it do?

01:12.560 --> 01:13.560
Game changer.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.560
It's a game changer.

01:14.560 --> 01:15.560
I don't know about this.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.560
I'm not hip.

01:16.560 --> 01:19.560
It's an extension that lets me – so you see – so take this paragraph right here.

01:19.560 --> 01:24.160
You got a title that's probably like a header 5 maybe or a header 4.

01:24.160 --> 01:26.560
It's probably a header 3 or 4.

01:26.560 --> 01:31.680
Then you have a paragraph here that has some links in it.

01:31.680 --> 01:36.420
It looks like it has two separate links and what I can do which is really great is I can

01:36.420 --> 01:38.640
highlight this text on this webpage.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.640
I can right click.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.800
Everybody is going to steal this from me now.

01:40.800 --> 01:46.800
I can go to template and then I can say quote and link and what's great about it is – so

01:46.800 --> 01:52.200
if I go to text edit here – not test edit but if I go to text edit, what it's produced

01:52.200 --> 01:58.440
for me is simple, easy, clean markdown where it's given me a markdown link for the URL.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.800
It grabs the title of the website.

02:00.800 --> 02:01.800
That's handy.

02:01.800 --> 02:06.560
It looks like it was a header 2 and so it doesn't actually comment a header 2 ironically

02:06.560 --> 02:09.920
but if say there wasn't a header there, it would put the text I selected in a markdown

02:09.920 --> 02:13.720
block quote and then it does reference links for all the URLs in that.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
That's neat.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.720
Yeah.

02:15.720 --> 02:20.320
If you're someone who does this 200 times a day, you can imagine how nice it is to not

02:20.320 --> 02:21.320
have to –

02:21.320 --> 02:22.320
Yeah.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.320
Absolutely.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.320
Yeah.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.320
I mean it's a huge part of what I'm doing for all of our show research all the time

02:25.320 --> 02:30.320
for all the shows every single day and it is so handy especially like when we're on

02:30.320 --> 02:35.080
the air and say Aiki says something that's like really something I want to cite in the

02:35.080 --> 02:38.680
show notes like yeah, go grab this thing here or here's the post where he talks about

02:38.680 --> 02:39.680
this.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.200
I can quickly while I have it up on my screen, grab that text and go drop it –

02:42.200 --> 02:43.240
It's already ready for –

02:43.240 --> 02:45.440
Right in the doc and then it goes out as part of the show notes.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.440
Browser handy.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.440
So I love those things.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.440
No converting.

02:48.440 --> 02:49.440
No messing.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.440
But I bet you somebody out there in the audience could come up with a way that's not a browser

02:52.440 --> 02:56.120
extension because that's what I'm going for here is let's just get off the browser extension

02:56.120 --> 03:01.000
sauce completely and come up with other methods to do that to other ways to process text.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Now I don't know exactly.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
It would have to be probably something that can read my clipboard because I could copy

03:05.000 --> 03:09.080
it into my clipboard and then something that could read my clipboard and output structured

03:09.080 --> 03:13.560
markdown for me would really be all I need and then I could start switching to Firefox,

03:13.560 --> 03:17.560
I could do gnome web, I mean it really wouldn't matter at that point.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.560
And I think that's the direction to go and once I replace some of these things I can

03:21.560 --> 03:26.240
only do in my browser with other tools that are just more operating system based then

03:26.240 --> 03:28.900
I think I'm going to go back to Firefox which should probably be a couple of releases down

03:28.900 --> 03:31.360
the road where this stuff's landing.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.320
It could be one big kumbaya, Wes.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.320
Oh, kumbaya.

03:36.320 --> 03:53.000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 201 for June 13th, 2017.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly talk show that has a show so good this week we

03:57.440 --> 03:59.800
probably should have made it our 200th episode.

03:59.800 --> 04:00.800
My name is Chris.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.800
My name is Wes.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.920
You know what, Wes, sometimes you roll the dice and you have a 200th episode where nothing

04:05.920 --> 04:09.820
happens and then the next week it's like oh damn, now that's the party.

04:09.820 --> 04:13.960
So I'm really excited because we've got some great follow up stories of things we've talked

04:13.960 --> 04:16.600
about recently in the show just a couple of weeks ago.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.700
A project that I think doesn't get enough attention has a new release.

04:20.700 --> 04:23.840
Then we'll get into a couple of news stories that we haven't talked about, do a deep dive

04:23.840 --> 04:28.560
into Fedora's, or I guess Red Hat's cockpit, the security of it, some interesting choices

04:28.560 --> 04:29.560
they've made.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.540
We'll discuss the new Fedora 26 beta as well.

04:33.540 --> 04:37.540
And then the internet's friend, Ikey, that's what I'm calling him now, everyone's favorite

04:37.540 --> 04:44.080
distro maker, joins us to discuss his big news and the resulting huge news for Solus

04:44.080 --> 04:45.080
users.

04:45.080 --> 04:49.160
And then I'm really happy to announce that something that was locked down to Windows

04:49.160 --> 04:53.040
users and proprietary systems will be opened up to all of us.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.960
And it was opened up in such a big way.

04:54.960 --> 05:00.240
And then I was so impressed by the project I did a little deep diving and discovered,

05:00.240 --> 05:05.520
there it is, discovered the source of something magical.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.320
Maybe I'm overselling it a bit, but I can tell you it's better than a keyboard.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.160
If Apple can call a keyboard magical, I'm definitely calling...

05:12.160 --> 05:13.280
Can and does.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.840
Yeah, they can and do currently.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.440
I'm calling this story magical.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.960
And that's more magic than their magic.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.960
So I think it holds up.

05:19.960 --> 05:20.960
I think it holds up.

05:20.960 --> 05:26.680
A lot of good stuff to get into, a lot of fun stuff, and we have ourselves, as always,

05:26.680 --> 05:30.480
a traditional virtual log.

05:30.480 --> 05:32.600
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.600
Time appropriate greetings.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.600
Hello.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
Hello.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.600
Good day.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.600
Hello.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.600
Howdy.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.600
Hi.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.600
Hello.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.600
Hello.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
Howdy.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.600
We'll let them be the judge of if you're overselling this or not.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.600
You think so?

05:44.600 --> 05:45.600
Mm-hmm.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.600
They were so quiet.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.600
They did so good.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.600
I don't know if you heard-

05:48.600 --> 05:49.600
Not a peep.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.160
I paused right before I introduced them because I had to double check the soundbar.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.520
I looked over and I'm like, shit, I didn't mute them.

05:53.520 --> 05:59.800
I usually mute them, but we were just shooting the shit before the show, and so I muted you

05:59.800 --> 06:06.520
and Hai, left them unmuted during the intro, and during that whole set up of the show,

06:06.520 --> 06:08.320
and none of you guys screwed it up.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.320
That is-

06:09.320 --> 06:10.320
We love you.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.440
Really, really, best, best audience in podcasting.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.560
I swear to God, it is so amazing.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.840
You guys are literally more professional than me today.

06:17.840 --> 06:18.840
It's-

06:18.840 --> 06:19.840
By far.

06:19.840 --> 06:20.840
Job well done.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.840
Thank you, Firefox, that I lost my head.

06:23.840 --> 06:24.840
Let's start with some follow-up.

06:24.840 --> 06:31.320
The big Gnome survey that Joey published on OMG Ubuntu, I didn't know when we were going

06:31.320 --> 06:34.120
to... I actually didn't know if we would hear the results.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.120
Could be months.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.120
Sometimes those things don't...

06:36.120 --> 06:38.840
Maybe we'll find out when they ship the LTS version of these.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.840
This is what you wanted.

06:40.840 --> 06:41.840
But no.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.640
No, the results are in, and I don't know.

06:44.640 --> 06:49.520
I don't find them to be too shabby, but I would say overall, my reading of Joey's post

06:49.520 --> 06:51.400
on OMG Ubuntu was a little disappointed.

06:51.400 --> 06:55.620
He was like, well, a little uncommitted on some of this stuff, but check out some of

06:55.620 --> 06:59.560
these numbers, and congrats to OMG Ubuntu for pulling this all in.

06:59.560 --> 07:00.560
Can you hear that?

07:00.560 --> 07:01.560
Yeah, you're squeaking.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.560
That's my chair.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.560
You're so squeaky.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.700
I've got to get some ranch hand on that thing.

07:06.700 --> 07:07.700
Ranch hand, Wes.

07:07.700 --> 07:08.700
That's better than WD-40.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.120
Get some ranch hand.

07:10.120 --> 07:14.460
So a massive 18,330 people took part in the survey.

07:14.460 --> 07:16.280
There were eight questions, if you recall.

07:16.280 --> 07:20.160
They were all optional, and they just asked people to rate how useful they considered

07:20.160 --> 07:26.000
various GNOME extensions on a scale of one to five, one being not useful and a fiver

07:26.000 --> 07:27.600
being very useful.

07:27.600 --> 07:34.320
The first question was about the Dash to Dock extension, and 17,948 people participated

07:34.320 --> 07:41.240
in that question, and 80% of them, Wes, rated Dash to Dock as a three, four, or five.

07:41.240 --> 07:45.800
Eighty percent of people thought at least it was useful.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.880
And this is where I think Joey's maybe a slight disappointment seems to come through to me,

07:49.880 --> 07:51.080
and I don't mean to put words into his mouth.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.920
I might be misreading this, but he says, Dash to Dock's pop, this is, he said it seems like

07:54.920 --> 07:58.200
a slam dunk to him, so Canonical responds, Dash to Dock's popularity doesn't necessarily

07:58.200 --> 08:03.520
mean we should ship Dash to Dock as an extension by default, but rather it shows us our users

08:03.520 --> 08:08.000
would like the Dock to be visible at all times or shown hidden automatically, as opposed

08:08.000 --> 08:11.720
to only shown in the activities view.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.720
He says that sounds uncommittable by Canonical, and sounds like it almost, like their intention

08:15.720 --> 08:18.880
is to persuade Gnome upstream to add Dash to Dock functionality in.

08:18.880 --> 08:19.880
Interesting.

08:19.880 --> 08:24.080
Which sounds like the beginnings of a rift.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.140
You know, I mean, that's how things start.

08:26.140 --> 08:31.320
We got this great idea for notifications, or the way system tray icons should be handled.

08:31.320 --> 08:34.120
Hey, here's some suggestions in code, what do you think?

08:34.120 --> 08:36.680
And Gnome says, well, we've already got that figured out, thanks though.

08:36.680 --> 08:41.000
Yeah, I guess it all depends on how the upstream would take it, right?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.880
Would you want Dash to Dock features built into Gnome?

08:43.880 --> 08:44.880
Would you use that?

08:44.880 --> 08:45.880
Absolutely.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.400
Yeah, I mean, I have it on every Gnome system.

08:48.400 --> 08:56.000
I find, I'm not a big fan of hidden UI elements to begin with, especially for anybody who's

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
using a system for a first time expert user or total noob.

09:00.000 --> 09:06.280
When you rely on certain incantations, aka gestures, or putting your mouse in a certain

09:06.280 --> 09:10.620
corner to get the menu, or knowing that there's a particular button on your keyboard that

09:10.620 --> 09:16.320
you should press to activate that menu, I think you're expecting too much from the end

09:16.320 --> 09:17.320
user.

09:17.320 --> 09:20.920
They sit down in front of most interfaces in their life, and like say their car, or

09:20.920 --> 09:25.240
a drill, or a microwave, and everything's laid out in front of them, and then it's up

09:25.240 --> 09:29.560
to them to deduce how to operate that machinery, and their intelligence will either make them

09:29.560 --> 09:30.960
more successful or less successful.

09:30.960 --> 09:35.220
But when you completely hide the interface from them, there's literally nothing for them

09:35.220 --> 09:36.220
to grok.

09:36.220 --> 09:37.880
There's nothing for them to intuit from it.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.280
There's nothing for them to instinctually poke at.

09:40.280 --> 09:44.600
And so they either have to know, well, on a lot of systems, if I flick up from the bottom,

09:44.600 --> 09:48.480
or I know that on Windows, if I press this key, it brings up the start menu, which most

09:48.480 --> 09:50.480
users don't know.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.540
I find it to be poor UI design.

09:53.540 --> 09:56.000
So yes, to me, dash to dock is a must.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.120
Just like I also agree with 90% of the respondents who said that top icons is useful, 90% of

10:02.120 --> 10:05.600
the respondents say, yeah, we want top icons.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.820
And I think, again, this is another one of those, you have this little nubbin that likes

10:09.820 --> 10:13.960
to sit there and flatulate down in the corner of your GNOME desktop.

10:13.960 --> 10:18.280
And it's irritating as fuck, especially when you have a full screen application, which,

10:18.280 --> 10:20.440
by the way, GNOME encourages you to use.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.920
So anytime you're interacting with the UI down there, you have this stupid little thing

10:23.920 --> 10:26.120
flatulating down there.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.120
Nobody likes it.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.180
Plus, again, it's hidden UI.

10:29.180 --> 10:35.160
And so I can completely become unaware that I've left Meleus sucking down resources in

10:35.160 --> 10:38.700
the background when it hides the icons, or that Skype is logged in.

10:38.700 --> 10:42.320
These are things that I like to have a heads up display about.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.880
So I am aware of these applications sucking down resources in the background.

10:45.880 --> 10:49.120
You're saying your shell should tell you about the applications that you're running?

10:49.120 --> 10:50.120
Yeah.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.120
And I think most GNOME users agree.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.080
And so there's certain obvious things like this that I think if Canonical were to go

10:54.080 --> 10:57.400
to GNOME and say, well, duh, guys, you should be doing it this way, they'd go, well, screw

10:57.400 --> 10:58.400
you.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
We intentionally didn't design it that way.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.600
I don't know.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
Maybe I...

11:02.600 --> 11:04.920
Ike, do you think my reading of this is too extreme?

11:04.920 --> 11:05.920
No.

11:05.920 --> 11:10.920
Well, not overly extreme.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.920
Appropriately extreme.

11:11.920 --> 11:12.920
I find...

11:12.920 --> 11:13.920
Yeah.

11:13.920 --> 11:14.920
I mean, I guess...

11:14.920 --> 11:15.920
An appropriate level of extremity.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.440
So I find some of these answers, too, to be pretty obvious.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.440
Would you agree with that?

11:19.440 --> 11:20.440
Yeah.

11:20.440 --> 11:27.120
I mean, if you compare what Ubuntu was shipping before versus what they're going to go now,

11:27.120 --> 11:31.800
a lot of it feels polar opposite and isn't going to be discoverable by their user base.

11:31.800 --> 11:35.360
So if you look at things like top icons, they're kind of a must-have.

11:35.360 --> 11:38.920
And as for the dash to the dock, well, that kind of speaks for itself.

11:38.920 --> 11:42.520
I meant to say that perhaps it's not as important.

11:42.520 --> 11:45.480
It doesn't quite add up in my head.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.600
Maybe it's just me.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.600
Yeah.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.600
They...

11:50.600 --> 11:57.200
I can totally see them either implementing it on their own or just shipping the extensions.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.300
I don't think Canonical has to play hardliner here.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.600
So they have sort of an advantage.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.560
Okay, if you guys want to do it upstream, we are happy to do that.

12:05.560 --> 12:09.300
But if you don't want to, we will package up these extensions and we'll maintain them

12:09.300 --> 12:13.080
and make sure that we test them before we ship you package upgrades to Gnome and...

12:13.080 --> 12:14.080
Yeah.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.080
I mean, that's...

12:15.080 --> 12:16.080
That'll be our cross to bear.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.080
Either of those sound okay.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.080
Yeah.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.880
So practically to end users, I think they'll still get the functionality.

12:19.880 --> 12:23.820
It was the most divisive result.

12:23.820 --> 12:24.820
Can you guess what it was?

12:24.820 --> 12:27.360
Of course, you'd have to remember all of the different options.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.640
So it's not a fair question.

12:28.640 --> 12:35.440
But it's one that Joe and I just talked about on Linux Action News on Monday.

12:35.440 --> 12:42.440
No top left hot corner and the applications menu, which is, I think, pretty not surprising

12:42.440 --> 12:45.440
because we've also talked about on this show, they were the biggest deviations from Gnome's

12:45.440 --> 12:46.440
core design.

12:46.440 --> 12:47.440
Right.

12:47.440 --> 12:52.800
The applications menu gives you that drop down applications and the left trigger area,

12:52.800 --> 12:53.800
which is normal.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.960
I think really Gnome was almost reliant on people accidentally triggering it to discover

12:56.960 --> 12:59.880
how to use the desktop.

12:59.880 --> 13:00.880
It's inevitable.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.880
It will happen.

13:01.880 --> 13:02.880
And then the last one, which is cut right down the middle.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.520
And this is the one Joe and I were talking about, actually.

13:05.520 --> 13:12.600
Window controls, left or right, which on 1710 beta right now, or alpha, they're on the left.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.600
Like a Mac.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.600
Like a damn dirty Mac.

13:14.600 --> 13:15.600
I don't really care.

13:15.600 --> 13:16.600
I don't know, whatever.

13:16.600 --> 13:17.600
I know how to close a window.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.600
Why the hell is it not configurable?

13:18.600 --> 13:19.600
Yeah.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.600
I mean...

13:20.600 --> 13:21.600
I suppose that could be.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.600
Yeah.

13:22.600 --> 13:28.480
If I switch over to Arc, do they stay on the left?

13:28.480 --> 13:31.360
That would be a bit of a pain in the butt.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.840
Anyways, so there you go.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.680
Follow up on the survey results.

13:35.680 --> 13:41.040
I find the whole thing to be sort of a good inclination, or a good, not inclination, but

13:41.040 --> 13:48.160
a good forecasting or foreshadowing of where all this is going.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.240
And I'm really kind of happy we got to see some of the results.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.240
I wasn't sure.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.240
It doesn't tell us what their decisions are going to be.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.240
No, it does not.

13:53.240 --> 13:58.560
But hopefully we'll see some upstream activity or, I don't know, actual decisions forthcoming.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.680
You know, in some ways, I'm really glad they're not saying what their decisions are, because

14:01.680 --> 14:09.120
it gives them the opportunity to try different things out, go all in on an idea.

14:09.120 --> 14:12.600
Yeah, hopefully they can land on an idea that it will actually work and they can invest

14:12.600 --> 14:13.600
in it.

14:13.600 --> 14:18.600
It allows them to bounce around without being constrained by the things they've promised.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.400
So it's probably a good thing that they're not.

14:20.400 --> 14:26.320
And really, the core truth will just be whatever ships.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.320
Yeah, right.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.320
Exactly.

14:28.320 --> 14:32.080
So, okay, one more story that's sort of breaking today as we record the show.

14:32.080 --> 14:39.280
I've been trying to do these sort of at the top, not to take away from less news coverage.

14:39.280 --> 14:42.560
I've been doing a little less news coverage in this show and trying to do more community

14:42.560 --> 14:50.360
stuff, more project stuff, more things that I think are applicable to daily Linux users,

14:50.360 --> 14:51.760
people who live and breathe in Linux.

14:51.760 --> 14:57.800
But stuff that's really super news-heavy and headlining, I'm sort of saving for Linux action

14:57.800 --> 14:58.800
news.

14:58.800 --> 14:59.800
That makes sense.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.640
So I'm kind of shifting some of the tone of some of this stuff to be more like community

15:02.640 --> 15:07.480
projects and things that are sort of underreported but really great sources of discussion or

15:07.480 --> 15:09.880
really interesting things happening at.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.800
I've been enjoying it more and more.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.800
And one of the projects I'm kind of including in that, because I don't think it really gets

15:14.800 --> 15:19.160
a lot of discussion, it's maybe just more of a small community focus.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.960
People who love it really know it, but we never really discuss it.

15:21.960 --> 15:22.960
It's Open Media Vault.

15:22.960 --> 15:28.760
And Open Media Vault 3 actually shipped today.

15:28.760 --> 15:32.680
It was close to shipping when I reviewed Open Media Vault months ago.

15:32.680 --> 15:36.200
And so it is using Debian 8, Jesse, as you would probably expect.

15:36.200 --> 15:41.440
They've totally quote-unquote refactored the back end, and they have quote-unquote adapted

15:41.440 --> 15:43.240
that back end to SystemD.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.320
Hey, moving with the times.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.320
That's good to see.

15:46.320 --> 15:50.920
It seems like that's probably kind of obvious since Debian made the switch to SystemD.

15:50.920 --> 15:51.920
Anyways...

15:51.920 --> 15:53.640
Hey, they wrote new unit files.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.080
Yeah, that's true.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.700
Also added support for Extended FAT, which would be nice for people hooking up external

15:58.700 --> 16:00.920
devices to import them into their Open Media Vault.

16:00.920 --> 16:01.920
LVM snapshots?

16:01.920 --> 16:05.160
Yeah, and LVM snapshots is good.

16:05.160 --> 16:09.320
And improved USB and rotational storage device detection.

16:09.320 --> 16:13.600
I brought this one up because I think this is a direction I want to go with the Open

16:13.600 --> 16:16.040
Media Vault server I set up for Angela months ago.

16:16.040 --> 16:20.680
Because I was considering setting up another one here at the studio eventually.

16:20.680 --> 16:25.320
And then setting up some sort of rotational backup system between her place and this place.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.320
That would be pretty slick.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.820
Yeah, a little off-site exchange.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.400
And maybe something like, because we're talking terabytes and terabytes and terabytes and

16:30.400 --> 16:31.480
terabytes of data.

16:31.480 --> 16:37.020
So maybe something like, maybe I could do the initial moving of data would still probably

16:37.020 --> 16:38.020
take days.

16:38.020 --> 16:41.960
And then it sinking over the internet would probably be sufficient after that.

16:41.960 --> 16:42.960
I don't know.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.640
But I was considering, so I was really happy to see that go into Open Media Vault 3 as

16:46.640 --> 16:47.640
well.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.640
No more I-386 though.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.640
Yeah.

16:49.640 --> 16:53.600
I mean, you can still install it, I guess, but they will no longer be making an ISO image.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.400
Yeah, at first I was like, so what?

16:56.400 --> 16:59.820
But then I was like, actually, one of the really nice things about FreeNAS and Open

16:59.820 --> 17:06.260
Media Vault is this whole take something that you are maybe going to toss or has been sitting

17:06.260 --> 17:11.240
around in your garage or whatever for months or years and get new life, get new use out

17:11.240 --> 17:12.240
of it.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.240
Yeah, that's true.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.240
This is my old rig.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.240
I don't need much.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.640
I'm not doing a crazy array, but I can buy a little extra RAM, put some disks in it.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.720
That's a good point.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.200
You know, Mr. West, last week was our 200th episode.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.200
Is that right?

17:24.200 --> 17:25.200
I know.

17:25.200 --> 17:29.200
And in tradition, we were pretty unplanned, pretty unorganized.

17:29.200 --> 17:34.940
I mean, this is the quote unquote unplugged show, which suffers from time to time from

17:34.940 --> 17:35.940
proper planning.

17:35.940 --> 17:37.880
I admit that is part of it.

17:37.880 --> 17:39.160
It is a design flaw, if you will.

17:39.160 --> 17:42.580
But we are making up for it in a big way.

17:42.580 --> 17:49.720
On America's birthday, Tuesday, July 4th, 2017, we will be having a virtual lug become

17:49.720 --> 17:50.720
a real lug.

17:50.720 --> 17:51.720
Wow.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.720
How about that?

17:52.720 --> 17:53.720
It's not virtual when you're going to actually be here.

17:53.720 --> 17:54.720
It's hard not to say, though.

17:54.720 --> 17:59.040
We are inviting you, the lug out there, to come join us in person here at the J.B.

17:59.040 --> 18:05.080
One studio for a little barbecuing, or Noah has advised me to call it grilling.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.080
Fair enough.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.080
They've been advised by my counsel.

18:07.080 --> 18:11.080
We didn't invite him, so it's fine.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.840
You should tell him he's not invited, because then he would show up.

18:13.840 --> 18:14.840
Oh, yeah.

18:14.840 --> 18:15.840
Right.

18:15.840 --> 18:16.840
That's a little-

18:16.840 --> 18:17.840
Disinvite.

18:17.840 --> 18:18.840
Little Noah trick for you there.

18:18.840 --> 18:19.840
Tell him he can't do something, and he'll do it.

18:19.840 --> 18:20.840
Sorry, Noah.

18:20.840 --> 18:21.840
You can't come.

18:21.840 --> 18:22.840
You just absolutely cannot come.

18:22.840 --> 18:23.920
I don't think you could pull it off.

18:23.920 --> 18:24.920
I don't think you have the means to-

18:24.920 --> 18:25.920
It's not really your crowd.

18:25.920 --> 18:26.920
Yeah.

18:26.920 --> 18:27.920
And I just don't think you could make it happen.

18:27.920 --> 18:28.920
So there you go.

18:28.920 --> 18:29.920
Maybe now we'll see him.

18:29.920 --> 18:30.920
Yeah.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.880
So that'll be streamed to some degree.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.280
I'm not exactly sure how the hell we're going to do that, since we'll be outside.

18:37.280 --> 18:43.080
But people have, well, it's already been committed, so I'm going to try to make that work.

18:43.080 --> 18:47.800
I wasn't conferred with on that decision, but I can try to make it happen.

18:47.800 --> 18:48.800
But be here.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.200
Dustin's going to also be here sous-viding.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.880
I might have another sous-vide going.

18:51.880 --> 18:52.880
We don't know.

18:52.880 --> 18:53.880
Oh.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.880
There has been rumors of ribs as well.

18:55.880 --> 19:00.520
Wes, if you've got any inclinations of something you'd like to make, you are welcome.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.520
Okay.

19:01.520 --> 19:06.960
Like a nice, I don't know, macaroni and cheese, I don't know, fruit salad, I don't know.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.080
Oh, I could bring some Hawaiian mac salad, yes.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.080
What?

19:10.080 --> 19:11.080
Really?

19:11.080 --> 19:12.080
Heck yes, I can do that.

19:12.080 --> 19:13.080
Okay, there you go.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.080
Absolutely.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.080
Coming right up.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.080
Shit, I wouldn't want to get down on that.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.600
Anyways, we're going to celebrate 200 weeks, I think without interruption too, of the Unplugged

19:17.600 --> 19:25.080
program on July 4th, which is not too long before I hit the road and head off to Montana.

19:25.080 --> 19:29.720
So we'll talk a little bit about that in user error, but I will be gone shortly after that.

19:29.720 --> 19:33.720
I think actually, I think I leave the weekend after that barbecue.

19:33.720 --> 19:37.880
So we have the barbecue on the 4th of July, yeah, and then I leave on the 14th.

19:37.880 --> 19:43.400
So I'll be back, I'll be here for one Unplugged after our barbecue one, and then I'll be on

19:43.400 --> 19:44.400
the road.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.640
If we survive.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.380
If the studio doesn't get burned down.

19:47.380 --> 19:50.340
So if you're going to be able to make it, I don't think we're having, you know, probably

19:50.340 --> 19:53.960
it's going to be a small crowd, because not only is it only people in our neck of the

19:53.960 --> 19:57.820
woods are going to be able to make it, which is, you know, a tiny percentage of the audience,

19:57.820 --> 20:01.160
but then half the people that go, they say they're going to go, don't show.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.880
People have, you know, jobs and kids and lives.

20:03.880 --> 20:04.880
We get that.

20:04.880 --> 20:08.520
Of course, I'm going to buy enough food for all the people that say they're going.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.520
So those of you who do make it, we're going to eat food, it's going to be great.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.040
We're going to have a very food coma episode that week.

20:14.040 --> 20:17.460
Anyways, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

20:17.460 --> 20:22.760
If you think you could make it, we'd really like to see you and toss in there, we got

20:22.760 --> 20:23.920
a little conversation going.

20:23.920 --> 20:28.200
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting to have Wes and Chris cook for you.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.200
That's right.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.200
That's what we're doing for 200 episodes.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.200
What the hell?

20:32.200 --> 20:33.200
Who thought?

20:33.200 --> 20:34.200
That was my idea, too.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.200
They should be cooking.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.200
Make it more work for us.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.200
They should be.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.680
Damn it, Wes!

20:38.680 --> 20:39.680
Take this down.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.680
Take this down, Wes.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.840
For episode 300, the audience cooks for us, okay?

20:42.840 --> 20:43.840
Thank you.

20:43.840 --> 20:44.840
Yep.

20:44.840 --> 20:45.840
Make a memo.

20:45.840 --> 20:46.840
Yeah.

20:46.840 --> 20:47.840
Thank you.

20:47.840 --> 20:48.840
Thank you.

20:48.840 --> 20:49.840
Okay.

20:49.840 --> 20:50.840
Next time, you know, I'm new to this.

20:50.840 --> 20:51.840
I'm still learning.

20:51.840 --> 20:52.840
Someday.

20:52.840 --> 20:53.840
Someday.

20:53.840 --> 20:58.760
I'm gonna go there to support the show, and if you sign up, you'll get either if you bring

20:58.760 --> 21:01.160
a device or if you got no device, you're gonna get a great deal.

21:01.160 --> 21:06.280
You get $25 in either purchase power off a phone or $25 in service credit.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.280
Now, you're like, Chris, $25?

21:07.280 --> 21:10.440
Yeah, I know it's $25, because $25 matters.

21:10.440 --> 21:17.280
Average ting line, it's gonna be $23 per month per phone, so you get $6 just for the line.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.800
I'm gonna break this down for you right now.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.800
Ready, Wes?

21:19.800 --> 21:20.800
Ready?

21:20.800 --> 21:21.800
Like you never heard before.

21:21.800 --> 21:22.800
Let's hear it.

21:22.800 --> 21:23.800
Let's hear it.

21:23.800 --> 21:24.800
That's what you use.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.440
That's what you pay for the minutes, the messages, and the megabytes.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.840
Oh, I got the chair squeak in there, too.

21:29.840 --> 21:30.840
That was good.

21:30.840 --> 21:31.840
I hope that showed up on mic.

21:31.840 --> 21:32.840
Hold on.

21:32.840 --> 21:33.840
Let me see.

21:33.840 --> 21:34.840
Hold on.

21:34.840 --> 21:35.840
Did I get it in there?

21:35.840 --> 21:36.840
Did I get it in there?

21:36.840 --> 21:41.160
See, the chair squeak's important, because that tells you I'm a thrifty person, and so

21:41.160 --> 21:42.160
you can trust my recommend.

21:42.160 --> 21:43.600
He's not spending money all over town.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.080
No, no, because I'm gonna buy equipment for the studio.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.080
No.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.080
It literally impacts the broadcast.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.080
It affects the job.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.080
You know what?

21:51.080 --> 21:52.080
I'll tell you what.

21:52.080 --> 21:55.200
When I see a good deal, I'll get a chair, and when I saw a good deal, I win it, and

21:55.200 --> 21:56.200
I got Ting.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.200
Lytics.ting.com.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.480
That's where you go to support the show and get the $25 credit.

21:59.480 --> 22:02.040
Now, I think you're probably gonna have a device that'll work.

22:02.040 --> 22:09.120
Check their BYOD page to be sure, but they got a CDMA network, and they got a GSM network,

22:09.120 --> 22:13.320
and so that's a lot of network, and that means it's gonna work with a lot of phones.

22:13.320 --> 22:18.180
You have a great dashboard, nationwide coverage, no contracts, no early termination fee.

22:18.180 --> 22:22.440
You just pay for what you use, however much you talk, however much you text, however much

22:22.440 --> 22:24.320
data you use, that's what you pay for.

22:24.320 --> 22:28.280
Like me, I'm all on the Telegram.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.960
A month or more since I've gotten a text message?

22:31.960 --> 22:37.720
What I tend to get is either an SMS alert about a system being down or a two-factor

22:37.720 --> 22:40.400
thing on one of my services that I use.

22:40.400 --> 22:46.280
That's maybe like three or four text messages, maybe one a week.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.720
There's no way I'd want to pay for more than that.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.680
It's just a waste of money.

22:51.680 --> 22:52.840
Pissing in the wind, is that the saying?

22:52.840 --> 22:53.840
Like throwing money into the wind?

22:53.840 --> 22:54.840
Mm-hmm.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.880
Yeah, well, I'd be like pissing on money and throwing it in the wind, which then it would

22:56.880 --> 22:57.880
just come back wet and smack me in the face.

22:57.880 --> 22:58.880
No one wants it.

22:58.880 --> 22:59.880
It's gross now.

22:59.880 --> 23:00.880
You've ruined the money.

23:00.880 --> 23:01.880
It's super gross.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.880
I don't care.

23:02.880 --> 23:03.880
I don't care.

23:03.880 --> 23:04.880
I just don't want it.

23:04.880 --> 23:05.880
It's a waste of money.

23:05.880 --> 23:06.880
It was literally a waste of money.

23:06.880 --> 23:08.080
Linux.ting.com.

23:08.080 --> 23:11.880
Great devices, either from Ting directly or you can bring your own, and they have fantastic

23:11.880 --> 23:16.240
customer service, great dashboard, and a blog that I follow.

23:16.240 --> 23:21.600
This one, I'm going to put out there as probably the best retrospective I've read on Pokemon

23:21.600 --> 23:22.600
Go.

23:22.600 --> 23:26.720
Looking back at it, really what it was about was augmented reality becoming a thing, and

23:26.720 --> 23:28.680
I think long-term that's what we're going to take away.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.520
You don't really see people walking around playing.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.520
Write a passage for AR there.

23:32.520 --> 23:33.520
Exactly.

23:33.520 --> 23:38.080
So it's a really good write-up on it, and on AR in general and the state of AR and the

23:38.080 --> 23:42.040
market and where it's going and the different vendors that are getting in on it, including

23:42.040 --> 23:45.320
Google and Apple and even Facebook in there and Samsung.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.400
It's just a great write-up.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.840
Start if you want to read that, but start by going to linux.ting.com.

23:49.840 --> 23:53.520
They've got a picture of a dog with a Ting sticker too.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.520
Linux.ting.com.

23:54.520 --> 23:58.000
You go there, look around, and even if you're not ready to switch to Ting, I recommend their

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
blog.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.580
It's a good resource for pretty much any enthusiast out there, linux.ting.com.

24:03.580 --> 24:07.840
It's a shame our friends from Canonical couldn't join us this week because I'm about to talk

24:07.840 --> 24:13.400
about their favorite subject right now, and that would be snap packages.

24:13.400 --> 24:18.240
Snap packages have finally gotten something that flat packs can do, and they essentially

24:18.240 --> 24:20.140
make the snap packs smaller.

24:20.140 --> 24:22.360
So take Corebird, a Twitter client.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.760
It's about two megabytes.

24:23.760 --> 24:31.880
The flat pack would be about 12 megabytes, and the snap of Corebird, 112 megabytes.

24:31.880 --> 24:32.880
That's good, right?

24:32.880 --> 24:35.400
I mean, you get more software that way.

24:35.400 --> 24:40.800
Holy, holy, holy shit.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.800
Holy shit.

24:41.800 --> 24:46.240
The thing is that flat packs are able to take advantage of shared GNOME stuff, like stuff

24:46.240 --> 24:52.120
outside of just that flat pack, like the GNOME platform runtime.

24:52.120 --> 24:55.920
So snaps are essentially getting functionality close to this now.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.880
That's my rough understanding.

24:57.880 --> 25:03.120
Like I said, I don't want to misrepresent what it is, but my understanding is that now

25:03.120 --> 25:08.280
if there is a GNOME platform snap, you could pull that in as part of Corebird.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.720
So I think you would still be pulling that stuff down if you don't have it originally.

25:10.720 --> 25:14.240
Right, but it's then going to be shared across different apps that I'll use now.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.240
Yeah.

25:15.240 --> 25:18.080
Eike, do you have a better understanding of any of this than I do?

25:18.080 --> 25:19.080
I'm assuming you must.

25:19.080 --> 25:23.240
Yeah, I mean, they're basically doing the same sort of thing at the moment as flat pack

25:23.240 --> 25:24.240
is doing.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.000
That's basically what it comes down to, bundling up the shared library.

25:27.000 --> 25:34.520
So you've got this shared, dare I say, dependency to de-duplicate the dependencies between the

25:34.520 --> 25:35.520
apps.

25:35.520 --> 25:39.580
So while the app may appear smaller, you still have that initial cost of that runtime.

25:39.580 --> 25:42.480
So once you've installed one app, it's shared between loads of them.

25:42.480 --> 25:43.480
Yeah.

25:43.480 --> 25:46.120
And at the moment, I believe it's limited to GNOME only.

25:46.120 --> 25:51.560
I'm not really sure how scalable this is going to result in being, though.

25:51.560 --> 25:54.720
Because while the GNOME is a very specific platform, if you start getting things that

25:54.720 --> 26:00.760
have these custom patch libraries and that, it's not going to work there.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.820
Since things are bundled in their own libraries, you just can't de-duplicate them.

26:03.820 --> 26:05.200
So time will tell.

26:05.200 --> 26:07.720
I mean, it's an early start, but it's a good start.

26:07.720 --> 26:11.720
Time will tell if people don't end up just bundling their own GTK stuff so that way it

26:11.720 --> 26:15.240
works and is stuck to the versions they expect and has the right theming and functionality.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.040
That option's there now.

26:17.040 --> 26:20.120
Some may use the shared stuff, and some people may find it's just more practical to just

26:20.120 --> 26:21.120
bundle it all themselves.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.840
I don't know.

26:22.840 --> 26:27.860
Speaking of flat packs, though, there is a bit of a fundraiser for infrastructure for

26:27.860 --> 26:34.200
Flat Hub, which I think Flat Hub is a necessary thing if we're going to have...

26:34.200 --> 26:35.680
Flat packs are going to be sustainable.

26:35.680 --> 26:40.040
You don't want to get them from GitHub and then compile them yourself, Chris?

26:40.040 --> 26:44.840
Or some GNOME developer's blog where he just updates it every few months with new links.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.120
No, that's not been working for me very well.

26:47.120 --> 26:51.120
What I like what Robert's doing here, Robert McQueen, is he also is intentionally trying

26:51.120 --> 26:55.160
to make this outside of GNOME.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.840
This is more than GNOME.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.960
This is a bigger deal.

26:58.960 --> 27:04.220
The GNOME Foundation agreed to support Flat Hub by offering support for legal advisors

27:04.220 --> 27:05.220
and whatnot.

27:05.220 --> 27:08.800
So they sat down with them to figure out the best way to get the initial ball rolling in

27:08.800 --> 27:09.800
all of this.

27:09.800 --> 27:15.320
And GNOME has also offered their sysadmin to help with some of the setup and monitoring.

27:15.320 --> 27:19.660
But his intention is to keep Flat Hub infrastructure independent from GNOME so they can make their

27:19.660 --> 27:24.360
own app decisions about making it easier to install proprietary apps, collecting donations

27:24.360 --> 27:28.400
for app authors, et cetera.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.960
So he wants to build up an infrastructure.

27:30.960 --> 27:38.080
And he's trying to raise, I think, 100 pounds, no, I'm sorry, 800.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.520
And he's already raised, as of this post, 532.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.520
Oh, that's great.

27:41.520 --> 27:48.640
But it looks like it's a paypal.me slash ramcq if you want to donate, paypal.me slash ramcq.

27:48.640 --> 27:54.040
I think if you're perhaps, I don't know if this is a thing that exists in our audience,

27:54.040 --> 27:58.560
but if you're an end user who's an advocate of Flatpaks, this seems like a pretty good

27:58.560 --> 28:00.080
thing to get behind.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.380
The Flat Hub.

28:02.380 --> 28:06.880
And I applaud Robert's decision to try to keep it a separate thing.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.000
I think that's a really good idea.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah, I think so too.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.560
It's obviously, you know, it's a very useful GNOME tool.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.960
But speaking of GNOME and Red Hat, and well, why not mention Fedora?

28:14.960 --> 28:17.760
Fedora 26 beta is out today as we record.

28:17.760 --> 28:18.760
Ah, I lied.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.320
There was one more hat-breaking story today.

28:21.320 --> 28:25.740
And I was going to come on here and give you like my first takes.

28:25.740 --> 28:26.740
So I downloaded it.

28:26.740 --> 28:32.160
I installed it, and...

28:32.160 --> 28:33.160
You converted.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.880
No, I mean, it's Fedora.

28:35.880 --> 28:40.600
It's great, I mean, it's fine.

28:40.600 --> 28:41.600
It's fine.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.600
It's fine.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.240
It's just a revving of Fedora.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.240
It's like GNOME 3.24.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.240
A quiet march.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.560
Yeah, it's exactly, yeah, it's exactly it.

28:49.560 --> 28:55.240
So I checked out Fedora Workstation, and it's got a new background, which is the one I have

28:55.240 --> 28:59.320
up on the screen right now, and that was what I took away from it.

28:59.320 --> 29:04.560
You know, because if you're already on GNOME Current, there's nothing different.

29:04.560 --> 29:09.100
So when you install Fedora 26, it's just GNOME 3.24, and it's great, it's fine.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.100
It looks like a good, solid release.

29:10.100 --> 29:14.080
I installed it with no issues, the performance was fine, but I don't have anything else to

29:14.080 --> 29:15.080
report.

29:15.080 --> 29:20.200
I thought I'd have a nice little bit of journalism moment there and do a little deep dive on

29:20.200 --> 29:25.680
a topic, and I walked away with a realization that this is why distro reviews are not really

29:25.680 --> 29:28.440
a thing I do anymore, because there's just nothing there to really talk about.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.280
It's a great release, and if you want to...

29:30.280 --> 29:33.680
Where if you want an uncanny valley of distro reviews, where it's just good enough.

29:33.680 --> 29:38.240
It's like, what it is, it sounds like what Mark Shuttleworth was talking about early

29:38.240 --> 29:41.320
on, where they're like, we're just going to ship GNOME, and we're not really going to

29:41.320 --> 29:45.760
touch it, and if you just want a GNOME workstation, fine.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.440
That's what this is.

29:47.440 --> 29:51.720
If you want a nice workstation, and it has GNOME, and it's got a decent package manager

29:51.720 --> 29:52.720
on it, fine.

29:52.720 --> 29:53.720
Have it.

29:53.720 --> 29:54.720
Done.

29:54.720 --> 29:55.720
You're good.

29:55.720 --> 29:56.720
They're not screwing around.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.800
Yeah, so that's what it is.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.280
So instead, I decided to spend-

30:00.280 --> 30:04.600
I would listen to a whole thing where you just gave really sarcastic and unenthusiastic

30:04.600 --> 30:07.520
reviews or short little summaries of distros.

30:07.520 --> 30:13.680
I was actually thinking about doing a special for the patrons called the Linux Critic, where

30:13.680 --> 30:14.680
I would just do that.

30:14.680 --> 30:15.680
That sounds fun.

30:15.680 --> 30:16.680
Yeah, you should.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.600
You should do that publicly, because I don't want to hurt feelings.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.160
Yeah, there's bridges and all those.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.160
Yeah, exactly.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.160
Yeah, it always causes controversy.

30:22.160 --> 30:25.400
But just for the patrons, the Linux Critic, I thought would be a good-

30:25.400 --> 30:26.400
That would be fun.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.400
Yeah.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.400
I have a few.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.400
I have a few.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.400
I could take some of our Slack discussions we've had.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.360
We could get you a little drunk, and then-

30:32.360 --> 30:33.360
Oh, God.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.840
I don't want to get people offended, but yeah.

30:35.840 --> 30:40.200
No, we've had some good Slack conversations that don't make it on air, because it's a

30:40.200 --> 30:43.480
little bit- some of it's sometimes slightly satirical.

30:43.480 --> 30:46.520
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking, Ahrefs.

30:46.520 --> 30:52.280
Ahrefs is just added warning satire to it, and I think maybe that's what I would do.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.440
But you never know.

30:53.440 --> 30:56.120
You may see the- I should just do it now, because somebody's probably going to steal

30:56.120 --> 30:57.120
the idea.

30:57.120 --> 31:03.960
So I decided to spend my time, since I wasn't just spending all my time deep diving into

31:03.960 --> 31:04.960
Fedora.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.760
There's just not a lot to parse for me.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.920
It's just a great release, but I thought maybe I'd spend a little time digging into Cockpit.

31:09.920 --> 31:18.520
And so I was reading in, and I saw on Steph's blog, I think his name is, he was doing a

31:18.520 --> 31:19.520
deep dive himself.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.760
And I thought, okay, well, let's go through some of his stuff.

31:20.760 --> 31:24.120
And I have it installed on a DigitalOcean Droplet, so I was kind of doing some side-by-side

31:24.120 --> 31:26.840
comparisons to kind of confirm what he said.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.200
And I liked it.

31:28.200 --> 31:32.120
I liked what I found, and I'll link you to his conclusions as well.

31:32.120 --> 31:36.100
I thought one thing that was interesting is that Cockpit actually runs as an alternative

31:36.100 --> 31:37.100
Linux session.

31:37.100 --> 31:43.280
Unlike your webmins or your cPanels of the past that are running as an Apache, the Apache

31:43.280 --> 31:47.400
server is listening and executing the pages, or their webmin where it's a self-container

31:47.400 --> 31:48.400
thing.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.500
This – but it's listening as a remote port.

31:50.500 --> 31:59.060
This is actually using PAM and Lognd and TTY, and if you have SE Linux, those things are

31:59.060 --> 32:00.060
being applied.

32:00.060 --> 32:04.200
So this – just right off the beginning, I was impressed with how Cockpit is getting

32:04.200 --> 32:07.080
you logged in to your Fedora system.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.960
I thought that was pretty cool.

32:08.960 --> 32:13.820
And then on top of that, Cockpit itself has no special privileges.

32:13.820 --> 32:16.840
It's the credentials of whatever user you log into.

32:16.840 --> 32:19.840
So this is – I thought, okay, this is fascinating.

32:19.840 --> 32:24.500
So if I log in as Chris F, I can perform exactly the task that Chris F logged into that system

32:24.500 --> 32:25.680
has access to.

32:25.680 --> 32:29.520
Or more importantly, I can't do anything that I don't have access to, which is hugely

32:29.520 --> 32:31.120
important for remote administration.

32:31.120 --> 32:35.640
And I'm like, how the hell then – how the hell am I able to do all of these amazing

32:35.640 --> 32:40.080
things even though I'm authenticated as my user?

32:40.080 --> 32:43.520
Well, essentially by using sudo.

32:43.520 --> 32:48.880
So when you log in to Cockpit, there's a little checkbox that says reuse my password

32:48.880 --> 32:49.880
for privileged tasks.

32:49.880 --> 32:54.240
So instead of like remember my password, which is what you normally see, it's use my password

32:54.240 --> 32:55.240
for privileged tasks.

32:55.240 --> 32:59.040
And like you're probably guessing right now, it's essentially using policy kit in the

32:59.040 --> 33:07.480
background to sudo me and perform admin tasks that I would be able to do via sudo, which

33:07.480 --> 33:09.560
is also, I think, a brilliant way to do it.

33:09.560 --> 33:13.200
And then I thought, okay, well, this is great and all, but what if I don't want to expose

33:13.200 --> 33:16.760
my server to the web?

33:16.760 --> 33:19.920
Is there a way to still use Cockpit since it's a web-based tool?

33:19.920 --> 33:26.040
And Cockpit itself typically listens on TCP port 9090, where you then connect to that

33:26.040 --> 33:28.880
and it'll launch appropriate software.

33:28.880 --> 33:34.840
And okay, but anytime you have anything facing the network, it's essentially a security risk.

33:34.840 --> 33:40.640
Anytime a computer is listening to the network, there is the potential for exploiting it and

33:40.640 --> 33:42.600
something that executes code on the other end.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.080
So this is a thought.

33:44.080 --> 33:50.080
So what I learned is, and I kind of learned this the backwards way, is that if you install

33:50.080 --> 33:56.940
like Fedora Atomic or Fedora Cloud, like my DigitalOcean instance, it installs Cockpit

33:56.940 --> 34:02.320
by default, but it installs it in a mode where Cockpit is configured for you to connect to

34:02.320 --> 34:03.320
it over SSH.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.320
Oh, interesting.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.320
Yeah.

34:05.320 --> 34:06.320
Super interesting.

34:06.320 --> 34:09.000
Because I'm going to have SSH listening on my droplet, right?

34:09.000 --> 34:16.880
And so you can log in to Cockpit over SSH, which is, I think, super awesome.

34:16.880 --> 34:22.840
And anyways, just sort of double down my sort of deep dive into this, kind of expecting

34:22.840 --> 34:24.420
it to be a little underwhelming.

34:24.420 --> 34:28.560
And at every turn where I was trying to figure out, well, how did they solve this problem?

34:28.560 --> 34:31.580
I went, oh, shit, they really thought this through.

34:31.580 --> 34:34.140
And what's great about it is it's something you can deploy yourself.

34:34.140 --> 34:40.580
You can put Fedora Atomic – or maybe they call it Fedora Cloud, I can't remember.

34:40.580 --> 34:44.840
You can put it on a DigitalOcean droplet and you can manage containers this way.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.660
They also use Kerberos for single sign-on if you have that.

34:47.660 --> 34:52.120
They have authentication tools that you can use to help replace the back-end authentication

34:52.120 --> 34:53.760
completely if you want.

34:53.760 --> 34:58.600
So it's well thought out and it's layered, which kind of matches the Linux system in

34:58.600 --> 35:04.880
general where it uses user permissions and policy kit and it becomes an alternative Linux

35:04.880 --> 35:05.880
session itself.

35:05.880 --> 35:11.000
So it's bound by SE Linux and I just – you know, it's not Webman.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.800
It's not Webman of years past that I had come across.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.960
It is a legitimate tool to manage a server that's really been well thought out and

35:16.960 --> 35:19.560
I was impressed by the security architecture of it.

35:19.560 --> 35:24.000
So if you want to be impressed by Fedora on a server, which I know is kind of an oxymoron

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
for a lot of you, but it's interesting, Cockpit is such a great way to manage a Fedora

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
server.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Yeah, I know.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.360
I mean, it makes me want to learn other things.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.360
Maybe there's a way to do it.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.360
I haven't really investigated that.

35:35.360 --> 35:39.200
Because it does seem very approachable, especially people who aren't like – maybe they sys

35:39.200 --> 35:42.560
admin some of the time but they know the changes they need to make but, oh, I don't remember

35:42.560 --> 35:43.560
which flag that is.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.560
Yeah.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.560
Yeah.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.520
Or if you – this is another one that I was picturing while I was going through this was

35:48.520 --> 35:52.240
gosh, you know what I would use the hell out of this for is back in the day, I would set

35:52.240 --> 35:57.200
up test systems for developers and then they would have to ping me to do things like restart

35:57.200 --> 36:00.680
a service or restart the box and then I would have to stop whatever I was in the middle

36:00.680 --> 36:02.760
of, SSH in, you know, not a big deal.

36:02.760 --> 36:06.880
But if I could have given them a login to Cockpit where they could see all of their

36:06.880 --> 36:10.460
containers and they could go in there and turn them off and turn them on and essentially

36:10.460 --> 36:14.480
to them would just be applications, that would have been so nice, man.

36:14.480 --> 36:19.360
So I could see Cockpit – I could have seen some uses for it back in the day.

36:19.360 --> 36:24.000
Now I just was like, well, okay, if I got this running on Fedora, well, let's put Sab

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
NZB in here.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Boom.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Container Sab NZB.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
I'm like, oh, shit, that was really easy.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
All right.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
Let's try a mumble container.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Boom.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Oh, man, that was crazy easy.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
This is great.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.840
And then you get – also you get performance charts and metrics and information right there

36:35.840 --> 36:36.840
in Cockpit.

36:36.840 --> 36:37.840
It's a good tool.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.840
It's a really good tool.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.400
So server side, Chris, maybe he's coming back in this age of containers.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.400
I tell you what.

36:43.400 --> 36:47.400
There's something about it that's sort of feeling good, like I'm scratching an itch

36:47.400 --> 36:50.440
that's been on my back for a while and I'm like, oh, I finally got a back scratch your

36:50.440 --> 36:51.440
way out.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.440
Oh, wow.

36:52.440 --> 36:53.440
Oh, yeah.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.440
Oh, yeah.

36:54.440 --> 36:55.440
Well, you heard me mention it's a great way to play around with this stuff.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.440
DigitalOcean.

36:56.440 --> 36:59.560
Go over to digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUG.

36:59.560 --> 37:00.560
That's one word.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.360
You apply it to an account after you create it.

37:02.360 --> 37:06.160
I know that's tricky, but the reason for that is because it's like a $10 credit they

37:06.160 --> 37:07.160
apply.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.160
Well, it's exactly what it is.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.160
So they're applying it.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.160
They need an account to apply it to.

37:10.160 --> 37:14.800
And once you have $10, you can get surprisingly far with DigitalOcean.

37:14.800 --> 37:19.040
First of all, they've got a $5 a month droplet, 512 megs of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU,

37:19.040 --> 37:20.640
a terabyte of transfer.

37:20.640 --> 37:24.520
They have all SSD storage for all of the rigs, but it starts at $5 a month.

37:24.520 --> 37:29.120
Then it goes up from there into just phenomenally huge systems, hundreds of gigs of RAM, tons

37:29.120 --> 37:31.000
of CPU cores, whatever you need.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.680
And one of the things that's super nice is the flexibility with the storage.

37:33.680 --> 37:38.160
You can attach block storage, itty bitty, I think like a gigabyte is the smallest number.

37:38.160 --> 37:41.200
I don't think I've ever attached one that small, but you can go up to 16 terabytes,

37:41.200 --> 37:45.400
which is what matters to me, and it addresses on your system as a block storage device.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.400
It's brilliant.

37:46.400 --> 37:47.400
I love it.

37:47.400 --> 37:51.500
And it makes expanding storage on a DigitalOcean droplet dead simple, which means once you

37:51.500 --> 37:54.280
get into something, you keep going, you're like, geez, I can't believe how much headroom

37:54.280 --> 37:55.440
I have on the system.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.360
I spun up a $5 a month droplet and I thought I could only do one thing.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.320
Now here I am doing three different things on it and using up my storage.

38:01.320 --> 38:04.600
You attach block storage easy, no problem.

38:04.600 --> 38:08.560
And the other thing I want to mention about it, it's a great way to play with complex

38:08.560 --> 38:13.800
file systems because you can format them, you could do ZFS, you could do ButterFS, it's

38:13.800 --> 38:15.420
a great way to learn, too.

38:15.420 --> 38:18.460
Something else they've recently rolled out, they have a great infrastructure.

38:18.460 --> 38:21.380
They're always making improvements to it and integrating it in with their dashboard is

38:21.380 --> 38:26.080
cloud firewalls, 40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors.

38:26.080 --> 38:30.680
Data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, Germany, they

38:30.680 --> 38:32.400
probably are going to build one on the moon one day.

38:32.400 --> 38:35.640
But what I really love is they're building in cloud firewalls at the network level.

38:35.640 --> 38:39.680
You'll have a central location to define access rules, apply them to all of your droplets

38:39.680 --> 38:44.000
and then DigitalOcean enforces those rules at the network layer so the traffic never

38:44.000 --> 38:46.440
even hits your droplet.

38:46.440 --> 38:51.040
You don't even waste a millisecond of CPU time trying to process those packets.

38:51.040 --> 38:55.600
They do it for you at the network level all through that super sweet dashboard.

38:55.600 --> 39:00.280
And then they have an API that makes it all smooth as butter.

39:00.280 --> 39:03.000
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code D-O-Unplugged.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.600
A big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

39:06.600 --> 39:09.120
DigitalOcean.com, D-O-Unplugged.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.120
Thanks DigitalOcean.

39:10.120 --> 39:17.120
Now, Wes, I'm wondering if you heard the big news this week.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.000
There is a reason why Ike is joining us.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.560
It's not, I mean, other than I'm sure he just loves to catch up with his buddies, Chris

39:22.560 --> 39:23.560
and Wes.

39:23.560 --> 39:27.800
But no, it's because Solace is going to have some big growth coming down.

39:27.800 --> 39:31.440
I mean, like they haven't already, which is funny.

39:31.440 --> 39:38.360
But I think it's all about to look like small potatoes compared to what could be coming.

39:38.360 --> 39:45.560
So Josh did a blog post over on the Solace project site and welcomed a new team member,

39:45.560 --> 39:46.560
Stefan.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.520
I think I'm saying his name probably right, to the project.

39:48.520 --> 39:52.520
And then a little bit down in the post drops the big bomb that I think is going to have

39:52.520 --> 39:57.400
huge ramifications for Solace and announced that Ike is going to become a full-time Solace

39:57.400 --> 40:00.880
developer in about four weeks.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.280
Hey yo.

40:02.280 --> 40:06.440
So I heard a little bit on late night Linux last night about it.

40:06.440 --> 40:11.760
And of course, see there, they don't want to gush about Solace too much, but here I'm

40:11.760 --> 40:12.760
all about that.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.920
So let's dig into this, Ike.

40:14.920 --> 40:18.400
First of all, congratulations.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.280
And it must have been kind of a hard choice.

40:20.280 --> 40:23.840
You've got, I imagine, a pretty good gig at Intel.

40:23.840 --> 40:29.640
Yeah, I mean, you've got to weigh the pros and cons, but you know, eventually it comes

40:29.640 --> 40:33.560
down to do you want to follow your dreams or do you want to wait a few years and regret

40:33.560 --> 40:36.560
not having done them?

40:36.560 --> 40:41.480
You know, it sounds almost cliche, but I completely concur.

40:41.480 --> 40:46.560
It's been about six years, I think, five or six years since I quit my full-time IT consulting

40:46.560 --> 40:51.240
gig, which paid much better to do Jupyter broadcasting full-time because I just knew

40:51.240 --> 40:53.160
I would really regret it.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.800
I would just really kick myself down the road.

40:55.800 --> 41:01.560
So with that sort of lens, I look at the situation, I'm very excited and very happy for you, Ike.

41:01.560 --> 41:14.760
But this is often, in my experience, a transitional moment for an open source project when the

41:14.760 --> 41:19.280
founder of the project or a key member of the project is able to shift to full-time.

41:19.280 --> 41:24.480
I think it's made big, big improvements and big changes for elementary as they've made

41:24.480 --> 41:26.240
some of those shifts.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.240
There's other projects out there.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.600
I could name drop, but it's kind of pointless.

41:28.600 --> 41:34.640
I think it's going to be a huge shift for Solace, and I know you still have four weeks

41:34.640 --> 41:37.560
at your old job, and I know you've got to be focused on wrapping that up, but your mind

41:37.560 --> 41:44.680
must already be running very, very, very, very fast on all the different things that

41:44.680 --> 41:48.280
might happen, all the directions you might go, where are you at?

41:48.280 --> 41:50.920
How are you doing this?

41:50.920 --> 41:53.800
What is the first couple of steps for you?

41:53.800 --> 41:59.520
I'm not asking you way down the road, but are you setting up an office situation where

41:59.520 --> 42:00.920
you're going to be working every day?

42:00.920 --> 42:03.560
What is the first few steps you're going to take?

42:03.560 --> 42:05.960
The future stuff, we'll just see where that comes, but what's next?

42:05.960 --> 42:14.040
Well, I work from home anyway, so in some ways, there won't be that many changes.

42:14.040 --> 42:21.120
The first thing is doing the legal, boring side of it, setting up as a limited company,

42:21.120 --> 42:28.760
all that crap, just to protect me from that one guy and his Chrome install.

42:28.760 --> 42:33.840
The very first thing is the change is the cadence of the project, so what I'm doing

42:33.840 --> 42:39.280
now is I'm using energy between effectively two full-time jobs, and while I've done a

42:39.280 --> 42:44.920
lot to date, the cadence of the project has been pretty good, to be fair.

42:44.920 --> 42:48.760
Now it's basically going to be my bread and butter, and it's going to be my nine to five,

42:48.760 --> 42:52.920
if you like, but without the connotations of a nine to five.

42:52.920 --> 42:58.160
I will be putting all of my work energy just into Solace, so instead of having those two

42:58.160 --> 43:03.880
or three hours at the end of the night, I now have all of the day to be doing that every

43:03.880 --> 43:04.880
day.

43:04.880 --> 43:10.040
So first thing I'll be doing is storming through the issues that we already have and working

43:10.040 --> 43:13.640
on refining some of that stuff.

43:13.640 --> 43:18.840
After that, things that I've wanted to do in the past, but might have fought against

43:18.840 --> 43:23.640
for how they might be perceived or whatever, I'm kind of freer to do a few things now with

43:23.640 --> 43:25.160
Solace.

43:25.160 --> 43:31.160
There's risks that I can take, and essentially, it's applying the startup culture to Solace

43:31.160 --> 43:32.160
in a big way.

43:32.160 --> 43:38.000
Well, here was my first take when you announced the news.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.100
I think you'd probably acknowledge that a lot of the criticism that projects like Solace

43:42.100 --> 43:48.360
and others, even Mint, they take on is, one guy can't do all this.

43:48.360 --> 43:53.120
He can't possibly do all this, and at some point, he's going to burn out, and he's going

43:53.120 --> 43:55.160
to have to quit.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.760
I think you probably just told all those people to shut the hell up with this move, because

43:57.760 --> 44:00.400
essentially what you said is, to me, what it seems like you're saying is, well, when

44:00.400 --> 44:04.240
the rubber hit the road and I had to make a decision, I chose Solace.

44:04.240 --> 44:05.520
Is that sort of what happened?

44:05.520 --> 44:12.720
No, I mean, to be clear, this is a transitional movement.

44:12.720 --> 44:14.840
It's a personal decision.

44:14.840 --> 44:18.520
I've enjoyed my job now for four years this month.

44:18.520 --> 44:21.080
I've absolutely loved it.

44:21.080 --> 44:25.160
The thing for me is deciding what I want next out of life.

44:25.160 --> 44:28.520
I'm not in a position now where I have to choose anything.

44:28.520 --> 44:34.400
It's something I voluntarily want to do, call it an easing of the soul, if you will.

44:34.400 --> 44:37.960
It is something that I feel like I want to do, and it's something I feel like I should

44:37.960 --> 44:40.440
do, because again, this is my passion.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.680
It's something I believe in.

44:42.680 --> 44:46.760
In terms of how people view the project, you are going to have that connotation around

44:46.760 --> 44:52.400
the project of, oh, well, he's only doing it as a hobby.

44:52.400 --> 44:58.440
To an extent, people are only going to take you so seriously, but not fully.

44:58.440 --> 45:05.440
So for me, this is like, well, I'm fully committed to this project and the community around it.

45:05.440 --> 45:10.000
I am going to make this thing run circles.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.160
There's already been a positive uptake by the community as well.

45:13.160 --> 45:19.440
On our Patreon page, you can see, I basically dropped it to them privately as a patron-only

45:19.440 --> 45:20.440
post.

45:20.440 --> 45:25.880
I told them, well, first of all, I actually kind of clickbaited them first.

45:25.880 --> 45:28.720
I said, exciting news, come in, and told them nothing.

45:28.720 --> 45:33.120
I left it off for about, well, I did that on Google Plus later.

45:33.120 --> 45:35.760
I'd already done it on Patreon.

45:35.760 --> 45:39.760
So I did that for about four hours or something, recorded late night Linux, went back, and

45:39.760 --> 45:41.440
I basically told them about it.

45:41.440 --> 45:44.360
The reaction was overwhelmingly positive.

45:44.360 --> 45:47.560
There wasn't a single negative comment about it.

45:47.560 --> 45:51.520
The beautiful thing that I saw was people were like, well, you know what, you're committing

45:51.520 --> 45:54.520
to it, so we're going to up our commitment as well.

45:54.520 --> 45:59.800
Since then, the Patreon has jumped up about $250 suggested, because people have taken

45:59.800 --> 46:00.800
it upon themselves.

46:00.800 --> 46:04.760
It's like, well, if you're all in, we're all in.

46:04.760 --> 46:09.040
For me, the last few days have been very emotional, to be honest with you, just having people

46:09.040 --> 46:10.800
believe in that you can do it.

46:10.800 --> 46:11.800
That's got to feel good.

46:11.800 --> 46:12.800
That's got to feel good.

46:12.800 --> 46:13.800
Life change.

46:13.800 --> 46:14.800
Yeah.

46:14.800 --> 46:18.760
I mean, it validates a lot of things as well, but when people have faith in you, take everything

46:18.760 --> 46:23.880
else aside, take finance aside, and take the methods of the way you're doing things.

46:23.880 --> 46:27.680
For people just to believe in what it is you're doing, that alone is empowering.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.680
Yeah.

46:28.680 --> 46:35.360
It also means that in a very real way, your success personally and the ability to feed

46:35.360 --> 46:40.600
yourself is now tied to the success of the project, which not that you weren't 100% committed,

46:40.600 --> 46:44.200
but I think it just removes any doubt in an observer's minds.

46:44.200 --> 46:49.080
That's probably why you're seeing an uptick there, because I kid you not, Aiki.

46:49.080 --> 46:52.640
After you made the announcement, I myself was like, well, I better make sure I'm on

46:52.640 --> 46:57.880
their Patreon, and I went there and go, oh, good, I already was, but I was like, oh, yeah,

46:57.880 --> 46:58.880
okay.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.720
Even though I'd been seeing your posts on Patreon, my first response is, well, I got

47:01.720 --> 47:05.720
to go double check that I'm... Because that was how I felt to me, is like, this is going

47:05.720 --> 47:09.200
to be a way for you to be able to keep doing this, I would imagine.

47:09.200 --> 47:13.360
I should just say right now, patreon.com slash solace.

47:13.360 --> 47:17.160
The main thing for us is, as I said, you're going from those couple of hours a day now.

47:17.160 --> 47:20.880
I'm not trying to blow me on Trump or anything, but what we've managed to achieve as a project

47:20.880 --> 47:26.640
already in a fairly small amount of time, when you look at the grand scale of projects,

47:26.640 --> 47:30.760
we've repeatedly been told that everything that we've done, we've repeatedly been told

47:30.760 --> 47:36.640
that it's impossible, you can't do that, you'll burn out, this isn't how projects work.

47:36.640 --> 47:37.640
What do you mean it's independent?

47:37.640 --> 47:39.680
Who are you based on?

47:39.680 --> 47:41.280
We've already done the impossible.

47:41.280 --> 47:45.280
We've basically bootstrapped this project, and now it's at a point, it's not like I'm

47:45.280 --> 47:48.640
... I don't want to say I'm completely financially reliant on solace.

47:48.640 --> 47:52.360
I don't want people thinking, oh, now he's going to be scared to make decisions.

47:52.360 --> 47:54.760
Quite the opposite.

47:54.760 --> 48:00.240
To put it semi-crudely, this is basically retrofitting the balls of a Volvo S back onto

48:00.240 --> 48:04.720
solace, because that was a ballsy project, and that's effectively what I'm doing here.

48:04.720 --> 48:07.560
I'm going effectively back to roots with it.

48:07.560 --> 48:10.560
That's an interesting perspective on it.

48:10.560 --> 48:11.560
Yeah.

48:11.560 --> 48:13.240
It almost matters more than ever now.

48:13.240 --> 48:15.920
It matters more than ever now, in a way.

48:15.920 --> 48:17.760
Yes and no, right?

48:17.760 --> 48:20.440
There are some people that would say, well, you're dependent on this, this has got to

48:20.440 --> 48:21.440
be this way.

48:21.440 --> 48:26.960
Obviously, I've made sure I can make the transition, and that were anything to go wrong, that I

48:26.960 --> 48:28.400
was still covered to do it.

48:28.400 --> 48:33.120
I've made sure it's a safe time in which to do it, but yeah, people are basically then

48:33.120 --> 48:35.040
paying me to work on solace.

48:35.040 --> 48:40.760
It's not like it's a hobby thing, and it's just the usual, we'll cover a hosting cost.

48:40.760 --> 48:45.120
It's quite literally keeping the lights on now.

48:45.120 --> 48:51.560
I guess I can't really put my hands on it, but for some reason, I feel different as a

48:51.560 --> 48:54.760
solace user.

48:54.760 --> 48:58.600
I've been just reconsidering all kinds of things about the Linux desktop recently.

48:58.600 --> 49:05.800
I got a long list, and the desktop and distro I use is one of them.

49:05.800 --> 49:07.960
I really, really appreciate that.

49:07.960 --> 49:11.680
Just as an aside, if Ike wasn't here, I would say this, and Wes, I think you would agree,

49:11.680 --> 49:19.240
I would say this in our Slack channel too, I feel like solace has a unique take and tackle

49:19.240 --> 49:22.400
on building a great desktop Linux.

49:22.400 --> 49:25.720
It's not a great VPS OS.

49:25.720 --> 49:31.880
It's not a great OS to run in VirtualBox, but it is a great OS to run on my XPS 13.

49:31.880 --> 49:39.440
It's a great one to run on my desktop with a nice 2K screen.

49:39.440 --> 49:44.400
Ike, you yourself are aware of issues in the desktop world that most users don't think

49:44.400 --> 49:47.400
of, and you're fixing them in solace before they're even a problem.

49:47.400 --> 49:51.120
It almost feels like in some ways, I could make a comparison to what some people view

49:51.120 --> 49:54.020
elementary OS as for the beginning Linux users.

49:54.020 --> 49:57.400
Solace is kind of that for your advanced particular Linux user.

49:57.400 --> 49:59.600
It's simple enough that it's applicable to new users.

49:59.600 --> 50:00.600
Oh yeah, absolutely.

50:00.600 --> 50:04.160
I guess, so I say all of that to also say, one of the reasons why we talk about it on

50:04.160 --> 50:09.400
this show so much is because in the 11 years or 12 years, whatever the hell it is now,

50:09.400 --> 50:13.000
that I've been doing Linux podcasts, it's one of the distributions that stands out to

50:13.000 --> 50:18.800
me as a strong performer, rapid growth, huge community, quick and large community adoption,

50:18.800 --> 50:25.640
I should say, a well-spoken, well-communicated team who has clear blog posts that clearly

50:25.640 --> 50:28.320
explain what the project's goals are and what they're working on.

50:28.320 --> 50:32.480
And then, and now I can add to that entire list, a reputation of following through on

50:32.480 --> 50:37.480
commitments on what they're doing when they went, like when you said you're going rolling,

50:37.480 --> 50:40.100
it's a rolling method that actually works pretty well for me.

50:40.100 --> 50:42.160
It's not totally crazy and it's also not haphazard.

50:42.160 --> 50:45.400
It's like at certain times, new updates come down for me and it works.

50:45.400 --> 50:46.400
It's fine.

50:46.400 --> 50:47.400
It's working.

50:47.400 --> 50:52.000
Everything you've committed to and now, in a sense, at a whole other level, is so far

50:52.000 --> 50:54.400
checked out.

50:54.400 --> 50:58.360
Those are five attributes that I don't say I could apply to many distros.

50:58.360 --> 51:02.000
You can say a lot of distros have been around for a long time, they've had a good slow burn,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.960
they have a great reputation, they have a huge deployment.

51:04.960 --> 51:08.120
You can give different attributes, but there are a lot of unique characteristics to the

51:08.120 --> 51:14.000
Solus project that have kept it on my radar, essentially since the project, well, got a

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
new name.

51:15.000 --> 51:21.080
I think the best way to summarize it with the Solus is when we started out, I mean,

51:21.080 --> 51:25.080
back in, you know, like when it was Evolve OS days, because in some senses, you've kind

51:25.080 --> 51:31.240
of got to ignore what came before because it was like the first attempt and then wanted

51:31.240 --> 51:35.440
to go independent because by that time, it's like you'd learned the things that you wanted

51:35.440 --> 51:36.920
to do with it, right?

51:36.920 --> 51:42.720
So then we have the lifetime really starting with Evolve OS and we were very adamant from

51:42.720 --> 51:45.820
day one that we were building an OS.

51:45.820 --> 51:49.320
We weren't telling people that we were building a distro and we were very, very adamant with

51:49.320 --> 51:54.680
that message to everyone and it became kind of meme-worthy after a while, but once we'd

51:54.680 --> 51:58.920
got all of that nailed down, because one of the things that I had learned from my previous

51:58.920 --> 52:03.920
experiences was how to say no and I had to be efficient with saying no and it was something

52:03.920 --> 52:09.080
I hadn't said before and that was what contributed to past failures.

52:09.080 --> 52:12.160
Now this time around, it's like, this is exactly what we're doing.

52:12.160 --> 52:13.280
This is what we define it to be.

52:13.280 --> 52:16.880
I don't care about all these other things, you know, package management and servers,

52:16.880 --> 52:20.720
you know, the usual controversial stuff you hear from me.

52:20.720 --> 52:21.720
This is what we're building.

52:21.720 --> 52:24.520
So wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.480
So when you say no, can you expand that?

52:26.480 --> 52:31.680
When you say no, it's like, when people say, well, I mean, because I'll just play devil's

52:31.680 --> 52:32.680
advocate.

52:32.680 --> 52:35.400
You know, you have plasma desktop, you have matte desktop.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.600
There's a lot of different flavors now.

52:37.600 --> 52:41.400
It seems like saying no would have been, no, we're just going to do Budgie and all of our

52:41.400 --> 52:43.560
resources are going to go into that.

52:43.560 --> 52:49.440
So my version of no is effectively a tool of scope limitation.

52:49.440 --> 52:54.400
So when I'm working on something, it's like, okay, at this current state, we can't do such

52:54.400 --> 52:55.760
and such and such.

52:55.760 --> 52:57.120
We need to do only this.

52:57.120 --> 52:59.600
This is what we must focus on for now.

52:59.600 --> 53:03.400
We pretend other things don't even exist until this is done.

53:03.400 --> 53:08.120
And when we first started out, you know, our scope was limited to supporting Budgie because

53:08.120 --> 53:13.080
at the time that was where our tooling, our technology, our basis, our process was at.

53:13.080 --> 53:18.520
And then as time goes by, well, you know, it stopped being just EvolverOS.

53:18.520 --> 53:21.080
We'd gone in, evolved into Zolas.

53:21.080 --> 53:22.080
Sorry.

53:22.080 --> 53:23.080
Sorry.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.080
You're loud.

53:24.080 --> 53:25.080
You're loud.

53:25.080 --> 53:29.120
We actually devolved into Zolas, if you like, and then by that time it was the OS itself,

53:29.120 --> 53:30.880
which was taking precedence in some centers.

53:30.880 --> 53:38.640
We made this mental differentiation between the operating system and the face, as I kind

53:38.640 --> 53:40.120
of run out of recalling it.

53:40.120 --> 53:44.400
So Budgie became the face and then at that point it's like, we have all this stuff.

53:44.400 --> 53:48.520
We know how to rapidly deploy a rolling OS at this point.

53:48.520 --> 53:53.640
It's like, okay, at that point it became, let's legitimize as a distro as well.

53:53.640 --> 53:58.000
So instead of just being an OS, because we weren't being assuming with most of our decisions,

53:58.000 --> 54:04.400
you know, like it's not, you don't feel belittled or anything, or the questions asked of the

54:04.400 --> 54:08.540
InstaHall or anything, you don't think it's trying to chastise you or anything like that.

54:08.540 --> 54:11.360
So there's no limitation on skill levels or the way it works.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.000
You can use a terminal, equally you can go and use this thing.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.240
So it's like, okay, at this point we have all our basics down.

54:17.240 --> 54:21.240
We've covered everything we want to be, but we still have this OS that other people want

54:21.240 --> 54:22.240
to use.

54:22.240 --> 54:26.440
And at that point it became about also legitimizing as a Linux distribution as well.

54:26.440 --> 54:29.160
So it stopped becoming just being an OS.

54:29.160 --> 54:33.480
It became legitimized as a Linux distribution that is used as an operating system.

54:33.480 --> 54:37.040
So that's when those two bits merged together conceptually.

54:37.040 --> 54:40.520
And then that's when you started getting the other desktops and slightly more tangent use

54:40.520 --> 54:42.120
cases coming along with it.

54:42.120 --> 54:45.080
But they're all done in a way that's improved everything else.

54:45.080 --> 54:48.240
Like everything that came in improved something else.

54:48.240 --> 54:54.360
Like the initial introduction of Steam, I never intended to go off and create all this

54:54.360 --> 54:59.840
gaming runtime and Linux-Steam integration and batching this and the performance.

54:59.840 --> 55:07.360
But it became something of a, again, a natural evolution that's going to get really old soon.

55:07.360 --> 55:13.240
But then that forced us to basically make all of our processes better by doing that.

55:13.240 --> 55:20.760
So our support for what we call Emul32, which is basically 32-bit libraries, it became first

55:20.760 --> 55:25.920
class to the point where you just said Emul32 in a package build and boom, off it went.

55:25.920 --> 55:28.120
A lot of the things that we include we do in that way.

55:28.120 --> 55:32.440
So we integrate them, they work well, and they improve something else as a consequence.

55:32.440 --> 55:37.320
Like we refine the core project and the core code base as a result of that.

55:37.320 --> 55:38.320
Yeah.

55:38.320 --> 55:39.320
And fair enough.

55:39.320 --> 55:43.800
You know, just going back to the Steam thing, for example, it's a serious differentiator

55:43.800 --> 55:44.800
of solace in it.

55:44.800 --> 55:49.280
Again, a lot of distros I try, it makes for a really smooth out-of-the-box experience

55:49.280 --> 55:51.480
when I, that's a stupid term, I hate that term.

55:51.480 --> 55:54.760
But it makes for a smooth experience when trying to play games, when you just want to

55:54.760 --> 55:56.640
sit down and play some games with your kids.

55:56.640 --> 56:00.280
Which is how I pretty much play games now is when my kids are sitting over me or standing

56:00.280 --> 56:01.280
over my shoulder.

56:01.280 --> 56:03.320
Dad, can we play Race the Sun or something like that.

56:03.320 --> 56:05.160
And so I quickly install Steam and...

56:05.160 --> 56:06.960
Can we play Race the Sun?

56:06.960 --> 56:14.600
I tell you what, when something fails to load like that, it's so defeating as a dad.

56:14.600 --> 56:19.280
Like you're sitting there, you want to have a good dad-kid moment around Linux and all

56:19.280 --> 56:22.520
that, and then it doesn't launch and it's just so embarrassing.

56:22.520 --> 56:23.680
It's like a shameful moment.

56:23.680 --> 56:27.160
Yeah, I mean, I've had a defining moment slightly like that before.

56:27.160 --> 56:32.520
It was a few years back, but actually it was at the very beginning of the Volvo West.

56:32.520 --> 56:34.040
So I was with my ex at the time.

56:34.040 --> 56:37.560
She wasn't the ex at the time, obviously.

56:37.560 --> 56:39.120
But then what happened?

56:39.120 --> 56:43.280
Yeah, I mean, we didn't break up because of that.

56:43.280 --> 56:49.880
I remember at the time that the multimedia codec support just wasn't fully baked at the

56:49.880 --> 56:50.880
time.

56:50.880 --> 56:57.680
And shamefully, shamefully, I had to download another Linux distro, nuke and pave the computer

56:57.680 --> 57:00.440
to watch a DVD.

57:00.440 --> 57:02.480
It was mortifying.

57:02.480 --> 57:06.880
And experiences like that, they will stay with you.

57:06.880 --> 57:11.720
You will make sure stuff like, I mean, it's a horrible term, you know, to work out of

57:11.720 --> 57:12.800
the box, right?

57:12.800 --> 57:14.200
There's no box.

57:14.200 --> 57:16.040
I downloaded this thing.

57:16.040 --> 57:21.360
But things like that, like enabling users to get stuff done and staying out of the way

57:21.360 --> 57:24.600
because an OS is not sexy.

57:24.600 --> 57:27.880
It's not at all.

57:27.880 --> 57:30.160
What you're doing is you're enabling someone to do something.

57:30.160 --> 57:33.960
You're enabling a workload, you're enabling a task.

57:33.960 --> 57:35.680
It's something to be done on the OS.

57:35.680 --> 57:40.760
The OS itself, I don't believe personally you can charge for an OS.

57:40.760 --> 57:43.120
Supporting the project and what it enables around it, yes.

57:43.120 --> 57:45.200
But charging for the OS, no.

57:45.200 --> 57:50.760
Even Windows, they're not going to be charging for it because you're enabling people to do

57:50.760 --> 57:53.240
stuff on top of that.

57:53.240 --> 57:54.880
How do they get their applications?

57:54.880 --> 57:56.480
That becomes very important.

57:56.480 --> 58:01.160
Something that didn't used to be as important in Solace history, notoriously became very

58:01.160 --> 58:02.160
important.

58:02.160 --> 58:04.080
How do you get those applications to them?

58:04.080 --> 58:07.240
How do you keep them safe when they're doing their daily stuff, when they're accessing

58:07.240 --> 58:08.240
in there?

58:08.240 --> 58:11.840
You want to make sure that they're up to date and more importantly, that they're informed

58:11.840 --> 58:15.680
as well, that they are being updated, that updates are available, that this is a good

58:15.680 --> 58:16.680
process.

58:16.680 --> 58:19.620
So you're slowly educating them with good practices over time.

58:19.620 --> 58:24.120
So those become the core considerations of the OS, not the OS itself.

58:24.120 --> 58:29.080
It's interesting to me and to Linux guys, how it works internally, but it's what we

58:29.080 --> 58:30.560
enable people to do.

58:30.560 --> 58:32.200
It's not the OS itself.

58:32.200 --> 58:33.200
That's what should be important.

58:33.200 --> 58:37.320
And I think that's now one of the defining characteristics of Solace.

58:37.320 --> 58:42.440
What can we enable our users to do and what experience do they deserve at the end of it?

58:42.440 --> 58:45.400
That makes me wish we had introduced the show with clips of the episode.

58:45.400 --> 58:46.880
That would be the highlight of this episode.

58:46.880 --> 58:47.880
No kidding, right?

58:47.880 --> 58:49.840
And that's what I really like.

58:49.840 --> 58:56.760
That philosophy does come through in a subtle way, but it's like 15 to 125 different subtle

58:56.760 --> 58:58.880
ways when you start using Solace.

58:58.880 --> 59:03.220
And each one of them is a complete message that essentially I think reflects the philosophy

59:03.220 --> 59:04.720
that Aiki just laid out there.

59:04.720 --> 59:08.560
And so I guess I was thinking about it as you were talking here, Aiki.

59:08.560 --> 59:12.920
I wonder, do you think that in some ways this is just sort of like now that this is going

59:12.920 --> 59:19.520
to be your full-time gig, proportionately, this feels like you're just getting started.

59:19.520 --> 59:23.200
Like you're really just getting started right now in some sense.

59:23.200 --> 59:24.200
Yeah.

59:24.200 --> 59:29.640
I mean, I've been lucky enough to be able to have done what I've done effectively as

59:29.640 --> 59:30.640
part-time.

59:30.640 --> 59:31.640
Right?

59:31.640 --> 59:32.640
That's basically what I've done.

59:32.640 --> 59:37.400
I've done it in part-time and I've had colleagues, I've had my teammates, I've had a community,

59:37.400 --> 59:40.760
which is now at a point where we've got so many patches coming in.

59:40.760 --> 59:45.160
I'm going to have to start having more gatekeepers to get the patches in on time.

59:45.160 --> 59:48.200
But obviously me working full-time, I'm going to be able to do that more quickly.

59:48.200 --> 59:50.640
But yeah, now all the pieces are there.

59:50.640 --> 59:52.440
I've got the deck of cards.

59:52.440 --> 59:54.600
Now I just need to build the house, right?

59:54.600 --> 59:55.600
That's a bad example.

59:55.600 --> 01:00:00.600
Did you not do that on purpose?

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.600
The house of cards.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.040
They're really structurally sound cards, it's fine.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040
Don't look too deep.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.040
They're weighted.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.040
Super glue.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.040
Super glue.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.040
Right?

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:16.880
No, we use wooden planks that look like cards and then we've got iron rivets on them.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.920
But yeah, I'm now just getting started out.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.840
There's so much I want to do and I'm excited by it as well because it's four weeks from

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.640
now but also it's like, it's four weeks away.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.960
It's a whole four weeks.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:33.000
But once that comes, again, it's back to that word, cadence.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:41.240
What we're going to be able to do is probably should terrify over projects what we're going

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.240
to achieve.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.240
Because if it's taken that long, then you can dense that.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:49.000
I can do this every single day, as well as doing the usual stuff, like dealing with bugs

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.200
and making sure that you still stay in touch with the community.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.040
It's one thing I've always done, Reddit, Twitter, wherever, I'll always try and engage

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.080
with the community because I'm not above them.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.160
Especially now, I work for them.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:08.840
But so many projects that I haven't started, we're going to be able to get it done.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.520
For me, this is now where solace breaks out.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.120
We spent all this time building this engine, we designed this engine.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.800
I'm now confident that that engine works.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.200
Let's go take off.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.480
I'm so excited about that.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:28.720
I really can't wait to watch it and I hope you keep us updated on what happens.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.720
I'll be keeping an eye on that.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.720
Oh yeah.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.280
I mean, I need the PR now.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:39.320
I have to ask, I don't know if you can comment or have an opinion, but can you talk at all

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:44.160
about what this means for the Clear Boot Manager or Clear Linux in general?

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.400
I mean, obviously, that side of it, yeah, I'm very sad for that to happen.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:53.640
I'm transferring what projects I have into the Clear Linux organization on GitHub.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:57.080
Now for projects like Clear Boot Manager, as much as I obviously won't own them, their

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.880
Intel projects, I'm going to be sending bullet requests to them.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.800
I'm still going to be contributing to them.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.400
Solace is going to continue to use it?

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.400
Yeah, definitely.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.400
Neat.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.920
I want to be clear here.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:12.400
There's no animosity or anything like this involved there.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.400
There's a lot of sadness at work because I've been there four years.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.680
It's almost like a family at this point.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.480
I've been very honored to work with some incredibly talented people.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:28.480
I'm not just saying that the usual BS you hear, like some gangster was shot, but he

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.480
was great.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.480
He was lovely.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.480
It's not that.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.840
You know the stuff, but I've really enjoyed myself.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:42.320
For me, it took me from a hobbyist open source contributor four years ago to an engineer,

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:48.360
someone who can rationalize the design process and give real solutions, not give solutions

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.240
where problems aren't present, but consider the problem that's already there.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.600
For me, it's changed me a lot.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.200
Because there is a bit of a special relationship, really, if you look at it between Clear Linux

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:05.880
and Solus, as much as I am the common denominator there, there's a lot of shared philosophy

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:12.360
in certain senses in the way that a distribution should be built and focusing on the task at

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.360
hand.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.320
I'm not going to sacrifice that.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.840
Again, it's open source projects.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.480
You see that as an example.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:25.480
I'm not here shilling, but too often you'll hear people complaining about a so-called

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:29.600
corporate backed project not doing open source things right.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:36.040
This is an example of it being done right because there is that collaboration and there

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.040
is that crossover.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.000
There is that sharing of patches and the slightly aligned philosophies.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.800
That stuff will still continue.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:50.320
Basically the patches and the PRs that I send, they'll just come from a different email address.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.640
I'm still quite happy to use that technology.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.640
I'm proud of it.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:57.320
I was involved in it for a long time.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:04.560
It's interesting too because I think it's a point well made that it helped you become

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:09.420
an engineer in a sense that allowed you to build something in a way that I think a lot

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:11.840
of hobbyists maybe don't build it.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:17.100
It also made me realize, in some senses, this is really your Solus is really, of course

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:21.880
it's an evolution, but it's really your third go too because you've got Evolv OS, Clear

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:26.400
Linux, Solus, so it's not like it's the first time you've tried this either, which explains

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.840
probably why it's fairly well put together.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.520
You learned a lot, obviously.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.880
By this time it started off in the old days, contributing to Linux men, I'm very thankful

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.520
for the times I had there as well.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.680
I know people might think there's animosity there, there isn't really.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:45.280
I think the guys nowadays, they're servicing their community.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.400
To me that's important for any distribution to be servicing their community.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.340
It started off humble beginnings all the way back there.

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:57.640
We had Linux Mint Debian Edition, then eventually I went my own way with Solus OS.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:01.720
I was contributing to Peppermint back there, I was in talks with the CrunchBank guys, they

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.860
were using some of my stuff back then.

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.240
Go all through the history.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:11.440
To give you an idea, my free node IRC account is over seven and a half years old, and that's

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.440
the second account I've had.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.240
That's a good nerd brag, I like that.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.240
That's a proper nerd brag.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:23.760
Then you had Solus OS 2, then we had this break, six or seven months or so away from

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:24.760
it all.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:30.440
That was actually after I had started with Intel, funnily enough, that Solus OS itself

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.440
was, and I hate to use the term, but put down.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:39.160
Things took a bad turn during those days because I had come to the point then where I realized

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:43.640
the stuff that I want to achieve as a Linux distribution, I think we all know now the

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:48.040
only way I can achieve what I need to do is an independent distribution, and I tried it

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.040
with the upstream.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.800
Over multiple revisions, it's like v1, v2, v3 of the spec, we finally got to a point

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.240
where Evolver OS is like, nailed it.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.400
We got the right people in the community coming forward and that community building around

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.400
it.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:09.400
I would like to say I'm a fairly experienced distro engineer by this point.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:17.960
I think so, and I think it shows, and I think it's a good investment if you're a Linux desktop

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:18.960
user.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.320
I think you should go to patreon.com slash solus.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.560
He's got 301 as we record.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.960
I think we should bump that up a little bit.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:32.120
If you've already got a Jupyter Signal Patreon or Unfilter, you got all the details.

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.440
You need to just go over to patreon.com slash solus and become a contributor.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.720
I'm in myself.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:41.520
Even if you don't use it every day, I think it's just really good for the Linux ecosystem.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.720
This is the kind of sustainable OS development that we need.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:49.720
That's one of the reasons why I'm also a patron of the BcashFS developer.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:55.480
I don't use BcashFS, but I think it's really important for desktop Linux, so I'm also a

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.080
patron of BcashFS, which is another one I recommend.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:04.080
By the way, if you become a patron, patreon.com slash solus, you get access to 27 Patreon-only

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.080
posts.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:10.400
That's pretty old, but the reason why I mention that is it shows you that IKEA and folks are

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.520
clearly engaging with their patron community.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:16.840
The perks are actually worth it.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:20.960
As a Solus patron, you sometimes can get access to ISOs a little earlier.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:26.000
You just get an idea of what's coming down, like information about the new app center.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
It's nice.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.080
It's nice as a user of the distribution to have access to this kind of stuff, and they

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.440
actually give you value.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:33.440
Patreon.com slash solus.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.960
For our people supporting us, I will just say one more thing.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.040
You're not just supporting Solus as is.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.040
You're supporting our efforts and other projects as well.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:48.520
Brisk menu, not quite because our beloved Wimpy is actually supporting Brisk menu, but

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.600
we've got projects.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.520
There's upstream contributions to GNOME, to MATE.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.840
There's software that we have that's used everywhere else.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:58.720
You've got the Budgie desktop as well that that supports.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:05.080
The MATE slate notification theme, Linux driver management, which is becoming quite sexy to

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.640
axe derivatives, so they'll end up using that as well.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.160
There's a whole slew of that stuff around there.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:15.860
If you are our patrons, obviously you're supporting us and enabling us to do this.

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:21.400
We will keep bribing you with secret ISOs and stuff so you do get goodies.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.400
Very nice.

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.400
Yeah.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:28.560
I think Patreon is becoming a good way to support folks like Ubuntu MATE, like the

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:35.960
BcashFS developer, like Aiki and the entire Solus project, I think – and Jupyter Broadcasting.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:41.160
I think it's because – it's not because people want to make money off the internet.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:49.460
It's because having patron funded either content or software development aligns the

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:56.680
goals of the project or the broadcaster with the intentions, expectations and goals of

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.300
the patron.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.300
Not the advertiser or not a donor or –

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:02.300
Yeah.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.300
There's no third party.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.300
It's just you and them.

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:13.280
It's a very clean, honest incentive and reward system that I think works particularly

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.200
well in both content creation and in open source software development.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.640
So it's – if you've been resistant to Patreon in the past, I would ask you to reconsider

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.760
not just because obviously it's in my best interest but because I also think it's a

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:29.720
way for us to get to sustainable software development for things that large corporations

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:36.000
or whatever don't find a particular motivation to invest in where we as end users who have

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.520
typically been underrepresented because Linux itself is underrepresented have been just

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.760
left to suffer.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:47.440
We now have a way to directly vote with our wallet that is completely unrelated to market

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:53.960
share or strategic goals of Google or Apple or Microsoft and is directly connected to

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:59.160
what we want to see happen on the Linux desktop or in Linux content creation, et cetera.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:03.600
I think that is one of the biggest things that we're not really discussing because

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.880
it sounds over self-serving if I talk about it too much.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.920
But with – now that I can plug Aiki's Patreon, I have an excuse to say that, patreon.com

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.400
slash solace.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.480
Great work Aiki.

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.800
Very excited for you as somebody who also quit a very great job to do this passion project.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.160
I think it serves the soul and when you end up doing what you love, you invest more in

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.200
it than – you work harder than you ever have which almost seems like an impossible

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.600
statement for me to say to you right now because you've worked so hard already but I can

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:33.520
tell you, you'll work harder than you ever have and it will be more rewarding than it

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.520
ever has.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.520
So I'm very excited for you.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.520
Yeah.

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.520
We're excited to see what comes of it.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.520
Thank you.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.520
Thank you for joining us too.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.400
It's just so – I feel like it's a birthday or like a baby's been born or

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.400
something.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.400
It's Aiki Day.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.400
Okay.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.080
So I also want to talk about a very exciting project that is bringing something that's

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:54.480
been locked down to Windows users or proprietary device users and now it's available to all

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.480
of us.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:59.080
And it's much further along than I expected and much easier to get started with.

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:00.080
But you know –

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.440
You're talking about Windows Defender, right?

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.440
We can run that on Linux now.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.440
Thank you.

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:04.440
Yes.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.440
You know that is actually a story.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.440
You do know that.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:07.440
I do know that.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.620
He does know that because it was one of the stories we discussed covering in this show.

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:10.620
So he knows.

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:14.520
And I just like – when I saw that, that is such a clickbait.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.400
When I saw that, Wes, I was like that's brilliant clickbait.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.520
I mean the old IT admin in you, you want those firewalls, you couldn't find a great one

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.520
on Linux.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.160
Do you know the funny nuance story – the thing about that guy that got all that working?

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.480
Do you know what the funny thing is?

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.480
He's a Google employee.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.480
Yeah.

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480
That's right.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.480
Did you know that?

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:31.480
You did?

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.480
All right.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.480
So let's talk about your mind for a second.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.480
Let's go a little Ben Folds.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.480
Let's talk about your mind.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:38.580
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:43.080
Go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:52.320
Linux Academy is like a classroom in the sky, like an academy, like some sort of academy

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.800
but in the sky that you connect to telepathically.

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:56.800
How about that?

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.800
Is that –

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:58.800
Cloud Academy.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.800
Wait.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:00.800
Hold on.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.800
I'm getting a note here.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:02.800
No, that is not correct.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.840
That is not how I should – it is a platform and it does teach you about Linux and all

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:08.080
the things around Linux that you would want for your – but it is not actually an academy

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.080
in the sky.

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.720
I think I was thinking – I think I was thinking of Iron Man.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.400
Anyways, LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:16.400
You go there.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.400
You support the show.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.740
You get a seven-day free trial and you can see really how it works.

01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:24.280
Get a little taste of the hands-on labs or the learning paths, the practice exams, which

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:27.720
I want to talk about more here in a second, or the video courses, self-paced in-depth

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.360
video courses on every Linux, Cloud, and DevOps topic.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:34.300
They have a vibrant community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members that are there

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:38.360
to help you learn and enrich their experience and they do that through parts of the Linux

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:41.840
Academy experience that are actually forkable by the community and if you're busy and

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.940
I understand, especially as a father of three and a small business owner, you can be very

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:45.940
busy.

01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:46.940
It's hard to fit this stuff in.

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:50.820
That's why I really appreciate the Linux Academy course scheduler.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:54.080
You can pick a course and then there will be a time frame that you can work with.

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.080
You set that up.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.320
It will help you keep with that.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.320
It will set goals for you along the way so it can be flexible and if you ever get stuck

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.420
and need help, instructor mentoring a real human being is available.

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:07.680
If you're on the go, if you've got some downtime on community transit or if you're a passenger

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:11.360
in a carpool, check out their iOS and Android apps to study on the go.

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.480
They have cloud servers.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.600
They spin up when you need them, USSHN.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.480
They have nuggets which are their cute way of saying if you've just got a little bit

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.120
of time or you just want to do like a single topic, maybe you've got two hours and you

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.040
want to do it like it's five minutes to two hours, like you've got some time, a little

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.880
bit of time, single topic, deep dive and then you've got study guides you can download

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:32.640
and take with you, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:38.520
So the blog's got a what to expect when you're testing for the Red Hat exams.

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:43.000
They have a poll rundown of what practice exams you should take, how to prepare yourself

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.200
beforehand, all of it.

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:48.040
It's nice because I know that's popular in the audience and this is a good way to get

01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.040
ready.

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.600
You don't even have to really subscribe to Linux Academy to read the blog.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.600
Yeah.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.440
You'll get a taste of it right there, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux

01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:01.360
Academy for sponsoring this here podcast, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, a platform

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:05.960
for learning more about Linux by Linux enthusiasts.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:12.280
So Moonlight, it's not like a project to run mono on Linux.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.280
That's what I was hoping for.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280
Were you, Wes?

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280
Yeah.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.280
Yeah.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.280
Lots of demand for that these days.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.280
Remember mono, everybody?

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.280
What a big deal that was.

01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:25.640
So Moonlight is an open source Nvidia game stream client.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:31.340
Now stick with me, stick with me, because I actually think this is a huge deal.

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:38.640
Because it takes the Nvidia GeForce streaming crap that you could only, the game stream,

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:43.400
that you could stream to a couple of tablets and the Nvidia Shield TV, which rocks.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.240
Oh yeah, you would mention that.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:53.240
And I think a Windows client, it was something that Steam kind of worked on, but some people

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.560
say this is nicer, and it was something that Linux users just couldn't get access to.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:02.760
And it kind of bugs me, because I've thought about, my kids have asked for, because people

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.680
at school tell them about these games, so my kids have been like, dad, we want Windows.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.640
I'm like, not happening.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.640
Not happening.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.840
And so the first time they asked, I was like, okay, we won't talk about that.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.200
The second time they asked, okay, he doesn't know what he's talking about, we won't talk

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.200
about that.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:18.160
The third time they asked, I thought, nope, nope, we're not gonna talk about that.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.000
And then the fourth time they've asked, I thought, well, what if I did game streaming?

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.480
So I've been sniffing around, and I found Moonlight, and I like the way it smells.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:32.000
So Moonlight allows you to stream your collection of games from a game stream compatible PC,

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.880
read Windows, I'll tell you more about that in a second, to any supported device, remotely.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.480
It's perfect for game play, even on the go.

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:46.000
You can stream to Android tablets, you can stream to Macs, you can stream to Linux boxes,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
of course.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
No way!

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.200
Low latency, 60 frames per second, yes, really, controller support, iOS, Android, you can

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.560
even have a Raspberry Pi as the end streaming client.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.560
Is that right?

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:01.120
You can turn a Raspberry Pi, I'm gonna say it again, into the end streaming client.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:04.040
So I can just throw my Xbox right in the garbage.

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.040
Throw it away.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.040
Put it in the garbage.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.040
Yeah.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.040
Just put it in the garbage.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.040
I got this Pi.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040
Put it in the garbage.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040
Put it in the garbage here at the studio, West, would you?

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.040
Yeah.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.040
Just put it in the garbage.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.040
Yeah.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:22.120
Because, the reason for this is, it's really just using video streaming, and a client

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:26.720
that expresses back and forth the different input controls, and it shows up, and there's

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.160
a little piece of software that looks for the game controller and stuff, and it communicates

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:36.720
it back to the streaming PC, and then it sends everything over an H.264 stream, basically.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:37.720
Okay, yeah.

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:39.920
A GPU accelerated H.264.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.920
So that's part of the magic, is the GPU, the NVIDIA, you have to have a system with an

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:49.040
NVIDIA GPU, and I have the requirements in the show notes, and it has to be running Windows,

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:56.280
so my vision was something that has a 600 plus NVIDIA GTX card, which is probably anything

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.280
still running anymore.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.280
Yeah.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:02.560
I mean, I'm sure that's wrong, but anybody that's remotely interested in playing games

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.560
is probably...

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.560
Yeah.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.560
Yeah.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:06.560
Check.

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:12.520
And AMD's GPUs are not supported, because this is an NVIDIA thing.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.400
And you have to have a 720p or higher display connected to the PC.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.800
No standard definition for you guys.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:19.800
Yeah.

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.640
The one thing I'm going to test is there are, from my Bitcoin mining days, I know there

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.720
are some plugs you can put in the back of the video cards to make it think there's a

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.880
monitor attached.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:31.400
So there's a display, we'll see if that's really truly required, but here's my idea

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:38.320
is put a decent-ish older, but decent, I've got a GTX 970 card I think I could put in

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:44.920
there, and put that in the garage, and then use this to stream to a Raspberry Pi device.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:45.920
Yeah.

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.920
That sounds fun.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:47.920
Maybe.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.920
Yeah.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:49.920
Because I was thinking I should have it.

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.360
What kind of controller are you going to go with?

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.360
Ethernet.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:57.360
Probably the... I guess for them, maybe actually the 360 controller.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.440
I was going to say I have the Steam controller.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.440
Oh, you have a Steam controller.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.440
Right.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.440
Yeah, of course.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:06.680
But I think actually my kids would probably do better with the Xbox 360 controller.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:11.220
I might be grasping at straws, but Moonlight to me seems like a potential project to keep

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:15.160
my kids on Linux, but give them access to a couple of games that are exclusive to the

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.160
Windows platform.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.960
I don't know if a Raspberry Pi is going to do it.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.640
I might also experiment with the iOS apps.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.280
I think I might experiment with just setting up a client on the Linux machine because there's

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.280
a Java client.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.280
Okay.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.280
Interesting.

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.280
Yeah.

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.600
Yeah, which Java is working fine on their machines, so I might try that.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.520
And then, and this is what I thought, well, for shits and giggles, I might give it a try.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:41.800
There's also a Chrome extension to act as a client to Moonlight streaming.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.800
That'd be convenient.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.920
It would be actually kind of great in a way.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:51.720
Any system you have this on, you could theoretically connect to your Moonlight server and start

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.880
gaming if you forwarded the ports on your firewall.

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.300
Or your kid's got a Chromebook.

01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:59.320
You don't really want them using your nice work machine, but they can use your-

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.320
Oh, yes.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.120
Actually, they have Chromebooks at school, so conceivably they will be bringing them

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.880
home someday, I suppose, as they go up in grade.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.800
Or Dylan just really needs to play Race the Sun.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.560
He doesn't want to listen to the instructor.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.560
That need is real.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.560
That is a real thing.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.560
We've all been there.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.600
Yeah, of course we have.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.160
So Moonlight's the project, Moonlight-stream.com, if you want to check it out.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:25.920
And yes, they support... So when you try it out, you can see, yeah, Chrome, then they

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:30.360
have a Java client that works on Linux and Windows and Mac, and then they have the Raspberry

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:39.160
Pi particular image, which fascinates me, because if it makes a really easy appliance,

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:42.080
then anytime they have an issue, like, well, Dad just gives you a new SD card with a new

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.720
Raspberry Pi, because I've got two of them sitting right here.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:45.800
There you go, kids.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:46.800
That fixes it.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.800
Plug that in.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:48.800
And then problem solved.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.240
Like, if the Raspberry Pi thing works and it's super appliance-like, that could be a

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.760
game changer for this whole thing, because then it takes my troubleshooting down to basically

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:56.760
nothing.

01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.760
I like that.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.200
And then, are you ready for this last one, which I'm never going to really test out?

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.200
Well, maybe.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.440
No, I'm never going to test this out.

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.200
They have an unofficial port to the Samsung Gear VR.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.200
Oh, cool.

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.200
I guess.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.200
Maybe.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.200
I don't know.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.200
I don't know.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.200
I'd have to have wimpy things.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.960
But I'll be interested to see about that monitor thing, because it makes me think, like, I

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:23.280
wonder, could you go run this on some cloud GPU box, and then, oh, I don't have my nice

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:24.280
machine on me.

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.280
But I really want to.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.720
I'm sure the latency would be terrible, but it might be worth trying.

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.720
Yeah.

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:34.680
To me, it's funny you say that, because it did make me think, like, well, what if I could

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:37.680
project the entire desktop this way?

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.920
And I don't know, like, I'd want the Windows desktop, but if you could use this, I guess

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.800
it's reliant on the GPU feature.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.600
So I mean, it's driver-dependent.

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:52.720
But it'd be such a great way to maybe, instead of use Wine, to have a Windows application

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:56.000
like AutoCAD or something like that on Linux.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Yeah.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Or Photoshop.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Or Premiere.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Yeah, that's an interesting idea.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.080
Of course, you wouldn't have local file system access, because it's on the remote system.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.240
You could have a mounted remote file system.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.040
Yeah, you'd have to have, like, or a NAS that both systems are connected to.

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.040
That might be legit.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.040
Man.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.040
Yeah, it is.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.040
It's an open source.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.040
Oh, so anyways, OK.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.040
I'm saying that a lot.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.040
I apologize.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.040
Yeah.

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.800
If you take a shot, everybody, we should create a game, and then put it in the comments.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.960
Every time I say, anyways, you have to take a shot.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.720
The thing that I was like, geez, this thing seems really far along.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:25.720
How much does it cost?

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:26.720
Well, yeah.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:27.720
I mean, what the hell?

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.320
How can something like this be this far along?

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.480
How the hell did they get this to work?

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:38.040
It's created by Case Western Reserve University as a project at the mHacks hackathon.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:42.600
And then it was taken from that at another hackathon in 2014, and now it's a project

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.160
that is ongoing.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.160
Wow.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160
That's neat.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.160
I thought so, too.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.160
That's a worthy project.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.160
That's great.

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160
I thought that was...

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.160
And it seemed really complete.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.720
And I'm like, how the hell can this be such a thing?

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:53.720
It's up on GitHub.

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:54.720
It's open source.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:55.720
It's nice to have it on the...

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:58.160
Because, like, the Steam streaming stuff, it was always like, all right, well, they

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.680
kind of just, like, you know, put it out there, but there hasn't been much happening with

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:02.680
it.

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:05.440
And then on the NVIDIA side of stuff, for me, I was like, geez, if I could take a little

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:10.320
PC with a 970 in it that has this capability and put it in the garage, and it's just they

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.840
never touch it, and it just launches these games for them.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.840
Yeah.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.840
That'd be awesome.

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:16.840
That's super great.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:22.580
But I was never going to do it if I had to have them using an NVIDIA Shield or a specific

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.800
device that supports NVIDIA Game Stream.

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.160
It's a lot less useful.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.240
That was never going to happen.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:33.640
But now that it can be anything from a Raspberry Pi to their Linux laptop, done.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.160
Check it out.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.280
And if you've played around with it, too, let me know at ChrisLAS.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:43.120
I would be really curious to know about how that's gone for you.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.360
So just a reminder, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, if you want to come to our episode

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:48.360
200 meetup.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.960
It's going to be, I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:52.960
I don't know how much...

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:53.960
We'll try to stream some of it.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:55.620
I'll put, like, a camera out the window or something.

01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:59.560
So if you can't make it in person, which would be 99.9% of you.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:00.560
We'll try to make it.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.800
Something will happen at jblive.tv.

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.320
Maybe I'll just have Wes run around inside the studio.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.960
Maybe I'll just do that.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.520
You could chase me with the drone.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.520
That'd be pretty good.

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:13.640
That'd be pretty good, Wes.

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.640
That actually, you know...

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:17.520
I wonder if we could figure out a way to livestream from the drone so we can make sure that goes

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.520
out on the livestream.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520
That would be amazing.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.520
All right.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:25.560
Well, if you want a little more of Wes Payne, check out this week's User Air.

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.680
I think it was episode 12.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:32.240
Or go grab yourself any recent episode of the TechSnap program.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.800
We subscribe to that and get Wes every single week.

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.960
Check back here on Tuesdays where we do this show live.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.080
We'd really love to have you on our virtual log.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.080
You're welcome.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.360
We just check your mic and then we get you in.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:46.160
Go to jblive.tv, join our chat room, and then do Bang Mumble to get all the info.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:48.360
And join us on our virtual log and take part of the conversation.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.840
We'd love to hear from you.

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:50.840
Thanks for being here.

01:23:50.840 --> 01:24:08.040
We'll be right back here next week.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:31.960
Bye.

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:45.720
All right, JBtitles.com.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.720
Thank you, Mumble Room.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:47.720
Yeah.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.720
Fantastic and wonderful, as always, JBtitles.

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:53.360
You know, if Gnome was as reliable as the Mumble Room, we wouldn't have those kinds

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:54.360
of problems.

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:58.160
Yeah, we really almost made it through the whole episode without a crash.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.360
So I don't think people in the final version, I don't think we made any mention of it in

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.360
the show.

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.280
But yeah, we had another Gnome crash.

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:09.600
And yes, I haven't replaced it yet because honestly, I got other things to do.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:12.040
We put this in here and it's just supposed to be working.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.240
And it almost, it's like 90%, just works.

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:18.360
Yeah, it really is just pretty much during the shows that it seems to crash.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:24.000
It sits here and runs over the weekend, although I suppose it could be crashing and we just

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.780
don't know it because the stream does eventually come back on its own.

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:28.780
So who really knows?

01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:30.880
So no, it can't actually do work.

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.880
Well, who knows really what the cause is?

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:38.560
And by the way, for the record, I got a few people that have snicker snicker Arch, well,

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.120
that's what he gets for running Arch.

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:46.100
Well, first of all, first of all, LTS kernel and LTS Nvidia driver.

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:51.800
And I suspect that the, and it's not like Gnome has changed in the last three months.

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:59.120
So I suspect that our culprit lies somewhere in either an Nvidia driver bug, something

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:05.580
happening between OpenGL and the Nvidia driver or OBS OpenGL and the Nvidia driver or something

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.840
that causes Gnome to take a shit.

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:12.000
And then when Gnome takes a shit, it reboots and in the reboot process, Paul's audio restarts

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:18.500
and technically the recording never stops, but we lose all audio for a bit.

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:25.240
So if Paul's didn't poop out, but what happens is we go back to GDM and then we go back and

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:32.160
then we go back to GDM and then we go back in and in that process, Paul's takes a shit.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:36.000
And people have suggested we switch to every distribution under the sun.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.280
People suggested we switch to XFCE or LXQT.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:45.560
Maybe we should just run OBS in an accession, just a single window full screen.

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.560
You know, maybe.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.040
I'm suggesting ZOS, just so people can suggest it.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.040
Yeah.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.800
The only thing that hasn't been suggested is Mac OS or Windows.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.000
Pretty much everything else has been suggested.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:04.440
Heart and Solus, how come nobody's voting?

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.440
JBtitles.com.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:08.160
I mean, people are voting, but it's pretty widely spread out.

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.160
Look at that.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.160
Holy shit.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:13.280
That's one of the widest spreads we've had in a while.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.160
We got to hone that in a little bit.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.160
Get that.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.160
You spread it wide over there, Chris.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.160
Yeah.

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:25.120
And the lights come on because we're getting...

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:28.160
So now you can look with the lights on, you can actually see the touch screen.

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.160
Oh, yeah.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.160
Look at that.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.160
Yeah.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:32.160
And we're getting ready for Tech Snap.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.160
All right.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:36.240
So he gets a promotion, Gnome's Bad Touch.

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.240
No, that was from the pre-show.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.240
Let's see.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.000
It was just so funny.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.320
Soul has Plugged.

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.320
Heart and Solus.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.320
Really, guys?

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:46.320
That's what we're doing?

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:49.600
We're doing Heart and Solus right now?

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:51.160
The fuck's the matter with you guys?

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.160
Come on.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.160
You know better than that.

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.160
WD.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:11.440
You know, Huey Lewis had the newest song.
