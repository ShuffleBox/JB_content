00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
There's one story I've seen going around more than any other this week, and it's the announcement

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,560
of a new project that promises to create a Linux-compatible kernel completely written

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,960
in Rust.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,960
The aim is not to replace Linux, but to create something written from scratch that aims to

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
be ABI-compatible.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,840
In other words, it would support running unmodified Linux binaries.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,840
Wes, I think you're a little skeptical pants about this one.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,840
Oh, no.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
I don't know about that.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,820
I think what I like about this project is it's intentionally limited in scope.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,280
The project author is really just trying to make something that's Linux-compatible but

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,000
that can run in a function-as-a-service runtime environment, actually using Firecracker VMs,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
also written in Rust.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,720
And so, you know, you don't have to worry about things like kernel crashes because it's

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,160
not doing long-running workloads.

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,840
That doesn't sound impossible, does it?

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,920
I actually was thinking of this as more like a tiny VM environment host, our guest kind

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,000
of a thing, or container runtime environment that's just this itty-bitty environment that's

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,120
binary-compatible.

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,200
But I liked that the motivation was the conversation around how could we use Rust in the Linux

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,660
kernel?

22
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,000
That kind of evolved into inspiration for this project to say, okay, well, let's take

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,720
this all the way.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,360
And it seems like the exact kind of thing that Free Software lends itself to, where

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,840
you can have just these, it's not, this isn't necessarily a fork, but you can have these

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,600
side projects that may never really ship, may never go into production anywhere, may

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,040
never even be a container runtime or a VM guest OS.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,040
But it can be an R&D factory for things that do actually make it in the mainline Linux

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
kernel.

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,400
Yeah, it teaches the person working on this, any contributors, and anyone along for the

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,160
ride, you know, like, what does or doesn't work about doing it this way?

32
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,080
And maybe it informs both future operating systems and the Rust language itself.

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,520
Now, it is very, very early days.

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,720
This isn't gonna, you know, this isn't gonna be like something you're gonna have some weird

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,000
distro Frankenstein thing with, with this kernel, which I think is BSD licensed, like

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,160
this isn't happening anytime soon.

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:20,040
But I'll tell you what, if it does start to happen, we're gonna give it a go.

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
My name is Chris.

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
My name is Wes.

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
And my name is Brent.

42
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,280
Hello, you two.

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,400
This episode is brought to you by the all new a cloud guru.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,120
You know, they are the leader in learning for the cloud Linux and other modern tech

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
skills.

46
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,440
They got hundreds of courses and 1000s of hands on labs get certified get hired get

47
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,700
learning at a cloud guru.com Well, coming up on the show today, it's fedora 35 release

48
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,700
day and we're making a whole theme out of it.

49
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,880
We're gonna have a project check in with Matthew Miller.

50
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,000
He's gonna tell us what's going on over there.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,160
We're then going to do our exit interview with fedora 34.

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,480
We had an opportunity to give it a spin later in its lifecycle.

53
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,980
And it's a totally different fedora.

54
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,640
So I want to have that chat and then it's our review of fedora 35 will tell you what's

55
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,200
new, what's different, what works, what doesn't work.

56
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,240
And then we'll round out the show with some great emails, some pics, some follow up, you

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,000
know, all that kind of stuff that we do.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,880
So before I go any further, I have to say time appropriate greetings, mumble room Hello

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
virtual lug.

60
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Hello.

61
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,320
Man, hello, everybody.

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,680
It's nice to be back in the studio this week.

63
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Everything's back to normal.

64
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm no longer in the woods.

65
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,720
I don't even think it's raining right now.

66
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
You're right.

67
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
It finally stopped.

68
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,660
Oh, man, that's been nice, although it was raining on the drive in.

69
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,960
So it's really only stopped while I'm in here.

70
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,600
But that aside, I mean, the weather does suck, but I kind of have I kind of have an idea.

71
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,120
Maybe this is stupid with with it getting close to the holidays and all of that.

72
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,080
But there is an opportunity at the Museum of Flight here in the Seattle area to go see

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,040
the new Mars rover and the Linux copter, you know, like their clones.

74
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,840
They have a whole Mars set up right now at the Museum of Flight.

75
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,680
And I thought, you know, maybe, maybe some in the audience might be interested in like

76
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,080
a little micro meetup at the Museum of Flight where we go check this thing out.

77
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
I don't know.

78
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
What do you think?

79
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
I'm in.

80
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
All right.

81
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
Sign me up.

82
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
Yeah, you go.

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
You go.

84
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
I mean, we can't go to Mars yet.

85
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
I don't I don't think Starship is ready.

86
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
This seems like the next best thing.

87
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Yeah.

88
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Yeah.

89
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,560
That would be nice one day to be able to go visit Mars and see the Linux copter.

90
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
What a thought.

91
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,800
I haven't really thought it all through yet, but here's what I do know.

92
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,440
The copter and the rover will be there October 30th, so they're there now through April

93
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
3rd, 2022.

94
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,800
And I think maybe we should pick something in there sooner than later with the holidays.

95
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,440
But let me know if you'd like to go and do a little micro meetup at the Museum of Flight

96
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,680
Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact or the Jupiter broadcasting telegram group, Jupiter

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,840
broadcasting dot com slash telegram or on Twitter at Chris Elias.

98
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,800
Let me know if you'd be interested in a little hyper local meetup.

99
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,240
I know this doesn't apply to ninety nine percent of you out there, but what an opportunity.

100
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,080
I thought if some of us got together and went down there, Wes and I could bring our microphones,

101
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,640
we could capture a little bit of it and we'd share it with you guys.

102
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,320
So it kind of be like you went.

103
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,040
But I don't really have any other details than that.

104
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,720
I guess I've been back for what, two months and I'm jonesing for a meetup again already.

105
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,200
I guess that's how long it takes to get back from the woods and I'm ready to see people.

106
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
I guess that's a good thing.

107
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Well, I think it speaks well of our audience.

108
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Yeah.

109
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
So let me know.

110
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,480
Contact page is probably the best place.

111
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,360
And once I hear from a few people, if I even hear from I'd say four or five people, really,

112
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
it doesn't need to be a lot.

113
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,920
It's just enough for like, you know, like a lunch crew so we can we can share all our

114
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
fun learnings.

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,240
Although I have to say, I'm a little upset because just about every week I get an email

116
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,040
from somebody in the, quote unquote, Seattle area and I'm like, how come I've never met

117
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,160
you?

118
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,960
Why have you never been to anything we've done?

119
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,160
Why don't you go to Linux Fest?

120
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,080
Like there's a lot of people who listen in the West Coast area, secret Seattle JB fans

121
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
out there.

122
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
What are you doing?

123
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,500
I think they're all hanging out with you downtown.

124
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
That's what I think.

125
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
And you guys just aren't sharing.

126
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
But that's fine.

127
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
That's fine.

128
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Well, I mean, we already had a crew.

129
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
There's a lot to invite you.

130
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm so far away.

131
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,160
You know, you got to wait like a half hour.

132
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Think of Levi.

133
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
That's true.

134
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
That's true.

135
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,160
That is a good point.

136
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,640
Well, this is our Fedora episode and we wanted to have a little project check in with Matthew

137
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Miller.

138
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,000
He's the project leader, perhaps maybe better known as the real beefy miracle.

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,760
Matthew, welcome back to Linux Unplugged.

140
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,440
Hey, glad to be here.

141
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,120
And thank you very much for taking the time to join us on release day.

142
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,720
Yeah, absolutely.

143
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,320
It's a little chaotic, but you know, I got some time.

144
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,800
Well, we appreciate it.

145
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,080
And we've been checking out the new release and I want to get there.

146
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,400
But you know, trying out the last several releases of Fedora, I really felt like this

147
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:06,920
trend picked up momentum in 33, then 34 brought us GNOME 40, now 35 is bringing us Wire Plumber

148
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
and GNOME 41.

149
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,200
Where I sit and having watched this stuff for a long time, I think there was a period

150
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,920
of time where Ubuntu was really setting the tone for the desktop.

151
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,760
And I feel like the transition of that baton has been completed with the last several releases

152
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,840
of Fedora, and now it really feels to me like Fedora is leading the direction of future

153
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,760
desktop Linux.

154
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,200
And people are looking to the Fedora project to see what direction things are going in.

155
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,840
And as a result of that, I think we're seeing some better traction with things like Wayland

156
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,200
and PipeWire and the entire ecosystem is improving as a result of that.

157
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,880
And I think it contributes to that momentum.

158
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,720
And I'm curious if you see this from where you're sitting at in the project and what

159
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,000
your, or maybe you think I'm wrong, but just what your observations are about this trend.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,480
I'll take it.

161
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,160
I think people in Fedora have been working on these things for quite a long time, longer

162
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,040
than that.

163
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,920
I won't speak bad about the other Linux distributions at all.

164
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,080
I'm going to try to just completely avoid the comparison.

165
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,160
But I think it's often the case that we've had a hard time getting those out to users

166
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,200
in a timely fashion.

167
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,720
We struggled with meeting our own schedule for a while.

168
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,920
And despite a one week delay this time, it's fine.

169
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,480
We've really been meeting our six month schedules really reliably, which helps.

170
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,880
And we've been doing a better job about kind of talking about the things we've done.

171
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,000
There's been a lot of cases where people working in Fedora, people in the Red Hat desktop team

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,040
like actually made stuff that ended up being headline features in other distros first.

173
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,080
So we're actually getting it out and talking about it sooner.

174
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,120
So I think that's part of it.

175
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,800
I think that we generally have a lot of new positive growing enthusiasm and energy around

176
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,640
Fedora as a project overall.

177
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,240
And I think that reflects in what both the actual technical output of all the people

178
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,480
working on it and just kind of all the polish around it that goes into making a release

179
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,720
and then in delivering a good experience to everybody.

180
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,400
So I'll get to my experience in a bit.

181
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,040
But while we're on this kind of trend line here, I'm curious if you can fill in the details

182
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,520
on how something like the following will work for Fedora.

183
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,520
So I've been noticing that Red Hat's been making a lot of significant hires that are

184
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,480
going to have a big impact on future desktop features at some point.

185
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,080
You know, I mean, it's very early because they're just opening the positions.

186
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,000
But I've recently seen positions open for HDR support on Linux.

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,640
I've seen more positions open for improving 3D and Vulkan and video.

188
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:48,320
I've seen hiring in all kinds of areas that are really like the low plumbing of desktop

189
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Linux.

190
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,040
And the Red Hat hires, but that work that's going to be developed, that must be happening

191
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
in Fedora.

192
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Is that correct?

193
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,560
Actually, generally, that work, we try to make it happen as far upstream as possible

194
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,160
because it's the right thing to do and it's less work for Red Hat really in the long run,

195
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,240
even if it sometimes feels like harder work up front.

196
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,880
So a lot of that work actually will go into the upstream projects and then kind of by

197
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,680
its nature, but also because the same people are working on it, we then try and bring those

198
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,040
things into Fedora as features pretty quickly and soon.

199
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,240
And it obviously helps when it's the same person working on the thing in an upstream

200
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,800
and in the project itself.

201
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,280
So like the pipewire stuff, I think is a good example of that.

202
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,200
I wonder if you felt like I did over the summer as I saw these positions.

203
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,200
I counted it up for Linux Action News a few weeks ago and I think it was like seven new

204
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,580
positions that have been opened and since then, there's like another position.

205
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,320
So I think in total, it's like eight positions.

206
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
It just keeps going.

207
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Yeah.

208
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,000
I saw that as, you know, there's been a lot of talk of post IBM acquisition.

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What's it mean for Fedora?

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
What's it mean for some of their free software contributions that contribute upstream and

211
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,080
some of us worried it could mean like the bean counters are going to get involved and

212
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,040
dial that stuff down and we're now several years into this now.

213
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,280
And it seems like there's actually increasing investment in this stuff that doesn't directly

214
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,120
translate to a rail product.

215
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,120
I mean, I acknowledge there is rail workstation and all that, but you know, I'm getting that

216
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,920
like it feels like this is this is the actual walk that is matching the talk.

217
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
Yeah.

218
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,360
Some of that I got a very carefully bracket with, like I can't speak to IBM business or

219
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
anything.

220
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,640
I have no idea, let alone like even even if I knew I couldn't.

221
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,720
But actually, the case is, I don't even know.

222
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,000
And my question really is about is, does this feel to you like the real kind of validation

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,960
that there is going to be continued investment here from just a personal feeling?

224
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Yeah.

225
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
So, right.

226
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,920
So, yeah, I can speak as a person and an employee.

227
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,320
I think, you know, a lot of us at Red Hat were worried about this acquisition, what

228
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,640
would happen.

229
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,880
But we were assured at the time that, you know, well, like that was really important

230
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,120
to them and they wanted to continue to invest in it.

231
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,480
It wasn't it was not an extract money thing.

232
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,920
I think we kind of see some validation in the spin off of Kindle.

233
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,880
I don't know how much big boring business news you follow, but that's happening like

234
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,440
this week, which is like the IBM managed service stuff is basically going away.

235
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,520
So Red Hat is going to be a bigger chunk of the new IBM than it ever was before.

236
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,880
So it's really significant.

237
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,720
So yeah, Red Hat real success is very important to the future of IBM.

238
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,680
And I think we're seeing that borne out.

239
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,320
Another thing that's going on here, there's actually a lot of these things you're seeing

240
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,880
are desktop related technologies, but they're actually hires related to an automotive initiative,

241
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,120
which you'll see automotive keywords and a lot of these hires as well.

242
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,480
And I don't have a lot of the details on that, but it is connected into things that

243
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,320
are, you know, useful on the desktop, but also useful in other contexts as well.

244
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,760
And, you know, the more we can find things that tie all these things together, the more

245
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
we all benefit.

246
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,440
It's funny, Wes and I were just kind of remarking about that off air yesterday that even some

247
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,960
of the work in the pipeline is about to enable AV in automotive Linux.

248
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,640
Yeah, exactly.

249
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,880
And then that benefits us all.

250
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,720
So yeah, that's awesome.

251
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,240
I'm down for that, right?

252
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,160
Like I think that's actually been one of the low key brilliant things about desktop Linux

253
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,380
that we underappreciate is how we have been able to leverage where the business is willing

254
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,520
to invest to also enrich the desktop and benefit from that.

255
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,960
It's just like the next level of shared infrastructure, right?

256
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,600
The kernel is doing that and the desktop is trying to do that, too.

257
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Yeah.

258
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,120
Maybe Fedora is the king at that, really.

259
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, I hope so.

260
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,880
Yeah, I think so, maybe.

261
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,480
So this is, okay, so this is release day of Fedora 35 and GNOME 41 is in here.

262
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,960
Fedora is going to be out ahead with GNOME 41 for a while.

263
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,280
But when you look at the release overall, Matthew, I'm kind of curious, just personally

264
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,200
as a longtime Fedora user, what's jumping out to you?

265
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,320
So yeah, on the desktop, I switched to it when the beta hit.

266
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,640
So I have to remember back to what's new.

267
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,160
But I really do feel like this is a really like a polished release and not in a bad way

268
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,600
where GNOME 40 had a lot of changes and then there's a lot of things that are responding

269
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,400
to people's feedback about that.

270
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,080
Like one of the things that's a big change that I appreciate is there's a setting for

271
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,760
the multi-monitor workspaces now that wasn't there originally.

272
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,360
And also a lot of little things like that were looked at and addressed, I think like

273
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,160
the new power settings, things like those are some nice things that kind of build on

274
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,600
features in GNOME 40 before, so I'm glad to see those things.

275
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,360
I think there's also a lot of exciting things going on in the project, like the Fedora Cloud

276
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,160
work in group is really energized and I was looking at the Fedora Linux 34 statistics

277
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,560
and we have something like 15% of Fedora systems are Fedora Cloud when you look at systems

278
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,800
that are installed over a period of time.

279
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,160
So we don't track individual systems, but we have a thing where systems by default will

280
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,360
report in once a week just with a count me.

281
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,840
And so we can tell if a system, and there's no UID or anything attached to it, so we can't

282
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,320
actually tell which systems they are, but we can kind of get a difference between the

283
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,340
number of systems that just show up once, like test systems and so on, or systems that

284
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,240
show up beyond that.

285
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,640
So of those test systems, 30% of them are Fedora Cloud and like another big chunk of

286
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,380
them are Fedora Container, not surprising.

287
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,520
So it's interesting to see like how much non-desktop use is going on in Fedora as well,

288
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:40,560
which I think is important because, okay, I was talking about that Synergy and Synergy

289
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,980
is a terrible business word, but just that like thing we get when we've got lots of

290
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,520
different things working together in the same project.

291
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,920
If we were to become just a desktop OS, it's kind of harder to get all of the investment

292
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,440
from Red Hat, but from everybody who has all these different interests working together

293
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,260
in one thing that lists everything.

294
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,680
So I think it's exciting to see, even though the cloud stuff isn't desktop focused, I think

295
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,840
it will help lift up desktop Fedora and just like the enthusiasm around desktop Fedora

296
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,720
and GNOME and so on kind of helps, I think, support that enthusiasm around our cloud offering

297
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
as well.

298
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,280
That wouldn't even be there if the desktop weren't there and people were not paying attention

299
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
to that.

300
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,400
So I think it all works together really nicely.

301
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,780
Well, you can see that maybe with cloud shipping, ButterFS as the default file system now, right?

302
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,920
After kind of having proven itself over on the workstation.

303
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,960
Yeah, yeah, great.

304
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Exactly that.

305
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
That's exactly what I was thinking, Wes.

306
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,560
I wonder if some of that adoption is because of that ButterFS switch.

307
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,840
I've never really thought about it in the use case of like on a VPS, but I actually

308
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,800
now that I'm working through that, I could actually see the logic.

309
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,520
Just like the data integrity stuff, I appreciate that from my photo collection, right?

310
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,200
Like I want to know if some bit rot flipped, like that's important.

311
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,240
And you like the send receive stuff is pretty nice as well for server uses.

312
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Yep.

313
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,960
So I just overall I just wanted to this isn't really a question so much as I just wanted

314
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:11,320
to pass along how impressed I was at how complete the arm ISO felt.

315
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,920
This is the first opportunity I've ever had to download an ISO image of a Fedora arm release.

316
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,640
Usually it's like I get an image file and I flash that to an SD card and I've never

317
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,720
really gone through like the complete process like I would for a real x86 computer is how

318
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,160
I put it where I get an ISO image and I run through the actual installer and I installed

319
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,640
it on a computer, but I had a chance to run it in an arm VM and I don't think people would

320
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
in fact.

321
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,760
In fact, now that I think about it, my son didn't even realize he was on arm Linux at

322
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
people.

323
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
You just wouldn't know.

324
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,840
It feels like a very complete implementation and you maniacs have all kinds of architectures

325
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
you support.

326
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,960
When I go and look in the in those download folders, I'm just amazed at the amount of

327
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,680
ISOs you must be spinning out.

328
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
Yeah.

329
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:04,200
If you have an S390 mainframe, IBM Z, we've got you covered.

330
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:12,280
I know some people who have power system workstations, is it a laptop, the Talos system?

331
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:20,720
I've never actually seen one, but yeah, what you were saying, this has actually been somewhat

332
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,760
hard for Fedora because this has always been our aspiration.

333
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,520
When we have another architecture, we want to make it an equal thing and make it, like

334
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,720
you said, you don't need to know you're in a different architecture.

335
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,560
You get the full, powerful, complete operating system.

336
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:45,200
Some of this stuff where other distributions have been content to have specialized kernels

337
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,960
and stripped down versions, which there's nothing wrong with that.

338
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,120
It's just a different approach.

339
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,240
Sometimes we've been behind because we're not able to get everything out so quickly

340
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,840
because we want it to be so complete.

341
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,480
But then the final result, when it gets there, is you have an amazing, fully functional operating

342
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,240
system that you can know and understand and treat like something else.

343
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,320
ARM is now, I think there's the RISC-V stuff, which is pretty interesting.

344
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,760
I'm talking to a lot of people about that as an emerging architecture.

345
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,160
I'm not going to pick any winners, but I find it really fascinating.

346
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,720
It's basically an open hardware implementation, open source hardware, and there's a lot of

347
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,640
enthusiasm around that.

348
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,680
That's not an official Fedora architecture right now, but there are some unofficial builds

349
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:39,680
of it, and we're looking at bringing that on maybe at least as a shadow architecture

350
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,520
and then maybe official sometime in the next few years.

351
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,160
I think that's pretty cool.

352
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,520
That is really exciting.

353
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
I love to hear that.

354
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,440
I love that you just got your eye on it.

355
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,680
Well, Matthew, will you please relay our congratulations and our gratitude to the entire Fedora community?

356
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,380
They've created another fantastic release, and thank you for taking some time to come

357
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,380
join us.

358
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,380
Yeah, absolutely.

359
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,000
And I'll be very interested in hearing what your experiences are.

360
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,320
So I'm going to run off and do some other things, but I'm going to listen to that later

361
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,860
when I get a chance.

362
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,480
Thank you very much.

363
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Leno.com slash unplugged.

364
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,560
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you support the show, right?

365
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,080
Just like saying, hey, thanks for supporting my favorite Linux podcast.

366
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,240
It's really what makes this work is you guys go there and Linode is willing to offer you

367
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,760
something pretty substantial in exchange.

368
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,080
I mean, $100 that says go try it and go form a real opinion, right?

369
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,240
Like they could give you $15 of credit.

370
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,200
You could start to get a first impression, but they're giving you $100 to really go try

371
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
this thing.

372
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,920
They've been around for 18 years making this the best way to run applications on Linux.

373
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,020
If it runs on Linux, you can run it on Linode.

374
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,000
They are our infrastructure, and I suppose I could go get locked into one of the big

375
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,140
huge hyperscalers who has a totally custom weird system.

376
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:01,280
And I could just just spend money like crazy as people download podcasts, or I could go

377
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,760
like buy some rack space somewhere and some colo, but I mean, that almost feels like caveman

378
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
stuff.

379
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,920
Like that's what we did back in the 90s, right?

380
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,720
I mean, and when you look at Linode's pricing, it's 30 to 50% cheaper than any of those hyperscalers

381
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,640
and you're going to get $100 from our offer to actually really try it out.

382
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,400
It's a great way to try out new projects too as things come along.

383
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,080
It's like my R&D place for sure.

384
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,880
It's when you look at the invoice that comes in, like some months there's like all these

385
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,760
weird R&D servers that come on the next month, they're all gone.

386
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,700
And I'm just kind of messing around with stuff all the time.

387
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,720
But I also noticed in the news today that Zoom announced the free versions of Zoom are

388
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,560
going to get ads now, yay, ads in your Zoom meetings.

389
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:51,800
And this is maybe just one of those windows of opportunity where you can say, hey, y'all,

390
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,240
would you rather switch to something free that we can host ourselves and have control

391
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
over?

392
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,600
Because Linode's got a one click deployment for Jitsi.

393
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,400
This could be your window of opportunity.

394
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,840
You get the $100 credit, you deploy that thing, $100 means y'all could try that out for a

395
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,460
while and not have to pay a dime.

396
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,760
They also have lots of other one click deployments or you can go the whole DIY route.

397
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:16,440
I mean, like nuke and pave and build up your own thing, like I have a crazy esoteric VPN

398
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,120
distro for my PEP wave on Linode.

399
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,320
My peplink router and it has this crazy combo LTE VPN.

400
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,800
And of course, they have their own Linux distribution.

401
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,480
Well, wouldn't you know it, Linode has so many great guides and tutorials, they've even

402
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,640
got a guide on how to do that kind of thing.

403
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,680
And they have super fast networking, incredibly fast rigs, they've just upgraded their MVME

404
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
storage.

405
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,080
They're just blazing fast and they support a lot of community projects.

406
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,160
And they've made things like our Jupiter colony reunion road trip possible.

407
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,180
I doubt that made them a ton of money, right?

408
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,240
It's expensive to drive lady jips, but they wanted to make that community connection.

409
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,000
They brought out their own people too.

410
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,800
They were hanging out with us.

411
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,080
It was pretty cool and it's pretty neat to see them do that kind of stuff.

412
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,200
They don't have to do that kind of thing.

413
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,080
So go sign up today and try it out.

414
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,000
Linode.com slash unplugged get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account and your support

415
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,800
in this here show Linode.com slash unplugged.

416
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,920
All right, before we get to Fedora 35, all the hype, all the new things, let's conduct

417
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,840
a Fedora 34 exit interview.

418
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,120
This is something we'd like to do more of something like a chance to follow up on a

419
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,760
distro a little later in its release cycle.

420
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,940
And we should be clear about this too, just because 35 is out doesn't mean Fedora 34 is

421
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
going anywhere.

422
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,560
It's going to be with us for a bit longer.

423
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,220
Actually the end of life is scheduled for May 17th, 2022.

424
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,920
So let's see if you're a regular Fedora day to day user and you're not quite ready to

425
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,440
try out 35, which just lands today.

426
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,080
What's life like for you right now?

427
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,200
Yeah, I recently had a chance to give Fedora 34 a go.

428
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,880
And kind of like Matthew was saying, I never do this.

429
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm always trying out Fedora as it hits the beta cycle, that I really kind of get serious

430
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,220
as it firms up and what you could kind of consider the RC phase.

431
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,520
And then I'm always doing like fresh installs of the actual released version and I'm doing

432
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,760
upgrades to the newly released version and I'm always kind of in that mode of Fedora's

433
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,600
life cycle and I kind of live there.

434
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,560
I almost never ever go back to a late stage distro, if you will, somehow you've moved

435
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
on already.

436
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,440
Yeah, I just don't normally have a reason to.

437
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,560
But I've been thinking recently about how it'd be nice to move my son and then if that

438
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,000
works for him, my daughters over to Fedora because then they'd be on what I'm using.

439
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,920
I want to be able to recommend Fedora to friends and family, but I didn't feel like I could.

440
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:54,520
And so I wanted to try giving a slightly older version a go and see if that changed my experience

441
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,640
and what it might be for somebody who might have, like my son, a more gaming focused desktop

442
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
setup.

443
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
Yeah, that's a good question.

444
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,320
Like what does the support life cycle of a Fedora family member actually look like?

445
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,400
But beyond that, I think Fedora 34 in particular, it just had a lot of changes going on and

446
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,420
something of an elephant in the room because when it landed, we were kind of still reassuring

447
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:24,840
people that Fedora was OK after all the big CentOS news, plus GNOME 40 had just shipped

448
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,380
and was brand new and had a ton of changes that were quite controversial.

449
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,800
And we were switching to pipeline by default.

450
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,640
And all of this was going to be the base for RHEL 9.

451
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,960
I mean, it was just it was a lot of neat stuff and a lot to be excited about, but also a

452
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,640
lot of stuff that had to be tested and maybe had some questions around it.

453
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Yeah.

454
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,000
And so many like GNOME extensions were broken.

455
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,880
PipeWire was causing issues for people that were joining like Zoom meetings.

456
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,640
And so the question was, is what is this going to be like after things shake out?

457
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,640
So we're six months into its life cycle now, pretty much right on the nose.

458
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,160
And I did an update of a Fedora 34 install I did today, just a regular update.

459
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,280
And yeah, sure enough, you know, there's still every few days fresh packages.

460
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,240
In fact, I have to say, because they keep the kernel current and they keep pretty much

461
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,520
everything else current, except for really they just iterate on the desktop environment.

462
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,160
And up to date, Fedora 34 install right now, even as 35 releases, still feels quite modern

463
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,400
in just about every way.

464
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,480
But the thing that's kind of nice now is just about all the critical, if you will, for lack

465
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,800
of a better term, GNOME extensions have caught up to GNOME 40 now.

466
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,560
So the situation there is a lot better.

467
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:47,040
And I noticed a significant improvement for third party software for Fedora 34.

468
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:53,000
Like you can go find prepackaged RPMs for Fedora 34 for like a commercial application

469
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,600
or a popular open source app, or they'll have their repository already updated.

470
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Yeah, exactly.

471
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,880
All those things that you're kind of understanding when you're trying out the beta because of

472
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,120
course they don't have support yet.

473
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,240
And then, oh, yeah, eventually they do update.

474
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,200
And the other thing too, Wes, is like a lot of the guides are just not all of them.

475
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Some of them are still horribly outdated, but a lot of guides have been refreshed for

476
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,320
the new version of Fedora.

477
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,960
And so by that point, six months into it, like if somebody is going to update their

478
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,280
guide for Fedora, they've done it at that point.

479
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,040
And that those all those things, they're like they remove paper cuts to switching.

480
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:33,640
And I actually think a Fedora release six months into its release cycle is sort of sitting

481
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,560
in a special sweet spot in the Linux ecosystem where it's got a lot of kinks worked out,

482
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,160
especially if you grab fresh packages.

483
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,280
It's got pretty good third party support and community support at that point.

484
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:53,180
It's still because it's Fedora, a very modern install, and you've still got months of support.

485
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,240
So you could just ride that for at least another six months and then upgrade to the next version

486
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,320
that's now becoming the old version of Fedora.

487
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,600
I think it makes a life a little easier and I think this is the one that's the version

488
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,400
of Fedora, the one that's about six months into its life cycle that you can recommend.

489
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,280
And I've teased people before that say, oh, wait a few months when you're looking at it

490
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,920
for like a family machine.

491
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Just wait a release.

492
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
That's what you're saying, huh?

493
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Yeah, right.

494
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,120
Wait a release because each each release gets 13 months of support.

495
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,280
So you got some buffer time for everything to kind of get worked out and they don't care

496
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,240
if they're on the latest and greatest.

497
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
That's just it.

498
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
You're right.

499
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
Most people don't care.

500
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,200
I mean, we care, but it's not necessarily rational.

501
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Yeah.

502
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Yeah.

503
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,160
Part of it's enthusiasm driven for sure.

504
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,340
But you know, but it also means I could wait a little bit on my main machine, maybe three

505
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,360
months after release, update a little bit before everybody, do a little checking around,

506
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,520
see how things are going.

507
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:54,360
You know, like there's I kind of I like this idea that maybe my main rig that I'm on, maybe

508
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:00,180
three months into that final six months, I upgrade and I figure out what needs still

509
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,640
to be fixed or what works fine.

510
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,240
And then when the next release drops, I upgrade the kids machines.

511
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,640
And then, of course, you've got you know, you've got stream in the mix, too.

512
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,200
If you have something that might need to be even more stable than that down the road.

513
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Yeah, true.

514
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
There that could be interesting.

515
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,960
A sent us nine stream for a family, for family and friends, perhaps.

516
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,440
But when we were trying this out, we wanted to give this an honest go like, can I give

517
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,960
this to friends and family?

518
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,660
And what I envisioned is bringing everybody to Fedora, put everybody on Fedora and put

519
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,800
everyone on a tail scale network, which is a wire guard mesh VPN solution.

520
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
All right.

521
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
So you've got everyone there.

522
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,760
You can access everyone machine just right over tail scale.

523
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
That makes sense.

524
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Right.

525
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Super simple.

526
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,960
And if they need support, I can SSH to their machine.

527
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,120
But I wanted to go a little bit further than that.

528
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,000
And I wanted to do remote desktop support.

529
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,800
And I love Rust Desk, but Rust Desk is X11 only.

530
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
No.

531
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,920
And, you know, in Fedora 34 and in Fedora 35, on GNOME, the Wayland supports.

532
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
It's really nice.

533
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,440
It's you get a better experience now and I don't want to I don't want to go backwards

534
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,440
for them.

535
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
I know, right.

536
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
Maybe in some ways.

537
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,240
But when Wayland works, it works really well.

538
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,360
Yeah, it's smooth as butter, but not butter, but butter.

539
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,840
But so we were digging around.

540
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,160
You and I were doing this, I think, after we did LAN one day.

541
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:30,600
And we found that the recommended way to kind of do this now on Wayland with GNOME Shell

542
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,420
is to use the RDP server that's built into GNOME Shell that I think uses pipewire and

543
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,380
all this kind of stuff on the back end.

544
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,880
But we discovered that it's not actually shipping yet.

545
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,640
Some of the documentation talks about it like it exists, but it doesn't actually fully exist

546
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
yet.

547
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
Yeah.

548
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
So, like, you might see this.

549
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,640
You can enable the remote desktop stuff.

550
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,400
But by default, it just exposes it over VNC.

551
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
And we gave that a try.

552
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
But it's a VNC.

553
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,560
It's not going to be great over a remote network.

554
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,920
But at some point they added via free RDP RDP support baked in as well.

555
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,960
But yeah, there's just no.

556
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,420
Because this is Linux, there's just nothing exposed graphically right now.

557
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,840
And setting it up and enabling it and providing default credentials, well, there's a guide,

558
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,480
but it's not exactly simple.

559
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,040
It wasn't horribly bad.

560
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,560
Like, I think we ended up pulling down a few things from GitHub and building them and then

561
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
moving them around, right?

562
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,920
Then maybe we had to start something with systemd.

563
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,400
So there was some futzing.

564
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
Yeah, you're right.

565
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
We did have to.

566
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
There's like a little script that's posted.

567
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,160
We'll have it linked in the show notes that you got to compile and then that lets you

568
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,440
configure like the credentials set up so that you can put a password on it and then you

569
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,960
go in and modify with decomp some settings.

570
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,680
And then I think, yeah, we just logged out, logged back in.

571
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,200
It did work, though, at the end of the day, that that was the part that was pretty nice.

572
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
It seemed decent.

573
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,460
Oh, man, it worked really good.

574
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,520
If you had the right RDP client, like we tried a couple of them and I wish I would have written

575
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,920
down the one that didn't work very good.

576
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,200
I want to say it was Romania, but I'm not sure.

577
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,640
But if you got the right RDP client, like Microsoft's RDP client or there's there's

578
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,440
like XRDP, there's a couple with the right settings.

579
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,760
It's impressively high performance.

580
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,640
It's much better than VNC.

581
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,760
I think it was near real time because we had the laptop and we had the remote machine right

582
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
next to each other.

583
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,900
It was there's just a very, very slight lag, which makes me think that if I was supporting

584
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,360
them over a remote link, it'd probably be fairly usable.

585
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,480
Yeah, that's that's the test.

586
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,160
But I just need this to work a little.

587
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,640
And it would work for family support machine, I think.

588
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,120
I think it would actually do the job.

589
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,480
So the only problem is, and I haven't tested this yet, dang it.

590
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,720
Now that I think about this, I wish I would have.

591
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm not sure if this is going to break when I go from GNOME 40 to GNOME 41.

592
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,340
And I just did that on my machine that we we did this test set up on.

593
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,160
So after the show, I'll see if RDP is still working on it.

594
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,720
We've got some follow up to do.

595
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,640
Yeah, I should have thought of that.

596
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,880
I was just you know, I was so focused on getting the upgrade and so worried that it was going

597
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,880
to break my Fedora 34 install, because as I was going through this little journey.

598
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,520
To see if this was a usable setup.

599
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:15,120
What I ended up with at the end of my Fedora 34 walk, if you will, is one of my all time

600
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,560
favorite Linux installs.

601
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,120
I really liked it.

602
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,640
It doesn't happen very often anymore, but it became precious to me and I was worried

603
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,760
that the upgrade would break it.

604
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,600
I know that's how much I liked the 34 experience six months into its life cycle.

605
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,000
I'd say I was impressed, but it felt early days when it released.

606
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,080
But six months in, it became my favorite setup I've ever had on that ThinkPad.

607
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,400
It really it really rocked.

608
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:49,580
So yeah, I think this is a really capable family distro if you just give it a little

609
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,040
bit for the community to catch up to it.

610
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,320
As well, Fedora isn't as just crazy moving forward as Arch.

611
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,800
It is fairly out there on the edge of things.

612
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,040
So I don't know if this is just me being crazy, but Brian, I kind of actually feel like maybe

613
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,880
we'll get into this in our review, but I kind of feel like this might be the perfect Fedora

614
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
set up for you.

615
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Oh, tell me more.

616
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Why do you think that?

617
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,880
Well, if somebody came to me like I have this, I have I always remember this conversation

618
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
I had.

619
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,680
There was this buddy of mine who was this big time PHP developer and he said, Chris,

620
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,440
I am so frustrated with Linux.

621
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,120
I just want to get my work done.

622
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,160
And he said, I installed Ubuntu and I can't remember what it was.

623
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,440
It was probably like eight, ten or something.

624
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,520
It was a long time ago.

625
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,600
And he said, you know, this isn't working.

626
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
That isn't working.

627
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,400
My PHP environment is broken and went on and on.

628
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:41,640
And so I introduced him to the Ubuntu LTS model and I said, here's what you need to

629
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,160
kind of whenever the LTS was kind of new.

630
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,600
So I don't know how long ago this was.

631
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,460
And I said, this is kind of what this is what you probably want to be running for your kind

632
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,960
of workload.

633
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,240
And Fedora doesn't offer anything like that.

634
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,800
They don't have an LTS version.

635
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,620
They have 13 months of support.

636
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,600
And then, of course, there's sent off stream, but it's not really quite the same comparable

637
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,840
desktop environment yet.

638
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:08,160
But I think this this model that we're talking about here where you kind of you ride six

639
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,600
months behind release is essentially as close to an LTS model as you're going to get with

640
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:20,200
mainline Fedora, because the upgrade experience is pretty smooth and the reliability and community

641
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,560
support is pretty high.

642
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,240
So when you want to troubleshoot in the middle of the night, you can find a guide online

643
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,300
and you can get it fixed instead of having to wait for somebody to, you know, like figure

644
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,440
it out, who's still like maybe waiting for the bug report to come in.

645
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
Right.

646
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
Do you see what I'm saying?

647
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Like, it's those are all things I love for sure.

648
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Yeah.

649
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,960
It's a more reliable target for the for if you wanted to be in the Fedora user land,

650
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,280
but you wanted that kind of reliability, I think that's the target right there.

651
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,560
Well, and to be fair, I do the same thing with the Ubuntu LTS right now.

652
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,180
I wait a few I wait several months, actually, because the reality of how much engineering

653
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,280
goes behind these things is that there's just inevitably some stuff that once you get it

654
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,760
out to users, there's like thousands and thousands of users who find all these bugs and things.

655
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,940
And then it's so three months later, six months later, of course, going to be more polished.

656
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:13,480
So I think that's a good strategy for anybody who's risk averse.

657
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,720
Maybe it's a good way to put it.

658
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,400
Or the first job is that it's a work tool.

659
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,080
The second job is that it's a tinker tool, right?

660
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,600
Like my see my think a lot of times my ordering slightly different, like sometimes tinker

661
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,380
tool is above work tool on some of my systems.

662
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,020
But you don't have seven systems like I do, right?

663
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,420
So you've got to you've got to narrow that focus a little bit more.

664
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,400
So honest, what I'm saying is if you came to me, like we just met at an event and you

665
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,080
and I didn't, you know, know each other and you said, Chris, what Linux should I use?

666
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,920
I'm a photographer and I want to be very reliable and I have a lot of things going on right

667
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,840
now and I need to be able to just open up my computer and have it work and perform well.

668
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,720
I would today if you asked me that I'd say fedora 34.

669
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,840
I don't think I'd say anything else.

670
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,840
I'd say go get fedora 34 and bring it fully up to date.

671
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,000
unpluggedcore.com want to support the show directly go to unpluggedcore.com and become

672
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,380
a member you get the full live feed the very long version of the show if you'd like or

673
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:12,440
you can get a nice cut down version with limited spots that Joe makes his full production you

674
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,380
know it's got all the Joe quality it just a little bit shorter runtime which can be

675
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,960
nice if you have a shorter commute but you also are supporting the show and on top of

676
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,620
that you're going to get access to special promo codes when we have new merch if and

677
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:29,760
when I'm not saying anything not announcing anything but I'm just saying if new things

678
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,680
were in the works and they were going to be announced as a thank you to our members we

679
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,200
offer discount codes so you can support the show get discount codes on new jb merch and

680
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,480
of course you get access to the two feeds the live uncut feed or the fully produced

681
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,520
shorter limited ad feed that's just a thank you for everyone out there who supports us

682
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:56,000
at unpluggedcore.com okay I think we've stretched out long enough we got to talk about fedora

683
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,680
35 it lands today and the way the fedora release cycle works is they kind of have some target

684
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:08,800
weeks and they release when the blocking bugs have been fixed or a solution is in place

685
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,200
it's not so much a date driven release as it is things aren't broken so we can ship

686
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,480
release and I have to say I'm I'm actually completely fine with that model and we just

687
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,120
kind of watch the bug tracker because it's all out in the open and you all can kind of

688
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,800
just follow along and find out when they're gonna release and yeah you know we get it

689
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,760
when it's ready why not yeah no rush and this version features gnome 41 which has been

690
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:37,840
out for a little bit in fact it looks like gnome 41.1 is just about just about out and

691
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,840
it includes in gnome 41 some improved power management options which we can touch on in

692
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:49,760
a little bit also like Matthew was saying those new controls for how the virtual desktop

693
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,320
layout I guess is how I'll say it works with virtual monitors and some more work on that

694
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,040
RDP back end that we were talking about and I have to say the thing that I'm most excited

695
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,480
about is the continued evolution of pipe wire in fedora and wire plumber as the session

696
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:13,400
manager so in fedora 34 we got pipe wire and under the hood it was kind of just using some

697
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,760
some default hard coded logic but pipe wire can do a lot more than that and so what wire

698
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,560
plumber is is it's a session manager that's going to enable future customizing that we

699
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,840
might use here in the studio of routing audio and setting things up in a very particular

700
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,560
way eventually there'll be things that sit on top of wire plumber there's some graphical

701
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,680
applications in the works right now one called hell VM I think that is a GTK patch bay it

702
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,080
really actually kind of replicates the patch bay of the early days of the music industry

703
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,040
where you're taking a wire from one device and you're running it to another device and

704
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,920
that's in the works right now and underneath that will be wire plumber and you'll be able

705
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,920
to save different sessions so you could maybe have like this is my jitzy meeting session

706
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,800
where my audio comes from my microphone and I also am taking audio from my other browser

707
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,800
so maybe like you have Firefox as your second browser like I do you could have a wire plumber

708
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:12,820
session that brings audio from your USB microphone and from Firefox and sends it in as an input

709
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,240
device that you have selected in your video meeting so you could play audio from your

710
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,960
web browser into the meeting or from VLC it's it's going to give you this kind of flexibility

711
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,800
so when you hear us talk about pipe wire and you hear us mention wire plumber the session

712
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,560
manager what you're going to get as an end user for you never going to do audio production

713
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,560
is you're going to get that kind of flexibility you can do a you know a VoIP call with somebody

714
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,860
and route audio in there and have your own soundboard if you want and have your own wacky

715
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:43,340
zoo thing or maybe you want to screen share your web browser and you want to play a presentation

716
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,440
and you want to capture the audio from that as well now you're going to be able to do

717
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,400
all that kind of stuff and what wire plumber does is it lays down the session manager piece

718
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,560
of this that's going to manage how this stuff works Wes am I explaining this appropriately

719
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,560
yeah I mean I think so because I feel like I'm kind of not doing a very good job explaining

720
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,400
it wire plumber replaces the you know some of the stuff that was built into pipe wire

721
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,400
by default that was kind of a just a simple bare bones version and but you can think about

722
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,920
you know pipe wire has all these facilities but you kind of have to make actual configurations

723
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,500
of those actual sessions actual arrangements of everything and you need something that

724
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,520
can help manage that and provide tools for other things to interact with it and that's

725
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,960
basically the layer where wire plumber fits so yeah as an end user unless you get into

726
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,980
the details of pipe wire you probably won't care about this but this is one of those pieces

727
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,760
I mean like I play around with pipe wire all the time building it from source I hadn't

728
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,560
set up wire plumber I was still using the other stuff this is like the area where fedora

729
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,380
is taking these disparate pieces and really thinking about it and building something more

730
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:45,820
coherent together yeah I'm looking forward to it Neil give me an idea of what we're going

731
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,560
to get down the road in the future like wire plumber is going to enable a lot more than

732
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,440
we have today but I don't think I'm giving it justice here the biggest thing you want

733
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,100
to think about when it comes to wire plumber and pipe wire is that what pipe wire actually

734
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,580
does is quite a lot more than what people see right now so pipe wire can manage audio

735
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:07,400
sources and audio syncs we're all familiar with that part we introduced that in 34 and

736
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,000
the other part that it has that we've had for quite a light longer but we've just really

737
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,420
not talked about it is the fact that can manage video sources and video syncs so this means

738
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:22,140
for example if you do a screen share through the pipe wire portal api to redirect an application

739
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:27,360
or whatever like you know how that apex rdp window fx i for remote fx thing that windows

740
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,400
has you can do something similar with this and the cool bit is because wire plumber is

741
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,860
a session manager for pipe wire that can manage sync sources and sites you can do programmatic

742
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:42,580
redirection of those things too so you can do things like orchestrate the connecting

743
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:47,480
of various different syncs and sources for video as well as audio from various sources

744
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,200
like a camera if they're going through lib camera into pipe wire out or a screen share

745
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,580
or an application share or any of these other things like for example you were talking earlier

746
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:02,680
about remote desktop through rdp and yes it does use pipe wire underneath pipe wire and

747
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,520
wire plumber contribute to supporting the ability to do these sorts of things in the

748
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,000
future if there's interest and development around this you could also see things like

749
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,440
an implementation of something like windows's remote effects which does you can do per application

750
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,400
shares and screen sharing or replication on like remote connections to applications you

751
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,520
know like you have a more powerful server computer running gnome on it with the application

752
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,440
running there and then you could screen share the application itself back to a weaker thin

753
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,560
client those kinds of things become possible there's all kinds of interesting things that

754
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:43,000
you can do for vdi use cases for instructor cases for screen shares for video conferencing

755
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:50,960
for music production for concerts for whatever you want when it comes to av there's a pipe

756
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:57,840
wire pipeline in there i love the sound of that and we're going just a little bit at

757
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,760
a time but overall when you look at other initiatives in the past i think i'm pretty

758
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,260
happy with the with the rate of progression there is a known bug right now some people

759
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:11,040
have no sound after they upgrade we'll have a link about that in the notes essentially

760
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,280
maybe for some reason wire plumber didn't start appropriately so if you have that problem

761
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,160
after you upgrade there is a note about it it's a known problem and a note on how to

762
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,240
just quickly start it up it's not that bad i guess i lied you should know about wire

763
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:29,080
plumber yeah maybe so so i did the upgrade on that fedora 34 install on my thinkpad

764
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:33,080
and overall things went really smooth you know it really didn't work as expected were

765
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,820
a few gnome extensions a lot of them actually have updated for 41 that's nice to see but

766
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:44,180
not all of them so you know you're gonna get that if you upgrade on day one but and i'm

767
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,440
really happy to see this if you have that new gnome extensions app when you log in for

768
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,480
the first time to gnome 41 on your recently upgraded fedora session or whatever it might

769
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,080
be in the future maybe it's a bunt or debian or whatever arch um that extensions app will

770
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,040
give you a notification that says hey man some of your extensions have updates and aren't

771
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:10,240
loaded and if you click it it launches the extensions app and that extensions app gives

772
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,240
you an overview of which extensions have been disabled which ones have updates again and

773
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:19,520
then it puts a banner along the bottom of the application that says the next time you

774
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,740
log in i'm gonna update some of your extensions for you would you like to log out now and

775
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:28,200
you hit that and it logs you out you log back in they're up to date and if they're compatible

776
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,380
they're up and going my doc extension for example hasn't been updated my tray icons

777
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,560
i had tray icons reloaded that hasn't been updated yet but anything that's pretty essential

778
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,280
to the use of gnome shell for me that's been updated which is a pretty minimal set now

779
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,200
and then i have like a nice to have set so that's good i mean outside of that really

780
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,880
no issue i haven't tried rdp yet but all of my apps work i think flat pack's doing a fair

781
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,240
amount of the heavy lifting there a dream of containerized applications alive in fedora

782
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:03,560
35 yeah and i think it's i think it's a good use case for things like slack and discord

783
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,800
and element and all the other there's a few other ones that are electron base that i have

784
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,080
to have open and you know shipping them as flat packs kind of makes sense i kind of like

785
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:17,560
having them sandboxed as well and so that just all goes really smooth works pretty well

786
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:23,040
for me but i didn't have quite the same experience brent did because i think brent you tried

787
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,180
out the plasma spin right yeah we were talking about you know last week talking about which

788
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:33,400
one i should try and we kind of went back and forth you said oh you got to try the gnome

789
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,760
implementation because it's fabulous obviously you're a big fan of it i actually decided

790
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,560
to try the kde spin because i'm super familiar with kde and i have to say that i hardly spent

791
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:50,260
any time in modern gnome so i thought i don't want it to be so different of an experience

792
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:56,000
that i'm not really focusing on the usability of it or the distribution itself so i decided

793
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,640
to try the kde spin and as some context i will admit neil that i haven't used fedora

794
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:09,260
for more than like a few minutes ever so this was my chance to really dive in and and chris

795
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:15,360
has been basically talking really positively about it for a few years now so i thought

796
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:23,760
okay now's my chance so if you want to find uh what i ran which was fedora 34 five's pre-release

797
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,040
the kde spin it's actually a little confusing to find uh if you go to fedora project.org

798
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,880
it just kind of redirects you to the main releases so you have to go to spins.fedora

799
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,720
project.org i found that as a someone who wasn't that familiar with fedora to be kind

800
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:46,440
of confusing to find and i tried it on some bare metal i had a have a thinkpad x240 that

801
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,960
i guess i found in my basement that i wasn't using and so i decided to uh throw that on

802
00:47:52,960 --> 00:48:00,740
a usb and give it a go directly on an SSD i didn't know anything about fedora so i did

803
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:06,760
dive into the docs first which i think is probably a good idea um one the most uh worrisome

804
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:12,720
thing was about how to update packages i know it used rpms but i didn't quite know how to

805
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:19,280
go about doing that and i loved the documentation it was good enough like it went into enough

806
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,800
detail to get you where you wanted to go or i should say get me where i wanted to go with

807
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,440
my level of um knowledge about linux and stuff but it wasn't so exhaustive that it was hard

808
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,240
to find what i needed so kudos there for whoever's writing the documentation i really really

809
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:41,080
appreciated it i also uh here's a skill testing question for you chris and us um do you know

810
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:49,920
what dnf actually stands for oh man yes i do but now i've forgotten now that you asked

811
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,480
i feel like i could like stall and be like well you know it was uh inspired by yum which

812
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,680
was the yellow dog update manager isn't it like the dandafied package manager or something

813
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,840
like that right yeah i chuckled there and so i thought okay the door is gonna be fun

814
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,560
i really appreciate this and i know yum has a lot of history and i don't really know it

815
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:16,200
that well but i've heard a lot of good things about dnf so use the kd live disk and uh usually

816
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,680
my typical method to do this is i have my main laptop in front of me and then i have

817
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,360
some friend's laptop or family member or some laptop i'm playing with and i like to use

818
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:32,920
my main system and just do a vnc session over to that other system so i have the keyboard

819
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,440
that i'm used to and all of the programs and i can look up you know notes in my regular

820
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:44,920
applications and from the live disk uh that didn't really work for me and i was sort of

821
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:50,200
i was like okay well it presented a black screen i was like okay this is likely a wayland

822
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:56,760
thing because i knew that was an issue in the past so i can do without that so i continued

823
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,020
with the anaconda installer and i know a lot of people say it's kind of clumsy and stuff

824
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:06,280
and i thought it was fine it was actually kind of nice and it was pretty visual which

825
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:12,780
i appreciated uh i did notice there's encryption as an option disk encryption which i love

826
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,080
and i always put that on laptops because i do a lot of traveling and stuff so that was

827
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,360
a really important thing for me another thing i appreciated was that it told me my password

828
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:28,040
was awful by doing a dictionary word check which is such a small little thing but i think

829
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,320
for new users chris like you're suggesting for family and stuff that's actually really

830
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,960
nice um i was using a terrible password because i didn't care to you know it's just a testing

831
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,360
machine but um that was actually a really nice thing that i think everyone should have

832
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:47,360
so uh there was one question or a warning that i didn't understand and i'm gonna read

833
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:53,360
it to you guys and even on mumble i want you to try to figure out what it means so this

834
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:59,480
was in the encryption section so i was encrypting doing some disencryption and it said warning

835
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,880
you won't be able to switch between keyboard layouts from the default ones when you decrypt

836
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:10,960
your disk after install so what are they actually trying to communicate there okay okay you

837
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:20,560
won't be able to switch between keyboard layouts when you decrypt your disks after install

838
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,360
i think i know what this is okay what are they saying wimpy if you've used special

839
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:34,480
characters in your encryption passphrase using say a french canadian keyboard and then try

840
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,600
to decrypt that using a u.s english keyboard those special characters are not going to

841
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:45,480
align it's got to be it he's got it and i have run into this previously and i think

842
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,880
anyone who's spent enough time with decrypting disks at boot you will eventually run into

843
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,960
this but anyways i thought that was worded a little confusingly maybe visually it's a

844
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,280
bit different than than that but anyways it all worked fine and it only took about eight

845
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:07,600
minutes to install which was really uh lovely actually but that's where things started going

846
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:14,720
poorly for me on the first boot you get the background of fedora and i am a visual person

847
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,160
and i thought the background they chose which is not a technical thing but i thought it's

848
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:28,200
like this teal almost like seafoam green pool reflections photograph i believe and it just

849
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:35,140
made me feel a little queasy i think guys what was your take on that with all due respect

850
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:42,240
to the to the art team yeah because i often like what they do um literally on every single

851
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,640
install of fedora 35 i've done the very very first thing i did was change the background

852
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,720
i find it kind of jarring i know west did you have that i bet if anybody's gonna be

853
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,840
chill about it no i had to say i had the same reaction i've really liked some past ones

854
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:01,640
i was trying to give it an open mind but now that this default background is i mean i generally

855
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:06,800
don't bring it up but yeah i i agree i first impressions are important right yeah doesn't

856
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,160
speak to the rest of the release yeah yeah so then i thought okay well i'm gonna try

857
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,040
you know i've installed it i'm gonna i'm gonna try this vnc thing again because i really

858
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:24,440
want to use that um so i'm used to using the krfb which is a kde um i guess vnc server

859
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:29,080
uh has worked amazingly for me in the last several years um and i went to use the menu

860
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:34,920
launcher and it just didn't do anything and i thought oh that's odd i'll just ignore that

861
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:40,040
for now and actually now that i'm thinking about vnc maybe it's a wayland issue and i

862
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:47,040
i knew that uh so maybe i'll try x11 so i logged out and uh logged into x11 and the

863
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,560
krfb menu launcher worked fine um and then i tried to connect to vnc from my other laptop

864
00:53:52,560 --> 00:54:03,080
and uh that just crashed krfb oh so i certainly wasn't going to use my preferred vnc methods

865
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:10,760
yeah i'm sorry brad i'm so sorry yeah so i decided to unplug my main laptop you know

866
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,960
from all of my stuff and switch the two and just focus on the fedora stuff which is fine

867
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,840
so i thought okay well the next thing i like to do typically on a system is play with some

868
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:27,800
of the uh you know install some minor things like htop and i don't know sometimes you have

869
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:33,720
to install ssh server and stuff like that so i'm going to do these um basic applications

870
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:39,280
that i like having so dnf is the first time i use it fair enough uh but it's super simple

871
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,160
so i just did dnf install htop that simple because i wanted to see okay what's it going

872
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:49,740
to do how's it going to work and it started downloading a package but it wasn't very descriptive

873
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:54,400
and then it just kept going and going and i thought okay htop i know is very tiny what's

874
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:01,440
going on over here um and so the description it gave was fedora 35 x86 64 and that's it

875
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,320
and it was just downloading it downloaded 61 megs of stuff and i was quite confused

876
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:13,040
because i knew that was unlikely wow where are you seeing the 61 megabytes if you've

877
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,840
used apt or most other you know it lists a package on the left and then gives you a progress

878
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,000
bar of how much is downloaded on the right hand side it gives you the total download

879
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,480
or how much time is going to you know be left in your download fair enough i don't have

880
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,520
a great internet connection here so 61 megs actually was kind of depressing here's what

881
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,600
i'm wondering you know because when you are on fedora brent for the and you install something

882
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:40,400
using dnf for the first time if you haven't first updated the repositories it will do

883
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,520
that for you automatically because that's actually one of the things that drives me

884
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,060
crazy about apt is it will actually let you go ahead and install something even though

885
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:50,240
it's looking at all old versions of the packages because you haven't updated the repositories

886
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,880
yet so what dnf will do is it will say okay now actually i have to first refresh the repositories

887
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,280
but on a new install it might be pulling that stuff down for a long time and because you

888
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,360
know i notice it takes forever to update the repos when i'm on a bad connection too and

889
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:08,880
that and because dnf does do that so frequently it makes the overall experience feel kind

890
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:15,400
of slow you know i think that's a great insight and i can't remember and my notes aren't good

891
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:22,160
enough to tell me if i did update um sort of the indexes beforehand i typically do because

892
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,440
that's my process with apt and this seemed like a very easy translation from one to the

893
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,960
other um but i kind of wish it just described that a little bit better it was a bit cryptic

894
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,720
to me yeah yeah after it continued sort of doing a bunch of stuff it did eventually change

895
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:45,960
that to suggest fedora 34 x86 64 updates but even that was kind of cryptic and so i didn't

896
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:51,480
love it but anyways it did ask me about downloading htop so after you wait for all of the refresh

897
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:58,160
of the repos and all the dependencies to be met you get your 170 kilobyte application

898
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:04,880
yeah that's that is sometimes the dnf experience so after all of that i decided okay well i

899
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,200
know i want to try wayland because i haven't tried it that much so i'm gonna i'm gonna

900
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:14,040
log out and go back and um when i logged in back to the wayland session krfb decided to

901
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:19,640
crash again just on login so i knew that wasn't gonna be any hope i did decide to change the

902
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:26,600
desktop as you guys did but i ran it immediately into some weird issues uh i was changing the

903
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:33,400
wallpaper and the apply button never appeared so i couldn't actually make that change commit

904
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:38,560
and like that's such a small weird basic thing and it made me really worried actually about

905
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,120
all of the other things i was gonna want to try because it's like one of the simplest

906
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:47,000
things and so i had to quit the settings application come back and then it worked but it was like

907
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,160
okay well what else am i gonna run into um so i decided to do a system update because

908
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:58,400
i knew okay well i'm on i'm on a pre-release and i downloaded a few days ago maybe some

909
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,840
people have you know i knew the release was going to be today but immediately i typed

910
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,080
dnf upgrade and it gave me a little bit of information it said there's a problem with

911
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:14,420
some of your packages so i hadn't done any updates yet and already there was some conflicts

912
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:21,080
that specifically being a kwin common requires kd decorations conflict it said it was trying

913
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:28,960
it cannot install 523 and 522 at the same time and literally this was a brand new system

914
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:35,400
i hadn't done a single thing so that too worried me because what was gonna happen next i bet

915
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:40,560
you got caught right in the switch over to the newer version of plasma perhaps that's

916
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:44,920
definitely a beta thing that couldn't what can happen sometimes although it's not common

917
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,360
is some of the packages land but not all of the packages land for the next version of

918
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:54,240
plasma that could potentially be what happened there right and and now that we explore this

919
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:01,120
here i'm seeing how this likely led to all of the other issues i ran into so i updated

920
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:07,200
the whole system that way and rebooted and then things just things just did not work

921
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:14,240
like abysmally did not function properly oh no i hate to say that because i was so excited

922
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,800
about this but upon reboot i tried to log into wayland and i just got this login loop

923
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:27,360
and it never ever would log into the desktop so i was like okay i know i can try the x11

924
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,600
session so i did manage to get logged into the x11 session and i thought okay i'm gonna

925
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,200
get some work done so i plugged in my external monitor and this was the beginning of the

926
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:44,120
end the super key on my keyboard didn't even open the menu which is really frustrating

927
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:50,360
and then the taskbar was on one monitor but then the menu when i clicked on it appeared

928
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:56,680
on the other monitor and none of the window controls were available on any of the windows

929
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:02,280
which is probably that conflict that i ran into uh because it had to do with kd decorations

930
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:09,400
so that's likely the issue but then i thought okay well it's been 12 hours and it's release

931
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:14,920
day etc etc maybe i'll just bring up a terminal and try to like update again and maybe some

932
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,640
of these things will be resolved and so i you know control alt t to bring up a terminal

933
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:26,920
and i literally got only the toolbar functions i did not get a terminal i did not get window

934
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:32,320
decorations to move things around so i it was just that was the point where i said i

935
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:36,500
can't go on that i can't there's nothing i can do i can't even troubleshoot this thing

936
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:42,960
is like uh so i had to give up and that made me really really sad oh no there's a lot to

937
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,960
this and there's several i think really important lessons here and one of them is this is why

938
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:53,480
betas are not like for production use fair enough there was a warning sticker on it but

939
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,240
still oh yeah and we know that right when we're going into this we have we always have

940
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,560
that in the back of our mind we know that in fact you know like if if you were to install

941
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,280
today and had these problems i'd say okay well it's time to start you know making out

942
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:11,080
some bug reports but i think what you got caught in is a beta transition that does happen

943
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,880
but i think that's a good thing for people to know listening to this that if if if say

944
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,000
someone is basing their impressions on that they got to give it a little bit uh and this

945
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,200
goes back to what i was saying about if you caught this say six months in you you installed

946
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:29,240
fedora 35 in six months i bet you this entire experience would be smooth as butter for you

947
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,680
all that stuff's completely worked out and that's where i think it makes that that's

948
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,980
where it's really in a sweet spot it's in a special kind of place it's in a special

949
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:41,880
sweet spot for desktop linux six months into its release cycle and right now it's still

950
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,320
early i think too one of the other things you probably got bit by is there was some

951
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:51,760
and i have a vague recollection one of the blocker bugs was related to something in plasma

952
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,720
and it was one of the things they had to fix right before release and it may have may have

953
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,680
been this conflict i looked at some of the common bugs and didn't see any of those but

954
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,280
maybe that is just for the main release not the spins and i think you're right like i

955
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:10,080
liked the experience errors aside enough to give it another try after you know maybe in

956
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,360
a few months wouldn't that be an interesting thing to do is do a follow-up review with

957
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:17,560
it in a bit and try it again and see what it's like well how about we do that okay all

958
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,900
right we do that but one thing that i worried about and maybe that will change my perspective

959
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:29,560
in a few months is how distributions treat their you know this is this is an official

960
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:37,600
spin and it seemed pretty officially busted like maybe i'm one of the only people who

961
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:43,440
ran into that but i i really hope that the next test in you know a few months is very

962
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:49,640
different because i worry that the spins don't get the attention that the main release does

963
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:55,200
the plasma spin has been on a on a trajectory of becoming more and more serious for the

964
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:02,480
fedora project like now for example a a serious bug in the plasma spin is a blocker for the

965
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,880
entire fedora project right that means that they're not going to release the gnome version

966
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,200
if something's wrong in the plasma version so they are they are taking it very serious

967
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,160
now but and they might they might push back on this but i'd kind of argue that wasn't

968
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:19,600
always the mindset uh but i think what you have here is sometimes very late in the in

969
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,800
the phase they have to fix something and that was something they were working on but we'll

970
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,840
do the follow-up and we'll see how it is in a little bit and you know when at some time

971
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:31,080
one of these days i'll get you to try out my gnome setup the way i have it and see if

972
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,640
you like it yeah i could use it to her i'd appreciate that oh yeah maybe you you bake

973
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,680
him an image you just ship it over there brent flashes it on tries it chris's way could do

974
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:44,000
so mr pain you got your hands on fedora 35 would you try would you think yeah well i

975
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,800
played around with the uh you know the main gnome version a little bit but then i thought

976
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:54,960
i'd i'd go even more out there than brent i played with kina white oh yeah right there's

977
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:01,400
silver blue version that's plasma based yeah come on immutable desktops for everyone including

978
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,360
plasma and flat packs for days it's been a while you know i have played with silver blue

979
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:11,160
but it's been a while i was at 33 i don't think i tried it for 34 so it has been a little

980
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:17,140
bit but i i was pleasantly surprised now you know i love don't love anaconda but it does

981
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:21,880
work it works just fine did seem like the kina white install took a little bit longer

982
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:29,240
but other than that it felt just like a normal fedora install of course things get a little

983
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:34,920
bit more interesting when you have to do some updates or start messing with the file system

984
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:41,740
or packages or anything like that because it's immutable rpm os tree based system it's

985
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:47,880
it's really neat i i think this could be a great development workstation for me personally

986
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:54,720
as um you know someone who tinkers maybe a little too much with some of my systems there

987
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:59,320
probably be one too many roadblocks but but for like a software development workstation

988
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:03,760
admin workstation just getting work done where you don't have to do a ton of packages or

989
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:09,140
customizations or you're fine with doing most of your things in flat pack and toolbox it's

990
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:13,920
really nice i was impressed how well this just worked in the katie environment i mean

991
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:20,040
it's not perfect discovers lacking some support for really working with rpm os tree for instance

992
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,120
but the flat hub support and discover was really nice because i you know i can just

993
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:29,440
turn flip that on and i got everything i need it is uh encouraging to see that kino night

994
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,600
development because i don't know if it's necessary that silver blue and kino night be two separate

995
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:40,440
projects but i think you're you're never going to have silver blue that can support both

996
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:46,640
plasma and gnome unless kino night exists it has to kind of be the project that keeps

997
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:51,040
the plasma torch burning so that way that silver blue doesn't become just a gnome thing

998
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,660
yeah you need somewhere to organize the the effort of all the little details that need

999
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:59,920
to get changed or fixed or packaged to make it a good katie experience and the idea west

1000
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:05,960
of that i got a really rock solid workstation that has this os tree approach to very careful

1001
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:13,280
updates and that combined with something like plasma and you know butter fs potentially

1002
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:18,040
like i mean i'm really seeing some seriously awesome workstation potentials just around

1003
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:21,360
the corner in the future plus it comes with you know a bunch of the latest stuff like

1004
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:25,560
python 310 which just recently came out that's here like if you're using fedora you're up

1005
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:30,000
to date which which is you often want for development yeah all right well i'm glad you

1006
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,480
had a chance to kick the tires one question i have for you west and maybe chris you have

1007
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:39,480
some insights or someone in mumble is um why make this if they have silver blue why put

1008
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,680
some effort into something like this as well what's the what's the reasoning behind it

1009
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,360
i think it is mostly just right now silver blue has always kind of been built with a

1010
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,480
gnome first kind of perspective and so you do your software management through gnome

1011
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:56,120
software and it's kind of using that entire pipeline and there hasn't been a bit much

1012
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:01,720
focus on making sure that a system like silver blue will work with something like plasma although

1013
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:07,560
it should right but and that would be the time now to start validating that out and

1014
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:12,720
not years down the road when perhaps silver blue starts to become pushed as the predominant

1015
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,880
workstation spin maybe of fedora could happen yeah i mean these these big desktop environments

1016
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:22,080
really do have their hooks into a fair bit of how the system works and so yeah it ends

1017
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,160
up being that there are things you need to think about when you've so radically changed

1018
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:29,860
the system with these immutable variants so while we're talking about this a big thing

1019
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:33,600
that makes all of this work is a lot of your application all your applications right are

1020
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:40,820
flat packs and flat hub integration with gnome software landed for all the different versions

1021
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:44,520
of gnome that use it so including the just a standard workstation version but it's not

1022
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:50,800
like the full flat hub but it's pretty close but it's not full flat hub explain this yeah

1023
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,660
so i mean you can still of course enable flat hub as you always have you know by manually

1024
01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:03,240
doing that but but now fedora's providing a filtered list of stuff from their own repository

1025
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:07,560
that they've sort of gone through and approved and made sure that doesn't cause them problems

1026
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,560
to include it's an interesting start and it means that that some of these applications

1027
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:16,240
that you might want are already there without having to do anything that's that's really

1028
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:21,000
nice for a new user yeah and of course they do have that filter public which we'll link

1029
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,240
to in the show notes if you're curious i was like well what are they filtering out uh it's

1030
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:29,760
in there there's nothing really all that surprising in fact it mostly just seems like obvious

1031
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:33,760
organizational stuff but it's nice to see them including the flat hub because flat hub

1032
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:39,040
has really grown uh it has if you haven't been over there in a while go pop it up in

1033
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,880
your browser flat hub.org and take a look at just like the new app section or something

1034
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:48,880
like that so having that built in to gnome software is a pretty solid experience and

1035
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,520
i'm glad they did it even if they have to take out some stuff for platform reasons or

1036
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,840
legal reasons or or whatever it might be and once you noted we've got butter fs on fedora

1037
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:05,020
cloud now that's good to see yeah right marches on go go a little butter fs go and nice to

1038
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:09,960
have if you are using um fedora cloud does seem like a good sort of polished release

1039
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,920
all around there's other stuff in this this release that we talked about like um making

1040
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,940
sure that user services are restarted after upgrades which is especially important when

1041
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:21,740
you're doing all kinds of audio stuff like pulse audio or pipeline running in the system

1042
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:26,060
d user level instead of at the system level they've also started shipping the power profiles

1043
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:29,920
daemon in fedora workstation enabling it by default and it's just those little things

1044
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,200
you know those little things that the distro is thinking about for you that make fedora

1045
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:38,400
you know a little more like a mainstream desktop and a little less like an arch setup yeah

1046
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:43,720
real quick this power profiles thing's interesting and a lot of us are going to have a different

1047
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:49,320
experience because the way it's integrated with gnome settings in your power area you're

1048
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:53,480
going to see different stuff depending on what your hardware supports and it's even

1049
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,400
integrated in with your thermal sensors and whatnot so for example if your laptop's running

1050
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,840
super hot it doesn't make high performance mode available it'll even have a little grayed

1051
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,840
out text that says we gotta wait here your laptop needs to cool down something to that

1052
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,120
effect but if your hardware doesn't support this stuff you see limited reduced options

1053
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:15,240
so they're only revealing stuff that your hardware has support for but it also means

1054
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,900
that a lot of us see different things and i know this is true because i've tried it

1055
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:25,220
out now on vms and several different physical boxes they're all different the thinkpad has

1056
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:30,020
the sweetest integration like i i think wes i sent you a screenshot where it's like high

1057
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:35,920
performance mode has been disabled while the laptop is in your lap what yeah it's impressive

1058
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,680
honestly i mean this also kind of speaks to the added challenge that these you know desktop

1059
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:45,200
environments linux distros have to to work on all kinds of hardware and make an interface

1060
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:49,820
that can work in all the situations so we have the link in the show notes to go download

1061
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:54,160
plus a link to some of the common problems people are hitting right now but we'd also

1062
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:58,440
love to hear your experience what you did to make things go smoother i'd also like to

1063
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:02,440
know what didn't work so we can put the word out head over to linux unplug dot com slash

1064
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:08,340
contact and fill us in on your experience and your tips and your tricks now we are kind

1065
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,120
of running out of time so we're gonna just do the pics really quick because we got something

1066
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:18,280
super cool i think wes found it it's a nintendo switch emulator and i gave it a go oh you

1067
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:22,680
did yeah you jinx i don't know how to say it but it's an experimental switch emulator

1068
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:29,480
written in c sharp it's in the a u r as you would expect uh and so i gave it a go on the

1069
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,880
arch box and um i immediately started getting error messages that i knew not what to do

1070
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,660
with it's something about some some file missing that you have to go get but they're being

1071
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:44,240
cagey about you anyways it is legitimate though and the gooey works and it promises

1072
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:48,200
pretty good compatibility and what's cool about this project and we have it linked in

1073
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:54,960
the show notes as i said um it is emulating the hardware really like accurately of the

1074
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,320
switch so game compatibility is good it's like pretending to be the right arm cpu and

1075
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:04,840
the right gpu and it's getting a lot of that right so even things like the newest metroid

1076
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:10,040
game that just came out appear to be working in it i kind of got to give it a go it recommends

1077
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,680
you have a system with at least like 8 or 16 gigs of ram which probably most of us do

1078
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:17,640
and you know some cpu yeah this is really neat and it looks like they've got a pretty

1079
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:22,520
nice website set up as well as a blog and i always find that the work that goes on behind

1080
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,840
the scenes to make this kind of stuff possible just fascinating it's worth worth worth a

1081
