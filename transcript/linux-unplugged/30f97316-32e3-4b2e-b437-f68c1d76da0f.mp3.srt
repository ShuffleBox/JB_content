1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
You guys have you guys noticed that if you watch

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,160
The show in VLC or MP at do with a watching MPV actually don't watch it in VLC

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,340
Have you noticed that if you watch the show in MPV like the RTSP stream like?

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,880
It's like a two second delay versus the flash player

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,120
Which is like a seven second delay

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,120
So if you want to interact with me in the chat room and you want me to be able to read you like you want to

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,040
Be able to respond a lot really fast and stuff

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,980
Maybe this is how JB Hawk a truth gets all the best titles if you watch the RTSP stream like an MPV

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,980
You just have to have a good connection

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,360
Yeah, I'm a con. I think it's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,160
Yeah

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,480
Yeah, yeah, I've been so burned by my s6 this last couple of weeks oh

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,460
Man don't give me you're good trying to get you are trying to get me into a rant

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,800
I am a con that's what you were trying to do you are trying to get me into a rant look at him oh

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Oh

16
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,500
Man go ahead go ahead API. I want to hear that or aka Andy

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,860
Okay, thanks, so does we'll see support the RTSP protocol. I am using RTMP for the moment

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
VLC is great. Yeah, VLC is good, too

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
MPV is just a little better and

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,280
And you are right about the delay, I think it does have a little

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
But I haven't measured it I

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,520
MPV one of the things I liked about MPV is I was watching the stream once and I had it in guake

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,440
I had I just did MPV on the command line MPV, and I pasted in the URL of the stream

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,000
And I watched MPV as is like this is the codec

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,380
This is and you know you just see all the cool nerdy output on the on the command line

26
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,380
and I

27
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
noticed it started saying something and

28
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,240
Then I when it when I read what it said I from that moment forward

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,520
I knew I would never use another desktop application to do live streaming and

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
it said

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,320
lip-sync mismatch detected

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,620
Automatically correcting and it automatically delayed either. I can't remember who's the audio or the video just enough. How did it detect that I?

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Don't know I don't know

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,640
But it fixed it for me automatically right there on the fly, and I thought to myself

35
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,880
Brilliant people wrote this this software was written by brilliant people and your MPV is it's got a lot of legacy to it

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,240
And it so it's got a good hit, and I thought this is the application

37
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,640
I have noticed now as somebody who watches a lot of live streams

38
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,560
I'm a cord cut. I don't have cable television, so I consume a ton of content

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,200
Over live streams, and I have I have squirreled out some of the bet like I have found the RTSP streams at some of the

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,400
Internal networks used to send content around to each other like I probably I can't really say this

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,040
But I had a recent live coverage of a big tech event that I put out for our patrons

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,680
And I got the master feed that they were sending out to all of their endpoint stores

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,960
And I've got this whole stash of RTSP feeds that I use to watch shows and and and get content and get news and I

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,600
Tell you what VLC is very very good VLC is amazing for like capturing and recording and doing streaming converting and VLC is like one

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,440
Of my favorite applications on the Linux desktop, but if I'm just watching a live stream

46
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Nothing beats MPV

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:38,440
This is Linux Unplugged episode 96 for June 16th 2015

48
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's mocking the Concrud

49
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,480
From afar my name is Chris and 96 is gonna be a packed episode for you guys

50
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,480
I am super excited I

51
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,320
Love this about the Linux Unplugged program our connection to the community and and really how crucial is that to open source?

52
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,520
That's what we're talking about today in episode 96. We're gonna get an update from the open tech conference

53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,040
that was across the pond this weekend and then I

54
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,420
Scoured through all of the live footage from self this weekend, and I found an amazing chat

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,520
That our Noah had with a contributor to open source comm mr. Semiotic robotic

56
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,840
You may have heard of him before they had a great chat on the live stream

57
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,080
It was like a 45-minute chat. I paired it down to the best of it. We're gonna play that then

58
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,000
We're gonna meet one of the authors of the

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,420
Really the man who wrote the book on slackware mr. Alan Hicks will be on the show today to talk about his impressions of

60
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,680
Southeast Linux fest and the kind of fest it is and why that's so critical to how open source software is made and how he'd

61
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,620
Take the lessons learned from these fest and applies them to his job as a system administrator, but first before all of that

62
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,620
before

63
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,900
All of that we're gonna get to some feedback and some updates that have occurred somehow

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:59,640
Between Sunday's show the Linux action show and Tuesday's episode of Linux unplug if you can believe it or not somehow news is actually

65
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,980
transpired between now and then and

66
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:09,620
Unfortunately, it's actually huge news that probably impacts a large large majority of the Jupiter broadcasting audience

67
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,540
So before we dig into this first story, let's bring them over so that way we can all commiserate together time appropriate greetings

68
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,540
my virtual hug

69
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,700
Okay, so I'm just I

70
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,780
Apologize if you happen to be one of those listeners who happens to catch a lot of the Jupiter Jupiter broadcasting shows

71
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,060
I hope you don't get burned out on this topic

72
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,300
But I feel like it's a public service announcement that we cover this on all of the shows and I know it impacts a lot

73
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,980
Of us right here on this show

74
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:44,380
This week last pass announced that their services were compromised your individual passwords were not compromised

75
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,180
But potentially the salted database has been you know

76
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,960
Encrypted like a hundred thousand times over has been stolen of your master password

77
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,420
Email reminders about when your passwords expire

78
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,260
Which kind of is sort of an important bit of information for an attacker to use and other bits of information

79
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,220
Have been revealed and last pass is advising that everyone change their master password

80
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,860
And if you do not have two-factor authentication, if you do not have two-factor authentication turn that s on

81
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,860
And now I

82
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:21,020
Have been a pretty big proponent of last pass and I I fully acknowledge that our open-source alternatives to last pass. I maintain

83
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,380
That the convenience of last pass if you I should back up

84
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,700
Security is always a compromise between convenience and practicality and and unfortunately

85
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,940
Having a password for every different service

86
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:42,100
Having a password for every different service I use is a very hard thing to actually pull off in practicality when I have a studio

87
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,620
And a house and I move around a lot and I have multiple offices and I have different computers

88
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,340
And I don't keep everything synced having a cloud-based service

89
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,780
While inherently risky

90
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,740
has an inherent value to it and

91
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:04,280
To me last pass sort of walks that sweet spot where I have local encryption. It's available on my Android device

92
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,340
It's available on an iOS device. It's available in my browser. It's available on the web

93
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,300
So I have advocated for last pass a lot and I've even done specials on last pass

94
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,320
And I wonder now and I want to bring this so I want to I want to turn this over to the mumble room

95
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,580
When you hear about something like this, do you think all right? This is it. This is another proprietary service

96
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,580
I can never use I can only use an open-source solution

97
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,460
I'll start I'll start with Popey because I I know Popey's here. I just talked to him Popey

98
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,140
Does this to you? Is this is last pass dead to you?

99
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,500
Are you gonna switch to key paths forever or does this reinforce your belief? Oh

100
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,420
So the frustration for me is the reason I switched to last pass was when Gorka was hacked four years ago

101
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,940
And I and I realized that I reuse the same password in a bunch of places. You know, that's my story too, right?

102
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,940
You know, that's my story

103
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,580
Exactly it. Yeah, so I switched the last pass and I thought yeah

104
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,980
this is the least worst option for me that enables me to have the convenience of having my password filled in when I need to and

105
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,980
my

106
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,100
feeling of security that the

107
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:16,020
Security file the password file is in unencrypted on my local machine and it re-encrypted on my local machine with my master password

108
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,500
Which is really long and I never use anywhere else. It's like I learned my lesson. I'm using that one password. So

109
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,640
Part of me thinks, you know

110
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,340
This is a problem and I should jump ship and go and use something open-source and only store on my own computer

111
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,380
But then who am I kidding?

112
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:36,420
I'm already using like Gmail and Facebook and Twitter and I'm already using other people's computers. This is just yet another thing and

113
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,780
I checked with our

114
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,700
internal is people and because we

115
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:48,260
We canonical use it as well. So, you know, I actually have two accounts. I have my personal account

116
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,780
I work out there and I check with them and their opinion was not that you know, everyone should you know

117
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,620
Nuke the world and go some good do something else. So I trust them. So I stick with it

118
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,260
I set up two-factor authentication there. Yes, right and and and can I add something to that and and this is of course

119
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
hindsight, right etc, etc

120
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
but I would say

121
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,580
This is here's the lesson. I have learned going forward from this last pass breach. I

122
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:22,940
Will no longer wait for a notification on a blog from the company telling me I should change my password

123
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm going to set a reminder in my calendar to just change my master password from time to time

124
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,420
And I recommend to you do not wait

125
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,540
Do not wait for them to get hacked

126
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:41,220
Turn on two-factor authentication now change your master password every three months. Why not? I mean really is it that actually?

127
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,820
When I when I went to the dialogue to change my master password, it said your master password was last changed

128
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,220
1502 days ago

129
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,820
I'm not gonna lie

130
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:59,060
Bopey I won't lie. I actually have a little sentimental attachment to my master password because it is a paragraph

131
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:05,300
I came up with a long time ago like before I really truly understood computer security

132
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,600
I thought to myself well geez a paragraph seems like a much better idea than a six center six six

133
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
character six character password

134
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,240
And I can remember a paragraph and so I wrote a little paragraph in my mind that I have been able to recite for

135
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
the last 15 years and

136
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,780
I I have zero zero zero worries that anybody will ever guess what it is because there's a completely nonsensical paragraph

137
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:34,320
It doesn't make any sense and I came up with it, and I love it, and I'm I'm going to go change it

138
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Um I know that sounds weird, but I'm attached to it. Yeah

139
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,120
Full stop on the end. You really only have to change it by one character

140
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,520
So you can add buffers to the beginning and end and there you go one two three

141
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
So of course

142
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
You know keeping our audience in mind

143
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,640
This sort of provokes thoughts of switching the key pass, and I found a thread on hacker news

144
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,840
Oh, did I oh did I grab it let me see oh?

145
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,720
I might not have actually grabbed it for the show notes

146
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,740
As you would expect though the focus has changed now to key pass well now that last pass is no good

147
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,420
And then let's be clear. Let's be totally 100% legit honest

148
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,900
Last pass is a big old target it has

149
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,320
It is really at the target of all targets. It's everybody's password

150
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,480
That's I mean even if you could never crack it like

151
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,000
just the idea of that makes it a target and and by by by

152
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,760
Participating in the last pass service you are participating in what is got to be one of the largest targets on the internet

153
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,280
So you have to have some faith in encryption and the general technology there and and so I don't think it's unreasonable to say

154
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,080
I'm not doing that

155
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,600
That the concept of just how big of a target they are is too much risk for me to assume

156
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,520
I'm not doing that and if and I'm gonna go with key pass, and I don't think that's unreasonable

157
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,600
But I think it is unreasonable to say

158
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,720
Key pass is flawless now. We all respect key pass. We all are thankful

159
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,200
They're making an offline solution. They're making something that actually has a very awesome Firefox

160
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,680
Plugin they're making something that has awesome Android apps they really are making one of the best open source apps in the world

161
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,040
But like all open source applications that can't be flawless because they're created by humans

162
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,240
And there could be a flaw in key pass as well

163
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,640
And so the there is a lesson to be learned globally here for all of us

164
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,320
And I I do not think it is Linux specific

165
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,820
But I think it is super important when so many of our credentials so many things online

166
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,520
I

167
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,600
I can get so easily on a soapbox about this

168
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,260
But whatever the case may be just I would recommend everybody change these master passwords often

169
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:53,020
Try to keep this try to try to make this the thing that you are actually diligent about

170
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,340
Because going forward these things have a way of getting away from you

171
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,020
So try to make this the thing if you maybe you're lax on backups

172
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,980
Maybe you're lax up on commenting your config file

173
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,780
I don't know what it is, but but of all of the things I plead with you make this the thing that you are diligent about

174
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:16,780
Because it good password hygiene can is just it's just a little bit of work up front to prevent so much chaos later on

175
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:22,180
And I'm gonna end with this hashtag watch text now boom. That's all I have to say

176
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,500
I'm an end of topic mumble room anybody have anything. I want to throw them before I finish

177
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Yeah, I would like to defend

178
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Last pass in this incident because they actually did act

179
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Responsible and they did act in a timely manner to let their their users know that their data could be compromised

180
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,500
And they give them the tools to lock it down and secure it

181
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Yeah, I mean and the value of this is negative. Here's the thing how many lessons do we need to learn?

182
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
How many times do we need to be taught?

183
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
That we should be that we should have used the open source

184
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Publicly audits audited solution. I do not want to stand here and say put trust trust last pass trust everything with a proprietary solution

185
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Because I mean time after time after time. It feels like

186
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,500
We sit here and we can mock what RMS says but then like three or four or five or six or seven or twenty years

187
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Later turns out dude was right dude was right

188
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,500
The problem is only the really tech savvy people are the ones who are

189
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,500
going to be the ones that are diligent enough to do this right where everybody else is

190
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,500
You know not and yeah, like I'm gonna come was pointing out something earlier this morning

191
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Open-source is great and all and it could be audited

192
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
We don't know the last type

193
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Stuff has been audited or bugs have been found and you know, there are people that don't report bugs

194
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
So, you know

195
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:56,500
It's still something that boils down to the most responsible tech savvy people are gonna be the ones that are gonna be ahead of this

196
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,500
There is currently a bug floating around the hacker news a kind of a flaw in the dotnet version of key pass and

197
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
It could potentially expose users

198
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
now

199
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
This audience that doesn't affect you you're using the Linux version

200
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,500
But don't put key pass on some sort of pedestal like the chat room is doing right now

201
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,500
There is today a flaw in key pass and like WW NSX just said in the chat room

202
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,500
There are people that are motivated to exploit these things and I I completely agree

203
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Like I see here and I think just remember it really comes down to your personal responsibility

204
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,500
It is it falls on you. Don't put don't put your faith in an open source project

205
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Don't put your faith in a proprietary project. That's kind of what you're saying, right WW

206
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Yeah, you know you're you're ultimately going to be responsible for your own security. Yes exactly

207
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Yes, Sunsell do you want to expand on that?

208
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Oh

209
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,500
I mean just basically what the video was saying that it really is the user responsible of one's ability about their passwords

210
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,500
You know keeping care of what they do with their passwords and how they manage them because no matter what solution you use

211
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Open-source or proprietary now no matter what or less that you use to manage this stuff. It's still on you

212
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,500
It could be the greatest solution ever and you're not managing your stuff very well. Yeah. Yeah

213
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Yeah, yeah, I agree and Sean PC says that it's made by humans

214
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Right and thus it likely will have flaws wizard. Do you want to add in something here?

215
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Yeah, I just the the one thing that I can you know, I don't want to sound like that

216
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,500
You know part of the mob saying oh, yes, which keep ass but no go ahead there is

217
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Yeah, but there is there is kind of the it is a lot easier to protect key pass than last pass itself

218
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Because at the end of the day, it's like we follow the things we've been falling for

219
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,500
You know as long as we have, you know, you know sandbox applications and you know, make sure you have your firewall

220
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Then you know on because it does use localhost to go and communicate

221
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,500
If you had cover the basics, you should be okay with key pass

222
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,500
It's when you start going outside that it's when you start and you start just kind of giving up on security everywhere

223
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,500
That's when you screw up. Well and wizard I will say to this

224
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Couldn't you make the same argument for Dropbox versus think thing

225
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Think thing is peer-to-peer. It's machine to machine. You don't have to worry about them indexing your files

226
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Submitting the list of your files to the RIAA for DMCA takedown, right? It is machine to machine

227
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:29,500
There is an inherent advantage to just using key pass in that you are one person

228
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:36,500
And you have realistically you are not very interesting to the global hacker community

229
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Whereas last pass is a global target

230
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Now all that said, I am not responsible enough. I am not judicious enough

231
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I should rephrase this

232
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I care more about my children than I care about good password hygiene

233
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,500
I care more about my children than I care about updating the patches on my home server

234
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,500
I would rather have sex with my wife than manage my passwords

235
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,500
I would rather have a really good rib dinner

236
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,500
I would rather barbecue something that is delicious than manage my passwords

237
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:19,500
That's my personal choice. I recognize that is not necessarily your choice, the listener

238
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,500
But because that is my list of priorities, because those things become before password hygiene

239
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,500
If I am being completely honest with my audience, those things are more important to me than password hygiene

240
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,500
So for me, last pass is a really great solution because it manages to straddle that sweet spot

241
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Between automation and holding my hand, but yet local encryption, transparency

242
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,500
And empowering me to make the decisions I need to choose if I continue to use the service

243
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,500
And because they check those boxes, I continue to use the service

244
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,500
Because I have to fundamentally believe that it is more important and it is better that I use last pass

245
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,500
With two factor authentication and a great master password

246
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Than it is to potentially botch some local password management solution

247
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,500
So that's where I live. And Rekai comes in, not to mention he says

248
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Why is it safer for me as an unexperienced person, good point

249
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,500
To maintain my own security and hope I do well and trust the people to do this for a full time job

250
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,500
So he is saying, this isn't my job, this is not what I do for a living

251
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,500
But this is what last pass does for a living

252
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Even if they are a target, they know what they are doing while I don't

253
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
And Rekai is a very smart person

254
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Like if Rekai wanted to put his mind to it, he could create the most ultimate password storage solution

255
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,500
But that is not what he would want, that is not what he chooses to dedicate his time to

256
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,500
And I cannot judge him for that, so he continues to use last pass, as I will

257
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Just as I will not judge you for using key pass or a text file on some Lux encrypted volume

258
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Have at it. I say it works for you? Good for it

259
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,500
I wanted to cover something really quick before we move into a couple of more things

260
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
This is the week that we cannot move forward without mentioning

261
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Guard your wallets, it's the Steam sales

262
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
I have spent some money this week but not actually that much

263
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,500
And Linux underscore gaming on Reddit has had a daily update on some of the best sales

264
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
There is a lot of different dynamics to this, so if you are following Tech Talk today you are already hip to all this stuff

265
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,500
But if you have been kind of on the fence about trying out gaming under Linux

266
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Maybe you don't have a great video set up, maybe you are not using the proprietary driver

267
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
And you are not sure how well games would work with the free driver

268
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:51,500
This is a great time to create a Steam account and show Valve that they are not wasting their money

269
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Go in there, go get some of these games for ridiculous discounts

270
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Go show these developers that there are Linux users out there

271
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:03,500
If you have kind of been motivated to show support for the Linux desktop that are not a big gamer

272
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
This is a great time to do that

273
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,500
I'm just putting that out there, I'm going to have a link in the show notes, it's the roundup of the best sales

274
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
When the sales are happening, it's a thread on Linux gaming

275
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Right now this one is created by Spinner Will

276
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I'm sure Linux Gamecast will have better coverage on this than I can

277
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
But they have when the deals end, how much the discount is

278
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,500
They have it in USD, Euros, Canadian funny money, Australian monies and all the other monies too

279
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,500
And I'm mentioning this because if I don't mention it I'll get a hard time

280
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500
And also, I know some of you are like me

281
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Where sometimes you might buy a product just to show the vendor you appreciate them supporting Linux

282
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,500
And maybe later on you'll enjoy it

283
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
This is what the Steam sale is all about

284
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:54,500
I also, like Waltiff in the chat room, he says I've been waiting for some of these games

285
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I bought the ones that are 50% off

286
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,500
I've had a whole bunch in my wishlist for a long time and now I'm going through and collecting them

287
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,500
So I might give away some games on the live stream for this Sunday's Linux Action Show

288
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Tune in live on Sunday and I might give away a few games

289
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Because I've been buying a few on sale that I've wanted for a while

290
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
And I might not even play them

291
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,500
But one was like a four pack of a game that was normally $40

292
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,500
And I got a four pack for $6.99

293
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
What's up? What you got?

294
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
So check it out, we have a link to that in the show notes

295
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
But that's all I have to say on that

296
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
That concludes

297
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,500
That concludes the Valve update

298
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Right there

299
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Now I wanted to mention something real nice for Mr. Dominic

300
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Coda Radio is...

301
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
Man, what did we just talk about this week?

302
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Oh, snaps

303
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
In fact, I'll save what we talked about

304
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
But it relates to something we're going to cover a little bit in this show

305
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Coda Radio has been going on for a while now

306
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
And Michael Dominic, he's an independent software developer

307
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,500
And he originally launched with a focus on Mac OS and iOS

308
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Pretty understandable, really

309
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
For somebody who wants to make money

310
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,500
And he has sort of gone through a transition

311
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,500
To pivot and focus on open source and Linux

312
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
And he's launched a new company around that

313
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
And I just wanted to kind of support that initiative

314
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Because he's one of our friends

315
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
He's the co-host of Coda Radio

316
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
And so if you're out there and you need somebody who focuses on things like

317
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Docker, or AngularJS, or Ruby on Rails, or PHP, or Android development

318
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
And he can still do iOS development, obviously, as well

319
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Or HTML5 stuff

320
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Native mobile development

321
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Buccaneer Tech is his new company

322
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
And for JB listeners

323
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,500
I think if you go over there, he's going to give you a free consultation on your project or your business needs

324
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
So if you've got like a small business that maybe needs an app

325
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Or a website

326
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,500
And you'd like to give it to somebody who's trying to support Linux and open source

327
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
And one of the Jupyter broadcasting communities

328
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
You can email him and mention in there

329
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Like say, offer code Sparrow or put that in the subject line

330
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Put Sparrow in the subject line, something like that

331
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
And he's going to give you like a free consultation

332
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
And I just wanted to mention this

333
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
This Buccaneer Tech is his new company

334
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
And I really wanted to support one of our co-hosts going out and saying

335
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
You know what?

336
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
I know the big industry trend is iOS and Android

337
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
And it's all Apple development right now

338
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,500
And Windows 10 apps or whatever the hell they're going to do

339
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
I mean, yeah

340
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
I can totally understand why that would be the trend

341
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
But instead he's saying

342
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
You know what I'm going to do is I'm going to try to carve out a niche

343
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Right here in Linux and open source

344
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
I'm going to try to do this

345
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
And so BuccaneerTech.com

346
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,500
Go check that out

347
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
And use the promo code Sparrow if you want to email him

348
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Just, I don't know

349
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Go over there and do sales at BuccaneerTech.com

350
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
And send him an email and say

351
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Hey, we want to talk to you guys

352
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
I just want to give him a mention because

353
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
You know, he's a friend of our show

354
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,500
And we just got back from Self

355
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,500
And there's so many independent developers out there right now

356
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,500
That are doing the small businesses marketing

357
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,500
And just one of the things I talked about in Coda Radio

358
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
That I was hinting at is

359
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
I recently attended some small business meetings

360
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,500
One in our local town where the studio is

361
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
It's Arlington

362
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,500
And another town that's about 15-20 minutes north of me

363
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
Burlington

364
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
And I went to both these towns

365
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500
And I attended some local business referral meetings

366
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
Business groups

367
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
Where you can go to see if you want to become a member

368
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
If you're a small business owner

369
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,500
And you want to become a member of the small business community

370
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
That's not why I went

371
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,500
I specifically went with the intention of trying to get show content out of it

372
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
And I wanted to get a feel for like

373
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
What kind of proprietary solutions are they using?

374
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,500
Who's developing their websites and their applications?

375
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
And I just wanted to get a feel for like super local businesses

376
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,500
How are they getting technology solutions?

377
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,500
And for the most part

378
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,500
You know, a lot of it was Linux based

379
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
Wordpress based

380
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
And things like that

381
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,500
And I was pretty stoked by that

382
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,500
However

383
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500
The second meeting I went to

384
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,500
They had a guy from Microsoft show up

385
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,500
And he did a presentation on why Windows 10 is going to be great for their business

386
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
I couldn't even

387
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
I had to laugh

388
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Like the guy shows up and we're at a restaurant

389
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,500
So they're having this business meeting at a restaurant

390
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,500
And because this is something they do on a weekly basis

391
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
There's like six things you can order

392
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
So I get like this

393
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Pecan crusted chicken salad

394
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
And I've ordered this pecan crusted chicken salad

395
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
And I see on the agenda

396
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Windows 10 for your business

397
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Okay, I'm already like

398
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
I'm thinking to myself

399
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Chris, you have a couple of options here

400
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,500
You can just sit here and listen to what this guy has to say

401
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Or you can stand up

402
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
And go into show mode

403
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
And give a Linux pitch

404
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
And I didn't know which way I was going to go

405
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Like literally I sat there and I thought

406
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
I kind of got a little nervous

407
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Like I didn't have much of an appetite

408
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
I kind of ate like the pecan crusted off my chicken

409
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
But I'm like I cannot sit here

410
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
And listen to this guy tell these people

411
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
How Windows 10 is going to help their business when it's not even released yet

412
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Like at a moral

413
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
At my moral core

414
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
I cannot sit here and listen to this man

415
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Tell these people how this proprietary product

416
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Which is not even on the market yet

417
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
Is going to help them

418
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
And I sat there and I ate my pecan crusted chicken

419
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
I just ate the edging of it

420
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
And the guy didn't show up

421
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
He no-showed

422
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
He totally no-showed

423
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
And I thought to myself wow, well I was right

424
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
So I sat up and I did a little 30 second commercial

425
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
When he didn't show up

426
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
And I gave the pitch

427
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
For podcasts in general

428
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
And I advised them to go find a podcast

429
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
About your passion

430
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
And I said if you're a small business

431
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
And there's about 15 people here

432
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
That are all like the owners or CEOs

433
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Or whatever and I said if you have a problem

434
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
Today, if you have a need today

435
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
There's probably already

436
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
A solution out there that somebody else has created

437
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
For you and I just, I ask you, just do

438
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
This one, I only had 30 seconds, I only had

439
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
30 seconds you guys, I said do this

440
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Google it

441
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Google the solution

442
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Before you pay for something there may be a free

443
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
And open source package that can do it for you

444
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
And that's all I could say

445
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
And that's all I could get in

446
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
And that was one of the two meetings I went to

447
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
And the second meeting

448
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
I was like I was all fired up and now I don't know if I'm going to go to another one

449
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
I'm not sure yet, but Kits and Kitty you wanted to jump in here

450
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Go ahead

451
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Microsoft has always

452
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Promised the next

453
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Product will be good

454
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Anybody remember Object FS?

455
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Right, yes this is the thing

456
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
I started to feel like a bit of an anxiety

457
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Attack because I'm like this guy cannot

458
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Come up here and promise these people the world

459
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Again and again and again like somebody has

460
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
To say something

461
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
That was like

462
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
That was a serious intense

463
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
Situation and I wanted to enjoy my salad

464
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
But you know

465
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
It worked out, it worked out and I got

466
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
A good plug in for open source and Linux and for

467
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Podcasts in general, so hopefully

468
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
I think I might well I might

469
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I'm finding good insights when I attend these business

470
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
So this is the second one I have attended now

471
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
And at first I was like I'm not going to do

472
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
This crap, I'm not going to waste my time doing this crap

473
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
This is stupid, I have better things to do

474
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
But then listening to

475
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Them talk about some of their problems and listening to some of the

476
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
Things they wanted, how technology can fit in

477
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Like a lot of these

478
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Meetings have been based about the technology solutions

479
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
They're going to use to solve their problems

480
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
So I may attend another one just to kind of get

481
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Some more insights there

482
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Alright well I want to talk to Popey about

483
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
The conference that he attended this week, well

484
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Actually before I

485
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Before I get too far into that, this is really

486
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
This is the part where we're going to transition to some great stuff

487
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
For the show, and I want to thank

488
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
First of all, I want to start, let's start with the community

489
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Let's start with Linux Academy

490
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
They're from the community, they've created something for the community

491
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
They're truly Linux enthusiasts

492
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
And this is, you know, if you go back

493
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
You look at what, Linux Action Show, it's been around

494
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Now for nine years, which is ridiculous

495
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,500
But it's been around now for nine years

496
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
But if you go back seven, eight

497
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Years ago

498
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
It's rough

499
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
It's not so good

500
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
But the passion and the enthusiasm

501
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
What we wanted to accomplish

502
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
What we cared about, the enthusiasm

503
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
About that, right, like how

504
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
How much we wanted to share with you

505
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
That was the spark

506
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
And now looking back at Linux Academy I think

507
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Boy, maybe I should have gone this route

508
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
See they had that same spark, they had that same passion

509
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
But they went a different route

510
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
They took the people

511
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
That were truly passionate about

512
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Open source, Linux

513
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
All of the technology around that

514
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
They met up

515
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
With developers

516
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
And educators

517
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
And they were able to create something

518
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Really unique, just for the Linux

519
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Audience

520
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
There's other educational sites out there

521
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,500
That'll teach you everything, I mean really

522
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
They promise everything

523
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
From how to build a rocket

524
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
To how to

525
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
How to edit something in Adobe After Effects

526
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
I mean they really, they promise everything

527
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Not Linux Academy

528
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
They don't promise

529
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
They promise everything

530
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
They promise

531
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
To focus on Linux and the best technologies

532
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Around Linux

533
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
They promise to focus on the things

534
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
That'll make you more employable

535
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
To make you better at your job

536
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
To scratch your educational itch

537
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
To challenge your mind

538
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
That's what they focus on, that's Linux Academy

539
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
They have self paced courses

540
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
You can go in there and see how much time is available

541
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
How long it's going to take, and you can tell

542
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Linux Academy, I've got this much time available

543
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
On a Monday, I've got this much time available

544
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
On a Wednesday, you want to base your

545
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Educational courses around when we're not live

546
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
You can do that

547
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
Linux Academy has self

548
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Setting educational plans, they'll fill

549
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
In the gaps with reminders and all of that

550
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
They have scenario based labs so that way you

551
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Work with this technology in the real

552
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
World, you get a sense of how to configure

553
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
These things, so when you go out there and do it in production

554
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
It's not the first time you've done that

555
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
And that little bit of confidence

556
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Makes

557
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
All of the difference

558
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
As somebody who's been in the industry for a long

559
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
Time

560
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
When you walk into a place with confidence

561
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
When you sit down at a job with confidence

562
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
Everybody around you

563
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Is reassured, everybody around

564
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
You feels a little bit more comfortable

565
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Because you're confident

566
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
That's what scenario based labs do

567
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
I want you to go to Linux Academy

568
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500

That's not a number that was just picked arbitrarily

573
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Linuxacademy.com

574
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Slash unplug, they have instructor help

575
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Available and I know you're busy

00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
I appreciate you just

577
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Listening to this podcast

578
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
So I want

579
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
You to use your time wisely

580
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
And Linux Academy does too

581
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
That's why they've rolled out nuggets

582
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
It's a cute name for an awesome

583
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
Feature, a nugget is

584
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
A single how to that walks you through a specific

585
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Task

586
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
That make you better at that specific task

587
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
It doesn't necessarily belong in a big course

588
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Or some big hourly multi

589
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Hour courseware, it's a lesson

590
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Between 2 and 60 minutes

591
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
That teaches one specific thing

592
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
And you can actually, look at this

593
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500

Bash script backup, right there, you need to backup

597
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
An AWS machine, I don't have any

598
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
Freaking idea how I would do that

599
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
I tell you what, if I was

600
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Put in the position of being responsible for an

601
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
AWS instance, and I

602
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Didn't know how to back it up

603
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
That might give me some anxiety

604
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
That might make me

605
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
A little stressed out

606
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

Creating a pixi boot server, what

612
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
The hell is active directory

613
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
How do I have single sign on with linux boxes

614
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500

Resource like this when I was in the business, linuxacademy.com

621
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
Slash unplugged, and a big thank you

622
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
To linuxacademy for sponsoring

The unplugged program, you guys

624
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Keep it up, and keep building that platform out even

625
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
More and more, alright so

Mumble room dropping us out, what's going on over there guys

628
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
We've had Comcast issues all day

629
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Seems good to me

630
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Alright, good

00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
For a second there during your pitch

632
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
It just dropped you

633
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
And the lips

634
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Weren't red, they were just gray

635
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Well good, well then just go to linuxacademy.com

636

Slash unplugged and you got it all, alright

637
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
So Mr. Popey is here today

638
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
And he, hello

639
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Hello Popey, hello, boy

640
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
And Corky, I know Corky

641
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Couldn't join us today, but he was here earlier this morning

642
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
On linux, or I'm sorry, tech talk today

643
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
And he talked a little bit about OpenTech

644
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
2015, but Popey

645
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
I couldn't attend it, I wish I could've

646
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Attended it, and it sounds like it was a pretty

647
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Fun event, it's been going on for a while

648
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Could you recap with the folks that are listening

649
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
What OpenTech 2015 was, and

650
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Anything you want to add in there? Sure

651
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
So it's an event that happens

652
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Regularly, irregularly

653
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
It's happened six, seven times over the last

654
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Ten years, and

655
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
It's a low cost

656
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
Tech event, which

657
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Focuses on what you might

658
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Call OpenTech

659
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Which covers quite a lot of ground

660
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Actually, there was quite a lot of

661
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Different talks that covered

662
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Vaguely related

663
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Topics, but there were also some a little bit

664
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
Out there ones as well, I tried

665
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
To push myself to go to

666
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Talks that were outside

667
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
My comfort zone, so rather than go to a talk

668
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
About Edward Snowden or

669
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Something that I kind of know about, I might

670
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Go to something else a little bit more weird

671
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
And there were three tracks

672
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
So three separate rooms

673
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
And they were full all day with

674
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Various talks, and

675
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,500
Yeah, it was good fun, and it was

676
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Nice to see some familiar faces there from the

677
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Tech crowd

678
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
In the UK, I've

679
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Made some notes about a few of the more interesting

680
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
Talks, if you want me to go for a few of them

681
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Yeah, I do, I guess I'll start with

682
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Kind of a basic question, so it doesn't necessarily sound

683
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Like it's a Linux

684
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Event per se, but more of a

685
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
Technology event

686
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
Anything that's open in technology

687
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Is that right? Right

688
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
So people were talking about

689
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Getting access to

690
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Your medical data

691
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
For example, or preventing

692
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Someone else having access to your medical data

693
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Or they were talking about security topics

694
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
Or privacy topics

695
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
Those kind of things that are

696
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
Open data, getting access to data

697
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,500
From the government, and using data that's been

698
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Provided by the government, so those kind of

699
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Topics, it wasn't so much open source

700
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
In fact, it was encouraged

701
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
For you not to have your laptop out at all

702
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
And I didn't see many

703
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Laptops there at all, because

704
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
You know, at some of the conferences, if you

705
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Go into a room where a talk is being given, you can see

706
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
A bunch of people sat around with their heads

707
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
Down on their laptops tweeting about what's going

708
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
On, or you know, chatting with friends

709
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
Not actually paying attention to what's going on

710
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
And here it was very different, people were very

711
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
Engaged and discussing topics

712
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
With the presenter, and

713
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Not focused on whatever's going on

714
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
On their laptop. Interesting, very interesting

715
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Now, I

716
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Hope I gotta

717
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Ask you, just sort of, if you could just

718
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
Remove all filters

719
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Pretend like you're recording a podcast

720
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
For the UK audience

721
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Is there a

722
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Is there a sort of

723
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Sense of

724
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
I'm trying to frame this correctly

725
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
What is the feeling of

726
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Is there a feeling that the American government is overreaching

727
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Is there a feeling that let's talk about how to protect

728
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Ourselves from the NSA at a conference

729
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Like this?

730
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Well, that kind of topic

731
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Kind of did come up in specific talks

732
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
But it wasn't the main focus

733
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
Of conversation, there were

734
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
Talks about

735
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
Privacy on the internet, and

736
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
You know, Snowden

737
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
But actually there was more about the European government

738
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
And the UK government doing

739
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Religious things than the US

740
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Because we're doing just stupid things over here

741
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
As the US

742
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
You know, three letter

743
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
Organizations are as well

744
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
It's just as daft here, unfortunately

745
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Yeah, interesting

746
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
But how many people would you say attend this thing?

747
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
It's a good few hundred

748
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
I don't know, it's not like massive

749
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Event, it's just

750
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
It's not like massive event

751
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
It's held in a university

752
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
In London, and it's got a low

753
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Barrier to entry as well, it's only five

754
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Pound to get in, which is what, seven

755
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Eight dollars, something like that

756
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
And it's

757
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
In the middle of London, so it's really easy to get to

758
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
It's at a university

759
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
So there's plenty of facilities nearby to get

760
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Food and drink at lunchtime and that kind of stuff

761
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
So yeah, it was

762
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Really enjoyable

763
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Now, I would love to hear some of your notes about the event itself

764
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
So, a couple

765
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
That stood out for me, one was

766
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
To give you an idea of the diversity

767
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Of the topics

768
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
That were covered, there was one talk

769
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
That was called

770
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Objects of Intrigue

771
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
And it was by a woman called

772
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Rachel Mote, she's on

773
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
She's on Twitter as atrachelmote, and she

774
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Volunteers at a school

775
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
For children, specializes in help

776
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
For children with special needs, and some of these

777
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Children have difficulty doing things

778
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Like even feeding themselves

779
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Or they have

780
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Reluctance to

781
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
Touch certain surfaces

782
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Or

783
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Textures

784
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
There are certain things

785
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
That they just have difficulty with

786
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
And what she wanted to do was

787
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Help children with their eating

788
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
And

789
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
She had out on the stage, she had

790
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Three bowls, one of them contained custard

791
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
One contained water, and one

792
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Contained spaghetti, and

793
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
She's constructed with an

794
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Arduino, and a little

795
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Speaker, and some

796
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Various other components, she's constructed a little

797
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Setup that encourages

798
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
The children to touch these bowls

799
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Of food and

800
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Liquid, and they

801
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,500
The way she does it is there's a

802
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,500
Touch sensor underneath the

803
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,500
Bowl, and when the kids put their hand in the bowl

804
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
And like touch the custard, or touch

805
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
The water, it plays music, or plays a

806
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Drum sound or something, so they can actually make

807
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Music just by putting their hands in

808
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
These bowls of water, and that might not sound

809
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Like a major achievement or a particularly

810
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Technically advanced thing, but getting these

811
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Kids to touch stuff like custard

812
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Or spaghetti

813
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Or something that they wouldn't normally touch

814
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
And then when they take their hands out

815
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Putting their hands in their mouth and actually eating the

816
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Food afterwards is quite an

817
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Achievement for a child with special

818
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Needs, so that

819
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Gives you an example of how someone's using

820
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
Technology like an Arduino

821
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
And simple circuitry

822
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
In order to

823
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Help someone else, and

824
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
I think she's made the designs and the

825
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Details available online, so

826
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,500
It was a really nice

827
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Different talk that wasn't just

828
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Privacy and tech

829
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
And nerding out

830
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,500
Completely, but there were some

831
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Nerdy ones, one of them

832
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
That I found particularly fun

833
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Was there's a hack space in London

834
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
LHS, London Hack Space

835
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
And they've got a caravan

836
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,500
Which they've converted

837
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Into a spaceship

838
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
And it's

839
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Completely awesome

840
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
If you imagine being inside a really

841
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,500
Really tiny

842
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,500
Star Trek Enterprise

843
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Bridge, I love it

844
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
It's excellent

845
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
They've got loads of controls, switches

846
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
And buttons and dials and wires

847
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Dangling and stuff, and

848
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Everyone's got their own screen and

849
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Their own readout, and then there's a main screen

850
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
As well, and there's a comms link

851
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
And an engineers station and a weapons station

852
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
All of that, it's

853
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Just brilliant, and they wrote their

854
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Own game in

855
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Unity 3D, which runs on a

856
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,500
PC out the back, and people are

857
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Invited to come in and play the

858
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,500
Game, and it's a multiplayer game, and you're all

859
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,500
Sat inside the

860
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Caravan, each taking on the role

861
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
Of a different member of the crew

862
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
And the people

863
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,500
Who own the caravan throw certain

864
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,500
Scenarios at you, and you have to do things like

865
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,500
Press certain buttons at a certain time, or a certain sequence

866
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
Of buttons, like you would on a real

867
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
Spaceship, but also you have to do things like

868
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
There are cables that become

869
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
Disconnected, and you have to figure out which cables go

870
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Where, and you have to get up from your seat and actually

871
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
Do manual stuff like you would see on

872
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
Star Trek, it's pretty impressive

873
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
And they've got a website for it, if you go to

874
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,500
I think it's LHS

875
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
LHS

876
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
LHSbikeshed.com

877
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
LHSbikeshed.com

878
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
You'll find pictures of this caravan that they take

879
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
To events, and invite people

880
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
To come in and fly the missions

881
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
This is so cool!

882
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,500
It is, it is really cool

883
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
That's one of the nerdier things

884
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
It's really good fun

885
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,500
So, one of the other ones

886
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,500
That I found particularly interesting

887
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
A woman called

888
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
Kat Matfield, I think it was

889
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
She works as a consultant

890
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Developing applications

891
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,500
And they do privacy related

892
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
Applications, and

893
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,500
She gave us some tidbits of information that

894
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Feedback they've got from user testing

895
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
Of privacy based products

896
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
And some of the notes I took

897
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,500
That kind of surprised me a little bit

898
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
The

899
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
Perception of privacy among normal

900
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,500
People, like, not you and me, but like

901
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Normals out there, right?

902
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,500
Is a little bit strange

903
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
People focus on passwords

904
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
And people, they think that

905
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
The password is the most important thing

906
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,500
That I have to have a safe password

907
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,500
And that they think that

908
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
Bad people target

909
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
Specific individuals, they don't realize

910
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,500
That fraudsters can just go out and buy

911
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
A list of credit card details

912
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
And they're arbitrary, they don't care

913
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,500
Who those credit card details come from

914
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500
People seem to think that

915
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
I am a target, that I am

916
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500
The individual that they're going to come after

917
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,500
When in fact they just like

918
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
Reap thousands of credit cards

919
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,500
And take money from all of them

920
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
Wherever possible

921
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
One of the interesting things

922
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
That came out of their user testing

923
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500
Was that adding

924
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,500
A Facebook button, like for

925
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
Facebook login to a product or a

926
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Service, actually makes people

927
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
More uncomfortable, having

928
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
That button there, when you're logging into

929
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
Any kind of service, if there's a Facebook button on

930
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
The screen, people in their user testing didn't

931
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,500
Like it, because they felt that it associated

932
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,500
That product and service with their personal

933
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Data, and that their

934
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,500
Brother or sister or friend or parent

935
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
Might see what

936
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,500
They're doing on that website, because

937
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Of the Facebook button, and that made them

938
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
Feel very uneasy, and that kind of surprised me, I thought

939
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,500
People loved the Facebook button, I thought they thought

940
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,500
Well that's an easy way for me to log in and I don't have

941
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
To worry about it, but it turns out

942
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,500
Exactly, and I don't have to

943
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Remember yet another password, so it surprised

944
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,500
Me that people, normal people, not just

945
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,500
You and me, but normals, don't like that

946
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,500
Facebook button, and

947
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,500
The funny thing that came out of this was

948
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
People focus on

949
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
The little padlock, they see that as

950
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,500
A way of ensuring

951
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,500
That the page is safe

952
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,500
And so, in their user testing

953
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,500
They started adding padlocks to

954
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,500
The page, and they kept

955
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,500
Adding more and more padlocks all over the place

956
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,500
To the page, and

957
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,500
As they added

958
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,500
Padlocks, people felt the page was

959
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,500
More and more safe, and

960
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
They never managed to get to

961
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,500
What they called peak page

962
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,500
Padlock, and peak page

963
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Padlock, peak page padlock would be

964
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,500
The maximum number of padlocks you

965
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Could possibly have on a page, and they never got to that

966
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,500
Point, they could throw as many padlocks as they wanted

967
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,500
On the page, and people would just

968
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
Accept that that was more secure, because

969
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,500
There were more padlocks on there, it was brilliant

970
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,500
And it's all security theatre

971
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,500
But it was great to

972
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,500
Hear those kind of user experience testing

973
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,500
Results, it was great

974
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,500
It was a good conference, I would certainly go again

975
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Wow, and so, do you know at this point

976
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,500
Will there be another one next year?

977
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,500
I don't know actually

978
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,500
That was my first one, I've not been to it before

979
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,500
You know, based on

980
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,500
My experience, and the people

981
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,500
That I was chatting to afterwards in the bar

982
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,500
They all enjoyed it, and would certainly

983
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,500
Go again, so

984
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,500
Did you get a chance to say hi to any Jupiter

985
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,500
And the meetup page was so new when you guys

986
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,500
Launched this, did anybody actually make it there?

987
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
Yeah, there was a couple of people

988
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,500
Who made it along, I was just standing

989
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,500
There, and we didn't actually have

990
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,500
A specific place to meet up

991
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Or anything, it was just

992
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,500
That's the thing we gotta do next time, right? You gotta have specific

993
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,500
Details, but if you don't know the venue

994
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,500
It's hard to do that

995
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,500
Right, well the good thing is, people just walked up to me and went

996
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Hello baby, and they recognised me

997
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,500
And so

998
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,500
You know, we

999
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,500
Had a chat, and then later on afterwards in the bar

1000
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,500
There were a couple of guys there from the

1001
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
Linux Luddites podcast

1002
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
We sat and had a chat with them in the bar

1003
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,500
And then we made our way to a pub

1004
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,500
Which is the traditional

1005
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,500
British way to end a conference, is to go to a pub

1006
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,500
Afterwards, had a few beers

1007
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,500
And chatted about all kinds of stuff, including

1008
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,500
Jupiter broadcasting

1009
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,500
And all kinds of other podcasts and stuff

1010
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,500
All good things I'm sure, all good things I'm sure

1011
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Yeah, it was good fun, it was really really good fun

1012
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,500
You know what's funny is, when we go to some of these

1013
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Events, people walk

1014
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,500
Up to the booth, or they'll walk up to us and they

1015
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
Just kind of stand around for a bit, and maybe you've

1016
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
Noticed this, they stand around

1017
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,500
For a bit, and they wait for us to talk

1018
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,500
And then they're like, oh

1019
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,500
You're Noah, you're Chris

1020
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
And they recognise the voices

1021
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
After we've talked for a bit, and then they introduce themselves

1022
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
Did that happen to you at all?

1023
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,500
No, they just walked straight up to me

1024
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
And said hello, so they clearly recognised me

1025
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,500
You know what that means is, your mug

1026
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Your mug chasing that chicken is all over the internet

1027
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,500
That's what that means

1028
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
Yeah, that's true, but it was really lovely

1029
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Because everyone's, you know, a typical British event

1030
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
Like, everyone's really understated and

1031
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Really pleasant and friendly, and it was good

1032
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
It was really really good

1033
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
Good, boy, I tell you what, if I was

1034
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Somehow able to make it next year, that would

1035
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,500
Boy, that would be amazing, that would be the highlight

1036
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
If I was in a position to be able to make it next year

1037
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
We are

1038
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
I mean, these events are so awesome

1039
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
I would love to have audio from these kinds of things

1040
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
I mean, Poppy, don't you think this is one of the best things

1041
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,500
About our community?

1042
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,500
Yeah, and I kind of

1043
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,500
I did take a handheld voice recorder

1044
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,500
With me, and I was tempted to do

1045
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,500
Some interviews and record some

1046
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Stuff, but actually

1047
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,500
I was on my own dime

1048
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,500
And I thought, you know what, I'm just going to

1049
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,500
Focus on the talks, and

1050
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,500
Absorb this stuff, and especially

1051
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,500
As I wanted to go to the ones that were

1052
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Out of my comfort zone, there was one

1053
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,500
I'll give you one last talk that I went to

1054
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,500
Towards the end of the day, and

1055
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,500
It was called Science as Art

1056
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,500
And it was a

1057
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,500
Woman called Leah

1058
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,500
And a guy called James, who are

1059
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,500
Very artistic

1060
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,500
And they've been

1061
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,500
Trying to use open data

1062
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,500
That's been made available by

1063
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,500
Governments and NGOs and other organizations

1064
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,500
And try and

1065
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,500
Represent that in different ways, rather than just have

1066
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
Graphs, and they actually made

1067
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Some music out of

1068
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,500
Open data, it's quite hard

1069
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,500
To explain, but they've got

1070
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,500
Information about the rise

1071
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,500
In CO2 gases

1072
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,500
In the atmosphere, and they map that to music

1073
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Yes, they map that to one

1074
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
Instrument, and then they took something else

1075
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,500
Like the number of earthquakes

1076
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,500
Or floods in Pakistan

1077
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,500
For example, and then mapped that

1078
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,500
To the drums, and so they play a

1079
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,500
Little snippet of each of these, and then they

1080
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,500
Mashed it all together into

1081
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,500
A piece of music

1082
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,500
And actually it was really

1083
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,500
Thought provoking, because

1084
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,500
You knew that that big drum sound

1085
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,500
Was an earthquake 15

1086
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,500
Years ago, and then another one, and then two

1087
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,500
In quick succession when there were two more earthquakes

1088
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Or something, it was really, really nicely done, and they're

1089
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,500
Looking for more sources of data

1090
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,500
And how they can

1091
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,500
Map that into music or

1092
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,500
Theater

1093
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
Or anything, it's a nice way to represent data

1094
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,500
That might be a bit dry

1095
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,500
Otherwise, so that

1096
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,500
Also I found particularly interesting

1097
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,500
Boy, no kidding, I bet that was actually

1098
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,500
Kind of powerful, to see, to

1099
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,500
Represent data through music

1100
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,500
This sounds corny

1101
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,500
Because you're going to laugh at me

1102
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,500
There were some skeptical people in the room

1103
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,500
There were, in a vertical, real scientists

1104
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,500
But it's pretty powerful, isn't it? It is in a way

1105
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,500
It's kind of, it's a different way to

1106
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,500
Visualize it, but

1107
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Yeah, it sounds funny to say visualize, but you know

1108
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,500
What I mean, yeah, and

1109
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,500
Yeah, that's great, well thank you Popey

1110
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
Thank you so much, and thank you honestly

1111
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Thank you very much for helping

1112
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,500
Being willing to take on the Meetup page

1113
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
So we had an event, meetup.com

1114
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,500
Broadcasting if you were going to make it

1115
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
And Popey was

1116
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
More than willing to be an event organizer

1117
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
And if you want to go to the next one

1118
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
Popey, you know, let's do it again

1119
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
Let's just, any events like that in the

1120
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,500
Area, because it's an area that

1121
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,500
You know, we just don't have a lot of oversight

1122
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,500
On, and so I really

1123
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,500
Appreciate you kind of filling me in on that

1124
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
Because we have 30% of our

1125
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,500
Audiences over there, and so

1126
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
Like, I feel like I

1127
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,500
I know, we're really packed in on this tiny bit

1128
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,500
You guys are

1129
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,500
You probably all know each other

1130
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
I assume

1131
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,500
Oh yeah, yeah, totally

1132
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,500
So meetup.com plus Jupiter broadcasting you for future

1133
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,500
Events, I don't know, one of the next

1134
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,500
Live events we might do

1135
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,500
I would really

1136
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,500
Really, really love to do

1137
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,500
Linux Unplugged on location sometime

1138
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,500
Why?

1139
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,500
Not because it makes the show better

1140
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
Necessarily

1141
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,500
Why? Because I

1142
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,500
Wanted to do it before I ever launched the show

1143
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
So, a couple of weeks ago

1144
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,500
Two weeks ago on the Linux Action Show

1145
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,500
We said if we got to 530 patrons

1146
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,500
I would go out to Noah's house

1147
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
And I would go

1148
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,500
And I would tour Noah's automated house

1149
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,500
I would put on his freaking

1150
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
Google Glass, even if it stings

1151
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
A little bit, and I would walk around his house and get a tour

1152
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,500
And

1153
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,500
If I find Windows

1154
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,500
I will tell you about it

1155
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,500
Like, I will tell you about it

1156
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,500
And I will search out Windows

1157
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
In Noah's house, and we got to 530

1158
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,500
In fact, we're at 538 right now

1159
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,500
Which is awesome

1160
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,500
I'm really excited about that

1161
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,500
So we might do Linux, I don't know how the timing will work out

1162
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
We might, oh god, wouldn't it be cool if we could do Unplugged 100

1163
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,500
From Noah's house

1164
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
I'm really looking forward to this

1165
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,500
Because one of the things I want to do, I mean, we're going out to Noah's house

1166
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,500
As a way to sort of just celebrate a milestone

1167
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,500
But long term

1168
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,500
I really

1169
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,500
Want to do more of these event coverages

1170
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,500
I really, really, really think this is an area

1171
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
That if Linux Unplugged and

1172
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,500
Linux Action Show focused on, and by the way

1173
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,500
Just wait

1174
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,500
Because we're about to get into

1175
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,500
One of the discussions that Noah

1176
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,500
Had at Self

1177
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,500
And I think you guys are going to meet

1178
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,500
Somebody you're probably just going to start following now

1179
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,500
Somebody who's a thought maker in Linux and

1180
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,500
Open Source that you've probably never even heard of

1181
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,500
And after today's episode you're probably going to follow them on a daily

1182
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,500
Basis

1183
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,500
Going out and meeting these people and talking to these people

1184
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
And if you haven't heard Poby's description, it's awesome

1185
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,500
And it's what's the best thing about our community

1186
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
And so, yeah

1187
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,500
We got to 530 people

1188
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,500
And now 538, which is cool

1189
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
Yeah, I'm going

1190
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,500
To Noah's house as a way to celebrate

1191
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,500
And yeah, I'm going to do Linux Action Show from Noah's house

1192
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,500
And it's, in a way, it's a way for me to say

1193
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,500
Thank you to Noah because he comes out here all the time

1194
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,500
But what it's really about

1195
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,500
Is it's investing

1196
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,500
In the content that I think

1197
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
I'm almost so positive

1198
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,500
That if we could expose more of this

1199
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,500
In a better way than we do it now

1200
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,500
Like the event coverage we do now

1201
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,500
Is like 10% of what I want to bring you

1202
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,500
Because what I want to bring you

1203
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,500
Is, I want to

1204
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,500
Make it like you're there

1205
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,500
And I want you to experience why when we go to these events

1206
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,500
We come back so supercharged

1207
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
About Open Source, about the community

1208
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,500
About Linux

1209
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,500
I want you to experience that

1210
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,500
And that's why I'm excited about 530 people

1211
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,500
Not because I'm going to Noah's house

1212
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,500
Or I'm going to do a segment or the entire show from a boat

1213
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500
That's awesome

1214
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,500
That's not why I'm excited

1215
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,500
I'm excited because after we do that

1216
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,500
We're starting to

1217
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,500
Kind of move into the next phase

1218
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,500
We're moving to the next step

1219
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,500
We're going to the next area for Jupyter Broadcasting

1220
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Where pretty soon

1221
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,500
Let's be real

1222
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,500
What's it going to take to make it possible for me to go to Self

1223
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,500
And for me to go to things like Open Tech

1224
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,500
And for me to go to things like BSD Can

1225
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
What's it going to take? It's going to take somebody right here in the studio

1226
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,500
It's going to take somebody sitting here at the spot

1227
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,500
That I'm sitting at switching

1228
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,500
It's going to take somebody vamping

1229
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,500
It's going to take somebody that can mix in remote locations

1230
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,500
It's going to take a producer in studio

1231
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,500
That's where I'm going with this

1232
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,500
I know it's crazy ambitious

1233
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,500
But I want to be able to raise the funds

1234
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,500
To afford a full time person in studio

1235
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
And I'm willing to start part time

1236
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,500
A couple times a week, whatever I can do

1237
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
But where I eventually want to go is I want to have a full time person in studio

1238
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:41,500
And I don't want to pay for it with sponsors

1239
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,500
I'm willing to, because in some ways

1240
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,500
It feels like the shortcut

1241
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
Because I could get a sponsor

1242
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,500
I could get a sponsor to sponsor just that

1243
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,500
I've got two emails literally in my inbox right now

1244
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,500
From two different companies that want to sponsor our shows

1245
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,500
And I'm sitting here telling them

1246
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,500
I'm sorry, I only want to have as few sponsors of the show as possible

1247
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,500
Because I only want to pick the people I use

1248
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,500
And I only want to talk about the people I think you guys would use

1249
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,500
Right?

1250
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,500
But holy shit is that limiting

1251
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,500
Turns out that's a super limiting model to go with

1252
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,500
But it's the only one I can go with

1253
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,500
Where I can show up at this microphone and genuinely talk to you

1254
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
So what I like about this

1255
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,500
Is this is giving me some runway to start budgeting

1256
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,500
God, you know what?

1257
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,500
If we got to 600 I could start thinking about actually budgeting

1258
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,500
To have a part time person

1259
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,500
And then I could actually start traveling

1260
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,500
And when I start thinking about it like that

1261
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,500
I get really excited

1262
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,500
Because then I'm responsible to the audience

1263
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
I'm responsible to you

1264
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
I'm not thinking

1265
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,500
How am I going to formulate this new show

1266
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,500
And make sure I got good spots for sponsors

1267
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,500
How am I going to make sure this content

1268
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
Is going to make enough people click

1269
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,500
That the sponsor gets enough return on their investment

1270
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,500
What I'm thinking about instead

1271
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,500
When it's a Patreon inspired show

1272
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,500
Is I'm thinking

1273
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,500
God, what does the audience really want?

1274
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
Does this show even need intro music?

1275
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,500
It's a 10 minute, 15 minute show

1276
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,500
Does it need intro music?

1277
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,500
The audience doesn't need that?

1278
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,500
What do they need?

1279
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,500
What do they want to know about?

1280
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,500
And when you expand that out to covering things like community events

1281
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,500
I can't think of a better way to have

1282
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,500
Coverage of community events

1283
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,500
The fundamental foundation of what inspires

1284
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,500
Our open source community

1285
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,500
I can't think of a better way to cover that

1286
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,500
Than something that is also funded by the community

1287
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,500
And I'm not totally opposed to sponsorships

1288
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,500
I tell you what, one way or another

1289
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,500
I will make this happen

1290
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,500
And if I go to commercial sponsors to make it happen

1291
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,500
Because I think this is

1292
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,500
The most important aspect of open source

1293
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,500
Coverage that is neglected

1294
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,500
Because nobody can do it

1295
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,500
Because it's expensive

1296
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,500
And it's a risk

1297
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,500
And I will make it happen

1298
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
I will make it happen one way or another

1299
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,500
If I go to sponsors and make sure that

1300
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,500
Every live event we go to is sponsored

1301
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,500
I will do that

1302
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,500
And I will find a way to walk that line for you

1303
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,500
To make sure that it doesn't influence our coverage

1304
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,500
I will do that for you

1305
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,500
But it will take

1306
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,500
It will take going that route, it will take sponsorships

1307
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,500
It will take making sure we only go to events

1308
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,500
That have enough coverage to make sure

1309
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,500
That our sponsor gets a return on their

1310
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,500
Substantial investment

1311
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
And what I want to do instead is I want to cover it for you

1312
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Patreon.com slash today, yes it's a

1313
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,500
Tech Talk Today page, yeah I get that, I know that's confusing

1314
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,500
I understand, that was a dumb idea

1315
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
But Tech Talk Today is a thank you

1316
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,500
To 538 people

1317
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,500
Who make

1318
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,500
Expanding our coverage

1319
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,500
Genuine coverage possible

1320
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,500
That's what Tech Talk Today is

1321
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
For 538 people, I do a show for 538

1322
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,500
People, that's dumb

1323
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Nobody would do a podcast for 538

1324
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,500
People, and if you do you should stop

1325
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,500
You can't make any money

1326
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,500
Doing that, unless it's this model

1327
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,500
That's why Patreon makes a difference, Patreon.com

1328
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
Slash today, it funds this show

1329
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,500
It funds the Linux action show, it funds future

1330
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,500
Shows you don't even know we have in development that are

1331
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,500
Focused on open source, well you might actually

1332
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,500
Know because it got out for a little bit

1333
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,500
And I'm not trying to

1334
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,500
Shame you, I'm not trying to guilt you, but what I am trying

1335
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,500
To say is, I'm going to make

1336
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,500
This happen one way or another, I'm going to make Jupiter

1337
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,500
Broadcasting the company that covers these

1338
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,500
Events properly, and if

1339
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,500
You watch BSD now this week

1340
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,500
You're going to see the same exact thing happening

1341
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,500
For the BSD community

1342
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,500
And they've got a lot more together

1343
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Right now

1344
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
And I want to make sure that Jupiter Broadcasting

1345
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,500
Is the company and the community and the Linux action

1346
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
Show, Linux Unplugged is the podcast that represents

1347
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,500
The Linux community and the open source community

1348
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,500
And the life that they deserve, because right now

1349
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,500
What we get is a bunch of bloggers that want

1350
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,500
Clicks, and we get a bunch of people that want

1351
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,500
To get people to retweet and they make crazy

1352
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,500
Ass headlines, and if it's not that

1353
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,500
If it's not people trying to get clicks for advertisers

1354
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,500
It's websites that are set up by

1355
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Proprietary companies or huge companies or even

1356
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,500
Open source companies that are huge in our industry

1357
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,500
That are paying journalists to write pro things

1358
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,500
About them, that's the state of open source

1359
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,500
Journalism right now, and all of them

1360
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,500
Are neglecting this fundamental

1361
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,500
Aspect, the core community

1362
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
Aspect, and I know I'm making a huge case

1363
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,500
Right now, but I, throughout the rest of this

1364
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,500
Episode, will speak for

1365
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,500
Itself of how important covering

1366
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,500
These events are

1367
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,500
I am willing to go out on a ledge right now and tell you how

1368
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,500
Important this is based on the rest of the content

1369
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,500
Of this episode, patreon.com slash today

1370
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,500
Please go there, help expand

1371
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,500
Our coverage, I want to be able to go to things like

1372
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,500
Open tag, I'm sick of standing here

1373
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,500
In the studio, I want to go there, I want to cover these

1374
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,500
Things, I want to bring them to you, I want to bring video

1375
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,500
I want to bring audio, I want to bring all

1376
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,500
Of it, I want to bring exposure to all of it

1377
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,500
Not for me

1378
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,500
Alright, I'm done

1379
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,500
Alright, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done

1380
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,500
In fact, we should probably get into some of it

1381
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,500
I know, go ahead kids and kitty, go ahead, am I

1382
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,500
Am I up in my soapbox too much?

1383
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,500
No you're good

1384
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,500
I wasn't asking you, I was asking

1385
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,500
Kids and kitty

1386
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,500
But alright, alright

1387
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,500
Kids, you say you want to say something

1388
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,500
Jump in, but what did you just leave?

1389
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
No, go ahead

1390
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,500
I'm used to push to talk, working

1391
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,500
On the keyboard, not in the window

1392
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,500
Sorry about that

1393
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,500
No, no problem

1394
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,500
What you said though, it's

1395
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,500
That's just like most of the other internet

1396
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,500
In terms of journalism, it is

1397
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
All dominated by

1398
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,500
Clickbait basically, and I think

1399
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,500
That is a huge problem, and I think it's

1400
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
Great that you're looking to

1401
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,500
Alleviate that

1402
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,500
Through an independent means

1403
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,500
Yeah, and I mean

1404
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,500
I know that anybody can say it

1405
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,500
Anybody can

1406
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,500
Make that claim, the only

1407
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,500
Proof I have is in the content

1408
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,500
That we produce, and

1409
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,500
The only thing I can make

1410
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,500
The only plea I can make is if you believe in the content we've produced

1411
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,500
So far, and you like the direction

1412
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,500
We're going, that's the bet I'm asking

1413
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,500
You to take

1414
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Not necessarily for me, I don't even really

1415
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,500
I don't really need a lot, I just need to be able to do this

1416
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,500
On an ongoing basis, and be able to go do these

1417
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,500
Things on an ongoing basis

1418
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,500
I don't need a lot, I

1419
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
I know, I know it sounds like a crazy plea

1420
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,500
This, I can't write code

1421
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,500
Right, like

1422
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,500
I'm just too ADD, like I'm never

1423
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,500
Gonna do, I don't even submit bugs that often

1424
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,500
I do about, like what, a dozen bugs a year

1425
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,500
Tops

1426
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,500
It's not who I am

1427
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,500
I know, I know, I know, but this is

1428
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,500
What I do, this is what I can do

1429
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,500
And I just

1430
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,500
When we go to these events man, it's like

1431
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,500
We're so close to covering them in the way

1432
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,500
We want to cover them, but yet

1433
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,500
I can see the huge gap, like

1434
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,500
Like, sitting at a desk and

1435
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,500
Talking to people, and getting great people

1436
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,500
To stop by the desk, and talking to them

1437
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,500
Is great, that is

1438
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,500
Super good content, and

1439
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,500
If I objectively observe it, it's

1440
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,500
Exclusive content that nobody else has

1441
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,500
And I'm very, very happy, and man

1442
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,500
Did the team work super hard to accomplish that

1443
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,500
It is awesome

1444
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,500
It's not enough for me

1445
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,500
It's not enough, I really want to show

1446
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,500
You how awesome, I feel like you guys never get an idea

1447
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,500
Of how awesome these things are

1448
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,500
And that's all, and I feel like

1449
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,500
I feel like if we knew that, I feel like

1450
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,500
All of the bickering, and like

1451
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,500
The religious wars

1452
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,500
Around system D, and all of it

1453
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,500
Would sort of melt away, I know it's crazy

1454
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,500
It's crazy, but I just

1455
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,500
Feel like that's my way to contribute to the community

1456
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,500
Is to try to

1457
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,500
Bring

1458
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,500
Some sort of balance

1459
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,500
To what the commercial interests

1460
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,500
Are bringing to the dialogue

1461
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,500
I want to bring balance to that dialogue

1462
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,500
That is focused

1463
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,500
And funded by the community

1464
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,500
And that's my goal, and I know that sounds crazy

1465
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,500
But I feel like

1466
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,500
The reason why that's important is open source

1467
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,500
Software is created by people for people

1468
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,500
And I know that sounds so stupid, but

1469
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,500
When people get all crazy

1470
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,500
And people start making death threats and stuff

1471
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,500
People bail on open source, they don't develop open source

1472
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
Software, it creates this barrier to entry

1473
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,500
It creates this mystique

1474
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
About how hostile the Linux community is

1475
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,500
And none of it is actually true

1476
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,500
It is a small

1477
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,500
Percentage of our community

1478
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,500
It is a minority, but they get all

1479
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
Of the attention because all of those jerks

1480
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,500
Out there want to write headlines to get

1481
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
Clicks, and they want karma

1482
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
On Reddit, and they want retweets

1483
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,500
And whatever the hell the

1484
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,500
Pretend internet points is that they want

1485
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
That's what motivates them

1486
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,500
And I

1487
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,500
I will never be motivated by those things

1488
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,500
Go look at my Twitter feed right now

1489
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,500
Go look at my Google Plus feed

1490
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,500
Right now, go look at my Reddit

1491
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,500
Submissions, I could not give a shit

1492
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,500
About those things, I never will

1493
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,500
I never will be motivated by those things

1494
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,500
I am generally motivated

1495
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,500
By these, by

1496
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,500
I truly believe that if people could see

1497
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,500
More about what happens at these conferences

1498
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,500
About what Popey just shared with us

1499
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,500
About what we're about to play for himself

1500
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,500
If you could see more of this, you would understand

1501
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,500
That these are real people creating amazing things

1502
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,500
That when they go to these conferences

1503
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,500
It is not a hostile environment

1504
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,500
It is real people that connect and collaborate

1505
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,500
And create and move forward

1506
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,500
It is not like the comment threads

1507
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,500
That you read online, and it is not

1508
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,500
What you have been led to perceive

1509
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,500
By the tech journalists that want you

1510
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,500
To read their articles and click their

1511
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,500
Headlines, and I know

1512
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,500
That seems like it's not a big deal, but I think

1513
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,500
If you set the tone correctly

1514
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,500
It sets the tone for the entire community

1515
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,500
And it creates a collaborative

1516
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,500
Environment that trickles down, and I know I'm sounding like

1517
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,500
Ronald Reagan right now, but I think it's the truth

1518
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,500
It's trickle down community

1519
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,500
Okay, I gotta shut up

1520
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,500
Cause I could literally

1521
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,500
Spend an entire episode talking about this

1522
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,500
It's one of the number one things I think about

1523
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,500
All the time, and it's a huge soapbox

1524
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,500
That I've been on, and I apologize that I've just wasted

1525
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,500
This much of the show, why don't we talk about something else

1526
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,500
Let's take a minute, I'm gonna talk about Ting

1527
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,500
I want you to go to linux.ting.com

1528
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,500
Right now, go check them out

1529
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,500
Listen, we wouldn't be able

1530
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,500
We would not be able to do this without Ting

1531
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,500
They have seriously a great product

1532
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,500
Here, and you know how I've often

1533
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,500
Advocated you need to vote with your wallet?

1534
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,500
That's Ting, Ting is changing the mobile

1535
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,500
Industry, you only pay for what you use

1536
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,500
They take your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes and they add them up

1537
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,500
Whatever bucket you fall into

1538
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,500
That's what you pay, it's a flat six dollars for the line

1539
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Now

1540
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,500
In practicality, what that means is we are

1541
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,500
Able to give every one of our members

1542
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,500
At self this weekend, a phone

1543
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,500
I don't have a lot of

1544
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,500
Money you guys, and I gave every one of our

1545
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,500
Members at self this weekend a phone

1546
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,500
That made production

1547
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,500
Possible, and that's how we were able to coordinate

1548
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,500
All of this, that's how I was able to send

1549
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,500
Noah messages saying, hey this clip has

1550
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,500
Five minutes left and then we need to transition to you

1551
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,500
With an interview, you need to have that person on mic

1552
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,500
In five minutes, I could not have done that

1553
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,500
Without Ting, Ting is awesome

1554
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,500
And either if you just have one phone

1555
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,500
Or if you have more than ten devices, you're going to save

1556
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,500
Money, because think about this

1557
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,500
Current mobile industry practices are getting you

1558
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,500
To pay for plans that you don't necessarily

1559
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,500
Need, you might need four gigabytes

1560
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,500
You might need a thousand

1561
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,500
Minutes, you might need five hundred

1562
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,500
Messages, you might not

1563
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,500
Me, I don't

1564
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,500
Okay, all of my text

1565
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,500
Messaging happens over either Hangouts

1566
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,500
Or Telegram, majority is Telegram

1567
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
Voice calling

1568
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,500
Happens over Hangouts or

1569
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,500
Viber

1570
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,500
So I'm able to have three lines

1571
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,500
And I only pay about

1572
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,500
Well, I think last month it was like 37

1573
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,500
Dollars for three lines, that's an

1574
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,500
HTC One

1575
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,500
A Nexus

1576
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,500
Five

1577
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,500
And an iPhone 5

1578
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,500
All

1579
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,500
On one account

1580
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,500
See Ting isn't based on your device

1581
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,500
Ting is based on you, so if you want

1582
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,500
To have a MiFi hotspot, if you want to have a couple

1583
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,500
Of devices, if you're a developer

1584
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,500
And you want to be able to test across multiple

1585
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,500
Devices, maybe you need iOS, maybe you need

1586
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,500
Android, maybe you need multiple Android devices

1587
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,500
And you don't want to pay a whole bunch of

1588
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,500
Fees every single month

1589
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,500
Ting is perfect, linux.ting.com

1590
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,500
You're going to get a fifty dollar credit

1591
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,500
Off your first device, linux.ting.com

1592
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,500
You're going to get a fifty dollar

1593
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,500
Credit, and if you have a Ting compatible

1594
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,500
Device, and you might, because let's

1595
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,500
Be honest, cell phones have been around for a while, and

1596
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,500
Ting has got coverage on GSM and CDMA

1597
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,500
If you

1598
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,500
Have a device, you're going to get a fifty

1599
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,500
Dollar credit on your entire Ting

1600
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,500
Service

1601
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,500
Which, for me,

1602
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,500
When I signed up, I got like a twenty five dollar credit

1603
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,500
That fifty dollar credit is only good

1604
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,500
Till the end of June too, so jump on that, and by the way

1605
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,500
Ting also has an early termination relief program

1606
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,500
To help you get out of a current contract

1607
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,500
Get out of that duopoly!

1608
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,500
With the Ting ETF program, you can find out more about

1609
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,500
That, and also

1610
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,500
If you've listened to these ads, and you've thought

1611
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,500
Yeah, okay, that sounds too good to be true

1612
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,500
I've been burned by mobile service providers before

1613
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,500
Okay, that's fair

1614
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,500
That's fair. I invite you

1615
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,500
To check out Ting's hangout

1616
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,500
Ting is going to have a hangout on Thursday at noon

1617
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,500
Eastern time

1618
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,500
Just around the TechSnap time, so

1619
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,500
Watch this, and then join us for TechSnap

1620
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,500
And you can ask the Ting crew

1621
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,500
Anything you want to know

1622
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,500
How the hell do they make money?

1623
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,500
Are they going to be around for a long time?

1624
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,500
Why do I only pay for what I use?

1625
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,500
How can they have unlocked devices?

1626
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,500
How can they afford an early termination relief program?

1627
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,500
How do they have no hold customer service?

1628
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,500
Are you skeptical?

1629
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,500
Ask them! They have amazing

1630
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,500
Answers

1631
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,500
And I think after you watch that, you'll be impressed

1632
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,500
In fact, they have all kinds of great tips, you can go check it on their blog

1633
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,500
Go to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com

1634
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,500
Right now, get a fifty dollar credit

1635
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,500
No contract, only pay

1636
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,500
For what you use, no hold customer service

1637
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,500
Boom! That is Ting

1638
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,500
Right there in a brief

1639
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,500
linux.ting.com, and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring

1640
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,500
The Linux Unplugged Program

1641
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,500
And check out this week's Linux Action Show for

1642
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,500
Noah's new Bat Phone, which is

1643
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,500
Ridiculous. Noah's got this new kind of crazy

1644
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,500
Mobile phone that

1645
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,500
I'm a little jelly of, to be honest with you

1646
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,500
Now, Mumble Room, I was talking about

1647
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,500
Open Source Journalism

1648
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,500
And we're going to hear from somebody

1649
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,500
Who has

1650
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,500
Been directly involved with Open Source Journalism

1651
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,500
Now, for quite a while

1652
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,500
And I actually kind of rather

1653
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,500
Enjoy this man's commentary

1654
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,500
So, Noah sat down during self

1655
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,500
And he had a chance to talk with Brian

1656
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,500
And Brian is an author at

1657
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,500
OpenSource.com

1658
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,500
So, he's also a Red Hat employee

1659
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,500
And so, OpenSource.com and Red Hat kind of have the

1660
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,500
Connection there, and he had a lot of

1661
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,500
Good commentary on the things that Noah wanted to

1662
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,500
Chat with. And so, we

1663
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,500
I want to play a few clips for you from Brian

1664
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,500
So, here he sits down, he talks about how to

1665
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,500
Tell whether Open Source is one or not

1666
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,500
Like, there's a metric that I think we could probably all

1667
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,500
Agree on. Is Open Source

1668
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,500
One in this category? How do you tell?

1669
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,500
How do you know once you can declare victory?

1670
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,500
Well, he's got some thoughts on that

1671
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,500
And also, knowing

1672
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,500
Him chat about how you can add value to

1673
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,500
Open Source software when you are

1674
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,500
In the IT department and you want to say, hey

1675
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,500
I want to switch off Microsoft

1676
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,500
Office, let's switch to Libre Office

1677
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,500
And the first answer is, how could something

1678
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,500
Free be better? It turns

1679
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,500
Out, there's a way to make that

1680
01:09:39,500 --> 01:10:05,500
Case pretty crystal clear.

1681
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,500
I want to see you. I want to see your face.

1682
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Do you hear my mouth in your ear hole?

1683
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,500
Hi there.

1684
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,500
Hi there.

1685
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500
So, I'm Noah. Good to meet you.

1686
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,500
I'm Brian. Nice to meet you.

1687
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,500
So, tell me, Brian, what it is

1688
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,500
That you love about Linux.

1689
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,500
Well, I love everything about Linux, but

1690
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,500
I love the concept of openness because I like

1691
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,500
Collaboration.

1692
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,500
I am a contributor

1693
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,500
To a website called opensource.com

1694
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,500
And I've worked for that

1695
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,500
Open source.com team

1696
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,500
For about five years and there

1697
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,500
We tell stories about the ways

1698
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,500
That open source values make

1699
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,500
A difference in people's lives

1700
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,500
Outside the realm of software.

1701
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,500
So, that's what I find most intriguing about

1702
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,500
Open source. I love the way that it can be

1703
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,500
Adapted to different domains like

1704
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,500
The government or your health or

1705
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,500
Education.

1706
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,500
Now, do you attend a lot

1707
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,500
Of different conferences? I don't.

1708
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,500
This is my second time itself. Oh, no kidding.

1709
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,500
Yeah, second time itself. I was here two years ago and loved it.

1710
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,500
I don't attend too many conferences, but

1711
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,500
I do love this one. And I live up

1712
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,500
In the Raleigh area, so I wanted to make sure I shot down and got here.

1713
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,500
Now I know why you value

1714
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,500
Openness. Because

1715
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,500
Here's why. For those of you that don't know

1716
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,500
Red Hat is based in Raleigh.

1717
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,500
And Red Hat has, from my perception

1718
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,500
From talking to other people that are from the area

1719
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,500
And around and work for Red Hat,

1720
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,500
Basically, everyone

1721
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,500
That is involved

1722
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,500
Has

1723
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,500
Red Hat has had this influence

1724
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,500
On the community around them to encourage

1725
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,500
Everyone to be open. That's right.

1726
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,500
So I had a chance to sit down with the folks from Red Hat and

1727
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,500
Interview them. And we were talking to them

1728
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,500
And I would give them

1729
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,500
Opportunities to pump their own business.

1730
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,500
I'd say, tell me what advantages

1731
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,500
You can offer over your competitors.

1732
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,500
And they would say, well, we're

1733
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,500
Open source, so anything that we can

1734
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,500
Offer, our competitors can offer.

1735
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,500
Because we're all just teammates.

1736
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,500
And I think that goes a long way.

1737
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,500
Now, do you use Linux on your desktop? I do, yeah.

1738
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,500
Okay, which distro are you using? I'm using Linux Mint.

1739
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,500
Alright. Linux Mint XFCE.

1740
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,500
So what would you say to people that say

1741
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,500
When you walk around

1742
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,500
And you see people that aren't using Linux and they say

1743
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,500
Well, you know

1744
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,500
I need a bash shell to get my stuff done

1745
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,500
So I wouldn't be, I don't think I'd be able

1746
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,500
To use Linux. I'd have to use the Mac

1747
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,500
Because I also have to have an office suite.

1748
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,500
Stuff like that. Yeah, well I'd say

1749
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,500
That those two are not mutually

1750
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,500
Exclusive. So I would say that

1751
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,500
Out of the box, you get the software you need

1752
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,500
To do all the things that you just described

1753
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,500
By using the software that I would suggest

1754
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,500
That you use. So instead of

1755
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,500
Creating a false dichotomy between software

1756
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,500
That has and software that has not

1757
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,500
I would try to suggest that these people look at

1758
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,500
Software solutions

1759
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,500
That do everything.

1760
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,500
And the thing is

1761
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,500
I find that the people that

1762
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,500
Keep telling me Linux isn't capable of doing

1763
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,500
Things are usually getting in my way of

1764
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,500
Making Linux do things, right?

1765
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,500
We were told, so our company

1766
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,500
Jupiter Broadcasting, we were told I don't know how many times

1767
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,500
That you can't do live

1768
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,500
Broadcast on Linux.

1769
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,500
And everyone else in that

1770
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,500
I don't know

1771
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,500
It kind of looks like the answer to that question

1772
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,500
Yeah, no, this is actually a version of

1773
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,500
Windows. It's Windows with

1774
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,500
Mate. Yeah, yeah, Windows

1775
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,500
But no

1776
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,500
For a long time, everyone

1777
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,500
In that sphere told us, well you can't do that

1778
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,500
You have to have a Mac, or you have to have Windows

1779
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,500
To do it. And

1780
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,500
We're fortunate

1781
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,500
At least I feel fortunate

1782
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,500
That the owner of the company has

1783
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,500
A deep-rooted belief in using

1784
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,500
Linux where he can. So when I came to him, I'm like

1785
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,500
Hey, Chris, guess what? This works

1786
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,500
It works on Linux. I mean, he wanted to see it

1787
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,500
Work first, but as soon as I showed him

1788
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,500
It took him, I bet, less than seven seconds

1789
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,500
Of me flipping through the cameras and saying, look, it does it

1790
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,500
And he goes, great, let's start the production

1791
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,500
I mean, it was that fast.

1792
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,500
Yep, yep, yep, I can agree

1793
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,500
He's done the same thing with people

1794
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,500
Fixing up old computers, plopping them in front

1795
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,500
Of them, and with little or no

1796
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,500
Guidance, they're able to work their

1797
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,500
Way through the system easily

1798
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,500
I think one of my

1799
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,500
Favorite success stories was

1800
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,500
My parents just bought

1801
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,500
A new computer. They got a Mac

1802
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,500
And I said, okay, I'll help you set it up

1803
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,500
So I helped them set it up. And my mom

1804
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,500
Does a lot of word processing

1805
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,500
So she wanted iWork on her computer

1806
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,500
And she called me a week later and was like, look

1807
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,500
This iWork thing, I just don't get it

1808
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,500
I just don't understand it. I was like, look, I'm going to try something

1809
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,500
I'm going to come over and put a new

1810
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,500
Program on your computer. It's called Libre Office

1811
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,500
And we're going to see

1812
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,500
What it's like. A week later

1813
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,500
I get a text, oh my god, this is so much better

1814
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,500
And it was

1815
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,500
No learning curve at all. I mean, I just put

1816
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,500
The software on her machine, and

1817
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,500
That was it. That was the end of the story

1818
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,500
And she figured everything from there, and I think what you're saying

1819
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,500
Is true.

1820
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,500
I'll share

1821
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,500
A success story that's kind of similar. I was at a

1822
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,500
I do a lot of IT contracting work

1823
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,500
And we're big into the hospitality

1824
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,500
Industry. Right. So

1825
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,500
A lot of hotels are moving to web-based solutions

1826
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,500
And of course, web-based solutions really lend themselves

1827
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,500
To Linux because I don't have to worry about virus protection

1828
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,500
Malware protection, you know, all that

1829
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,500
Not to mention the ability to remotely

1830
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,500
Update Linux. It's a heck of a lot easier than trying to

1831
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,500
Remotely update Windows, right? Right, sure.

1832
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,500
So we had installed this computer

1833
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,500
And I had put

1834
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,500
Libre Office on it, and the girl looks

1835
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,500
At it, and she goes, aww. And as soon as

1836
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,500
She did that, I knew, I thought, oh, she's

1837
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,500
Heard of Libre Office, and usually it's a

1838
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,500
Oh, I don't want the Microsoft Word replacement

1839
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,500
I want actual Microsoft Word. She looks

1840
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,500
At me, dude, and she goes

1841
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,500
Why do you have Macsoft? What, do I have

1842
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,500
To use the Mac version? I'm like, what do you mean the Mac version?

1843
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,500
Yeah, I'm like, what are you talking about? She goes

1844
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,500
Oh, the school system, they all have Macs

1845
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,500
And they have this Libre Office, and they've switched the whole school

1846
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,500
And I'm like, what?

1847
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,500
What'd you just say? And I'm like

1848
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,500
The entire school district is using Libre Office, and she's like

1849
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,500
Yeah, and I'm like, so

1850
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,500
Open-source software has gotten to a point now where

1851
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,500
It gets confused for the overpriced, overinflated

1852
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,500
Mac stuff. Yeah, that's awesome

1853
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,500
I think that's a huge compliment to the Libre Office folks

1854
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,500
Some people wouldn't consider it

1855
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,500
But I think that's perfect

1856
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,500
That is

1857
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,500
That's what you need

1858
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,500
You need the

1859
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,500
How do I put this? When it becomes a non-issue

1860
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,500
When it becomes so commonplace

1861
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,500
You know, Clay Shirky

1862
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,500
Has this bit in his book

1863
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,500
Here Comes Everybody, where he talks about the common

1864
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,500
Placeness of technologies, and he says that

1865
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,500
He recalls

1866
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,500
He recounts the story of his

1867
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,500
Parents meeting for the first time

1868
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,500
And it's a story they told him many times

1869
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,500
How they met, and he said

1870
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,500
It involved a car, and the one thing that was

1871
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,500
Didn't resonate

1872
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,500
Wasn't part of the story at all, was the car

1873
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,500
The car was just a mundane thing that was there

1874
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,500
And it was part of the story

1875
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,500
But it didn't bear any remark at all

1876
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,500
And that's sort of how

1877
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,500
Open source software needs to function

1878
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,500
When it becomes the default

1879
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,500
And it becomes taken for granted, we've won

1880
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,500
Yeah, that's right, and the nice thing about that is

1881
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,500
Now we're vastly

1882
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,500
Approaching a point where companies are

1883
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,500
Starting to, they don't necessarily value

1884
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,500
The ideals like maybe you and I would

1885
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,500
But they value the way

1886
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,500
That it can be cost effective to them, so the fact that

1887
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,500
They're not locked into a proprietary

1888
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,500
There's no vendor lock-in

1889
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,500
And the fact that typically the cost

1890
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,500
To implement the software or roll it out is

1891
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,500
Low, and a lot of things is

1892
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,500
I worked for a large organization

1893
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,500
A very large organization, and I

1894
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,500
Pitched LibreOffice to them, and because

1895
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,500
I knew what they were capable of

1896
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,500
Monetarily wise

1897
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,500
I had recommended, I said rather than

1898
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,500
Pay $400 for Microsoft Office

1899
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,500
Technically we can install it for free

1900
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,500
Make a donation to LibreOffice

1901
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,500
And we'll install

1902
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,500
For every copy you install, instead of paying $400, make a donation

1903
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,500
For $200, and I knew

1904
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,500
We're going to roll it out over X amount of computers

1905
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,500
That's going to add up quickly

1906
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,500
But the company, even though

1907
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,500
It was going to cost them money, they were happy to do it

1908
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,500
Because they didn't have vendor

1909
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:47,500
Software lock-in, they had an upgrade

1910
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,500
Path, so in their mind

1911
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,500
They were going to pay once and upgrade forever

1912
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,500
And so yeah, I think that brings a lot of value

1913
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,500
Absolutely

1914
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,500
Now I love that Chad, and

1915
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,500
It's an interesting idea, like bringing value

1916
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,500
To open source software by saying

1917
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,500
Okay, we're going to use this free software

1918
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,500
But let's donate a little

1919
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,500
Money first, and you'll donate once

1920
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:09,500
And then you can use it guilt-free going forward

1921
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,500
I don't know if that worked for everybody

1922
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,500
But I suggest that

1923
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,500
As an interesting idea, if you run into

1924
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,500
A barrier, and I've

1925
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,500
Been there, and I don't know if this is still as common as it used to be

1926
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,500
But if you run into

1927
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,500
A barrier where they say, how can this be any good

1928
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,500
It's free

1929
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,500
Before the conversation

1930
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,500
Ever gets to that point

1931
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,500
If you know that's your company's inclination

1932
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,500
Maybe suggest to them

1933
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,500
That they start by making a contribution

1934
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,500
Let's use this software, and we're

1935
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,500
Going to make a contribution first

1936
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,500
You're going to spend $200 per

1937
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,500
User, for the rest

1938
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,500
Of that user's

1939
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,500
Existence, you know? Like you're not

1940
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,500
Every three years going to spend $200

1941
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,500
You're going to spend $200 once per user

1942
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,500
Maybe you even do it, every new user that rolls out

1943
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,500
You spend $200, right? It's still half

1944
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,500
The amount

1945
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,500
Wouldn't that fundamentally change

1946
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:03,500
Open source software? Isn't that a great idea?

1947
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,500
I was really inspired

1948
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,500
By that

1949
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,500
So that was Brian's take on that

1950
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,500
Now, Brian and Noah talked about

1951
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,500
Maybe the best way to get

1952
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,500
Started is, you know, a lot of times

1953
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,500
You run into this tool bias

1954
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,500
And this is going to be a theme of their conversation

1955
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,500
As we go forward, tool bias

1956
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,500
Well, I know I can

1957
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,500
Make it work under Excel

1958
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,500
Well, I learned how to do it in

1959
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,500
Well, I know that

1960
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,500
I've done it before

1961
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,500
Under, you've heard those

1962
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,500
Excuses before, why you can't switch to Linux

1963
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,500
And maybe

1964
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,500
The strategy actually is

1965
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,500
Maybe Microsoft and definitely

1966
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,500
Apple got it right all along

1967
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,500
Get them while they're young, maybe that's what it is

1968
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,500
I think that's why

1969
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,500
A lot of these, I'm reading a lot more

1970
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,500
Initiatives about open source

1971
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,500
And education and the way that people are not

1972
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,500
Only taking open source principles and importing them

1973
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,500
Into classroom settings, but what they're doing is they're trying

1974
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,500
To change

1975
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,500
Computer education to talk

1976
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,500
About digital rights

1977
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,500
And to talk about privacy rights

1978
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,500
And to talk about openness and to talk about

1979
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,500
The way that the tools we use define

1980
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,500
Our capabilities in some way

1981
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,500
That is extraordinarily important

1982
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,500
Those initiatives are extraordinarily important because

1983
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,500
Like you say

1984
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,500
People who don't

1985
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,500
People like us are reflexive about the tools we use

1986
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,500
We care about them, other people don't, and that doesn't

1987
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,500
It's not a criticism, it's just

1988
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,500
It is what it is

1989
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,500
To have a tool

1990
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,500
Synonymous with the job, I use X to do Y

1991
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,500
If I don't have to think about

1992
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,500
Using X to do Y, that's better for me

1993
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,500
So when I learn that X does Y

1994
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,500
Whether it's LibreOffice or Word or whatever

1995
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,500
It might be, that's what I'm going to go to

1996
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,500
That's what I'm going to use

1997
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,500
Getting started early

1998
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,500
As has been the Microsoft strategy

1999
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,500
As has been the Apple strategy

2000
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,500
Getting people started early is

2001
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,500
Teaching them to associate their computing

2002
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,500
Experience and their computing habits

2003
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,500
With open source solutions, I feel like

2004
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,500
Sounds like a great strategy

2005
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,500
If I were to be invited

2006
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,500
To a school board and they said, Noah, tell me

2007
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,500
Tell me why we should use this software

2008
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,500
That or the other, I would

2009
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,500
Submit to them that by

2010
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,500
Implementing things like LibreOffice

2011
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,500
You empower your students

2012
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,500
With more, so it's more

2013
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,500
Fair to your students, so for example

2014
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,500
A financially underprivileged

2015
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,500
Student is going to have a hard time kicking out

2016
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,500
What's the education version, $100, $200

2017
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,500
Or whatever, so even that is a lot

2018
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,500
Of money for a high school student or even some

2019
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,500
College students to pay for

2020
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,500
So this idea that if a professor is

2021
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,500
Going to release a presentation, why not

2022
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,500
Release that in LibreOffice

2023
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,500
Where everyone can download it and use it

2024
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,500
I have two things to say about that

2025
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,500
The first is that

2026
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,500
It's an uphill battle because people

2027
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,500
Associate openness with price

2028
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,500
With open source software with price

2029
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,500
And so what they will do is they will say, oh, well

2030
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,500
You get a student discount on Microsoft Word

2031
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,500
There's no reason for you to

2032
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,500
If you really have a problem, you can get a free

2033
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,500
Copy, you can present a financial hardship

2034
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,500
Application or whatever

2035
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,500
And get the software for free, and it's like

2036
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,500
People don't understand that it's not about that

2037
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,500
But for so many people

2038
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,500
It is, so we need to fight that fight

2039
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,500
I like this

2040
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,500
Idea

2041
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,500
I want to change the conversation

2042
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,500
When somebody says, well look, I can get Microsoft Office

2043
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,500
For free or I can get it with a discount

2044
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,500
You say, it's not about that

2045
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,500
It's about, yeah, yeah, yeah

2046
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,500
Sure, you can buy today's version

2047
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,500
But just look

2048
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,500
At how much it changes over the last few years

2049
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,500
You can learn

2050
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,500
See, when you learn Microsoft Office

2051
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,500
You are learning Microsoft Office

2052
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,500
When you learn

2053
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,500
LibreOffice, you are learning

2054
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,500
Skills that apply to a free platform

2055
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,500
That can be applicable anywhere

2056
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
In the world

2057
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,500
There's such a huge difference

2058
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,500
When you

2059
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,500
Learn skills that work with LibreOffice

2060
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,500
Versus Microsoft

2061
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,500
I feel like what we need to do is we need to change the

2062
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,500
Yeah, you can get a discount on Microsoft Office

2063
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,500
Sure, yeah, you can do that, of course you can

2064
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,500
And you can

2065
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,500
Become super well skilled

2066
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,500
In a very limited time product

2067
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,500
But technology is always changing

2068
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,500
It's always moving forward

2069
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,500
And LibreOffice allows you to stay current

2070
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,500
You keep

2071
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,500
It's free, you can keep staying up to date

2072
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,500
You can keep that skill set

2073
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,500
Now, let's talk about specifically

2074
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,500
How to get past that bias

2075
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,500
Of, well, I've seen this font

2076
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,500
And I like the way this font looks

2077
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,500
Or I know this application

2078
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,500
Like Publisher, that was a huge one

2079
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,500
When I was trying to convert somebody

2080
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,500
Somebody special in my life

2081
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,500
I tried to convert to Linux, and they couldn't do it because of

2082
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,500
Publisher

2083
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,500
How do you get past that tool bias? Well, Brian and Noah

2084
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,500
Have some thoughts, and Noah shares his

2085
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,500
Super secret trick

2086
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,500
Welcome

2087
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
On opensource.com last week, we had a new author

2088
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,500
Her name's Lee Brian, she told

2089
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,500
We have a regularly

2090
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,500
Occurring column series on opensource.com

2091
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,500
Called My Linux Story

2092
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,500
And it's where people who, it's where people come on

2093
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,500
And just tell their story about how they got started with Linux

2094
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,500
Why it appeals to them, and sort of

2095
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,500
Where it's taken them in their life

2096
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,500
And we had a really great column last week by

2097
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,500
A newbie writer, Lee Brian

2098
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,500
Who wrote about, wrote her Linux story

2099
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,500
And talked about how tough it was

2100
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,500
For her to adopt opensource tools as a student

2101
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,500
Because teachers

2102
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,500
Would see that the default font

2103
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,500
Was different in the documents, or the margins were wrong

2104
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,500
Oh, they rail against it, yeah

2105
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,500
Yeah, they rail against it, and it's like

2106
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,500
You know, a lot of great comments, over 100

2107
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,500
Comments on that story, people just saying they didn't

2108
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,500
Understand why

2109
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,500
You know, the criticism was about

2110
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,500
The way the paper was laid out, and that was written

2111
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,500
And why

2112
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,500
The tool became so important

2113
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,500
And I didn't know how to answer those comments

2114
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,500
You know, I really didn't understand

2115
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,500
I haven't yet figured out the strategy

2116
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,500
For how you dislodge

2117
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,500
You know, the bias towards

2118
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,500
Certain ways that things appear, and the way that

2119
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,500
You know, certain tools function

2120
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,500
And make their final product, it just doesn't make any sense

2121
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,500
So, I had a client

2122
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,500
She had a

2123
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,500
She had a computer, and it had failed

2124
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,500
And I went to take a look at it, and she goes

2125
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,500
Can we put Windows 7 back on there? And I said, well

2126
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,500
You know, let me tell you about Ubuntu

2127
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,500
You know, it's a software we use, it has

2128
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,500
It is basically immune to virus

2129
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,500
Spamware comes with the, we're going to put

2130
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,500
An office suite on there, we're going to provide that for you

2131
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,500
Your mail client is going to be there, you're going to be able to do all the same

2132
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,500
Things, and she worked in an

2133
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,500
Environment where all she was doing was office documents

2134
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,500
And I said, you know, it's really, it's going to work just as

2135
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,500
In fact, she was even using LibreOffice

2136
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,500
I said, it's going to work just the same as Windows, except it'll be

2137
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,500
A little bit more reliable for you and such

2138
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,500
And I get done explaining that, and she goes, no, I'd really rather have

2139
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,500
Windows 7, and I said, alright, well, no problem

2140
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,500
We'll go ahead and get the restore disk sorted for you

2141
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,500
Because we don't have those, so I'll get those from HP

2142
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,500
So, call HP

2143
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,500
Order the restore disk, they said it's going to be 7 to 10 business days

2144
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,500
So I called her back and said, so, it's going to be a little bit

2145
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,500
Before we can get that out to you, and she goes

2146
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,500
Do you have a loaner computer? I said, I do

2147
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,500
We have plenty of them, but I don't have anything with Windows on it

2148
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,500
I'm sorry, it's just we can't pay for the license

2149
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,500
It's just going to be a pain

2150
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,500
And she goes, well, I guess if it's only for

2151
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,500
10 days, I'll use it, and I said, okay, sure

2152
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,500
Great, Trojan horse

2153
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,500
So we get it put into her place

2154
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,500
Into her desk, now I paid $53

2155
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,500
For the recovery disks, which, if we had restored

2156
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,500
Her computer, that would have gotten passed off to her

2157
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,500
Plus, I would have charged her for my time to come out and install it

2158
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,500
So, I come back out

2159
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,500
And I said, hey, I just want to let you know that

2160
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,500
The restore disk came in, so we'll be there on Friday to restore your computer

2161
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,500
And she goes, is it too late

2162
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,500
To change my mind? Because, I'm not

2163
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,500
Going to lie, I actually

2164
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,500
This is working really well, and she's like, I've never

2165
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,500
Had my computer perform this fast

2166
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,500
Now, I do have a secret weapon

2167
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,500
When I switch people to Linux, or when I get them to try Linux

2168
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,500
The first time, traditionally

2169
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,500
Computers, this might change in the near future

2170
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,500
But right now, desktop computers are

2171
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,500
Typically shipping with spinning rust

2172
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,500
And so, what I'll do is, I'll rip that out

2173
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,500
And I'll swap it for an SSD

2174
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,500
And there are a couple people in the chat room, they always give me

2175
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,500
Crap about it, and they say, wow, you're being dishonest

2176
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,500
You're misrepresenting, and I'm like, you know

2177
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,500
I'm giving Linux a little bit of an edge

2178
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,500
You know, when you get it on that SSD, all of a sudden

2179
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,500
You click on something and everything flies, it's like

2180
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,500
Oh, this is way faster. Well, she told me, she goes

2181
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,500
This is just so much more faster and responsive to

2182
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,500
What I'm used to, and

2183
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,500
But I keep it, and at that point, it's like, wow

2184
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,500
This is where the whole commitment to open source comes in

2185
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,500
Because I'm just going to eat the cost and tell her, alright

2186
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,500
So, you know, it was all set up

2187
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,500
And so, you know, we didn't end up billing her for anything

2188
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,500
Yeah, exactly, but

2189
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,500
The point was, what you were talking about

2190
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,500
Once you can get past your preconceived

2191
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,500
Ideas of how something should function

2192
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,500
Or how something should be, once you can

2193
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,500
Get past that, and she didn't have a choice, because

2194
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,500
We just sat the computer in front of her, once she

2195
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,500
Got past that, then all of a sudden

2196
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:25,500
Linux became a viable option for her

2197
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,500
I like

2198
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,500
Inagura's comment in the chat room

2199
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,500
Cost of the SSD is basically

2200
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,500
The cost of a Windows license, and it's a one-time

2201
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,500
Investment. What a great point

2202
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,500
What a great point. So,

2203
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,500
We got a couple of mumble

2204
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,500
Commentary. Kits and Kitty, I wanted to start with you

2205
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,500
First. You made a great comment during

2206
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,500
That clip, and I wanted to let you jump in right now

2207
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,500
Yeah, one of the things that I do

2208
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,500
Because I work in sales

2209
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,500
Is when I want to sell somebody on a

2210
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:55,500
Product, I ask them, well

2211
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,500
What do you like about

2212
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,500
What you're currently using?

2213
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,500
Tell me about that. And then I

2214
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,500
Use that as ammunition

2215
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,500
To push the sell

2216
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,500
Because I know everything

2217
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,500
About the product that I sell

2218
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,500
So you say, what feels

2219
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:13,500
Good? What do you like about

2220
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:15,500
Solution A?

2221
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,500
Exactly

2222
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,500
And a lot of times what you

2223
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,500
Will find is people

2224
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,500
Don't have much to say

2225
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,500
About the product that they have

2226
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,500
So then that lets you

2227
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,500
Come in and present

2228
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,500
Option B. Actually

2229
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,500
I don't want to

2230
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,500
Skip over this. This is

2231
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,500
Pure brilliance. Make them

2232
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,500
Focus on what they like. What do you

2233
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,500
Like about X, right?

2234
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,500
And then say, okay, well you know what

2235
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,500
I get that. And by the way

2236
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,500
Y provides this and even

2237
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,500
More. And I think if you could make that

2238
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,500
Case, that's a very, very, very strong

2239
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,500
Way to do that. Great point

2240
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,500
Kitson. Sunsol, you wanted to make a comment about

2241
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,500
Awareness overall. Go ahead.

2242
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,500
So I'm in the same

2243
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,500
Boat as I guess most people

2244
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,500
So I'm trying to make people

2245
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,500
Aware, especially in my

2246
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,500
Small community. People who are

2247
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,500
Blind or visually impaired about Linux

2248
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,500
How it can help you

2249
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,500
Especially for how it's advantageous for them

2250
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,500
So I always present the case of

2251
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,500
Look, what is your current

2252
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:19,500
Workflow and how does it work for you

2253
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,500
And I try to show them this is how this

2254
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,500
Can work for you because

2255
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,500
In my line of people

2256
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,500
They have to be shown

2257
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,500
It's kind of like

2258
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,500
What Noah and Brian had started

2259
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,500
Talking about, about change. A lot of people

2260
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,500
Are really hard on change

2261
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,500
So when you try to show them

2262
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,500
Something new and try to show them the benefits

2263
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,500
They're almost not willing to accept it unless you can show them

2264
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,500
A good way of how this is really going to

2265
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,500
Enforce a good change.

2266
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,500
Wow. Great point.

2267
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,500
And thank you for bringing up the accessibility aspect of that too.

2268
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,500
Great point.

2269
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,500
And

2270
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,500
You know, I wanted to talk about

2271
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,500
As we move, as we zoom

2272
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,500
Out a little bit because that's

2273
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:01,500
Such a good point and yet

2274
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,500
It's really in the weeds, right? And so

2275
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,500
How do you address that at a

2276
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,500
Global level? And

2277
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,500
As somebody who has followed

2278
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,500
Linux forever

2279
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,500
Basically

2280
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,500
I've never really known where to put

2281
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,500
Red Hat, right?

2282
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,500
I grok a lot of what they

2283
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,500
Do. At the same time, I kind of

2284
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,500
I'm inclined because

2285
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,500
They're worth a lot of money and they're

2286
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,500
A company. I'm inclined to put them

2287
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,500
Sort of at a far and

2288
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,500
Watch them at a distance.

2289
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,500
That could all change though.

2290
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
I don't know where I'm going to stand.

2291
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,500
I'll tell you more about this, but we had something

2292
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,500
Really unique happen this last week for

2293
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,500
The Linux Action Show and

2294
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,500
Red Hat. And

2295
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,500
This clip with Brian

2296
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,500
And Noah touches a little bit on this. I'm going to

2297
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,500
Expand on this more after we play this, but

2298
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,500
Let's talk about Red Hat a little bit.

2299
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,500
Welcome.

2300
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,500
I guess what surprises me so much about Red Hat

2301
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,500
Is they're so big.

2302
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,500
And I guess I'm surprised

2303
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,500
I shouldn't be, I guess, but

2304
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,500
I guess I was pleasantly

2305
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,500
Surprised at how such a big company

2306
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,500
Can get to a point and still

2307
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,500
Maintain their integrity. They still

2308
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,500
Maintain that really strong

2309
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,500
Sense of community and they really get it.

2310
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,500
I mean, they really, really get it.

2311
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,500
Well, you know, it's really great to hear you say that

2312
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,500
Because I feel that way.

2313
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,500
And if I can just make one more

2314
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,500
Shameless plug, our CEO

2315
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,500
Jim Whitehurst just wrote a book about this

2316
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,500
Very topic. It's called

2317
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,500
The Open Organization.

2318
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,500
And it's about Whitehurst's

2319
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,500
Time at Red Hat.

2320
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,500
He's very open about the fact that he came

2321
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,500
From Delta seven or eight years ago.

2322
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,500
Very traditional hierarchical

2323
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,500
Organization, you know, real button

2324
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,500
Down, straight laced place. And he came

2325
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,500
To Red Hat and he thought his mission was going to be

2326
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,500
As he says in the book, I thought my mission was going to be

2327
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,500
To clean this place up. This is chaotic.

2328
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,500
You know, this company

2329
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,500
Is just, you know, it's doing things

2330
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,500
In a way that I've never seen things done before.

2331
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,500
And he said instead of changing the company

2332
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,500
The company changed him. So he wrote

2333
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,500
This book that I just finished reading

2334
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,500
And we write about on open source dot com

2335
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,500
A little bit. It's called The Open Organization

2336
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,500
And it's about the ways that open source principles

2337
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,500
Function in organizations.

2338
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,500
The way that they actually present a model

2339
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,500
For organizing that is more in line

2340
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,500
With 21st century business practices, right?

2341
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,500
And the way that, you know, our

2342
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,500
Economy today demands in some ways

2343
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,500
Demands that companies

2344
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,500
Adopt open source principles. So what he says

2345
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,500
Is that, you know, Red Hat's been a great project

2346
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,500
And it's taught him a lot. But what he's saying in the book

2347
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,500
Is that other companies can begin

2348
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,500
To adopt, you know, these principles

2349
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,500
And make their companies

2350
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,500
Open. And in fact they will have to survive.

2351
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,500
Yeah.

2352
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,500
Now, this is something I'm pretty fascinated by.

2353
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,500
How connected

2354
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,500
Is Red Hat with the community?

2355
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,500
And really how tuned in are they?

2356
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,500
So we're going to do something kind of unique.

2357
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,500
Something we've never done

2358
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,500
For really the history of the Linux

2359
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,500
Action show.

2360
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,500
We're going to totally drop the format

2361
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,500
Of the show. And we're going to do a special Linux

2362
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,500
Action show visits Red Hat on Friday

2363
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,500
At 3 p.m. Pacific. Go to

2364
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,500
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that in your local

2365
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:05,500
Time.

2366
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,500
Self was

2367
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,500
Kind of within range of Red Hat's

2368
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,500
Corporate offices. And so

2369
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,500
Producer Q5 Sis and

2370
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,500
Noah went out there

2371
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,500
And talked to Red Hat. And we

2372
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,500
Have three hours plus

2373
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,500
More than three hours

2374
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,500
Of footage. And we're going to try

2375
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,500
To whittle all of it down to the best of in about an hour

2376
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,500
Format. And for

2377
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,500
The next week's Linux Action show

2378
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,500
For just that episode we're going to

2379
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:33,500
Kind of

2380
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,500
Throw the format out the airlock

2381
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,500
If I could use a Star Trek reference

2382
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,500
If I could. And for episode

2383
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,500
370 it's going to be the Linux Action

2384
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,500
Show visits Red Hat's offices.

2385
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,500
And we're going to go down there and talk to them about this.

2386
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,500
And so when I heard that interview with

2387
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,500
Brian I got pretty excited about that.

2388
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,500
And I'm really looking

2389
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,500
For that. So this Friday join us won't you.

2390
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,500
We're going to do a special 3pm Pacific

2391
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,500
Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar

2392
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,500
For a Linux Action

2393
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,500
Show visits Red Hat. Now

2394
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,500
That was Brian from

2395
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,500
Opensource dot com. We'll have links to his material

2396
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,500
In the show notes. Thank you to Brian too for tuning

2397
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,500
In. And apparently he's a big fan of

2398
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,500
The network too. Which I am

2399
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,500
You know I can't lie. I'm a fan

2400
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,500
Of him too. So Semi-Robotic

2401
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,500
He's known as online. And we'll have

2402
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,500
A link to his blog and more

2403
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,500
In the show notes if you want to follow up with Brian.

2404
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,500
Now we have one more thing

2405
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,500
To get to.

2406
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,500
Something really special. I'm really looking forward to playing this.

2407
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,500
And part of it is because

2408
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,500
When I play this next clip I think

2409
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,500
Of all of you outside the good old

2410
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,500
United States of America. Who

2411
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,500
Don't get really exposed to that good old

2412
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,500
Southern twine. Well this next

2413
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,500
Clip is going to be Alan Hicks. A long time

2414
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,500
Contributor to the Slackware project. In fact

2415
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,500
The man

2416
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,500
Who wrote the book on Slackware.

2417
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,500
He's going to join Noah. He's going to talk

2418
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,500
About self. He's going to talk about Slackware.

2419
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,500
I really want to play this clip for you. But first

2420
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,500
I'm going to tell you about Digital Ocean.

2421
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,500
Last sponsor

2422
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:01,500
Of the Linux Unplugged program. Go to Digital Ocean

2423
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:03,500
Won't you? And use our promo code

2424
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,500
DOUNPLUGED. That'll give you a $10 credit.

2425
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,500
Get a $5 rig. Try it out for a couple

2426
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,500
Of months absolutely for free.

2427
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,500
Now what I love about Digital Ocean

2428
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,500
Is they're a company that recognized

2429
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,500
That look there's a few key points we got to hit.

2430
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,500
We got to have great connectivity.

2431
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,500
Like for example they just built out the new data

2432
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,500
Center over in Germany.

2433
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,500
40 gigabit e-connections

2434
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,500
To each hypervisor.

2435
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,500
Their fastest SSDs yet.

2436
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,500
And like Digital Ocean

2437
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,500
Is like a tactical strike when they do this

2438
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,500
Kind of thing. They made sure that when

2439
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,500
They picked their data

2440
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,500
This new data center in Germany it's

2441
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,500
Perfect if like not only

2442
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,500
Germany is a great country but you got to distribute

2443
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,500
To anybody around Germany

2444
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,500
This is a great data center. So 40 gigabit

2445
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,500
E-connections to each hypervisor.

2446
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:49,500
Their fastest SSDs yet.

2447
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,500
That's awesome.

2448
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,500
But really what I love about Digital Ocean is they

2449
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,500
Early on decided we're going to go SSD only.

2450
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,500
They made that bet way

2451
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,500
Before anybody else.

2452
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,500
And yeah you know

2453
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,500
Linux is the obvious bet. And yeah

2454
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,500
KVMs are the obvious

2455
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,500
Bet. But for a commercial

2456
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,500
Company to go out there

2457
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,500
And base their entire company around

2458
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,500
Linux. Around

2459
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,500
KVM.

2460
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,500
That's a bold bet.

2461
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,500
That's a bold bet. I got to respect

2462
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,500
That. And that's what Digital Ocean

2463
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,500
Did. But they realized it's not just

2464
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,500
Linux. It's not just KVM.

2465
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,500
We got to have super great hardware.

2466
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,500
We got to have SSDs. We got to have the

2467
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,500
Best best best data centers anywhere.

2468
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,500
And that's why Digital Ocean has data center locations

2469
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,500
In New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

2470
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,500
London and that new one in Germany. Right?

2471
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,500
And you can get started in less than a minute.

2472
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,500
You can get started in less than a minute.

2473
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,500
And remember use the promo code

2474
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,500
DOUNPLUGGED. You'll get a $10 credit.

2475
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,500
You can try out Digital Ocean a couple of months for free

2476
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,500
Because for $5 a month

2477
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,500
You can get a $5. $5 a month.

2478
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:53,500
Just $5. That's less than a burger.

2479
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,500
512 megabytes of RAM.

2480
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,500
A 20 gigabyte SSD.

2481
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,500
One CPU.

2482
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,500
And a terabyte of transfer.

2483
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:03,500
That's crazy.

2484
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,500
For $5 a month. That's crazy.

2485
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,500
And if you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED

2486
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,500
Not only are you supporting the show and keeping us on the air

2487
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,500
But you're going to get a $10 credit. You can try it out for 2 months for free.

2488
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,500
Guys. Go try out

2489
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,500
Core OS. Go try it.

2490
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,500
Core OS is like. I don't know.

2491
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,500
I love it. Because you know me. I'm all in

2492
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,500
On rolling. But there are some

2493
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,500
Serious disadvantages to our rolling distribution.

2494
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,500
Well Core OS sort of solves that. Right?

2495
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,500
Between containerization. Between Docker. Between the rolling

2496
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,500
Base OS. That's a great solution.

2497
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,500
And Digital Ocean worked with the upstream project

2498
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,500
To make sure that way you get the

2499
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,500
Updates directly from the Core OS

2500
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,500
Project. I love that.

2501
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,500
Digital Ocean has the big picture

2502
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,500
In mind. And when you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED

2503
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,500
DOUNPLUGGED

2504
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,500
DOUNPLUGGED. One word.

2505
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,500
Lower case.

2506
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,500
You get a $10 credit.

2507
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,500
I want you to just experience it.

2508
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,500
Go create a machine. They have an HTML5

2509
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,500
Based console. You can get from post all the way

2510
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,500
Up to the boot screen.

2511
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,500
All HTML5. From your mobile

2512
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,500
Device to your desktop. No

2513
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,500
Flash required. You know you love that.

2514
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,500
You can transfer devices

2515
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:07,500
Between clients. So if you want to make something for somebody

2516
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,500
And sell it to them. You can.

2517
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,500
They have the best tutorials on the web.

2518
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:13,500
I'm sorry Arch Wiki.

2519
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,500
Fact of the matter is. Digital

2520
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,500
Ocean has you beat. Ah you're a good

2521
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,500
Number 2 Arch Wiki. And

2522
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,500
Gentoo. Yeah you're number 3.

2523
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,500
But the Digital Ocean

2524
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,500
The Digital Ocean documentation is so good

2525
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,500
Because they're actually willing to pay people to write that

2526
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,500
Stuff. And they actually have open

2527
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,500
Positions right now for technical

2528
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,500
Writers. That way.

2529
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,500
It's all about. You can get started. You can do one

2530
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,500
Application deployment. Sure yeah you can deploy Ruby on

2531
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,500
Rails. Wordpress. Ghost with one

2532
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:41,500
Click. That's pretty cool.

2533
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:43,500
But you might run into a wall.

2534
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,500
And you might decide. Well okay I've done this

2535
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,500
But now I'm not getting anything out of

2536
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,500
This.

2537
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,500
That's where this really

2538
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,500
Really good tutorials kick in.

2539
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,500
And you can get a little more out of Digital Ocean. Go to DigitalOcean.com

2540
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,500
Right now. DigitalOcean.com

2541
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,500
And use the promo code DO

2542
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,500
Unplugged. It's all one word. Lowercase.

2543
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,500
You'll get a $10 credit. You can try out a

2544
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,500
$5 droplet. Two months for free.

2545
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,500
If you've been a long time Linux

2546
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,500
User. Maybe this is

2547
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,500
The opportunity. To

2548
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:13,500
Experiment with FreeBSD. Cause they've got those

2549
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,500
Droplets as well. Or maybe if you've been a long

2550
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,500
Time Debian user. If you've been a long time

2551
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,500
Red Hat user. Try out

2552
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,500
Core OS. It's a different approach

2553
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,500
To doing Linux.

2554
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,500
And I think it's gonna go big.

2555
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,500
DigitalOcean.com

2556
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,500
Use the promo code DO Unplugged.

2557
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,500
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for

2558
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,500
Sponsoring.

2559
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,500
Linux Unplugged Program. Alright. Now before I completely

2560
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:37,500
Die of heat suffocation in this freaking

2561
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,500
Studio. Cause it is freaking hot.

2562
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,500
It is ridiculous. I want to play Alan

2563
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,500
Hicks. Now you may have heard of Alan

2564
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,500
Hicks if you were a Slackware user before.

2565
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,500
He wrote the book on Slackware. Or he was part of it.

2566
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,500
He's been a long, long, long

2567
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,500
Time contributor to open source.

2568
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,500
And he's one of the main contributors to the Southeast

2569
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,500
Linux Fest Conference itself.

2570
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:57,500
So he sat down with Noah.

2571
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:59,500
And he talked about South. And can I give

2572
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,500
If you've been wondering, is this something I

2573
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,500
Should attend? Is this something, is this worth

2574
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,500
Me spending the money to fly out there and visit?

2575
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,500
Well, this talk might give you a little

2576
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,500
Perspective.

2577
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,500
Welcome. So Alan, tell me

2578
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,500
Tell me who you are. And

2579
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,500
And what distro you're using.

2580
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,500
Well, the distro I'm

2581
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,500
Using is obviously gonna be Slackware.

2582
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,500
That's what I've been using since about 2001

2583
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,500
When I got started. Actually 2000

2584
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,500
When I got started. But

2585
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,500
My name's Alan Hicks. I've been

2586
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,500
Working with Slackware and

2587
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:31,500
Working professionally

2588
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,500
With Linux for

2589
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,500
14, 15 years now.

2590
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,500
I'm currently a

2591
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,500
System administrator for

2592
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,500
Well, I forget what

2593
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,500
Our new name is. Cronky Sports

2594
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,500
Group or something. We recently got purchased

2595
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,500
And we're going through name changes.

2596
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,500
So I'm not sure about all that.

2597
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,500
But I've

2598
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,500
Been involved in a lot of different projects.

2599
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,500
I've been

2600
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:57,500
One of the most frequent speakers here

2601
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,500
Itself. This is actually the

2602
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,500
First year ever that I'm not gonna be speaking

2603
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,500
Presenting, doing networking

2604
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:05,500
Stuff. This is the first year that

2605
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,500
I'm just taking it easy and enjoying the conference.

2606
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,500
Yeah, yeah. You are in

2607
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,500
Relax mode this year. But even on relax mode

2608
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,500
Alan, I watched you set up tables down

2609
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,500
That way and people pull you right and left.

2610
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,500
Well, it's just

2611
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,500
The way it goes. You know, 80 percent

2612
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,500
Of the people do 80 percent of the work.

2613
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,500
I was one of those unfortunate

2614
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:25,500
20 percent when I was born.

2615
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,500
So this is what I think

2616
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:29,500
Is particularly

2617
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,500
Kind of cool about self, right? Is that

2618
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,500
We have, you and I

2619
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:35,500
We both like Linux. And we could talk about

2620
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:37,500
Linux all day long. But the reality is the

2621
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,500
Majority of the conversation that occurred last night

2622
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,500
Was about guns.

2623
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,500
Was about guns and about politics and how the world's

2624
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,500
Going to hell in a handbasket.

2625
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,500
And that is something that I

2626
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,500
Don't get at other conferences.

2627
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,500
And I think part of that is

2628
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,500
Because of the nature of the open

2629
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,500
Source community. We all want to build relationships

2630
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,500
With each other. It's not just about how can

2631
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:59,500
I make money off of this? Or how can your

2632
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:01,500
Project benefit mine? When I go, when I used

2633
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,500
To travel for work, I would

2634
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,500
Go to conferences and it would be a very typical conversation

2635
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,500
We talk about what we do. And then at the end of it

2636
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,500
It would be, well, I think our company

2637
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,500
Would really like to work with yours. I think that you could

2638
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,500
Really be an asset to us. And I think that we could

2639
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,500
Really be an asset to you. And if you put me in touch with

2640
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:17,500
Your PR people, I could put you in touch with my

2641
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,500
Secretary. You know, that kind of nonsense.

2642
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,500
And that's not the kind of environment

2643
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:23,500
I see here.

2644
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:25,500
Yeah, and I've never really liked those kinds

2645
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:27,500
Of environments. This is really the

2646
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,500
Only conference I ever attend each year.

2647
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,500
And I've only been to one or

2648
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:33,500
Two others and they were in

2649
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,500
South Paulo, Brazil for a

2650
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,500
Slackware conference many years ago.

2651
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,500
And I don't

2652
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:41,500
Really go for the whole

2653
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:43,500
Corporate networking thing.

2654
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,500
That's just not me.

2655
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,500
I'm not big

2656
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,500
On that. I don't enjoy that aspect.

2657
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,500
I like a one

2658
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,500
On one relationship with a person.

2659
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,500
Rather than a business

2660
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,500
To business relationship. And

2661
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,500
While there's plenty of businesses here

2662
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,500
Who have their wares,

2663
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,500
Their offerings and stuff

2664
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,500
On display and will, you know,

2665
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:07,500
Happily work with you. Self is

2666
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,500
Really geared towards that

2667
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,500
One on one relationship person to person.

2668
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,500
Yeah, and my experience has been the same.

2669
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,500
And it's not that I particularly enjoy

2670
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,500
Corporate networking.

2671
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,500
I just sometimes feel like I don't have much of a choice.

2672
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,500
Because if I want to provide

2673
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:23,500
A competitive advantage to my clients,

2674
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:25,500
Then what that forces me to do sometimes

2675
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,500
Is to become,

2676
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:29,500
I have to become knowledgeable and I have to

2677
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,500
Work with those people. And a lot of

2678
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,500
Those companies, the way that they want to do business

2679
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,500
Is they have it all

2680
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,500
Situated. They have everything

2681
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,500
Kind of set out the way that they want you to follow a

2682
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:41,500
Process. And then

2683
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:43,500
Deviate from it. And you're exactly right.

2684
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,500
When you want to talk to, you have a problem with a

2685
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:47,500
SQL database, you can go find the guy that did SQLite.

2686
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,500
You have a problem with Red Hat. I can go talk to Red Hat

2687
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,500
Right there. There's a guy right there from Red Hat.

2688
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,500
If I wanted to talk about Slackware,

2689
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,500
I'll ask the guy that wrote the book.

2690
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,500
And you'll tell me about Slackware.

2691
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,500
Yeah.

2692
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,500
That's what I love about these conferences, you guys.

2693
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,500
Is, you know,

2694
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,500
I sat down at lunch and had a barbecued

2695
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,500
Salmon with the guy that wrote my SQL.

2696
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,500
And that's

2697
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,500
Different. It's different. It's an experience.

2698
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,500
And so, Southeast

2699
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:15,500
I gotta go next year.

2700
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,500
I gotta go to that. It's a really

2701
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,500
Cool experience. And thank you to Alan Hicks

2702
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,500
And thank you to Brian for stopping by and chatting

2703
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,500
With Noah. And

2704
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,500
I can't go forward without saying a huge

2705
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,500
Thank you to Noah

2706
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:29,500
For all of his crazy

2707
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,500
Hard work.

2708
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,500
Only I know how hard he worked

2709
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,500
And I really

2710
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,500
Really, really, really, really, really

2711
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,500
Appreciate it. He is awesome.

2712
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,500
Now, one of the other guys

2713
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,500
That's awesome is producer Q5 Sis

2714
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,500
And he had a talk itself

2715
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,500
That I think might be right up your alley.

2716
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,500
He talked about creating

2717
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,500
Your own Linux laptop.

2718
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,500
Building your own Linux laptop.

2719
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,500
This is an hour and

2720
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,500
Five minute talk. I can't play for it.

2721
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:59,500
I cannot. I'm sorry.

2722
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:01,500
I cannot do it. But I wanted to

2723
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,500
I went in about six minutes

2724
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:05,500
Into his talk. I have the whole thing linked

2725
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,500
In the show notes. Really, if you've ever

2726
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:09,500
Wanted about building your own laptop, now

2727
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:11,500
Is a better time than ever.

2728
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:13,500
I jumped in about six minutes

2729
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:15,500
Where he talks about batteries. So you want to get a

2730
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,500
Board that's going to be power efficient and

2731
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:19,500
Still be able to accomplish the tasks

2732
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,500
That you're going to want to accomplish.

2733
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,500
As for

2734
01:45:23,500 --> 01:45:25,500
The screen, who's heard of Adafruit?

2735
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,500
I love this.

2736
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:29,500
If anyone that has their hands

2737
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:31,500
Up, is anyone next to

2738
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:33,500
Them that is a friend of them that doesn't have their hand up?

2739
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:35,500
This is

2740
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,500
This question right here is Mr. Q5

2741
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:39,500
Sis. Producer Q5 Sis.

2742
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,500
Perfect. This is what it's like

2743
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,500
To work with Mr. Q5 Sis.

2744
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:45,500
He's so great because he

2745
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,500
Once he researches something

2746
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:49,500
Once he understands something

2747
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,500
He evangelizes it.

2748
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:53,500
Don't we all do that? And he's so great

2749
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:55,500
About that. Not your friends.

2750
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,500
I want to back up a little bit. I want to play a little bit of this

2751
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:59,500
For you. I want to back up.

2752
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,500
Hold on. I want to play a little bit of him talking about this for you.

2753
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:03,500
So you can find the whole talk.

2754
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,500
And there is a couple of minutes where you might

2755
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,500
Have some audio issues. Do not worry about that.

2756
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,500
There was a little bit of YouTube issues.

2757
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:11,500
I think top 2 needed enhancement.

2758
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,500
Oh there we go.

2759
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:15,500
So he

2760
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:17,500
Notes to me here that there's a couple of minutes where

2761
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,500
YouTube didn't quite capture the Hangouts audio.

2762
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:21,500
So if you listen to the

2763
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,500
I have a link to the show notes. Mr. Q5 Sis

2764
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,500
Talks about battery issues.

2765
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,500
3D printing your own laptop.

2766
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:29,500
Building it around a Raspberry Pi.

2767
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,500
All of those topics are in his talk.

2768
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,500
And I have it linked in the show notes.

2769
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:35,500
It's over an hour so I can't play the whole thing.

2770
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:37,500
But I really recommend you check it out.

2771
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:39,500
And it is also like Micro 89 points out

2772
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,500
Available in the Linux Action Show subreddit.

2773
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:43,500
Oh yes. The Linux Action Show subreddit.

2774
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:45,500
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com

2775
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,500
Make. This. Show. Better.

2776
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:49,500
You weren't happy?

2777
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:51,500
What? What?

2778
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,500
We didn't do it? What?

2779
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,500
You weren't happy?

2780
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,500
Okay. I'll take that.

2781
01:46:57,500 --> 01:46:59,500
Submit a bug. Linuxactionshow.reddit.com

2782
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:01,500
Make it better. Seriously.

2783
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,500
I listen to the community over there.

2784
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:05,500
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com. Go check it out.

2785
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,500
I will also, by the way, we'll have a feedback thread

2786
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,500
For this episode.

2787
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,500
I am trying to figure out what all of you

2788
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,500
Are doing in response to the last pass.

2789
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,500
What are you doing? What is your response

2790
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,500
To last pass? Let me know. Linuxactionshow.reddit.com

2791
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,500
Go find the feedback thread

2792
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,500
For episode 96

2793
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:23,500
Of the Linux Unplugged program.

2794
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,500
And let me know. Are you going to switch

2795
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,500
To key paths?

2796
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:29,500
I want to know. The anime says he's doing nothing.

2797
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:31,500
Hmm. Okay.

2798
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,500
Alright. I'll take that as well.

2799
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,500
Go over there and let me know what your plans are

2800
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,500
For this and other things.

2802
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,500
And also, if you want to

Hook up with us at a

2808
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,500
I was planning to do episode 100

2809
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,500
In Seattle, but now...

2810
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,500
Now I think I might

01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,500

In the IRC right now,

2846
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:39,500
Kids and Kitty, you've submitted

2847
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,500
a straw poll.

2848
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,500
I won't steal your thunder. What is it about?

2849
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,500
Go ahead.

2850
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:47,500
Kids and Kitty.

2851
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,500
Go ahead.

2852
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,500
I don't hear you.

2853
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:53,500
Are you muted? Still having trouble with that mic, kid?

2854
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,500
So, Kids and Kitty

2855
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,500
asked the live stream, will you be migrating

2856
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:59,500
away from LastPass? And it's just a simple

2857
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,500
yes or no question.

2858
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,500
And I'm going to vote no right now.

2859
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:05,500
But I'm curious.

2860
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:07,500
Ooh, it's split. It's literally split right now.

2861
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,500
50-50. 50-50 in the live stream.

2862
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,500
Ooh, wow.

2863
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:13,500
Wow, you guys. Really?

2864
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,500
Should've had third options

2865
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,500
because I'm using KeyPass

2866
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,500
and there's no option for that.

2867
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,500
No, no, no. Because that's a no.

2868
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:23,500
If you're going to KeyPass, that's a clear no.

2869
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,500
No, I like this. Two options is good.

2870
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:27,500
It's good.

2871
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:29,500
I specifically did that

2872
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:31,500
intentionally because the

2873
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,500
question is, would

2874
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:35,500
you move away? Right.

2875
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:37,500
So, it's irrelevant whether or not

2876
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:39,500
you have LastPass now

2877
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:41,500
per se, as

2878
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,500
if you were using it, would

2879
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,500
you move away?

2880
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,500
Are we going to be talking about Fedora again?

2881
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,500
No, I think we're all done. Why? Do you have something to say?

2882
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,500
I just tried it out this week.

2883
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,500
It's awesome.

2884
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,500
Should've tried it out last week.

2885
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,500
I'm sold.

2886
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,500
I'm sold. I wiped the

2887
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,500
SUSE partition

2888
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:03,500
after I used it

2889
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:05,500
for a few days.

2890
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:07,500
Whoa.

2891
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,500
So, you're like switching?

2892
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,500
You're that sold?

2893
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:13,500
I am that sold and I'm a hard

2894
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,500
sell from SUSE.

2895
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:17,500
Okay, all right. What is the big

2896
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,500
diff? Because at the end of the day, they're both

2897
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,500
RPM distros.

2898
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:23,500
One's got the build service. One's got

2899
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,500
copper. What?

2900
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:27,500
What's the big difference?

2901
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,500
You know what sold me was the fact that

2902
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:31,500
everything was just so consistent.

2903
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:33,500
I didn't have to, pardon the language,

2904
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:35,500
dick around with four

2905
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:37,500
different software managers

2906
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:39,500
to do what I wanted to do.

2907
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,500
I could go into software or I go into

2908
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:43,500
DNF. Oh, yeah. It is a bit of a

2909
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:45,500
it's a little

2910
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,500
I sometimes feel like OpenSUSE is a little

2911
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:49,500
bipolar. It's a little

2912
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:51,500
chaotic in that sense. There's a lot of

2913
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:53,500
different tools available to you. And that honestly

2914
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,500
maybe is my bias of all the transitions they've

2915
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:57,500
done with their package manager. But when I sit down

2916
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:59,500
to use it, I feel like

2917
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,500
there's a lot of places I go to manage sources

2918
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,500
and I just

2919
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,500
but I felt like with Fedora,

2920
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,500
okay, I've got DNF repos and

2921
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,500
I've got GNOME software. Boom, boom. I can use

2922
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:11,500
it on the command line or I use it in the GUI. Is that how you

2923
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,500
felt?

2924
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,500
Largely. And the other thing

2925
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,500
is that I noticed is every

2926
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,500
time I wanted to do something with

2927
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,500
this installing software

2928
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:23,500
at one point, it wanted to

2929
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,500
drag a bunch

2930
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,500
of packages in

2931
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:29,500
because they were part of the

2932
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:31,500
meta package that I had installed.

2933
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,500
So I had to taboo those

2934
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,500
in Yast. And they would

2935
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,500
still want to install.

2936
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:39,500
And heaven forbid, you have to do any kind of

2937
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:41,500
conflict resolution

2938
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,500
through Yast. That's

2939
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:45,500
where it kind of gets hairy because

2940
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,500
I feel like when I have to do

2941
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,500
conflict resolution for RPMs and dependencies

2942
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,500
and because the meta package

2943
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,500
wants to be able to replace a package that another

2944
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,500
meta package wants, all of a

2945
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,500
sudden I feel like I'm back in like 2006,

2946
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:59,500
2004

2947
01:52:59,500 --> 01:53:01,500
Linux. And

2948
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:03,500
I kind of just start shutting

2949
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:05,500
down and I think my time could be

2950
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:07,500
spent better than this.

2951
01:53:07,500 --> 01:53:09,500
But, okay, come on chatroom.

2952
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,500
Come on. Strawpoll.me.

2953
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,500
Strawpoll.me.

2954
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,500
Oh, I'm, alright, well

2955
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,500
see

2956
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,500
the problem is like 40

2957
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:21,500
to 50% of the people are not even in the

2958
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:23,500
chatroom. So I've got to give it to them over air.

2959
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:25,500
The strawpoll URL sucks, but it's

2960
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:27,500
strawpoll.me slash 46

2961
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:29,500
53

2962
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:31,500
78

2963
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:33,500
strawpoll.me

2964
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:35,500
slash 46

2965
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,500
53

2966
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:39,500
782.

2967
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,500
And there's a link in the chatroom.

2968
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:43,500
We have 19 votes

2969
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:45,500
right now. 20 votes.

2970
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,500
I just can't see moving away from

2971
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,500
last pass. It seems too practical to me.

2972
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,500
But I, at the same time,

2973
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:53,500
like part of me recognizes they are a

2974
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:55,500
huge, huge, huge

2975
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,500
target.

2976
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,500
On another

2977
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,500
note, I kind of wish that Colonel

2978
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:03,500
Linux would have been here to join us

2979
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:05,500
because I wanted to

2980
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,500
ask him if he ever saw anybody

2981
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:09,500
show up the self

2982
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,500
in full leather bondage gear.

2983
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:13,500
Confused. Okay, alright, okay,

2984
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:15,500
alright, okay. So

2985
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,500
going on at the same time of

2986
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,500
Southeast Linux Fest is the southern

2987
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:21,500
I don't even know the whole acronym, but it's like

2988
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,500
Southeast Leather Fest

2989
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:25,500
and it's a leather

2990
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,500
fest. And

2991
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,500
last year, if you searched Twitter for

2992
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:31,500
self, you got pictures of

2993
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,500
65 year old ladies in leather.

2994
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:35,500
Now, this year

2995
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:37,500
they coordinated and self had

2996
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:39,500
there was self and then

2997
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:41,500
there was the Southeast Leather Fest and they had their own

2998
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,500
hashtag separate from self.

2999
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:45,500
But no, Noah

3000
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,500
very, very much so. I believe

3001
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,500
I'm not positive. I think

3002
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,500
he's in Amsterdam right now.

3003
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,500
So what Noah does is

3004
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:55,500
Noah works at like

3005
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,500
300-400 percent

3006
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:59,500
and I'm not exaggerating. I've never known

3007
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,500
anybody who's ever worked

3008
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:03,500
harder in his life. I don't

3009
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:05,500
know how his wife and

3010
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:07,500
his kids accommodated,

3011
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,500
but nobody works harder than Noah.

3012
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,500
And so he goes out to these conferences

3013
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,500
and then he's hooking up with a

3014
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,500
buddy of his and I think he's in Amsterdam

3015
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:17,500
right now. So he goes out

3016
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,500
and he just totally goes all in

3017
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:21,500
on these conferences.

3018
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:23,500
And then I think right now he's like

3019
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:25,500
on his way home, on his way

3020
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:27,500
home from self, he's stopping by

3021
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:29,500
Amsterdam and he's having a party with his buddy

3022
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:31,500
and then he's going to go home.

3023
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,500
And then he'll be back by Friday so that way we can

3024
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,500
do the Linux action show.

3025
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,500
That's pretty crazy. But I think that's

3026
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:39,500
how he rolls so that's why he couldn't join us today.

3027
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:41,500
Swift,

3028
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:43,500
I'm okay. I'm a little stressed out.

3029
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,500
Yeah, it has been very difficult

3030
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:53,500
to make all of this happen centrally

3031
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:55,500
and it has been very hard

3032
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,500
to watch all of it happen remotely, if

3033
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,500
that makes sense. So it has been very

3034
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,500
hard technically to pull it all off

3035
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,500
because Jupyter Broadcasting has grown

3036
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,500
and so we have

3037
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,500
Roku devices and

3038
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,500
Tivo's and audio

3039
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:11,500
streams and web browsers

3040
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:13,500
and VLC that when you

3041
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:15,500
think you can tune in live and watch,

3042
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:17,500
you think you can go to your Roku app or you

3043
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,500
think you can go to the Kodi app

3044
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,500
or whatever, XBMC app, whatever,

3045
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:23,500
and just watch live. It takes

3046
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,500
a crazy amount of coordination

3047
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,500
behind the scenes to actually deliver content

3048
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:29,500
at all of those endpoints.

3049
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:31,500
And thankfully Rekai and I

3050
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,500
really, Rekai managed

3051
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:35,500
to pull it all off, but it was very stressful.

3052
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:37,500
And it was also stressful because

3053
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:39,500
I wasn't there. I really wanted to be

3054
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:41,500
there. But otherwise, I'm okay.

3055
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:43,500
I'm good. I'm very happy.

3056
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,500
I think Noah is an incredible

3057
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,500
asset. So I'm very good

3058
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,500
about that. And Rekai has been amazing.

3059
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,500
So everybody say thank you to Rekai

3060
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,500
for how hard he worked this weekend.

3061
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:55,500
We don't pay him to work over the weekend and

3062
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:57,500
yet he did. And

3063
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:59,500
he made it possible for us

3064
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:01,500
to stream the content from self-live

3065
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,500
to all of the endpoint destinations.

3066
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,500
The beard made it all

3067
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:07,500
happen. So thank you to Rekai.

3068
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:09,500
And as

3069
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,500
all things, our poll is

3070
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:13,500
completely split down the middle. If you're a long time listener

3071
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,500
or a viewer, you know,

3072
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:17,500
everything, every freaking

3073
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:19,500
poll, every

3074
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,500
time, goes 50-50. You know

3075
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:23,500
what this happens if you've been

3076
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:25,500
listening. You know this if you've been

3077
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,500
following for awhile.

3078
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:29,500
16 votes say...

3079
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:31,500
This is so ridiculous.

3080
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:33,500
I can't even...

3081
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:35,500
Okay. We've had

3082
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:37,500
31 votes from the live stream.

3083
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:39,500
This is incredible.

3084
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,500
I didn't

3085
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:43,500
expect anything less.

3086
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:45,500
16 people will move away from

3087
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:47,500
LastPass and 16 people will not.

3088
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:49,500
It's

3089
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:51,500
literally split right

3090
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,500
down the middle. You guys

3091
01:57:53,500 --> 01:57:55,500
are such sons of bitches. You are

3092
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,500
so hard to please because you are

3093
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,500
literally split on every single

3094
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:01,500
topic. And you know if you've been watching

3095
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,500
for awhile, you know this is true.

3096
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:05,500
You know I always run into this.

3097
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:07,500
You are so hard. I

3098
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,500
love you though. I love you.

3099
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:11,500
Chris, um,

3100
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:13,500
blue bricks or red curtains?

3101
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,500
I'm sorry.

3102
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:25,500
Well, last week it was blue bricks and the week before that it was red curtains, obviously.
