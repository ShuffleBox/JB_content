WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
Hey, Wes, I heard you pulled your first all-nighter of the year.

00:03.040 --> 00:03.920
How's that going?

00:03.920 --> 00:06.640
Yeah, I think it's something of a milestone.

00:06.640 --> 00:10.080
I mean, it is probably the first time I've seen dawn in a while.

00:10.080 --> 00:13.200
But that's like a silver lining, I think.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.400
Wow, what happened?

00:14.400 --> 00:16.880
Well, sometimes you have a lot of work on your plate.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.080
Sometimes you're really in the zone.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.960
And you just want to finish your task.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.120
You want to make sure things are working so that you

00:23.120 --> 00:25.960
can have some consistent bedtime.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.680
I see.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.440
So I used to do this when I was in my 20s.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.200
And if I were to do it today, it would

00:32.200 --> 00:34.640
be like I had gone out drinking all night the next morning.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.360
I would feel rough.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.680
Yeah, it's been a long time.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.560
This was my first all-nighter in a while.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.280
And that's how I know I'm definitely getting there.

00:43.280 --> 00:55.400
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.400
My name is Chris.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.400
My name is Wes.

00:57.400 --> 00:58.520
And my name is Brent.

00:58.520 --> 00:59.720
Hello, gentlemen.

00:59.720 --> 01:03.520
It is going to be a really fun episode this week.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.640
Coming up on the show, we're going to talk about a Linux

01:05.640 --> 01:09.280
superpower that we've overlooked these days.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.380
It's something that snuck up on us.

01:11.380 --> 01:13.200
And now we take it for granted.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.080
And it wasn't always a trick that Linux had.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.360
It's the live session.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.660
They're amazing.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.600
And there's something that the Windows and the Mac don't really offer.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.860
So this week, we're going to chat a little bit

01:21.860 --> 01:24.840
about the history of the live session, how it came to be.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.560
And then we're going to share a few times.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.720
And hopefully, our mumble will have a few times that it totally saved our bacon to have

01:29.720 --> 01:30.720
a live session.

01:30.720 --> 01:31.720
Oh, yeah.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.960
That's definitely a thing.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.800
So before we go any further, let's say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.800
Hello, mumble room.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.800
Hello, hello.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.800
Hello, hello.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.800
Hello, Chris.

01:41.800 --> 01:42.800
Hello, Wes.

01:42.800 --> 01:43.800
And hello, Brent.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
Namaste.

01:44.800 --> 01:49.880
And then today, we have a real special episode, I guess, because we have a meetup happening

01:49.880 --> 01:50.880
here at the studio.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.000
So everybody out in the living room, say hello, time-appropriate greetings to the living

01:54.000 --> 01:56.840
room.

01:56.840 --> 01:58.840
Hello.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.480
Amazing.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.480
Nicely done, everybody.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.480
Yeah.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.480
We have the meetup happening right here.

02:03.480 --> 02:05.120
We're going to do a little podcast thing.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.260
I don't know if you heard of it.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.620
And then after this, we're going to all eat.

02:07.620 --> 02:11.400
So if you hear a bunch of noise and ruckus in the background, that's because we've got

02:11.400 --> 02:15.560
a living room full of folks that are talking and enjoying themselves some cookies and snacks.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.760
As they should be.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.460
Maybe a few of them are having some bruskies.

02:18.460 --> 02:23.960
And we even have some stashed champagne that Brent thought I had before he left for Canada.

02:23.960 --> 02:24.960
Yeah.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.760
I want to be part of the show, part of the experience.

02:27.760 --> 02:28.920
But I knew I couldn't be there in person.

02:28.920 --> 02:31.640
So I thought, I'm going to hide some stuff around the studio and tell you about it in

02:31.640 --> 02:33.280
very calculated moments.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.280
So there you go.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.280
Nice.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.280
Well, thank you.

02:36.280 --> 02:40.360
So we have Wes and I have some champagne to celebrate the occasion.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.920
The folks out in the living room have got a TV and a speaker going so they can hear

02:42.920 --> 02:43.920
the show.

02:43.920 --> 02:44.920
It's one big happy family over here.

02:44.920 --> 02:45.920
It is.

02:45.920 --> 02:46.920
It is.

02:46.920 --> 02:51.920
So we were kind of talking as a group off air about different Linux installers and how

02:51.920 --> 02:57.480
only a few of them now, like SUSE, offer the ability to just boot right into an installer.

02:57.480 --> 03:02.280
Most Linux distros these days, they boot right into a live desktop session and you get to

03:02.280 --> 03:04.160
try the whole desktop out.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.280
You get to see if your hardware is supported.

03:06.280 --> 03:09.960
And then sometimes they'll auto start an installer or sometimes they'll have like an icon on

03:09.960 --> 03:10.960
the desktop.

03:10.960 --> 03:11.960
And this has just kind of become the norm.

03:11.960 --> 03:12.960
Yeah.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.960
Yeah, definitely.

03:13.960 --> 03:14.960
Every day.

03:14.960 --> 03:15.960
Linux experience now.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.160
You kind of, sometimes you even have to get a separate, like just installer ISO if you

03:18.160 --> 03:19.640
even want that functionality.

03:19.640 --> 03:22.920
And it wasn't always this way, Wes, no.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.200
In fact, that was not the norm at all.

03:26.200 --> 03:30.940
The way it used to be is you'd get a Linux installer CD, it'd do some sort of hardware

03:30.940 --> 03:36.740
detection dance and it'd boot up into a minimal X environment that sometimes you even had

03:36.740 --> 03:40.280
to configure before it could start and then you would just go through the installer.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.280
Say it ain't so.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.280
It is so.

03:42.280 --> 03:47.300
And I don't really necessarily mind that experience, but it didn't give you an opportunity to find

03:47.300 --> 03:52.200
out if everything that you had on your machine was supported by Linux.

03:52.200 --> 03:56.580
And that was especially back in the day, one of the gotchas, you install Linux and discover

03:56.580 --> 04:00.880
your modem doesn't work or your wifi doesn't work or your sound card doesn't work.

04:00.880 --> 04:01.880
It was a problem.

04:01.880 --> 04:02.880
Yeah, right.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.420
One of those things you find out only after you've gone through the full install, you've

04:05.420 --> 04:10.440
rebooted, hopefully you've even got, you know, grub or lilo working, right?

04:10.440 --> 04:11.440
Yeah.

04:11.440 --> 04:16.800
So the idea of a live CD really was something unique and it was indeed a CD.

04:16.800 --> 04:20.760
We called them live CDs and they were very, very slow.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.120
And you to make all this work, you had to have stacks of blank CDs.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.640
Well, we all did at that time.

04:25.640 --> 04:30.200
Yeah, I get like the Costco tower, you know, and I'd have like a whole bunch of like TDK.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.960
Then hopefully you have like a spindle you've already used.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.360
You kind of got like a queue system.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.480
You load up on the new spindle.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.480
Right.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.760
The older distros kind of work their way to the bottom, you know, pile of used Sharpies

04:38.760 --> 04:41.160
on the floor.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.560
Totally.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.600
And the early CD-ROMs were slow as hell too.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.040
And they got faster over time.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.160
And then like, were you taking the time to go check and verify that you burned it?

04:49.160 --> 04:50.160
No.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.160
Okay.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.160
Okay.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.160
No.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.160
Living on the edge.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.520
I also like would experiment with a bunch of different ways to burn these ISO images

04:55.520 --> 04:56.520
to a CD-ROM.

04:56.520 --> 05:01.680
I think I ultimately looking back on it, K3B was my favorite experience.

05:01.680 --> 05:02.680
Nice.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.880
Do you have any recollections of burning CD-ROMs?

05:04.880 --> 05:09.560
Because there were so many, so many options to burn CD-ROMs under Linux back in the day.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.560
Yeah.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.320
I don't know that I ever really settled on a favorite.

05:12.320 --> 05:16.440
I do remember, though, having access at the time I was working at like a computer lab

05:16.440 --> 05:19.240
and they had a big CD duplication machine.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.240
So that was pretty nice.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.960
You could put, you know, pop one in and then just give away a bunch of CDs to people.

05:23.960 --> 05:24.960
Yeah.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.680
Well, and really early on before the live Linux CD took off, there was a format war

05:29.680 --> 05:30.680
in CD-Rs.

05:30.680 --> 05:36.880
You had CD-ROMs and CD-RW and CD-RAM and there was all these different standards.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.200
And some of them you had to put the blank CD in a cartridge.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.640
I don't know if you recall these.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.640
Oh, yeah.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.800
You had a plastic cartridge and then you'd put that cartridge into the burner.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.240
Honestly, that seems like a good idea.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.960
Why are we touching these CD?

05:47.960 --> 05:48.960
It's gross.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.200
You see the fingerprints on there.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.360
So the funny thing is, that is kind of the model that a lot of the banks standardize

05:54.360 --> 05:59.960
on is so for banking and backing things up, they felt like that was the best medium for

05:59.960 --> 06:03.360
like write once and preserve forever.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.840
So because it didn't become the predominant standard, the banks would have to buy the

06:06.840 --> 06:07.840
drives.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.320
Of course, I know this because I was hooking these up.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.040
The banks would have to buy the drives at like 900 bucks a pop.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.040
Of course.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.040
And then you have to get the jewel cases.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.840
You got to get just the right format of blank CD and the whole thing.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.400
And they had crappy Windows software.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.080
There's so many crappy Windows software.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.080
Oh, yeah.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.800
Colonel's talking about Nero, the Nero ISO format.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.280
Yeah, that was definitely a staple.

06:27.280 --> 06:32.520
So this meant that you really had a hodgepodge patchwork approach to getting these CDs actually

06:32.520 --> 06:33.520
functional.

06:33.520 --> 06:38.360
It was not just as simple as DD an image to a USB or go get Etcher.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.360
Right.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.120
This is a few hurdles to even try and try this stuff out.

06:42.120 --> 06:45.360
I'm just saying to try out a distro, I had to walk uphill both ways.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.360
That's what I'm saying.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.360
OK.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.360
And I just want you to appreciate that.

06:48.360 --> 06:52.040
But you end up with a bootable CD and of course, you'd have to have a BIOS that allowed you

06:52.040 --> 06:56.240
to boot off of your CD ROM, figure out how to like go access the boot menu.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.240
Yeah.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.880
And then you'd get that going.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.720
And of course, it would be slow as hell.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.760
But we were going to sit here and kind of tell you a little bit about the history until

07:04.760 --> 07:10.920
we realized there was a big piece of this whole world that we didn't really know about.

07:10.920 --> 07:12.380
And we started looking into it.

07:12.380 --> 07:17.520
And the history of live CDs is a little more complicated than Knoppix.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.520
It turns out.

07:18.520 --> 07:19.520
Yeah.

07:19.520 --> 07:23.760
In fact, I don't know how you pronounce this first one, which I don't think is in production

07:23.760 --> 07:24.760
anymore.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.500
But it's what do you think, Wes?

07:26.500 --> 07:30.080
It's why DD or I'm sorry, why Gigi?

07:30.080 --> 07:32.240
Yggdrasil is, I believe, the most common way to say it.

07:32.240 --> 07:39.000
So English speakers typically say Yggdrasil, but it's Yggdrasil in the old Nordic way.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.180
Silent G's, right?

07:40.180 --> 07:41.180
Pretty much.

07:41.180 --> 07:42.180
I see.

07:42.180 --> 07:43.380
This one passed me by.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.600
It came out in 92, ceased production in 95.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.440
It was really alive between 92 and 93, though.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.440
That one kind of passed me by.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.480
But that's for a live CD.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.480
I know.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.820
A live environment at that time.

07:54.820 --> 07:58.560
When CDs themselves were such new technology at home.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.560
Right.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.240
Yeah, we're not talking about live floppies here.

08:01.240 --> 08:05.720
But the one that did catch my attention and made me realize something was going on was

08:05.720 --> 08:10.400
released in 1998, and it was called Demo Linux.

08:10.400 --> 08:16.120
And it was specifically designed to fit on these business card CDs that were actually

08:16.120 --> 08:17.120
turned out to be a horrible idea.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.120
But I don't know if you ever saw these, Wes.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.280
They were like cut down CD ROMs.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.400
Just big enough for like a label.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.480
And if you had like one of those CD drives where you had to insert the CD, it would jam

08:27.480 --> 08:28.480
the drive.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.480
Well, of course.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.680
And then like the small little tray and yeah.

08:31.680 --> 08:36.360
But I was at a very early Linux Fest Northwest, and there was a booth that was handing out

08:36.360 --> 08:41.160
these little business card live CDs, and it blew my mind that you could have a whole live

08:41.160 --> 08:44.000
Linux desktop environment in there.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.560
Linux Care also released a business card bootable live CD in 1999 that was focused on system

08:49.560 --> 08:50.640
administration.

08:50.640 --> 08:55.480
This is where the first kind of brand positioning as a way to rescue your system started with

08:55.480 --> 08:57.680
the Linux Care bootable business card.

08:57.680 --> 09:02.600
The idea was that you could keep it in your pocket and then rescue a system with it.

09:02.600 --> 09:10.460
And then, Phinix, released in 2000, F-I-N-N-I-X, were released before Knoppix and is still

09:10.460 --> 09:11.460
in production.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.120
Yeah, I'm running it right now in a VM.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.120
How about that?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.120
Wes is on...

09:15.120 --> 09:16.120
It supports UEFI, man.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.120
Really?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.120
Yeah.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.840
It works with Ventoy just fine.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.900
Oh, wow.

09:20.900 --> 09:25.760
So Phinix 123 was released last year, I think it was.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.000
I think that it released about a year old.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.120
Yeah, it looks like it.

09:28.120 --> 09:32.480
And they're on Discord, they're on Twitter, they're on GitHub.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.680
They have an updated website.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.400
Yeah, they've got docs over on GitHub.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.760
I mean, you don't get a graphical environment, you just get like a root shell.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.200
But if you want something simple...

09:41.200 --> 09:42.920
They're sponsored by Linode.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.560
How amazing is that?

09:45.560 --> 09:46.560
It's really great.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.560
I don't know.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.560
Did either...

09:48.560 --> 09:49.560
I know, Wes, you're running it right now.

09:49.560 --> 09:50.560
I didn't get a chance to run it.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.560
I don't know.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.560
Brent, I don't know if you had a chance to try it.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.560
I did.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.640
I was going to do the West route and just run it in a VM, but I thought that was disingenuous.

09:56.640 --> 10:02.840
So I totally, I didn't burn it to a CD, but I did put it on a USB drive and ran it on

10:02.840 --> 10:08.440
some bare metal and it's tiny, which is lovely because it was fast for me to download, but

10:08.440 --> 10:14.320
also fast for me to write it to a USB drive and it booted super fast and it was surprisingly

10:14.320 --> 10:15.320
modern.

10:15.320 --> 10:20.760
It had notes about ZFS, like if you need to work with ZFS disks, run the following beforehand

10:20.760 --> 10:22.580
and it gave you a nice command.

10:22.580 --> 10:27.780
It was super friendly for like a command line only troubleshooting OS.

10:27.780 --> 10:30.840
So I was nicely impressed actually, I would say.

10:30.840 --> 10:31.840
Yeah.

10:31.840 --> 10:37.680
There's something kind of great about a distribution that's been around since the early two thousands

10:37.680 --> 10:39.920
and they're still doing a release.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.800
They're still trying to engage with community.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.400
They're on social media.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.000
They're still doing releases.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.920
Their last release was in September of 2021.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.000
Hey, that's pretty recent.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Really for something that's been around as long as they have.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.360
I mean, I'm on too, come on.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.360
It's really neat to see that.

10:56.360 --> 11:00.000
I was pleasantly surprised, I suppose, is the phrase I'm looking for.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.640
I feel like it says a lot too about some of the stuff we like about the Linux ecosystem.

11:03.640 --> 11:04.640
Okay.

11:04.640 --> 11:09.640
Sometimes it means things feel stale or, you know, old school, but it also means that the

11:09.640 --> 11:11.960
same thing has been able to preserve.

11:11.960 --> 11:12.960
Sure.

11:12.960 --> 11:17.340
You got to catch up on stuff, system D, things like that come around, but mostly just stays

11:17.340 --> 11:18.340
the same.

11:18.340 --> 11:19.340
It keeps working.

11:19.340 --> 11:23.360
It keeps the same environment and a live environment that gives you a root shell to try to recover

11:23.360 --> 11:26.100
your system is still something that's really useful today.

11:26.100 --> 11:29.160
So then the real king of live CDs came out.

11:29.160 --> 11:33.840
The one that basically became the Kleenex of live CDs, Knopix, a Debian based Linux

11:33.840 --> 11:37.180
distribution that was released in 2003.

11:37.180 --> 11:40.640
And they really nailed the timing on this because that was right around when broadband

11:40.640 --> 11:42.680
was getting pretty widespread in the US.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.080
So you could actually pull down these ISO images.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.080
That was a new era right there.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.820
That really landed at the right time.

11:47.820 --> 11:53.040
It was named after Claus Knopper, who had like an IT business where this was a useful

11:53.040 --> 11:54.320
tool for him.

11:54.320 --> 12:00.120
And the first public release was actually in 2000, but I guess like the 1.0 that everybody

12:00.120 --> 12:02.200
used was considered 2003.

12:02.200 --> 12:06.040
The history was a little muddled there, but it looks like there was a range of betas that

12:06.040 --> 12:08.720
had been in there and then a final release.

12:08.720 --> 12:14.120
But what was so cool about Knopix was that it had this awesome wicked advanced hardware

12:14.120 --> 12:15.600
detection system.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.300
And this was back in an era where you had to pick if your kernel was going to support

12:19.300 --> 12:22.120
multiple kernels or a single kernel.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.080
And Knopix was problem solving all of that.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.500
It did exhaustive hardware detection.

12:26.500 --> 12:30.620
And then on top of that, if your system was low on memory, it was smart enough to switch

12:30.620 --> 12:34.840
between a KDE desktop or like FWM just automatically.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.320
You could also do things like load it into RAM and all that kind of stuff.

12:38.320 --> 12:43.720
It truly has like a special place in my memory because it was the one that took off like

12:43.720 --> 12:44.720
wildfire.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.640
And it just became the live CD that everybody used to try a system out.

12:48.640 --> 12:53.960
You could throw a Knopix on a CD, boot up a Windows box and try something out in demo.

12:53.960 --> 12:57.160
This is something I did just right in front of a client.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.720
And I got like the Windows system.

12:59.720 --> 13:00.720
It was their proxy server.

13:00.720 --> 13:05.680
I got it completely replaced on Knopix as a demo in like a couple of hours and didn't

13:05.680 --> 13:07.160
have to reload their Windows system.

13:07.160 --> 13:10.040
And they were just blown away by all of that.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.540
It changed the way people viewed operating systems and what you could do with them.

13:13.540 --> 13:17.480
But in a lot of ways, it's still something that people are catching up to.

13:17.480 --> 13:21.760
It strikes me as maybe an extension of what we love about using the command line on Linux

13:21.760 --> 13:27.280
is it presents this very immediate, interactive sort of invitation to play with the system

13:27.280 --> 13:29.280
where you're just like, oh, I can do anything here.

13:29.280 --> 13:33.840
I can explore and Linux especially like exposes all these things and a live environment is,

13:33.840 --> 13:38.400
you know, if you think about like a Windows installation or especially like a Mac OS experience,

13:38.400 --> 13:40.600
it's very tied to a particular thing.

13:40.600 --> 13:44.680
Setting it up as a very niche activity, exploring any of its internals or the environment that's

13:44.680 --> 13:47.960
not locked to, you know, you probably bought a computer and it came with the software.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.080
But a live environment is just like, hey, check this out.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.080
Play with me.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.080
You don't have to commit to anything.

13:53.080 --> 13:56.080
You can try out a whole new world and you reboot and it's all gone.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.640
Yeah, I gave Knopix a spin too.

13:58.640 --> 14:04.680
But one thing that I found was a stack of these DVDs that you mentioned, Chris, and

14:04.680 --> 14:06.300
I sent you guys a photo of it.

14:06.300 --> 14:14.880
And so along with my, you know, Ubuntu 12.04 and Mint 10 DVDs, I found a Knopix 6 CD and

14:14.880 --> 14:16.400
Sharpied on it said 2009.

14:16.400 --> 14:23.920
So it's pretty darn old and lucky for me, I was burning some like local DVDs over Christmas

14:23.920 --> 14:25.640
and so I had my drive handy.

14:25.640 --> 14:29.920
So I actually ended up booting off one of these CDs and do you remember the sound it

14:29.920 --> 14:32.320
makes when you're booting off one of these?

14:32.320 --> 14:33.320
It was so nostalgic.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.120
You mean the drive?

14:35.120 --> 14:39.140
The drive just kind of working away and, you know, every once in a while some text would

14:39.140 --> 14:41.580
come up on your screen and let you know that things were happening.

14:41.580 --> 14:47.360
It was, yeah, I just got a giant smile from just that like auditory experience of booting

14:47.360 --> 14:48.360
this thing.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.360
It was lovely.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.360
Yeah, it really is funny because I have a machine right now that I'm using again and

14:52.360 --> 14:56.440
you know this Brent, it has a floppy drive and so to hear that floppy drive get accessed

14:56.440 --> 14:57.440
from time to time.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.440
Yeah.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.440
It's very nostalgic sounding.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.660
What was your impression, though, of the overall Knopix experience?

15:02.660 --> 15:04.120
Is it starting to feel kind of old?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.120
Did it hold up?

15:05.120 --> 15:09.920
Well, that's why I wanted to run both this CD version that I found, you know, buried

15:09.920 --> 15:14.080
away in my stuff, but I also ran the newest version that just came out, it looks like

15:14.080 --> 15:19.220
a few days ago, January 25th, and there was a big contrast, actually.

15:19.220 --> 15:23.440
The old one, obviously, it was running Compiz and stuff, so it had OpenOffice installed

15:23.440 --> 15:30.640
and Iceweasel and so it felt kind of aged, but the new Knopix I was pleasantly surprised

15:30.640 --> 15:31.640
by.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.640
It felt modern.

15:32.640 --> 15:37.640
I mean, they had some, still had some wonderful ASCII art when it booted up, which was nice.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.240
Yeah, really, a nice little terminal experience there.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.240
Yeah.

15:41.240 --> 15:45.680
It also had a little audio byte that said, initiating startup sequence, which I thought

15:45.680 --> 15:46.680
was funny.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.680
That's still in there?

15:47.680 --> 15:48.680
You're kidding me.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.080
It was a different era when we like wanted sound effects from our systems.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.080
Yeah.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.460
Yeah, I used to like have like little Star Trek sounds for all the different things my

15:55.460 --> 15:56.460
computer did.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.080
That was a horrible idea.

15:58.080 --> 16:01.800
Another kind of dated feel that I thought you guys would enjoy was I noticed when I

16:01.800 --> 16:08.840
closed an app in the modern Knopix 9.1 that it still had that like window squiggle fade

16:08.840 --> 16:10.480
action going on.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.480
Wow.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.480
The classics.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.800
That's great.

16:13.800 --> 16:20.440
But then I started digging into the menu and found a bunch of really modern, cool, fun

16:20.440 --> 16:21.840
things to play with.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.480
Like for example, the first thing I saw was it had KD Connect.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.600
So I thought, okay, it's, you know, within the last five years, there's some software

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
in there.

16:28.600 --> 16:33.760
And Chris, you'll like this, it had the Electrum Bitcoin wallet listed just by default, you

16:33.760 --> 16:34.760
know, it was installed by default.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.760
That's kind of random.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.760
Yeah, I know.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.440
It had Tor browsers and Tor proxy was ready at your fingertips.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.840
It had a DAW simulator on there.

16:42.840 --> 16:49.680
But it also had a bunch of options to restart Knopix, either in Docker or a Chirrut or to

16:49.680 --> 16:50.680
run it in KVM.

16:50.680 --> 16:57.760
It had a bunch of these like fun little, I guess, scripts to just sort of get you interested,

16:57.760 --> 16:58.760
which I really enjoyed.

16:58.760 --> 17:02.680
Yeah, I mean, it comes from such a different, it's like the middle era now where you can

17:02.680 --> 17:08.240
get the whole 4.3 gig DVD version, which it's that era of, well, you might not have a network

17:08.240 --> 17:09.240
connection, right?

17:09.240 --> 17:12.600
Or you have one sometimes, and so you want to download the whole world.

17:12.600 --> 17:16.680
So you just get all kinds of different utilities baked in by default.

17:16.680 --> 17:21.100
Yeah, I agree to like the chat rooms talking about how Knopix to RAM give you like the

17:21.100 --> 17:24.000
most amazing performing computer of your time, right?

17:24.000 --> 17:27.560
Because you went from running off of a CD to running on a RAM.

17:27.560 --> 17:30.440
They even have a script still that lets you package up a mini system.

17:30.440 --> 17:34.280
It's got just LXDE and the kernel and like a bare set of sort of like it's got Chromium

17:34.280 --> 17:39.000
and a few rescue utilities, but it fits on a 700 megabyte CD, the modern version.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.020
Yeah, I mean, I would be down with running from a RAM disk all the time.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.920
That feels like that'd be a fun project is create a system that syncs your stuff to a

17:44.920 --> 17:47.440
disk and then it boots into a RAM disk all the time.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.560
Yeah, I mean, you could use snapshots.

17:50.560 --> 17:55.680
I hear one of the servers has a lot of RAM for you to play with.

17:55.680 --> 17:59.600
So I want to hear stories about, you know, live sessions saving your butt.

17:59.600 --> 18:04.480
So Mumble Room, if you've got stories about using a live CD or a live USB session to rescue

18:04.480 --> 18:09.040
data or somebody's computer or your own computer, start thinking about it now.

18:09.040 --> 18:14.040
But before we get to that, I wanted to share something that was really special for me.

18:14.040 --> 18:18.600
And this was in the early 2000s, around 2003, 2004.

18:18.600 --> 18:24.260
There was a project that built on top of Knopix and man, this was awesome for a geek who just

18:24.260 --> 18:27.840
got himself like a cluster of Linux systems, like a whole bunch of them, you know, like

18:27.840 --> 18:29.880
a hundred Linux servers.

18:29.880 --> 18:37.680
There was this remix called Cluster Knopix, and it was exactly what it sounds.

18:37.680 --> 18:42.960
It used OpenMozix, which had a special kernel, and you could boot up one of them.

18:42.960 --> 18:47.200
You just boot up this Cluster Knopix and you'd say you're the server.

18:47.200 --> 18:52.360
And then it would fire up a DHCP server and a TFTP server, and then you'd boot the other

18:52.360 --> 18:58.080
systems with Cluster Knopix and say you're a client, and they would use TFTP and DHCP

18:58.080 --> 19:04.600
and network boot to run Linux terminal services to boot up a cluster system that was all loaded

19:04.600 --> 19:08.960
off of one centralized system, and then they would share the processes load.

19:08.960 --> 19:14.480
So you could do builds across all of the systems, and they would just be one, the way the system

19:14.480 --> 19:20.320
looked at it, because that's the way the kernel patch worked, is it was all one process space

19:20.320 --> 19:22.800
across all of the systems.

19:22.800 --> 19:28.640
It was so rad, and it all used Linux terminal services project, so you could essentially

19:28.640 --> 19:34.040
have all of the systems share in the resources, and you could also use it as a desktop environment,

19:34.040 --> 19:37.280
and you'd have like this massive computer behind you.

19:37.280 --> 19:42.480
It was the neatest thing, and I really don't know if anything like that exists anymore,

19:42.480 --> 19:47.320
and it really was a lot of fun to play with, and if you want to get nostalgic, I do actually

19:47.320 --> 19:53.000
have a link to an archived version of the ISO in the show notes, because why not?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.320
Why not go back in time and play around with it?

19:55.320 --> 19:58.880
It's pretty fun.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.600
Linode.com slash unplugged.

20:00.600 --> 20:04.920
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

20:04.920 --> 20:05.920
show.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.640
Linode has been our partner since we have gone independent, and they've been around

20:08.640 --> 20:14.240
since 2003, one of the very first companies in cloud computing, and now over 18 years

20:14.240 --> 20:18.880
later they're dedicated to offering the best, and they are independent, and they remain

20:18.880 --> 20:23.960
the largest open cloud provider in the world, with 11 global data centers serving nearly

20:23.960 --> 20:24.960
a million customers.

20:24.960 --> 20:30.360
You know, we were doing some research for today's episode, looking at some of the classics

20:30.360 --> 20:35.060
in live CDs, and Linode's name came up several times.

20:35.060 --> 20:38.500
They have been such a huge supporter in the community for so long.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.040
It's kind of how I found them.

20:40.040 --> 20:44.640
I noticed, you know, there's a couple of events, and it was definitely the Texas Linux Fest

20:44.640 --> 20:50.000
one, where a couple of the booth vendors just weren't taking the event very seriously, but

20:50.000 --> 20:54.520
you could see the Linode staff was there, they had their game faces on, and they were

20:54.520 --> 20:57.600
genuinely enjoying interacting with the community.

20:57.600 --> 21:02.280
And I wasn't in the market at that time, but I thought, I'm going to remember that, and

21:02.280 --> 21:03.280
I did.

21:03.280 --> 21:10.600
And when it came time for us to build JB 3.0, and I needed really good, fast infrastructure,

21:10.600 --> 21:15.320
and I wanted the best customer support in the world, and I wanted a company who truly

21:15.320 --> 21:20.040
gets Linux, well, it was obvious then, I went with Linode.

21:20.040 --> 21:24.660
I went because they have the best in virtualized cloud computing, 30-50% cheaper than the major

21:24.660 --> 21:28.640
hyperscalers that want to lock you into their crazy, complicated platforms, and they have

21:28.640 --> 21:32.800
a bunch of great extra services in there that we've integrated in with our infrastructure.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.480
I mention the S3 compatible object storage all the time, because it's just so great,

21:36.480 --> 21:39.380
but there's small things that we take for granted, like the super fast networking between

21:39.380 --> 21:43.040
the data centers means that even if a server isn't in the same data center as one of our

21:43.040 --> 21:45.940
object storage, it doesn't matter.

21:45.940 --> 21:50.340
The connectivity is so great, because Linode is their own ISP, and they have a bunch of

21:50.340 --> 21:54.000
one-click applications if you want to just switch over from a proprietary stack that

21:54.000 --> 21:58.680
you've been paying some crazy service to, to maybe a Linode stack, like replace Zoom,

21:58.680 --> 22:00.000
or go to Nextcloud.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.320
I also just got a note from a listener who's using AdGuard centralized on Linode for his

22:04.320 --> 22:05.860
mobile devices and his home.

22:05.860 --> 22:09.580
That kind of stuff is brilliant, and when you get $100, you can really try this kind

22:09.580 --> 22:12.640
of stuff out, and it's a great way to support this podcast.

22:12.640 --> 22:17.120
Keeps us going, keeps us independent, and it lets you get some real value out of Linode.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.760
That's a great opportunity.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.600
Linode.com slash unplugged.

22:20.600 --> 22:24.960
Go there, get that $100 in 60-day credit, and you support the show.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.880
Linode.com slash unplugged.

22:27.880 --> 22:33.960
Well, besides just playing around and trying out a new Linux distro, live environments

22:33.960 --> 22:36.880
can be pretty essential for rescue and recovery.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.440
I think we've all been there.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.360
I think it might be story time.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.320
Let's turn to our chat room, Kectogen.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.320
What's your story?

22:44.320 --> 22:49.840
So I just did like, you know, some massive upgrade on my Gen 2 system, genius idea.

22:49.840 --> 22:54.920
So one of the kernel modules that was necessary for the system to boot, I didn't look through

22:54.920 --> 22:58.720
it properly, and I boot up, and it doesn't load the video driver.

22:58.720 --> 23:03.480
So I was able to load up, you know, my live USB.

23:03.480 --> 23:09.920
I loaded my live USB at short end, you know, install the alternative to the driver or whatever,

23:09.920 --> 23:12.520
do something, and then it boots.

23:12.520 --> 23:17.960
It saved my entire Gen 2 install and many hours of compiling time.

23:17.960 --> 23:21.000
That's always great, you know, like save yourself from an update going wrong.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.180
Minimac, it sounds like you helped someone else that was worried about maybe losing data.

23:25.180 --> 23:26.180
What happened?

23:26.180 --> 23:27.480
Well, I was at the dentist.

23:27.480 --> 23:31.340
It was like two or three years ago, and she was so scared.

23:31.340 --> 23:36.720
She was really scared because in the morning, the computer did not boot up and she was scared

23:36.720 --> 23:38.400
of losing data and everything.

23:38.400 --> 23:44.840
So I said, well, can I just boot a Linux installation just to check if the hard drive is okay?

23:44.840 --> 23:46.600
Normal, normal question, yeah.

23:46.600 --> 23:53.320
So I booted up an Ubuntu drive that I always have on my key, and then I was in fact able

23:53.320 --> 23:57.600
to tell her that the hard drive was okay and that it was just probably the Windows boot

23:57.600 --> 24:00.360
system that was corrupted.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.200
And she was so happy.

24:02.200 --> 24:08.640
I didn't have to pay the bill, and they called a PC doctor to get Windows back running.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.840
Sometimes that helps having a USB key just with you.

24:11.840 --> 24:16.160
Yeah, saving someone's peace of mind in that situation, but it sounds like you were helping

24:16.160 --> 24:18.040
someone after a Windows install went sideways.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.040
I've been there.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.040
I've done that.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.040
Yeah.

24:21.040 --> 24:27.160
So I've seen Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE.

24:27.160 --> 24:33.360
I even saw a Windows Server 2000 install.

24:33.360 --> 24:37.840
Why do they always get corrupted during one of those big service packs?

24:37.840 --> 24:39.600
It's like good enough.

24:39.600 --> 24:44.040
Something went wrong, rolling back, installing again, something went wrong.

24:44.040 --> 24:47.360
And suddenly they're like, okay, I have to turn off the computer.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.200
Now it won't start anymore at all.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.520
The Windows bootloader is just the most fragile thing.

24:51.520 --> 24:54.780
You change one little thing and nope, it's just going to blue screen on you.

24:54.780 --> 24:57.280
It feels like they're touching too many things during those processes.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.840
Those PCD files, it's no good.

24:58.840 --> 25:01.640
Just a lot going on there, a lot.

25:01.640 --> 25:06.560
Morgan, you've done this move as well, where you have a system, you're migrating, you don't

25:06.560 --> 25:09.880
have access to the files, you got to get file permissions changed.

25:09.880 --> 25:10.880
What happened?

25:10.880 --> 25:15.080
Well, moving this cluster and realized after we shut it all down that we hadn't put SSH

25:15.080 --> 25:16.520
keys or anything on it.

25:16.520 --> 25:21.340
And so when we get to the data center, we plug it all in and now we have to configure

25:21.340 --> 25:24.820
its network so it can reach out back to the owner.

25:24.820 --> 25:29.560
So I just threw on, I think it was Fedora Live or something and just popped root, changed

25:29.560 --> 25:31.480
password and rocked the races.

25:31.480 --> 25:34.600
Yeah, it is great for that too.

25:34.600 --> 25:38.520
There's definitely been systems that I've borked that I've saved, or partitions that

25:38.520 --> 25:42.320
I've mounted and got the data off of when the OS has gone sideways.

25:42.320 --> 25:46.200
It's also just been always handy to have a live CD around.

25:46.200 --> 25:50.240
I don't dual boot that often, or now it's easy to have multiple hard drives or set things

25:50.240 --> 25:51.240
up.

25:51.240 --> 25:55.560
But on one hard drive with multiple partitions, and if you get Windows installed second, for

25:55.560 --> 25:58.880
whatever reason, maybe you already got, it's just always going to overwrite that bootloader

25:58.880 --> 26:02.440
and having a live CD laying around that you could just jump in, reinstall grub or boot

26:02.440 --> 26:05.400
into an existing system to do that, very handy.

26:05.400 --> 26:12.000
I don't want to go into detail for reasons that will become obvious, but I had this client

26:12.000 --> 26:16.760
and he was a lawyer and he paid top dollar to have me come out and save his XP system

26:16.760 --> 26:19.440
over and over and over again.

26:19.440 --> 26:22.000
And this went on for a few years.

26:22.000 --> 26:28.840
I think he got a new computer at one point because it got so messed up with malware and

26:28.840 --> 26:29.840
he was really a big email guy.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.640
He did everything through email and Outlook kept getting screwed up for him.

26:33.640 --> 26:39.680
And I think he ended up getting a really super high end HP workstation with a RAID 0 setup

26:39.680 --> 26:42.040
with Windows Vista at the time.

26:42.040 --> 26:46.560
And then a week or two later, it was just loaded up with malware again and there I was.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.720
I was out there cleaning it up and fixing it up.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.880
Did you have the right number of browser toolbars?

26:50.880 --> 26:51.880
Oh yeah.

26:51.880 --> 26:52.880
You need those.

26:52.880 --> 26:58.020
So something I don't know if people appreciate as much now, but back in the day, you'd basically

26:58.020 --> 27:01.680
just get owned if you went on the internet with Internet Explorer.

27:01.680 --> 27:05.200
And that's what they would do, right, because they had these ActiveX applications that they

27:05.200 --> 27:07.520
used for like filling out legal paperwork.

27:07.520 --> 27:11.120
And so they were a shop, the User Internet Explorer, and he would go on the internet

27:11.120 --> 27:14.240
in the evenings and entertain himself.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.800
And then he would get his machine loaded up with crap and then they'd have me come out

27:17.800 --> 27:21.100
about almost once a week at one point to clean his system up.

27:21.100 --> 27:23.600
And then all of a sudden it stopped happening.

27:23.600 --> 27:27.040
And I was like, huh, this is great.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.320
Maybe he finally stopped.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.320
Maybe he's just going home.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.320
I don't know.

27:30.320 --> 27:34.600
He's just got a computer at home, quit working late at the office.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.360
I don't know.

27:36.360 --> 27:39.760
Except for one week when I came in and I walked into his office and it was booted into a live

27:39.760 --> 27:40.760
Ubuntu session.

27:40.760 --> 27:47.080
He figured out that he could boot into a live session and contain the damage, I suppose.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.760
And that's when it really struck me like, oh, yeah, I guess there's everyday use cases

27:49.760 --> 27:50.960
for this kind of stuff.

27:50.960 --> 27:55.340
I heard of people used it for like paranoid banking and back in the day, like people only

27:55.340 --> 27:57.480
manage their Bitcoin like a live session.

27:57.480 --> 27:58.480
Yeah, right.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.320
I mean, details is still a useful thing today.

28:01.320 --> 28:02.320
Yeah.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.320
Yeah.

28:03.320 --> 28:07.320
But I was like, oh, well, OK, all right, that works because I was getting really sick and

28:07.320 --> 28:10.100
tired of cleaning his system up because it'd always be right in the middle of some kind

28:10.100 --> 28:12.320
of emergency where he had something he had to do right away.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.320
Big case, you know, needed access.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.600
I'm like, get off my I didn't break your system.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.520
I didn't do this.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.800
You know, like the least you could do is cover your tracks.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.880
Gosh, it's just, you know, one of those things.

28:22.880 --> 28:26.840
So live sessions ended up being really a useful thing, even for everyday folk.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.700
I won't go into more detail than that for obvious reasons.

28:29.700 --> 28:31.180
Now we haven't heard Brent's story yet.

28:31.180 --> 28:37.160
So Brent, stay a while and listen, you ever had a live session save your bacon all the

28:37.160 --> 28:38.160
time?

28:38.160 --> 28:41.720
I will say to the point where I always travel with one and I encourage everyone, friends

28:41.720 --> 28:46.440
and family who I support to also travel with one to just tuck it away somewhere.

28:46.440 --> 28:47.440
Forget about it.

28:47.440 --> 28:50.320
But if you're traveling somewhere, that's usually when things are going to break.

28:50.320 --> 28:56.360
But the one time that comes to mind that really helped was my mother has a Lenovo Yoga.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.360
It's a 710.

28:57.360 --> 29:01.080
And that'll become a little bit interesting in a bit.

29:01.080 --> 29:04.480
She ran into an Intel microcode bug.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.800
And it took me a little while to figure it out.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.320
But she got to a point where it was like a no boot situation.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.800
And so of course, live USB is the way to do it.

29:12.800 --> 29:17.800
But it took me a few hours to kind of like really get a handle on what was going on and

29:17.800 --> 29:18.800
do a bunch of research.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.840
But the biggest challenge, and this will be hopefully a trick that someone can use.

29:22.840 --> 29:26.560
The biggest challenge with her laptop is it only has one USB port.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.560
Oh, yikes.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.440
Yeah, I've run into a few systems like this.

29:29.440 --> 29:33.080
And it's fine because you can boot into your live USB drive.

29:33.080 --> 29:37.920
But then I always love to do a full backup before I change anything, especially having

29:37.920 --> 29:40.160
to do with kernels and things like that.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.920
So how do you do that if you can't, you know, plug in another drive?

29:42.920 --> 29:46.960
It can also be tricky if you might need, say, you know, if the live environment doesn't

29:46.960 --> 29:49.920
have the right firmware or drivers, and so you don't have, you know, you might need to

29:49.920 --> 29:53.720
use the USB for if you can't get access to a built in mouse or keyboard or something.

29:53.720 --> 29:59.240
Yeah, so nice trick that I learned was to simply change the kernel parameters and add

29:59.240 --> 30:00.240
to RAM.

30:00.240 --> 30:04.440
And I think this might work with all Debian based live disks.

30:04.440 --> 30:05.960
I don't know that for sure.

30:05.960 --> 30:09.160
But that, you know, Chris alluded to it earlier that just throws everything in RAM, you can

30:09.160 --> 30:13.760
unplug the USB, that was such a help in this particular case, because then I was able to

30:13.760 --> 30:16.200
do backups and do a bunch of other stuff.

30:16.200 --> 30:23.280
But eventually, led to writing a bug report to Ubuntu for this Intel microcode.

30:23.280 --> 30:27.680
And it was like, I think only three other people had this strange bug with this particular

30:27.680 --> 30:29.580
processor on this particular yoga.

30:29.580 --> 30:34.520
So it was a weird situation, but it totally, you know, live USBs to the rescue again.

30:34.520 --> 30:35.520
Save the day.

30:35.520 --> 30:38.560
Yeah, that, that two RAM trick is pretty killer.

30:38.560 --> 30:39.560
So great.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.520
You know, you can do some fancy stuff with Ventoy to do that too.

30:41.520 --> 30:45.880
But yeah, as you say, with a lot of Debian based ISOs, like it's just built in, it's

30:45.880 --> 30:48.640
there in the init RAM FS and super handy.

30:48.640 --> 30:54.040
Either of you guys ever try to build your own, like, personal live USB or live CD?

30:54.040 --> 30:55.600
Did you ever mess with any of that kind of stuff?

30:55.600 --> 30:58.960
Yeah, I was building my own little Arch images for a while.

30:58.960 --> 30:59.960
Really?

30:59.960 --> 31:00.960
That was fun.

31:00.960 --> 31:01.960
Yeah, Arch ISO, you know, makes it, it makes it pretty easy.

31:01.960 --> 31:05.120
And then you can kind of customize things, build in your environment.

31:05.120 --> 31:09.040
I was, I was especially playing with that as I was exploring, just booting more stuff

31:09.040 --> 31:12.840
to RAM or two RAM environments, and then you could customize the init RAM FS that you bake

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
in there.

31:13.840 --> 31:14.840
So it does that.

31:14.840 --> 31:18.960
You know, I was just realizing all of my OG Bitcoin mining I did that I should have held

31:18.960 --> 31:24.400
on to now that I look back, all of that was like custom live sessions and stuff like that.

31:24.400 --> 31:28.920
You know, that I just boot up a machine that was a studio computer that was idle, not doing

31:28.920 --> 31:32.240
anything and then I would have it run that.

31:32.240 --> 31:35.920
And that would just work, you know, and then I would boot back into its regular work OS.

31:35.920 --> 31:39.400
You know, Byte was also bringing up here that you can also have live, live CDs that have

31:39.400 --> 31:42.600
persistence too, like it's still, you know, it doesn't need to take over your computer,

31:42.600 --> 31:46.880
but you with USB drives, at least you can still have that kind of environment where

31:46.880 --> 31:48.400
you don't have to throw everything away.

31:48.400 --> 31:53.360
Well, you see, you have that really super speedy little nano USB thumb drive thing that

31:53.360 --> 31:54.360
you like.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.360
What's it called?

31:55.360 --> 31:56.360
It's got some ridiculous name.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.360
Oh, supersonic rage two.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.360
Yeah, yeah.

31:58.360 --> 31:59.920
That's what you want in your USB.

31:59.920 --> 32:03.760
I mean, you could almost see like you load everything to RAM and then right as you're

32:03.760 --> 32:07.640
shutting down or whatever, it saves to that supersonic rage speed thing.

32:07.640 --> 32:09.960
And then that's your like persistent storage.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.480
I was running Windows 11 off here.

32:11.480 --> 32:13.520
It was super slow, but you know, it did work.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.000
Yeah, but I want to run it from RAM.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
What do you got?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.800
Don't you have like 64 gigs or something?

32:17.800 --> 32:18.800
It's 32 gigs in here.

32:18.800 --> 32:19.800
Yeah.

32:19.800 --> 32:20.800
Okay.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.800
You can still make it work though.

32:21.800 --> 32:22.800
Yeah, yeah.

32:22.800 --> 32:23.800
You totally could.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.120
I feel like that's something we should work on is like, wouldn't that make Air Master

32:26.120 --> 32:27.120
great?

32:27.120 --> 32:28.120
I feel like that'd be great.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.120
Air Master should be running from RAM.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.120
You're right.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.680
And that way we can install whatever crap we might want.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.680
Mm hmm.

32:32.680 --> 32:33.680
OBS.

32:33.680 --> 32:34.680
When you're running from RAM.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.360
You know, recklessly doing updates right before the show.

32:36.360 --> 32:37.360
Yeah.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.360
Not a big deal.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.360
Not a big deal, right?

32:39.360 --> 32:40.360
Hmm.

32:40.360 --> 32:44.800
You know, that's what kind of live CDs to me also highlight is that the Linux boot process,

32:44.800 --> 32:48.820
whether it's the, you know, the old bio style UEFI versions these days, whether it's all

32:48.820 --> 32:53.560
baked into one big kernel thing or you have a separate RAMFS, whatever.

32:53.560 --> 32:54.560
It's so flexible.

32:54.560 --> 32:58.100
Like, and you can, you can even just drop to a shell in your inner RAMFS and change

32:58.100 --> 33:01.480
mount points and move things around and move stuff to RAM if you want.

33:01.480 --> 33:05.920
Like it, it's just such a fun world that you can really customize pretty easily.

33:05.920 --> 33:08.720
And there's a lot of scripts these days to make it pretty simple.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.800
It's just so uniquely Linux.

33:10.800 --> 33:16.360
You can get like a live Mac rescue environment or whatever, but you can really have these

33:16.360 --> 33:20.440
custom Linux environments and it's something that we've kind of just completely forgotten

33:20.440 --> 33:23.440
is so special, but it really is a superpower.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.120
It doesn't have to be a stripped down environment.

33:25.120 --> 33:28.480
You can have it as fat as you want as long as you got the, you know, USB space for it.

33:28.480 --> 33:29.480
Go for it.

33:29.480 --> 33:34.000
I mean, I was downloading some SOOS image that was like five gigs the other night.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.760
So that's pretty big.

33:35.760 --> 33:36.760
Pretty big.

33:36.760 --> 33:40.600
And it's, it's funny because we were talking, we got down this path just by talking about

33:40.600 --> 33:44.960
different ways to install Linux and then sort of a tangential conversation.

33:44.960 --> 33:48.320
We were talking about sort of big moments in Linux's history.

33:48.320 --> 33:53.080
And as a, as kind of a side tangent, I looked up a few articles that were written that covered

33:53.080 --> 33:56.120
like massive, massive moments in Linux's history.

33:56.120 --> 34:00.600
And I didn't see any of them that listed live, live CDs and live sessions.

34:00.600 --> 34:06.440
I feel like that's a major oversight because it was such a hack to let you test your hardware

34:06.440 --> 34:09.480
compatibility back during such uncertain times.

34:09.480 --> 34:13.080
It let you before you took a leap, really try it out.

34:13.080 --> 34:17.120
And that really made it possible for so many people to adopt Linux.

34:17.120 --> 34:20.200
And it made it possible for distros to say, look, you can try it first before you, you

34:20.200 --> 34:21.200
know, before you deploy.

34:21.200 --> 34:23.880
Especially maybe, you know, you're just trying it out and you have a shared, a shared desktop

34:23.880 --> 34:26.280
you're sharing with your family or other members in the household.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.280
And like, you can't, you know, you don't have partition.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.880
You might have a 20 gig partition back in the day or something like you don't have space

34:30.880 --> 34:33.920
to separate things out, let alone do you have the skills to install it.

34:33.920 --> 34:36.920
So yeah, pretty crucial for even getting Linux at all.

34:36.920 --> 34:40.520
And now it's just how we do pretty much everything, you know, when you go to install, it's just

34:40.520 --> 34:41.520
totally how it is.

34:41.520 --> 34:45.800
And I know what kids these days, they didn't have to walk uphill both ways to install their

34:45.800 --> 34:47.160
Linux like we did.

34:47.160 --> 34:48.160
And that's good.

34:48.160 --> 34:49.160
Yeah.

34:49.160 --> 34:51.840
Now they just use a cloud workstation.

34:51.840 --> 34:55.760
Just a spot of housekeeping this week, cause you know, we got some eating to get to, but

34:55.760 --> 34:59.040
I do want to thank our members at unpluggedcore.com.

34:59.040 --> 35:03.120
You guys help us keep this show going, especially when it's just like a single sponsor show.

35:03.120 --> 35:06.320
Like you're, you're what's keeping us on the road right now.

35:06.320 --> 35:07.320
Thank you.

35:07.320 --> 35:11.440
And so as a thank you, we have two feeds, an ad free feed, totally ad free now, or the

35:11.440 --> 35:16.200
live feed that has everything we did on the pre and post show, all our screw ups, you

35:16.200 --> 35:19.240
know, when West starts cursing, that's all in there now.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.240
Sorry.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.240
You got to get fired up.

35:21.240 --> 35:24.180
So it kind of depends on what you want something longer or do you want something with all the

35:24.180 --> 35:30.680
Joe's editing techniques and fine touches, you know, that Joe Rez special it's your choice.

35:30.680 --> 35:35.040
You get a tighter show that's the Joe Rez special with no ads, or you get the long one

35:35.040 --> 35:39.960
where we screw up, we talk over each other, West is cursing, but it's also like two shows

35:39.960 --> 35:40.960
in one.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.760
It's a whole lot of other stuff going on.

35:42.760 --> 35:44.400
That's all available for our members.

35:44.400 --> 35:47.960
And also anyone who supports the whole network at Jupiter.party, if you want to support more

35:47.960 --> 35:51.560
than a couple of shows, that's probably the way to go Jupiter.party plus you got to type

35:51.560 --> 35:52.560
in that fun domain.

35:52.560 --> 35:53.560
Yeah, that's true.

35:53.560 --> 35:54.560
That's true.

35:54.560 --> 35:58.000
Shout out to those of you who have been sending us boosts with the value for value payment

35:58.000 --> 36:02.360
systems in the new podcast apps, if you don't know what I'm talking about, well, you got

36:02.360 --> 36:06.520
to go check out newpodcastapps.com because we're getting live messages from folks out

36:06.520 --> 36:09.580
there that are listening to the show as they go.

36:09.580 --> 36:10.640
It's pretty great.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.160
See somebody send in a message.

36:12.160 --> 36:16.280
We got a boost the other day because they were streaming us sats as they listen, but

36:16.280 --> 36:18.440
Linux action news was kind of short.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.720
So they sent us an extra boost to make all that.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.600
Isn't that great?

36:22.600 --> 36:23.600
It's pretty cool.

36:23.600 --> 36:27.480
It's a it's a I think it's gonna be a revolution one day we shall see.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.400
And last but not least, we'd love to have you join us.

36:29.400 --> 36:36.360
We do this show on a Sunday, set a little time aside and come hang out.

36:36.360 --> 36:41.080
Well since last week's mailbag was lost, we found it again and it was extra full.

36:41.080 --> 36:46.040
So this week, we're going to touch on a little bit of some arch feedback.

36:46.040 --> 36:50.840
Carrie writes, I wanted to offer up an alternative to your hypothesis that Linux gaming was driving

36:50.840 --> 36:51.840
arch adoption.

36:51.840 --> 36:57.400
I'm not a gamer, but I have been finding myself gravitating to Manjaro and Garuda.

36:57.400 --> 37:01.340
I've been a Windows, Mac OS and iOS user for a long time and I've always been an early

37:01.340 --> 37:06.000
adopter of new updates, I jump at a chance for new releases to have fun playing with

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
new features.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.680
I even like to beta test even though I'm not super technical.

37:10.680 --> 37:16.400
Just like your thoughts in Linux Unplugged 4.22, I feel that technology should be fun.

37:16.400 --> 37:21.460
I purchased a framework laptop last year and ran Linux exclusively on it.

37:21.460 --> 37:25.880
The only distros that worked in the beginning were the bleeding edge distros that adopted

37:25.880 --> 37:27.320
the latest kernel.

37:27.320 --> 37:33.280
This left Fedora 35 and Arch as the easiest to install solutions for quite a while.

37:33.280 --> 37:39.160
And only recently do distros like Pop OS work seamlessly, mostly due to driver support issues.

37:39.160 --> 37:42.960
Waiting for a stable release in the Ubuntu world just isn't feasible.

37:42.960 --> 37:48.480
Arch's rolling release solves the new hardware issues and allows us to play with new features.

37:48.480 --> 37:52.360
The tried and true distros like Ubuntu are slow to release updates to the kernel and

37:52.360 --> 37:56.680
desktop environment and frankly just aren't that fun, although I am happily using them

37:56.680 --> 38:01.280
for my server's VMs because of the great documentation, support and stability.

38:01.280 --> 38:05.240
I think that echoes a sentiment that I hear more and more when I talk to people in the

38:05.240 --> 38:07.080
real world.

38:07.080 --> 38:10.280
And I don't know what that necessarily means for the Ubuntu.

38:10.280 --> 38:13.360
I think this is an issue we've been kind of circling around delicately because we don't

38:13.360 --> 38:16.000
want to sound like we're dogging on Ubuntu.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.840
But there sure seems to be a trend line here that we're seeing from our audience and we're

38:18.840 --> 38:19.840
starting to see from data.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.120
And that makes me kind of uncomfortable actually.

38:22.120 --> 38:28.520
There's still a lot of momentum and there's still many folks who are maybe not Linux users

38:28.520 --> 38:30.880
but not following it as closely as we do.

38:30.880 --> 38:34.920
Let's say that Ubuntu is maybe still sort of a default, like, oh, what's that latest

38:34.920 --> 38:35.920
Ubuntu release?

38:35.920 --> 38:36.920
I'll give that a go.

38:36.920 --> 38:42.180
But if you're really following what's latest, you're interested in trying out new versions

38:42.180 --> 38:45.880
of software, new kernels, yeah, it's probably not what you're gravitating to.

38:45.880 --> 38:49.240
So I wonder too, like, we could be having a couple of trends, right?

38:49.240 --> 38:53.640
Like people that adopted Ubuntu a while ago are maybe just kind of looking for something

38:53.640 --> 38:54.640
else.

38:54.640 --> 38:59.120
At the same time, we're kind of at the peak age between LTS releases.

38:59.120 --> 39:03.880
We're just at the dawn before the next LTS where it's kind of going to be new again.

39:03.880 --> 39:08.120
And maybe get that little nice, you know, first six months, right, right.

39:08.120 --> 39:13.520
But I kind of agree, like, I also find myself gravitating towards Arch and Fedora for that

39:13.520 --> 39:15.560
fresh hardware stack.

39:15.560 --> 39:21.800
And also, legitimately, there is really good innovation and improvements landing in upstream

39:21.800 --> 39:22.800
Linux kernels.

39:22.800 --> 39:25.640
And I want that on my machine.

39:25.640 --> 39:27.840
And I've always kind of been on the fence on that.

39:27.840 --> 39:32.640
But in the last year or so, it's essentially been, if you look at the last few kernel releases

39:32.640 --> 39:37.720
for the last, I don't know, six months to a year, there's like at least one, often five

39:37.720 --> 39:41.680
things that are landing in the kernel that I'm like, oh, that's great.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.620
I've been waiting for that for years.

39:43.620 --> 39:46.840
And so it's just such a good time to have a fresh version of the kernel.

39:46.840 --> 39:51.640
Like, there are seasons where the kernel kind of slows down a little bit, but we are not

39:51.640 --> 39:53.160
in one of those seasons right now.

39:53.160 --> 39:56.600
And you don't really need to rely, I think there's also sort of a, oh, Ubuntu, you know,

39:56.600 --> 39:57.600
it's going to make things really easy.

39:57.600 --> 39:58.600
It's just going to work.

39:58.600 --> 39:59.600
It's going to be rock solid.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.600
It'll work on my hardware.

40:00.600 --> 40:01.600
They've got things out.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.600
It's very well tested.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.600
And that's all still true.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.840
But I mean, Fedora has come a huge way.

40:05.840 --> 40:08.600
There's easy to use Arch setups for you.

40:08.600 --> 40:11.940
Of course, there's various options from SUSE, like, there's just a lot of things that can

40:11.940 --> 40:14.240
work that have newer options, you know, you're not stuck.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.240
Those have all gotten better.

40:15.240 --> 40:19.560
I mean, I think it is worth mentioning, because we all know this, but we haven't said it out

40:19.560 --> 40:23.400
loud is there are use cases for having a kernel version that doesn't change.

40:23.400 --> 40:27.220
Like there, you know, we've had hardware in the past that has a driver for a specific

40:27.220 --> 40:28.360
version of the kernel.

40:28.360 --> 40:29.360
And you're sticking to that.

40:29.360 --> 40:33.920
Like there are use cases for having a system that doesn't have a bunch of updates.

40:33.920 --> 40:35.800
Maybe you've got ZFS involved.

40:35.800 --> 40:40.600
Speaking of ZFS, I think Kristen has the opposite end of this one.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.840
She says, I was just listening to the Linux Unblogged 4.42.

40:43.840 --> 40:47.160
And I found a downside of newer kernels on Ubuntu based distros.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.160
I run Pop!

40:48.160 --> 40:49.160
OS 2004.

40:49.160 --> 40:53.080
And a couple weeks ago, I tried to mess around with that ZFS, but it didn't work.

40:53.080 --> 40:58.180
Turns out there's a problem because the kernel is new, but the ZFS modules weren't updated

40:58.180 --> 41:00.480
to match.

41:00.480 --> 41:03.240
Linked is a Reddit thread that might be interesting.

41:03.240 --> 41:07.000
Of course, that Reddit post could all be wrong, she writes, but it seems plausible.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.960
For all I know, the problem could be fixed now.

41:08.960 --> 41:13.800
One of the shows, by the way, best, Kristen McDuffie, former assistant district attorney

41:13.800 --> 41:14.800
of New York City.

41:14.800 --> 41:15.800
P.S.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.960
I've been messing around with mini computers lately.

41:17.960 --> 41:18.960
They're fun.

41:18.960 --> 41:19.960
What a daredevil.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.000
What do you guys think?

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
I totally agree.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.320
Mini computers are a lot of fun.

41:25.320 --> 41:26.320
That's awesome.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.320
I'm glad that she added that.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.320
Yeah.

41:28.320 --> 41:32.100
Boy, she just really kind of illustrated the point that I just roughly attempted to make.

41:32.100 --> 41:33.960
And that's a great, you know, that really is true.

41:33.960 --> 41:36.440
And I wanted to acknowledge that on the show, too.

41:36.440 --> 41:41.680
It's like, yeah, there are use cases like ZFS or hardware where if you're getting updates

41:41.680 --> 41:42.960
all the time, things are going to break.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.360
And when you're in production, you ain't got no appetites for that.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.360
Right.

41:46.360 --> 41:48.440
And it may require that you learn about those things.

41:48.440 --> 41:52.440
And not all computer users really have to want to have to care about that kind of thing.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.440
And that's fair.

41:53.440 --> 41:58.160
And the other thing we have is we kind of have the advantage of kind of trending our

41:58.160 --> 42:02.080
systems towards working in this environment, right?

42:02.080 --> 42:05.020
It's not something that we're just now figuring out we want to do.

42:05.020 --> 42:07.160
We know we like these modern components.

42:07.160 --> 42:10.520
And so we've built our systems in a way now for a while.

42:10.520 --> 42:11.520
So they work with that stuff.

42:11.520 --> 42:14.880
We're not trying to take an LTS workflow and use it on a rolling.

42:14.880 --> 42:15.880
Right.

42:15.880 --> 42:19.240
And we're now we're even even like when we look for hardware, we're looking for hardware

42:19.240 --> 42:21.240
that we know already has kernel support today.

42:21.240 --> 42:25.360
So that way, any kernel we go to in the future is also going to just keep working.

42:25.360 --> 42:29.440
And that's the luxury you have of figuring this out a little bit ago and just now having

42:29.440 --> 42:32.540
years of making those choices kind of pay dividends.

42:32.540 --> 42:35.440
But when you're just kind of getting started, you got to really kind of get your feet underneath

42:35.440 --> 42:37.160
yourself and figure that stuff out.

42:37.160 --> 42:40.160
So we got one last one we wanted to get in before we wrap up the feedback.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.040
You want to take that one, Mr. Payne?

42:42.040 --> 42:43.040
Yeah.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.040
Garrett writes in.

42:44.040 --> 42:45.040
Hi, guys.

42:45.040 --> 42:50.200
I feel a little lost in the woods on the whole SUSE Liberty Linux intrigue.

42:50.200 --> 42:55.120
So we're primarily a red hot shop where I work in academia.

42:55.120 --> 42:59.680
And occasionally, I'll have some contact with our regional SUSE representative because,

42:59.680 --> 43:05.560
well, I just love chatting about Linux and yeah, hey, Garrett, we feel you there.

43:05.560 --> 43:11.160
Garrett goes on to say, anyway, SUSE's primary goal is, of course, to get you to buy SUSE

43:11.160 --> 43:15.080
the Linux enterprise and maintain a support contract.

43:15.080 --> 43:19.960
In organizations like ours, traditionally, you'd be proposing a migration from the fleet

43:19.960 --> 43:22.440
of relboxes to SLE.

43:22.440 --> 43:27.480
I can be a mind blowing task to execute in a tight timeline if you want to avoid a very

43:27.480 --> 43:30.080
expensive contract overlap.

43:30.080 --> 43:34.120
So much so that this could be a blocker to any type of deal actually moving forward.

43:34.120 --> 43:40.040
To massage this point a little, according to our rep, they offer rebuilds of Red Hat

43:40.040 --> 43:47.240
RPMs and offer a method to migrate your box from rel update repos to SUSE maintained ones.

43:47.240 --> 43:51.480
This gives you an opportunity to cut your Red Hat contract, keep your existing rel servers

43:51.480 --> 43:57.160
fed with updates, and allow you to grow into your eventual SLE roadmap.

43:57.160 --> 44:01.200
The idea being that you wouldn't bring up any new Red Hat boxes with SUSE, but new boxes

44:01.200 --> 44:05.680
would be SLE and you'd phase out your Red Hat through an intentional migration of attrition.

44:05.680 --> 44:10.880
I could see SUSE needing to rebrand legally what they build, similar to how CentOS, Racky,

44:10.880 --> 44:16.560
and Alma have to, and that maybe Liberty Linux is that branding result.

44:16.560 --> 44:20.520
Those rel SUSE Liberty Linux boxes could be what Apple was seeing.

44:20.520 --> 44:25.560
Does that seem plausible or am I missing a finer detail to indicate a new skew?

44:25.560 --> 44:31.760
The only thing that kind of would influence my thought process on this is I think we have

44:31.760 --> 44:36.640
to keep in mind that this is essentially a service that SUSE was offering before the

44:36.640 --> 44:37.640
whole Liberty thing.

44:37.640 --> 44:40.080
It's essentially a rebranded package.

44:40.080 --> 44:44.640
And without the distro part of it, I don't really know how it's different.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.360
And it has been kind of hilarious.

44:47.360 --> 44:51.600
Even as of like a couple of days ago, there are outlets that are still reporting this

44:51.600 --> 44:54.620
as a new CentOS clone.

44:54.620 --> 44:55.620
That's embarrassing.

44:55.620 --> 45:00.960
It seems like several people in the media had insider knowledge about this thing getting

45:00.960 --> 45:05.940
worked on, but then they didn't get the updated insider knowledge that it was pivoted to a

45:05.940 --> 45:08.420
different product or that part of it was canceled.

45:08.420 --> 45:13.280
And so the initial reports led as a CentOS clone, when in fact it is a service that allows

45:13.280 --> 45:19.320
you, like was just very well articulated here by Garrett, it allows you to manage your SUSE

45:19.320 --> 45:24.400
boxes and your rel based boxes all together with one SUSE management system and then eventually

45:24.400 --> 45:26.320
transition to a complete SUSE system.

45:26.320 --> 45:29.800
Carl, sounds like maybe you've got some thoughts on the scope change for Liberty.

45:29.800 --> 45:30.800
Sure.

45:30.800 --> 45:35.960
There was a Twitter thread I was participating in and Richard Brown, Cisrich on Twitter,

45:35.960 --> 45:36.960
he works for SUSE.

45:36.960 --> 45:41.760
I think he used to be on the OpenSUSE board and he clarified that in the past, the old

45:41.760 --> 45:46.720
expanded support offering that was for rel only and it had kind of an expectation that

45:46.720 --> 45:49.320
you would eventually migrate to SLIS.

45:49.320 --> 45:55.680
And the new Liberty offering is that it is for rel and CentOS and there's no expectation

45:55.680 --> 45:57.160
you can just keep using it forever.

45:57.160 --> 45:58.160
Oh, interesting.

45:58.160 --> 46:00.800
And that actually seems like a pretty smart move there.

46:00.800 --> 46:05.800
I mean, if this is all it ever is to that, this is probably a decent offering that people

46:05.800 --> 46:08.920
like Garrett, we make a good case, we'll take care, take advantage of.

46:08.920 --> 46:09.920
Seems quite practical.

46:09.920 --> 46:13.560
I still wouldn't rule out a distro shipping one day though.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.880
I mean, I'm hoping here.

46:14.880 --> 46:16.760
It'd be a lot of fun.

46:16.760 --> 46:22.560
All right, just a quick pick this week because it's so ridiculous, but my grandpa tells me

46:22.560 --> 46:27.440
all the time that back in his day, Lotus one, two, three on the terminal was the best damn

46:27.440 --> 46:29.440
spreadsheet program around.

46:29.440 --> 46:37.720
And so in that spirit, we're going to share SCIM, which is a spreadsheet calculator in

46:37.720 --> 46:38.720
the command line.

46:38.720 --> 46:42.720
And yeah, it's an end curses based SOB and it's kind of beautiful.

46:42.720 --> 46:43.720
There's graphs in here?

46:43.720 --> 46:44.720
What?

46:44.720 --> 46:45.720
Yeah, yeah.

46:45.720 --> 46:49.720
I wonder if this would actually make me tolerate spreadsheets or if it would just make it even

46:49.720 --> 46:50.720
more confusing.

46:50.720 --> 46:51.720
Yeah.

46:51.720 --> 46:55.400
I mean, you could, you could write down all in your various crypto assets in here, keep

46:55.400 --> 46:57.680
track of it, make little charts on the command line.

46:57.680 --> 46:58.680
I love it.

46:58.680 --> 46:59.680
Yeah, that'd be good.

46:59.680 --> 47:00.680
Right now.

47:00.680 --> 47:03.160
They've got well formatted tables with breakdowns.

47:03.160 --> 47:04.340
It's actually not bad, right?

47:04.340 --> 47:06.800
Like some genuine hard work has gone into this application.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.960
Like you could really use this on the daily.

47:08.960 --> 47:12.440
It seems to be very much inspired, built in part with VIM.

47:12.440 --> 47:14.720
So you'll have to get used to that, I guess.

47:14.720 --> 47:18.760
You know, finally learn the ice and the hard truth is, is I would probably be able to pick

47:18.760 --> 47:24.200
it up pretty quick because I used to, I used to exclusively use VIM as my editor on my

47:24.200 --> 47:25.200
systems.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.280
This thing has XLSX import support.

47:27.280 --> 47:28.280
What?

47:28.280 --> 47:29.280
I know.

47:29.280 --> 47:32.680
You know, if it just had some sort of integration with nano, I'd really be on board.

47:32.680 --> 47:34.360
That'd be pretty great.

47:34.360 --> 47:37.160
So our love blog is getting together on Tuesdays and Sundays.

47:37.160 --> 47:38.160
We have a bunch of it.

47:38.160 --> 47:44.280
We have a bunch of like, yeah, we have a bunch of time now, like, well, two, I guess compared

47:44.280 --> 47:45.280
to just one.

47:45.280 --> 47:46.280
That's like a doubling.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.280
Right?

47:47.280 --> 47:48.280
Yes.

47:48.280 --> 47:49.280
That kind of feels like a bunch.

47:49.280 --> 47:50.280
Right?

47:50.280 --> 47:51.280
You see what I'm going with?

47:51.280 --> 47:52.280
200% from, you know, the.

47:52.280 --> 47:53.280
That's what I'm saying.

47:53.280 --> 47:55.720
So if you'd like to know when those things happen, you're gonna have to figure it on

47:55.720 --> 47:59.040
your own because there's no calendar at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.040
That's not a thing.

48:00.040 --> 48:01.040
Don't check.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.320
There's no linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

48:02.320 --> 48:04.320
You couldn't put these pieces together.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.660
It's impossible.

48:05.660 --> 48:08.840
And we don't talk about it all the time on the live stream on Sundays, which we do every

48:08.840 --> 48:09.980
single Sunday.

48:09.980 --> 48:12.960
You definitely can't join our telegram group to ask about that.

48:12.960 --> 48:13.960
Right.

48:13.960 --> 48:15.160
You can't go to linuxunplug.com slash telegram.

48:15.160 --> 48:17.760
You can't do that, unfortunately.

48:17.760 --> 48:21.360
And there's no way to find out about new releases on Twitter, like a Jupiter signal or anything

48:21.360 --> 48:22.360
like that.

48:22.360 --> 48:25.720
There's also no method to subscribe to get MP3 files very easily on your.

48:25.720 --> 48:28.560
We never put up linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

48:28.560 --> 48:32.240
We never publish the links at linuxunplug.com slash 443.

48:32.240 --> 48:33.240
We don't do those things.

48:33.240 --> 48:36.600
I mean, we would, but we got brats to go eat.

48:36.600 --> 48:37.600
So we're going to go do that.

48:37.600 --> 48:38.600
That's it, though.

48:38.600 --> 48:41.560
I'd love to hear when a live session saved your bacon.

48:41.560 --> 48:44.520
Let us know, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

48:44.520 --> 48:45.520
Send it over there.

48:45.520 --> 48:46.520
Let us know.

48:46.520 --> 48:48.280
And we got a whole bunch coming up.

48:48.280 --> 48:51.280
So join us live one of these days and help us title this thing and hang out in our virtual

48:51.280 --> 48:52.280
lug.

48:52.280 --> 48:53.280
We do it at jblive.tv.

48:53.280 --> 48:54.280
We want you there.

48:54.280 --> 48:55.280
We do.

48:55.280 --> 48:59.880
But we still appreciate you listening, downloading, becoming a member if you can, or sharing this

48:59.880 --> 49:00.880
with a friend.

49:00.880 --> 49:02.680
It's the best way to spread a podcast is word of mouth.

49:02.680 --> 49:05.760
If you enjoyed this episode, share it with somebody.

49:05.760 --> 49:07.360
We'd appreciate that very much.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.360
Thanks so much for joining us.

49:08.360 --> 49:11.560
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

49:38.360 --> 49:53.960
All right, let's go title this thing so we can get to cooking, everybody.

49:53.960 --> 49:54.960
I'm not ready for that.

49:54.960 --> 49:57.400
I'm still stuck on this pick because it's got Lua scripting.

49:57.400 --> 49:58.400
What?

49:58.400 --> 49:59.400
It's got GNU plot integration.

49:59.400 --> 50:00.400
Yeah, I knew the GNU plot.

50:00.400 --> 50:01.400
I didn't know about the Lua scripting.

50:01.400 --> 50:02.400
I love GNU plot.

50:02.400 --> 50:03.400
It's just great.

50:03.400 --> 50:04.400
All right, title time.

50:04.400 --> 50:09.160
We got to go pick our title.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.160
JBtitles.

50:10.160 --> 50:12.680
Everybody out in the living room, get on your phones and go over to JBtitles.com and pick

50:12.680 --> 50:13.680
a title.

50:13.680 --> 50:14.680
Come on.

50:14.680 --> 50:15.680
Put yourself.

50:15.680 --> 50:16.680
What?

50:16.680 --> 50:17.680
Is that a thing?

50:17.680 --> 50:18.680
Is that a thing?

50:18.680 --> 50:19.680
Not yet.

50:19.680 --> 50:20.680
Should be though.

50:20.680 --> 50:21.680
Could be.

50:21.680 --> 50:22.680
We got every other domain out there.

50:22.680 --> 50:23.680
Tell you what.

50:23.680 --> 50:24.680
Tell the registrar quick.

50:24.680 --> 50:27.840
Here, crack that door open there, Wes, just so we can just crack it open so we can hear

50:27.840 --> 50:28.840
them.

50:28.840 --> 50:29.840
Just get a little.

50:29.840 --> 50:30.840
There we go.

50:30.840 --> 50:31.840
Yeah.

50:31.840 --> 50:33.460
All right.

50:33.460 --> 50:34.800
These are all about me getting old.

50:34.800 --> 50:35.800
What's with that?

50:35.800 --> 50:36.800
How are all these titles?

50:36.800 --> 50:37.800
I'm not sure.

50:37.800 --> 50:38.800
Because you are?

50:38.800 --> 50:39.800
What the hell is this?

50:39.800 --> 50:40.800
Sorry, Chris.

50:40.800 --> 50:46.440
Well, you wanted the live stream to keep going, so I had to have content.

50:46.440 --> 50:47.440
You just became the content.

50:47.440 --> 50:48.440
Oh, man.

50:48.440 --> 51:04.560
Oh, man.
