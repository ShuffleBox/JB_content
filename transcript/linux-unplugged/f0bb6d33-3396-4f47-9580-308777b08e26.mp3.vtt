00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Did you guys all see the Enlightenment OS's post about the importance of our brand?

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Did everybody catch this blog post?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
I told them about it.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Okay. All right. So here we go.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
This is Elementary OS, and they put forth sort of a,

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Hey community, this is how we'd like you to represent us.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Could you stop doing knockoff screenshots and then posting them online and saying it's called EOS.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
By the way, don't call it EOS. We will never call it EOS.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Don't make EMusic. Don't make EWeb.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
That sounds stupid. We don't want that.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
So don't call it EOS. Don't make EApps.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
And please stop ripping off like OS X because we're worried Apple's going to send us a cease and desist if you guys keep it up.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
So they kind of go on and talk about how important brands are.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
And I actually agree with a lot of what they talk about with brands.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
I think this is one of the advantages the Elementary OS project has is they get this.

00:53.000 --> 01:01.000
However, it's also, it's essentially a blog post telling people what they are allowed and not allowed to say about free software.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
And as you might have guessed, where the neckbeards hang out, there has been much, much angst.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Popey, you said you trolled them. What was your take on it?

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh, no. It was just one of the guys, Sam, who does some of the icons and does the new mixing, I think.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
He posted a screenshot and said, you know, and tweaked it and said, this is my screenshot of Elementary.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
And didn't say it was Elementary OS. And I asked him if it was EOS.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh, no.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
And Daniel turns up and he's like, yeah, very funny guys.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
So how do you guys feel about it?

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
How do you feel about a Linux distribution coming out and saying, hey, this is how we'd like you to refer to us or hey, we don't want you to refer to us this way?

01:39.000 --> 01:49.000
I think it's fine for them to do that internally. If that's for their staff and their direct developers and their direct community members, fine.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
But to tell users to do that is a bit of a dick move.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
Oh, it's the same thing with Maté or Qt.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
No, it's not. It's branding. It's just they're asking you to do something.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Maté is a brand. And they're like, oh, don't ever call it mate.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
No, I was just having fun with that when I posted that in the subreddit. I'm sorry everyone got bent out.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
No, no, no. That's a difference. That's a pronunciation versus a...

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
So here's a more of an example. Here's something that maybe would bug me.

02:19.000 --> 02:27.000
Say somebody made a Jupyter broadcasting app for Ubuntu Touch, but they lowercase the B in broadcasting.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
That would drive me crazy, even though it's a small little thing. That just doesn't look right. That's not our branding.

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
That's the kind of thing they're talking about. They don't want E-music. Like you have iTunes. They don't want E-tunes, those kinds of things.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
But then you're not officializing the app. So what's the problem?

02:43.000 --> 02:52.000
I mean, just tell them to drop the thing as well. You can. You own the brand. You can tell them to drop the name.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
Okay. Is the question, are they asking people to do this or are they telling people to do this? That's the main question.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Well...

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
They're just asking. Who cares? They're making a request.

03:00.000 --> 03:11.000
Well, it's very politically worded. I mean, you could almost see maybe a few years if this kind of stance could evolve into issuing C synthesis potentially.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
No, I don't think it's that strong.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Well, no, here's why.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
I mean, but this is the thing. I would see that kind of communique coming out on an internal mailing list at Canonical talking about Ubuntu.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
I could see that. I could see someone saying, look, if you're going to put out screenshots that are promoting the product,

03:28.000 --> 03:36.000
use the default items that are in the launcher, use the default icons that are in the indicator area, use one of the default backgrounds.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
That all makes sense in your own message, right?

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
And that you're talking to people who work on the product who are talking about the product.

03:43.000 --> 03:51.000
But when you're telling people who are in your community who are enthusiasts who aren't necessarily contributors and you see them as posting a screenshot,

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
it makes them a contributor. Therefore, they should abide by the guidelines. I think that's wrong headed.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Well, and you know, not only that, but it's wasted effort.

04:00.000 --> 04:08.000
And on top of that, what you're really saying, Poppy, is if you internally message correctly and then when you discuss it,

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
when you talk about things externally and you all agree on the language and then you use that same language when you discuss things externally,

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
your community just picks up on that and rolls with it. And that's how they start referring to things.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
The problem is they use EOS a couple of times themselves back in the day.

04:24.000 --> 04:32.000
Right. But messages change over time. It may well be they didn't formalize their branding until recently. That's fine.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
And they may have had a meeting about it.

04:34.000 --> 04:41.000
And maybe a lawyer said, hey, we're a little concerned about that highly litigious fruit company that makes iPhones.

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
And if you guys keep going this direction where, I mean, let's be honest, elementary OS looks a lot like Mac OS X.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
And if you have third party themes out there that make it look even more like Mac OS X,

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
and then you start having things like E-Tunes and E-Web, I would not be surprised if Apple issued a cease and desist.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I mean, didn't it happen to pair PC or whatever it was?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
No, there's no music.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Well, yeah, I know. But you get my drift. Maybe that's what they're worried about.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
So, but here's the thing, though.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Apple don't give a shit about elementary, honestly.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Technically, they are worried about this way long before.

05:15.000 --> 05:22.000
Initially, as a former contributor, I should say, like two, three years ago, I was contributing to the project

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
and there was these talks about licensing things about the website because they wanted to protect the branding.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Yeah, yeah.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
They had like licensing stuff that are weird.

05:32.000 --> 05:40.000
They put themselves into the Google Plus walls because they didn't want people to start talking about things that are going to come out.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I don't know what they are talking about.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
They're punching above their weight slightly.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah, I think that's partially it.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I think that they are very, very, very brand conscious.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Extremely, extremely brand conscious.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
And they feel like it's important to set the tone right and to keep it that way.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
And I don't necessarily disagree with that because we just had a conversation about the KDE project

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
and I think a big part of their issue that they now face is improper branding originally or inconsistent branding.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
And I can't really blame the Enlightenment, or I'm sorry, elementary guys.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Obviously, they have some branding problems because I'm too dumb to remember it.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
I can't really blame elementary OS for wanting to have a strong brand.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Yes, that's their fault that you're dumb.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Right, yeah, of course.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
We have the same problem.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Actually, when we changed the logo, do you remember when our logo used to be three colors?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Yes.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
The search for friends, right?

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
And now it's one color and it's a specific DD4814 open to orange.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
And that's the hex code, by the way, DD4814.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Nice, dude.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Nice.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I'll remember that.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
For some reason, someone set up DD4814.com and it's just a big orange screen.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
So you know that that's the right color, right?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Yeah.

06:53.000 --> 07:03.000
But the thing is, when that logo came out, people still afterwards use the old logo in their websites and materials and blog posts.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
And some of our design team used to get a little bit annoyed and they'd send little pings to the people to say,

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
hey, can you can you change your favicon because it's the old logo and we're now using the new one?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Can you change that article?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Can you change this?

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
And some of them got a little bit funny and got a little bit upset about people not using the new logo.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
So I can see how people can get a little bit funny about the branding being missing.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Right.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's embracing the sun

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
and just barbecued up some tasty chicken.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
My name is Chris.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
And my name is Matt.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Hey, Matt. I'm telling you, man.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I went over to Savannah Meats, you know, best meat around.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I got one of those whole chickens.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
I put it on its...

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Have you seen the beer butt chicken before?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Have you seen that?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Oh yeah.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah. Well, this is like an official like cast iron beer butt permanent chicken fixture that you put the chicken on top of.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
So oil, garlic, some bacon grease, some dry rub.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Matt, Matt, best chicken I've had all year.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
So good.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Nice.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Yeah. So I'm coming off a nice fresh chicken meal.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
And it turned out delicious.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
But that didn't mean we closed up all the windows at JB1 Studios.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
So it is hot here today.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
That's okay.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
I'm going to refresh myself with some good Linux topics.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
That'll be my source of refreshment.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
You know, we had a lot of really good comments on last week's episode of Linux Action Show.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
I'm really glad you guys liked them all.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
And our first bit of follow up in that area came in the topic of containers.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Now, if you didn't catch last week's Linux Action Show,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
we talked about how the Gnome project, Gwadek, their big conference is coming up.

08:31.000 --> 08:40.000
And one of the things that's going to be hot on the topic list is containerization and sandboxing of applications on the Linux desktop.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.000
And we mentioned, boy, we could see how this could maybe raise some ire in the Linux community.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And we suspected people might get a little upset.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
Well, Matt, that's just exactly where our first feedback is going to take us this week is right to that topic.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
So if you want more details on that, you can jump in on last week's Linux Action Show.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
But you don't have to.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
We'll get you up to date right here because it was Crossroads 1112 that wrote in.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
And Crossroads is easy in the... Crossroads, you should have joined us for the virtual log.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
That would have been perfect.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Anyways, he wrote in.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
He said, here's my concerns with containerization of software on the desktop.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
He said, let me preface this by saying that it's not a rant.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I'm not yelling or screaming about the possibility.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
It's very possible that my concerns will be addressed and these will be non-issues.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
So he seems like he's being pretty rational about it.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.000
He says, up first, my first concern, which is the exact same thing you said on the show on Sunday, Matt, updating.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
As Matt said, putting software in containers could make updating more difficult.

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
And I actually, I think that's funny because I think the way he's thinking about it is like through a software manager.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Like, you know, I'm sorry, a package manager like Pacman or Apt.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
I think contained applications are going to be delivered through app stores.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
I really do.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
You've got the Gnome Software Center, whatever they're calling it that they're working on.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
KDE's got something they're working on.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
I really think when you get these apps, they're going to be distributed.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
A lot of the distributions are doing this already.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
Like, if you have Fedora today, you can use the Gnome Software Center and it uses PackageKit to install applications for you.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Pretty much one of the few distributions it doesn't work on is Arch.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
There's no PackageKit interface to Pacman.

10:09.000 --> 10:15.000
That aside, if you look at that, maybe that'd be one way they could handle it.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
So, crossroads, I wouldn't worry too much about updating.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
And I also think your package manager will still be available to you.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
He says, there could also be possible app compatibility.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Now, this is the one I was worried about.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I forgot to mention it in the show.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
He says, what if I need software A to interact with software B, but no API to allow those two to talk, right?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Because they're both individually in sandboxes.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
They can't even see each other.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
They're not even aware each other are running.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
And so, if there isn't an API to allow them to communicate, then this is not going to happen.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
He says, obviously, this wouldn't be a problem for probably about 95% of interactions, but for the 5%, it'd be a huge problem.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
And that's a great question.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
I'm sure they actually have talked about a solution to solve that problem.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
They have a good name for it, too.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
I just forgot what it was.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
I don't know if anybody in the Mumble Room is aware of the name that the Gnome Project is talking about to allow applications to communicate.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
It's like the way the Android system works.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
It's like the way Windows Mobile does in the new iOS extensions.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
It's that same kind of – there's an infrastructure in place.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
And then applications can communicate via that infrastructure.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
So, they have addressed it, but I don't know the details on it.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
And then, last but not least, this is the one I think probably resonated with a lot of the folks.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
The Linux way of installing software is better than the Windows way.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
I don't want to go hunting around the internet for software containers like I do on Windows.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
I want to install software either from the terminal or a GUI, either it be Synaptic or Pacman XG, Ubuntu App Store, etc.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
Perhaps I've been spoiled by the AUR and the ability to install pretty much any package without internet hunting.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
And that's a great point.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
But again, I think if they deliver it through app stores, I think that could help.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Now, I'm not saying app stores are the future of Linux.

11:47.000 --> 11:53.000
I'm talking about a specific kind of apps, like GNOME Maps, and things like that,

11:53.000 --> 11:59.000
that will be available through these software centers that at first will seem very awkward and clunky to use on a Linux desktop

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
because we all love our Pacman-S.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
But it's one of those things that I think after a while will just seem natural.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Like all of your main tools will still be available at the command line.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I mean, this has to be the way of the future, right?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Well, so here's the way I see it.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
And correct me if I'm wrong, but potentially if we did go with a package manager for, say, containers, for example,

12:19.000 --> 12:24.000
instead of installing applications, wouldn't you just be able to just install like a new container over the old one?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Yeah, exactly.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
So in essence, it really becomes a mood issue.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
You could literally arrange it to where you could still use the command line.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
You could still use a GUI.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
You know, Bob's your uncle.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah, very much so.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Wimpy, you wanted to key in on the Android aspect of this?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Go ahead.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
Well, APKs are containerized applications just by another name.

12:47.000 --> 12:54.000
The APK contains everything that the application requires, including libraries for multiple architectures,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
and your user data lives elsewhere.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
So yeah, I think delivered through an app store type presentation, it would work.

13:02.000 --> 13:11.000
And the GNOME extensions already deploys the extensions via the extensions website, which is app store-like.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
I don't know what the big fuss is about.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
This is nothing new to anyone, really.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
We've been doing this for years now.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Poppy, this is probably a problem that's being solved on Ubuntu Touch, correct?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yep.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
We have click packages, which are containered applications.

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
They can't talk to each other directly, but they can talk to each other via Content Hub, for example.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
So they can pass messages backwards and forwards, and like, you know, your gallery app can get a photo from the camera,

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
or you can download a music file via the web browser and send it to the music app, that kind of stuff.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Same kind of stuff that happens on Android.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
And yeah, we have a central app store, but equally the same as Matt was saying,

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
you could still install stuff via the command line because the click packages you could go and download,

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
or someone could build one for you, a custom one, side-load it on the phone and install it.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
I don't think there's anything terribly bad going on here.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
It makes total sense, and yeah, it's got an app store just like you say.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah, and I think one of the other comments I've seen is,

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
well, man, one of the things I love about Linux is that everything is dynamically linked.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I don't think that goes away.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
In fact, you could have these packages work in a sense where if the necessary libraries are there

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
and they're the correct version, it uses those.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
And if the necessary libraries are not there, or the correct version is not present,

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
it uses something that's internal or statically linked or something like that.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
So that's a possibility, but also you think about it,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
I think the way I'm envisioning this is layered, right?

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
So you'll have the very, very top layer of a Linux desktop system or laptop system

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
that has sandbox applications, a sandbox display manager, a sandbox desktop,

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
sandbox web browser, and it truly guarantees or gets as close as we can to guaranteeing

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
a safe, private, open source desktop, okay?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I think that's the top layer.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
Then just below that you have all the GNU utilities, you have all of the command line stuff,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
all of the package manager stuff, all of the shared libraries.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
It doesn't go away. It's still there.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
And then below that you have like systemd, and then you get down to the kernel.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
And that's essentially how I'm seeing this structured, right?

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
And it does mean things a little differently, and I wouldn't be surprised if these containers

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
were just simply installed to your home directory.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Maybe there'd be like an apps folder in your home directory.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
And then you just back that up, and you've just backed up all of the installed applications on Linux.

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
And one of the things they talk about in the GNOME sense is if you have these containers,

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
these bundle files, these APKs, then the GNOME desktop can be aware of those and what they are,

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
and you could have a descriptor file, a.desktop file, in those APKs,

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
and you could automatically have the shortcuts added to the GNOME menu

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
regardless of where they're at as long as the GNOME desktop reads that file.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
So you could back up that entire directory, do a clean install,

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
drop that entire directory back into your home folder, point the GNOME menu at it,

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
it would reread all of the.desktop files and recreate all of the links

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
in your GNOME application menu for those apps.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
It's pretty cool, and it makes backup a hell of a lot easier.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
And if you think about like, you know how my mom backs up her Mac right now?

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
She never even thought about it any other way.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
She never thought about how I should back it up.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
She got an external USB drive, and then she went and took her Photoshop folder,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
and she clicked it from her applications folder and drug it to the hard drive

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
and said, okay, I've backed up.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
And to her, she's backed up the program now.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
And that's how she thinks about it, is this is right, exactly.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
So this is something that regular users have a hard time understanding,

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
and they have certain expectations that binaries are portable to them

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
by their very nature.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I should be able to pick up a binary off one computer

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
and drop it on another computer and just run it.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
And if you can't do that, then there's something wrong with the operating system

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
because that's the operating system's job is to run applications.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
That's how they see it.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
They don't think about libraries and all that kind of,

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
and dependencies and all that kind of stuff.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
And I think this could go huge to addressing that

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
because I don't think it's going to neuter the power users.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
You guys know me.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
I'm the first person to be like, screw the fictional new user.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Focus on the power users.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
You know that's usually my mantra.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
But in this case, I think it gives enough benefits to new users

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
and enough benefits to power users and enough security and privacy

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
that I think it's a win-win.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
And I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of desktops implement this.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Oh, definitely.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I think if we're in a position to where it's like, look,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
I can still pop a drop-down terminal and pound out what I need to

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
to get my software updated or installed,

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
I can't see why anyone would have a problem.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
That's just my philosophy.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
There you go.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
All right.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Ben wrote in to update us on his command line challenge.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Quick thank you, too.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
We got some reports in.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Some folks were like, dude, this one guy's like, dude,

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
I had a netbook running Arch.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
It was my only machine because my main computer died.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
I had it for like three months or I think it was two months.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Only could use the command line.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
It was no problem.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
However, Ben, who wrote in last week about starting the command line challenge,

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
wrote in this week to give us an update.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
He says, hey, guys, I just wanted to give you an update

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
to the command line challenge.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
I hate to say it, but I caved.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
I caved.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
On Thursday, I logged back into my desktop, fired up Iceweasel.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
I just couldn't do it anymore.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
The nice thing is I'm now way more comfortable in the command line

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
than I was before.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Great point.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
That's a great benefit.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
He says, thanks for the show.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
So the command line challenge didn't last too long for Ben.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Hey, Ben, no judgey here.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
It wouldn't last much longer.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
We got an email.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
Somebody was like, dude, as a long-time sysadmin and pen tester,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
how do you not understand living in the command line?

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
And I wrote him back and I was like, dude, you don't understand at all.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
I live.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
I fight for the GUI.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I fought for the user.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
I was there through the bad days and all the industry crap that we had to slog

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
through to get decently performing GUI desktops.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
I don't want to go back.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
And I like my web browser.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
I like my VLC.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
I like my instant messaging client and all that stuff.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
I don't want to go back.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
I could do it.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Just because you can doesn't mean you want to.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Right, exactly.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
That's exactly it.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
That's how I felt about it.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
It's like, but dude, command line.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I'm like, bro, I know.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
I know about the command line.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
All right.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Roy wrote in with two questions for the virtual lug.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
He says, hey, all my name is Roy.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Over the last year, I've set up a couple emails.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
I've sent a couple emails you mentioned on the show about my moving to Arch experience.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Oh, great, Roy.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
He's like, okay.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
And this is what I love about Roy because he's right where my head's at right now.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
He says, I'm all in on de-clouding.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
And for almost every service now I use, I attempt to establish in my own,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
I'm trying to set up my own service on my own fanless Arch server at home.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Nice.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
So I was looking at email servers.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
And I think he's directing this at you, Mumble Room.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
And I recently found the Colab suite.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Does anyone have experience with Colab?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I.e., is it any good?

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
And do you know, this is the second part, do you know how to install it on Arch as I failed to find it?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Anybody have Colab?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Anybody tried it on Arch in the Mumble Room?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
We got a big group here today.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Nobody.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I haven't tried it on Arch, but I have tried it.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
What do you think of Colab in general, Wimpy?

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
It's quite good if you haven't used something better.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Oh.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
That's what I'd say.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
So yeah, I did try it.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
At work, we've been using Zimbra for some years.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
And we're looking to decide whether we're going to upgrade to the new Zimbra or move to something else.

19:57.000 --> 20:05.000
So I've had to go through all of the sort of big collaboration suites that you can run on open source platforms.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
And Colab was obviously one of those I tried.

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
And it is very good, but it doesn't stand up against Zimbra very well.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Oh, that's what I was going to ask you to see.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
That's exactly what I'm finding too.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
But the counter argument there is that these days Zimbra isn't that open source friendly.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
It's not as open source friendly as it used to be a couple of years ago.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
So there's not the packages that are available for the different distributions now.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
It's a lot more heavy lifting involved.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
It's not as well documented.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
So it swings in roundabouts.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
So Colab's definitely very good.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Not as good as Zimbra, but I'm probably not going to use Zimbra either.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Go ahead, Eric.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
You had a question about...

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Yeah.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
My question about that app is this.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Is it open source?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
And does he know how to compile it?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
And then I'm sure somebody could walk him through it.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Colab?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Yeah.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
And there's packages too.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Yeah.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Although I've looked at it.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I haven't tried it extensively.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
The one of the bunch that I've actually had production deployments and probably a version

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
or so ago was Zimbra.

21:09.000 --> 21:16.000
And this de-clouding thing, it's definitely something I'm starting to take very seriously.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Before, it's always been sort of intellectual masturbation for me.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Like how would I accomplish it?

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
I feel like I spent the last year kind of intellectually masturbating different ways

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
to get out of the cloud.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
And sort of, again, my favorite new word, digesting.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Like what are the ramifications that we're learning?

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
And if you guys watch Tech Talk today and on Filter, you might have heard about some

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
more recent revelations that came out that are just uncomfortable.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
They make me uncomfortable.

21:40.000 --> 21:46.000
Today, I ran a story on Tech Talk today about the U.S. government saying the Fourth Amendment

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
doesn't apply to data stored in cloud services.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Oh, seriously?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
That physical protections don't apply to digital goods and that that authority allows them

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
to not just reach within the U.S., but they're trying to currently get data off of a Dublin

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
server that Microsoft has for a drug trafficking case.

22:04.000 --> 22:11.000
And to me, I don't think I'm going to be targeted, but I feel like that, A, is something that

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
I'm not comfortable with and I need to vote with my own body, with my own usage.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
And B, I feel like in order for these things, these independent options to exist, people

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
have to be using them.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
There has to be consumer demand for them to thrive or else they'll just go away if they

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
don't have a user base and I'm somebody who's in a position to use them.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
So I sort of almost feel a responsibility in some sense.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
So the big one for me is Gmail, Google, calendars.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
And the Google one's a big one, right?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Because that's really very integrated these days.

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
I really got to be honest, Google calendars is my favorite calendar implementation.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
Gmail's probably my favorite webmail, right?

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
So I've been trying to think of how do I move out of the cloud, but not just move out, but

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
make it a better experience for me.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
And the way I'm looking at it is I'll try one thing for a little while.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
And I'll see like, okay, if I do this off of Google, like I've tried Hackpad for a little

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
bit and I'm looking at setting up Etherpad for a little while and trying that and maybe

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
switching to BitTorrent Sync more instead of Dropbox and BitTorrent Sync.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
These kinds of things, I'm trying to find out how I can kind of not get off the grid,

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
but have more of a say in the services I choose.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
Because one of the things I'm discovering too is like with Android in particular is once

23:23.000 --> 23:29.000
you opt in at one level, you kind of go all in and you kind of like you end up on the

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
grid regardless.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
You don't have a choice.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
If you wanted to use a device, like this is why I'm so excited about things like Ubuntu

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
Touch and Firefox OS, because I want to have a device where I can elect to use maybe BitTorrent

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
Sync for my photo sync, maybe my own LDAP server for my contacts and my own IMAP server

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
and have that experience be a first class experience.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
Not have it be hobbled because I'm not using the Gmail app, because I'm not using the calendar

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
app, because that's what you get on Android now is if you choose not to opt into the Google

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
experience, all of the Google services, you get second rate applications.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
And that I'm sick of, I'm so sick and tired of that.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
Is that force opt in, you're all in, balls deep, you got the tracking, we got data on

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
you, you got an account with us, you got a Google Plus account now, have at it bro, welcome

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
to Android.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
And that I'm sick of.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
That I'm sick and tired of.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
Because there's other ways out there, there's other services out there.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
You know, maybe I want to use Amazon for my music.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
You can do all of it on Android today, but it's becoming less and less of an option and

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
that drives me crazy because it's all running on top of Linux.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
And that's one of the things that really gets me.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
So I'm totally right where he's at right now.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Where I'm looking at like, what can we bring in house?

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
Not only can I have it on the land so it runs better, but now I don't have to worry about

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
this weird, like, sure if the US government wants to come get emails that were sent to

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
me by some listener, then they'll have to come knock on the actual studio door and hand

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
me a warrant.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
They can't just deliver it through some automated system to Google and then Google just extracts

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
it from my Google account and delivers it to them.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
They have to come to me to get it.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
And at least that's something, at least then I know it's happening.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
But I'm legitimately in a position where people send me confidential information that's encrypted.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
I communicate with people that are all over the world on a daily basis.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
I research stuff that's obviously going to, in some cases, be considered by some agencies

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
worth monitoring.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
I mean, at what point do you start going, okay, maybe I should start taking some steps

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
to preserve my own privacy and put things under my own control.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
And then I start thinking about it from a father's perspective.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
And I start thinking about when my son and daughter come to me for school or whatever

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
and they say, okay, Dad, we need an email account.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
Do I want to elect, do I want to say, okay, guys, go get a Google account.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
Have a lifetime of your information being observed by Google.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
I don't think that's a good idea.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
So I want to set some stuff up too.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
So I'm thinking about it a lot.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
But, you know, it's really hard to make a move and not take a considerable hit in functionality

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
these days.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
Well, it feels like there's a lack of out of the box options, you know, really.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah, that's for sure.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
And if you really want like the stuff that everybody's really excited about, you know,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
you got to kind of opt into the system a little bit.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
So it's something.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
So I have right now on my Nexus 5, I'm triple booting.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
I'm going to put L on there.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
I don't have L on there right now.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
I just have the latest Android.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
But Ubuntu Touch and Firefox OS.

26:10.000 --> 26:15.000
I tell you out of the three, Android is obviously the one that's the most feature complete for

26:15.000 --> 26:19.000
me because it's got things that I use like Waze and Evernote, which I only really use

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
when I'm traveling.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
But it's nice to have them when I do need them.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
So it's not like I need them all the time.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
But Ubuntu Touch, you know, as far as like then compared to Firefox OS, I definitely

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
think I prefer the Ubuntu Touch experience.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
So I figure I'm going to triple boot that for a little while and see what that's like.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
But at the end of the day, I have to be realistic.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
I want a smartphone that has a great camera because I have three adorable children and

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
I want to be able to send those pictures to my wife when I take a great picture.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And if I get lost, I want to be able to launch Waze.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
And I don't think that's unreasonable to expect from a smartphone.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
Well, and I think what's scary is that if I'm correct, you guys can correct me if I'm

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
wrong, but I believe Google actually purchased Waze.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
So that app that we all love.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
So it's like, it says what they're doing is you're like, okay, Google, I'm finally free.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
Oh, you know, you got that one app I really like and Google's like, we own it.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Yeah.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
And it sucks because it's like, okay, so what's your alternative?

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Some podunk GPS thing?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Right.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
I'm going to have to use Nokia Hear Maps or whatever they call it.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
Well, in fact, Google Maps actually uses information from Waze now.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Yes.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
It's actually kind of handy.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Yeah.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
I mean, all of it's very...

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
And the value of this is negative.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
It's all very, you know, negative, but I tell you...

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
And the solution of course is Bing Maps.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Yeah, there you go.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
I'm thinking about it.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
There you go.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
I'm thinking about it.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
Yeah.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
I think part of it, and this is to get to, actually I should probably take a little break

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
right here and thank our first sponsor because to get to it, Ting is part of that stack,

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
right?

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
But this is a part that desperately needs address and that's why I'm really enthusiastic

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
about Ting.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
So go to linux.ting.com, that'll get you $25 off your first device or if you already have

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
a device compatible Ting, $25 of credit.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Now here's why Ting's great.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
No contract.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
They just kill that and you only pay a flat $6 per month per line.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
The reason why this is huge is it changes the value model completely.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
Instead of trying to trick you into paying more than you need so that way you don't go

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
over, you just pay for what you use.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
And if you need hotspot and tethering, you check the box and now it's just your data

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
usage.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
That's genius.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Ting is open like that too.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
I tell you what, I had Ubuntu Touch on the Nexus 5, fired it up, got right on the Ting

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
network, started making calls.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
Couldn't hang up with the Ubuntu Touch operating system, but I could make calls on the Ting

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
network.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
That was cool.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
The hanging up part was a bug, which is fixed now.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
And it's really great.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
Yeah, I just have that freedom and flexibility, plus they have fantastic support.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
You can call them at 1-855-TING-FTW and a real person answers the phone.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
How nice is that when your phone's not working and you're frustrated and you just want to

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
get it solved.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
That's right.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
And they'll help you get out of your contract.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
If you go over to ting.com slash ETF, they have an early termination relief program.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
They'll pay up to $75 per line that you have to get canceled.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
So that'll get you out of your contract.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Then you can go contract free.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
And check out their savings calculator when you go to linux.ting.com.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Put your current details in there, your actual usage, not what you're paying for, not how

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
they're scamming you, but what you actually end up using and see how much you would save.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.000
And I've been talking to the folks over at Ting about my current frustrations with vendor

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
lock-in, and so they sent me over an iPhone 5 for free.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
I'll be trying out iOS 8 and doing an iOS 8 and Android L head-to-head comparison in

29:17.000 --> 29:18.000
the future.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
So if you've got any thoughts on that, I'd love to hear it.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Noah, don't cry, though.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
Don't cry, Noah.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
I know he's up in the mumble room right now like, what?

29:24.000 --> 29:29.000
Yes, I'll probably have an iPhone 5 running iOS 8 at OSCON.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
I know, it's egregious.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
I know.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
It's absolutely egregious.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
But it's an interesting experiment.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
And I'm going to see, can I connect to my own IMAP server, my own LDAP server?

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Can I use BitTorrent Sync as my storage backend?

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
Because iOS 8 is supposed to have some sort of application extension linking, I don't

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
know.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
But what I'm really curious about is how do the two operating systems stack up?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
And Ting's like, dude, we'll send you an iPhone 5 to try it.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
So I got an iPhone 5 for a little bit.

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
I'll be kicking the tires, and I'll give you my thoughts on that in the future and see

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
how L and iOS 8 stack up, both maybe as the OSes get a little closer to maturity.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
I'll do that comparison.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Go to linux.ting.com.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
They've got a lot of great phones.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
The Nexus 5 runs amazing on the Ting network.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
That's my daily driver.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
You can get the iPhone 5 through their partners at Glide for $250.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
You own it.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
$250.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
You own it.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
Off contract.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
$6 a month.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
They've also got MiFi devices if you need a data connection.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
So you can go over there and rock that for a flat $6 a month.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
It's a $6 hotspot at that point.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
Linux.ting.com.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Go see what I've been talking about.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Go see why Ting rocks so hard.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
And now I've got three devices on my Ting network.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
How about that?

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Three devices.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Look at me.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
I'm like a phone roller.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
The phone ranger over here.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
So I'll give you my report soon.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Linux.ting.com.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
Go check them out.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Go get yourself a great phone.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
They've got feature phones, Android phones, Windows phones, all of it.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Linux.ting.com.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
And a really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Love that.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Good deal.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
That's sweet.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
All right.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Noah, are you okay?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Noah, are you okay?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
I'm calming down.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I'm glad that you're bringing an iPhone because I was hoping we could make it to the gun range.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Nice.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
No, I think Noah's going for large caliber on this.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
I don't know.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
I'll bring mine.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
Noah's like, I know he's got a Nexus 5 with him, so if I end up destroying the iPhone,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I know he's not going to be out of communication.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
So there's a little risk is what he's thinking.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
He's walking in with a desert eagle.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Yeah.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
Hey, you know, we talk a lot on the show.

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
Actually, this is the wrong way to describe this.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
One thing that we never talk about on the show, but people who watch the video version

31:26.000 --> 31:31.000
see this all the time is my desktop setup.

31:31.000 --> 31:37.000
And we got a request in from Kaz21 just to kind of go over a little bit of what I use.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
And some of the stuff I use, I know a lot of the Mumble folks use.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
So here, I'll show you.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
Kaz, if you're watching the video version of Linux Unplugged, here is essentially what

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
I use on my GNOME box.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
So for the theme, this is, I guess I should say, this is the latest version of GNOME.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
My window theme is Numix.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
The GTK theme is Numix.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
My icons are Numix Circle.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
My cursor is oxygen white.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
That way it pops and I can see it.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
And I have this Akuito shell to get the nice transparencies, which are cut off on my camera

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
shot.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
You can't see them.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
My conkey setup you asked about, I'm actually just cheating.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I'm using Conkey Manager, an app pick before that sets it up.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
It's actually a little broken right now, but I like the way it looks.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
And I have global dark theme turned on.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
So it's a nice, yes, flat.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
I know.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
I know.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
It's flat.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
It's a nice flat GTK theme that I like quite a bit.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Mumble Room, you guys have anything you do to tweak your desktop?

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
Oh, the other thing I do is I have a bunch of tweaks installed for Firefox, but you guys

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
can't really see those most of the time.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
So that's kind of it.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Oh, I guess I could cover my extensions.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
I have a ton of extensions, actually.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I mean, Numix kind of changed.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
I just kind of, once Numix came out, I kind of went all in on Numix.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
But my favorite GNOME desktop extensions are the audio output switcher, which allows me

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
to toggle my audio sources really super quick, which is great since I'm doing that all the

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
time.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
The caffeine extension, dash to doc, must have.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
It's my favorite doc, and it's just built right in now.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
Extension update notifier, todo.txt, top icons.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
You guys can't see this either, but all of the notification icons that normally go down

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
in the tray on GNOME are now up along the top, like old school, sort of applet style

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
along the top of my bar, which is nice.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
And, oh, this is the best one.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
I've got to find it.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Where is the best one?

33:17.000 --> 33:22.000
It's like minimum workspaces or something like that.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Top icons.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
This is the one that made GNOME finally really work for me.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
And what it does is it essentially establishes a set of fixed desktops.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
So it kills the dynamic desktop thing.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
So I always have at least four desktops available to me.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
And then once I use the fourth desktop, then it begins to do dynamic workspace management

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
and create virtual desktops for me on demand as I need them.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
So I thought it was called minimum workspaces, but I'm not seeing the extension now.

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
I totally recommend you get that one, though, because for me, it totally helped me wrap

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
my brain around the way virtual workspaces work in GNOME.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
So, yeah, there you go.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
Anybody in the Mumba room have anything they want to chime in with their favorite setup

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
on GNOME or KDE?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Any new themes?

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Yeah.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
I would suggest, as far as Konkey goes, Numix has a really cool Konkey layout.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Oh.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.000
And it's kind of like, it looks like Google now, but you can make it blend with your desktop

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
as well.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
But there's also, I love gtile extension.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Yeah, it's gtile.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Yep.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
For Firefox and Thunderbird and whatnot.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
Oh, no.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Oh, that's htile.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Sorry.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
That's htile.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
That's htitle.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
Oh, yeah.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
Gtile is an extension for GNOME that gives you tiling window manager features.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
Oh, right.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Yes.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
I've used that for a little bit.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
Yeah.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
It gives it, yeah, it auto-positions windows for you, and it'll tile them as you open up

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
more windows, right?

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Right.

34:42.000 --> 34:48.000
And you can control like this, you can set it to automatically turn, tile them and set

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
for certain sections based on what app you're opening and stuff like that.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Very cool.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
That's a nice one.

34:54.000 --> 34:59.000
And we did like a GNOME customization episode ages ago.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
So, if you go dig through the Linux Action Show archive, you'll find info on that.

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
Hey, we have just a little bit of breaking news.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
That's right, Plasma 5 has been released today.

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
The Plasma 5 desktop is out, and we've been kicking the tires a little bit.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I meant to do a demo on last, on Sunday.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
I'll try to do one this Sunday.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.000
Eric, you've been running it for a few days now.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
What do you think?

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Are you impressed with...

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Oh, he's up and staging.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Well, when he gets back, I'll ask him.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
I wonder if he's impressed with Plasma 5.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Here's a couple of the highlights.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
So, today, July 15, 2014, KD proudly announces the immediate availability of Plasma 5.0,

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
providing a visually updated core desktop experience that is easy to use and familiar

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
to the user.

35:38.000 --> 35:43.000
Plasma 5.0 introduces a new breeze artwork concept, which you guys might have to go set.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I don't know if it's turned on by default, actually.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
At least on my system, it wasn't.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
I've been using the Project Neon ISO to play with it for a little bit.

35:52.000 --> 35:58.000
Now, you have a fully hardware accelerated graphic stack, OpenGL, with the updated modern

35:58.000 --> 36:05.000
clean-looking theme sitting on top of Frameworks 5.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
It's definitely a.0 release.

36:08.000 --> 36:13.000
The testing I've done is 5.0, and it's had some crashing in the limited use I've had.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
So, I would say, at this point, this is a good time for you to jump in and help the

36:16.000 --> 36:17.000
KDE Project out.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.000
Don't expect it to necessarily be great for your daily driver, just like Joss warned us

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
earlier last week.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
I'm very excited about it for some reason.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
I don't know, Matt.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
I don't sense a lot of excitement from you.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
I feel like I got all the excitement, and you're kind of like, okay, well, I'll give

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
it some time.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
Yeah.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
I'm one of those people.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
So, I'm weird when it comes to updates.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
I'm one of those.1 guys,.2 guys.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
That makes sense.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
I like to let things sit in the oven for a while.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
I don't know.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
But, at the same time, I want fresh packages.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
But, when it comes to desktops as a whole, whether it be KDE, GNOME, whatever it may

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
be, I feel like that leaving it in the oven a little bit doesn't hurt anything.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
Well, yeah, for sure.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
It's okay to wait.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Of course, no wonder you say that.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
You're a big XFCE guy.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Yes.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
There you go.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
There you go.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Look at this hip music they got.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Oh, yeah.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Plasma 5.0 Visual Feature Guide, everybody.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
Coming at you with a screencast for Plasma 5.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
Eck, are you back?

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Yeah, I'm back.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Yeah, I saw you were staging somebody.

37:12.000 --> 37:18.000
Did you want to share any of your impressions with Plasma 5?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
I know you've been working with it for a few days now.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
What do you think?

37:20.000 --> 37:28.000
Well, today, I am actually running it completely as my main desktop, just to really try it

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
out, really get into it.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
I have noticed a lot of graphics glitches, a lot of bugs that still need to be worked

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
out.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
I'm sure they'll get worked out because I've just got standard Intel graphics for the most

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
part.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
So that's going to get fixed.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
Typically, it has to do with the compositor.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.000
If you set the compositor right, make sure you're using OpenGL if you want the effects.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
But for the most part, it looks great.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
It works great.

37:55.000 --> 38:01.000
It feels like it's missing a few things compared to the previous experience with 4.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
But honestly, they've already said that they're going to add to that, so I can only see it

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
getting better with time.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
Right, and the artwork team is continuing their work.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
It's interesting.

38:12.000 --> 38:19.000
They went to great lengths to replicate essentially the same basic functionality of the previous

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Plasma desktop.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
And to better and worse, I think they've improved it in some areas.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
The typography definitely looks a lot better.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
There's animations that look smoother.

38:27.000 --> 38:33.000
To me, I'm excited about this because I love the technology at work here, and I don't know

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
if I'm going to switch now.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
I'm tempted.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
I also saw, especially I'm a little more tempted now because Billy Big Rigger linked in our

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
subreddit how to install Plasma 5 on Arch right now.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
It's in the repos.

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
So now that I can put it on an Arch box, I can just log into it, and that'd just be one

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
of my many desktops.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Yeah, so look right here.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
I'm going to do it.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
Pacman-S K5 and K5-AIDS, and that's it.

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
That gets you Plasma 5 and Frameworks 5.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
That's it, right?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
How am I not going to do that?

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Because even if it doesn't work, I could just switch back to GNOME.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
So yeah, I'm doing that tonight probably.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
It depends on my hard drive space.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
And I know, Eric, you were talking about loading it up on an Arch box, too.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
That to me is a sweet spot.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
I really like to try that because then you're going to get more updates quicker, too, I

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
would think.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
Yeah.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
Well, I would think, except right now I'm tracking the daily with the Project Neon.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
Yeah, that's true.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
That's true.

39:29.000 --> 39:37.000
But honestly, I want to see what the difference is where Arch is at with it, as opposed to

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
running it alongside Kabuntu, essentially.

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
I think the most well-supported desktops on Arch is KDE.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
They get day of updates and whatnot.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
I think one of the core Arch guys is a core KDE guy, but I might have my details wrong

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
on that.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
But it's like day of.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
I think one of the main distro Arch guys is the maintainer of KDE for the packaging, and

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
he just gets it done right away.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Right.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
Super awesome.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.000
Well, we have an old soapbox that we haven't gotten on for a long time.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
We're almost at episode 50 now, Matt.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
And something happened when we talked about it on Sunday.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
It got producer Q5 really upset.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
And we're going to talk about that next.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
But first, I want to thank DigitalOcean, sponsors of the Linux Unplugged program.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
DigitalOcean is rocking some stuff right now, you guys.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.000
This is the time to get in if you're not yet a DigitalOcean customer.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
Plus, if you use our promo code, UNPLUGEDJULY, you'll get a $10 credit.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Now, why would you want a $10 credit?

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
I'll tell you why.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Because DigitalOcean rocks.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
They're a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
to spin up a cloud server.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
If you're quirky, you can get a cloud server spun up in, what do you do, like, 33 seconds?

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
It was amazing.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
It was amazing.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
But most users get a cloud server spun up in about 55 seconds, and pricing plans start

40:47.000 --> 40:54.000
at only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, a blazing fast CPU,

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
and a terabyte of transfer for $5 a month.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
And if you use the promo code, UNPLUGEDJULY, you get a $10 credit.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
So you can try it for two months absolutely free, nothing out of your pocket.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Plus, they have hourly pricing.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
That's another great way to go.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
and now London.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
And that's where Corky set up his new DigitalOcean droplet and where you got the rockin' speed.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Their interface is simple.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
Their control panel is super intuitive, and power users can replicate that control panel

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
on a larger scale with their new API.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
DigitalOcean has grown like crazy because they've combined an amazing interface with

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
an efficient system powered by KVM and Linux.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
And congratulations to DigitalOcean.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
They announced the London region today.

41:38.000 --> 41:43.000
So you can go build yourself a London DigitalOcean droplet right now and use the promo code,

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
UNPLUGEDJULY.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
And if you're doing backups, why not do a DigitalOcean droplet in the U.S. and do a

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
DigitalOcean droplet in London and sync between them?

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
It'll be $10 a month.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
And you could do it for two months for free.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Why not do it?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Go check it out.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
DigitalOcean.com.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Use the promo code, UNPLUGEDJULY.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
Go get yourself a root box up in the cloud that you control.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
And they have a great droplet management system too with backup snapshots, all kinds of good

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
stuff.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
DNS management, an HTML5 console too.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
You can even watch the thing post and boot.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
It's pretty cool.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
DigitalOcean.com, UNPLUGEDJULY.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
When you check out, thank you.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
And thank you for, you know, when you used UNPLUGEDJULY, that lets them know, hey, I

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
appreciate them supporting the Unplugged show.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
So thanks, you guys.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
That's right.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Well, I'll tell you, I keep opening up new droplets.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I keep thinking, oh, God, I could do that one thing.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Oh, yeah.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
And I keep popping up a new one.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
And then I'm like, oh, you know, I could connect these together.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
I keep, it's just, it's been definitely become something I spend a lot of time doing.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
It's a lot of fun.

42:38.000 --> 42:43.000
And Wimpy, you were just telling me in the chatroom here, you moved over the Ubuntu Matea

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Remix repos to DigitalOcean London?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
I did.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
We were using build, we were using build servers in Amsterdam on DigitalOcean.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
I took some snapshots, spun up two instances in London and restored the snapshots and then

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
destroyed the Amsterdam boxes and all done.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Done?

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Done.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
That's so cool.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
I love it.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
I love it.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
It makes such a cool technology that we all hear about in the abstract actually applicable

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
to all of us.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
It makes it accessible to all of us.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
DigitalOcean.com.

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
And also, they really are fast because the SSDs make all the difference when you're building

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
an ISO image.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
And then when you've got two one gig ISO images and you can copy them to your distribution

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
servers in 18 seconds, that's pretty great.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
Yeah, buddy.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
That's awesome.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
Or like Corky is spinning one up in 31 seconds.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
31 seconds.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Okay, 31 seconds.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
How crazy is that?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Nuts.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
That's nuts.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Yeah.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
That's crazy.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
He's breaking in the London data center right now.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
I love it.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Okay.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
So speaking of breaking things in, Manjaro.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
Boy, did they have a rough weekend.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
So you guys probably heard us talk about it.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Ferronix ran a piece.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
The Manjaro developers suffer a mass exodus was the headline.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Turns out not to be exactly accurate.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
Producer Q5Sys is pretty upset that this is still a problem.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
And it's been a particular soapbox of mine.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
It's one of the reasons I launched Tech Talk today.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
It's something we've talked about here on Linux Unplugged before.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
The state of Linux journalism and news blows.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I mean there's exceptions and there's different types.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
There's casual journalism and writing and then there's actual news and event coverage.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
And that's where we're particularly weak.

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
So to recap, and I don't really mean to go after Michael in particular because I think

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
it's more of a symptom of the requirements of the industry and not a reflection of his

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
personal character.

44:26.000 --> 44:31.000
But so Ferronix came by some information that the Manjaro developers were leaving the distribution.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
No big deal.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
That happens sometimes.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
People move on.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
But that's not sexy enough to drive clips, Q5 writes.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
He says, so what we had here was a really fragrant title.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
Like Manjaro Linux developers experience a mass exodus because it drives clicks.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
It hurts the distro, but it drives clicks.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
Now in the real world of news reporting, of course, he says there's a thing called verification

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
where you independently verify from multiple sources when possible.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
He goes on to point out that the open source community is pretty available.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
A lot of developers are available on Twitter or Google Plus or on mailing lists, not always

45:02.000 --> 45:07.000
and not all projects, but probably more so than most commercial operations where journalists

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
have to verify information from commercial companies.

45:11.000 --> 45:16.000
So he thinks it's perhaps more egregious that the verification isn't happening in open source

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
news coverage.

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
And he says it's because the first to report is the first to get clicks in this world and

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
clicks equal money, so we've sacrificed truth for convenience and money.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Any thoughts on that part, Matt?

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I think he pretty much nailed it.

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
See, the problem is that you do dance a balance.

45:34.000 --> 45:39.000
Content as a revenue source these days or as a job or as a business is tough.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
It's tougher than it's ever been.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
And so a lot of companies and a lot of people that write get sucked into that vacuum of

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
having to make some tough choices.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
They want to make sure they're breaking the news, but they don't always do a real good

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
job of saying, hey, we heard through the grapevine or this has not been substantiated.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
This is merely a rumor.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Instead, it comes out as being a factual thing.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
And as Keefi points out, that's not acceptable.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
You can't do stuff like that.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
And it does blow up in your face and it does create problems and hardships.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Here's the other thing that he goes on to touch on.

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
This is something that I think makes it one of these problems that isn't going to get fixed.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
So what happens is you have a lot of misinformed users.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
The project takes a PR damage.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
It looks bad in the image.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
It's like the way you and I touch on is like even if there was a max exodus or not,

46:22.000 --> 46:26.000
the point you and I were making on Sunday's Linux action show was it's a stain on the

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
reputation regardless.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
It's a stain on the reputation and it's now in the common consciousness.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
But Q5 Sys says there's even a more ugly side.

46:35.000 --> 46:41.000
Intentionally not verifying information can sometimes create a lot of drama.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
And drama, my friends, equals clicks.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
So what's our mantra?

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
We take a story out first if it's wrong and creates drama.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
No problem.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
That's a plus.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
It'll drive more traffic to the site.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
We can later retract any false information once we actually have been presented with

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
the correct information.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
It's really quite simple math.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
Drama equals clicks.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
Clicks equal money.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
Thus drama equals money.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Rod and Corpse, go ahead.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
I was just going to say is that he said it was being kind of easier or more egregious

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
because there are so many ways to get contact with these different people.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
And that's true and it's a good thing and a bad thing because if you think about it,

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
it makes it harder to find out where these people are.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
So some projects in the open source community are almost impossible to find

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
contact information about particular people.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
But some are really easy.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
Manjaro is one of the easy ones.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
All you need to do is go to their team page on their about section and you're done.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Right.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Yeah.

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
And this is one of those problems where I understand like it's a lean operation.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
He wants to post as fast as possible.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
It's a good scoop if it's true.

47:50.000 --> 47:56.000
And he also has a, you know, it's rare to be able to legitimately totally originally

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
break a story.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
You know, you can be one of the first people to jump on a story often in tech reporting

48:00.000 --> 48:06.000
but to actually have like a source and run an original story that then you become the

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
originator of that story and everybody links to you.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
That's more than your average drama click.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
That's like something that sustains for a few days.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
And so that's a really tempting morsel to go after.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
And that's influenced by the economies of that type of site.

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
That's why and I don't see Jupiter Broadcasting isn't at a scale where we could do something

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
like this.

48:26.000 --> 48:33.000
But I would love to have a written component to our shows because if our main focus is

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
to generate revenue from the shows and potentially through Patreons and things like that,

48:37.000 --> 48:42.000
then the news reporting becomes a function that supports our shows and thus the more

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
accurate and detailed it is, the better it makes our shows.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
And so as a byproduct of producing our shows, we could produce better news potentially.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
I don't know if that's true, but I do know we don't have the scale for it.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
But we can take steps at Jupiter Broadcasting.

48:54.000 --> 48:59.000
And that's why on Sunday, Rob from the Mangero Project is going to join us on the Linux Action Show.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
And we'll just chat with Rob and find out what the hell is going on and we'll get it

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
straight from the horse's mouth and we can ask our questions.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
And Matt, as a longtime Mangero user, anything you want to throw his way, you can ask him

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
and we'll just get it straight, right?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Definitely.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
Definitely.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
I think I'd actually welcome that because I like the project.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
I just I was very frustrated by the fact that I felt like there was a lot of unknowns

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
and because it was an important box, I had to make some tough choices.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
But who knows?

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Maybe I can come back.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
Yeah.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
Maybe you can be drawn back.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Derek Devlin, go ahead.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
You have some thoughts.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
Yeah, I was wondering, I mean, doesn't people that read for Onyx already had some grain

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
of salt while reading?

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
I mean, he also iterates really quick, the articles.

49:37.000 --> 49:43.000
It's not that it's up there maliciously for too long.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
I can't see really that big of a damage.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
Right.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
It's only as much as the original developers make it a damage.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Like, oh, we are concerned.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
For Onyx said it.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Well, no.

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
I mean, the original reputation damage that he puts out without like actual researching

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
the topic, it doesn't matter if you update your comment.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
For example, the title is still the same thing.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
He didn't change the title because he would be changing the SEO stuff.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
He does pretty bad clickbait titles.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Yeah, sometimes.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
But so do I sometimes.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.000
Let me just fun fact for you guys that are not in content.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
If you want to survive in this industry, you better get used to clickbait or forget it.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Just stop.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
Just don't even bother.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
I mean, like we try to draw the line.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Like we won't say like Manjaro was dead.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Like we didn't title last that.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
Right.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
But I mean, there's definitely a line you can cross.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
You do want to kind of honestly, you want to excite people across the malicious clickbait titles.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Right.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
You don't want to.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Yeah.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Malicious stuff is horrible.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Yeah.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
And that's and that's the thing is like what he should do.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
And I don't understand why he doesn't is, OK, he's got his he's got his title.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
It's totally drawn you.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
And it's, you know, it's obviously hook in the end.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
And then when you read the article in a nice, I don't know, grad color at the very top,

50:52.000 --> 50:57.000
it says rumor mill or, you know, we heard through the grapevine.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
And then that way people know, hey, we have not substantiated this, but you might want

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
to know this is potentially a thing.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
I'd be OK with that.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
That would be fine.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
That's that's a much better idea, I think.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Here's what also resonated with me.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Go ahead.

51:09.000 --> 51:14.000
Normally on news articles like on CNN or they, you know, if it's stuff they haven't confirmed

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
yet, it's like breaking.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
And this is not confirmed.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
We've heard blah.

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
You can't just make claims and then update it after the fact if you happen to be wrong.

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
So if you do enough appropriate couching like this is a developing story.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
I could see that.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
And I think it has to be used carefully.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
You have to make it clear that you don't know this for a fact.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.000
And when you claim you know things for a fact, that's it's the opposite.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Well, this is this was Q5 point.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
And maybe this is where the community comes in is like he says, for me, the saddest part

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
was and is the community continues to allow this to happen several times a year.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
We have an instance where some news site will get something so horribly wrong that it creates

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
a huge cluster F.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
I mean, at the end of the day, doesn't the buck actually stop with the reader?

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Partly.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
But you can't just go on to claim bullets for Onix.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Everybody should know to take it with a grain of salt.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
That doesn't work.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
That doesn't scale.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Right.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
I didn't know that.

52:07.000 --> 52:14.000
The same thing has happened, you know, before that there was some journalists over at ZD

52:14.000 --> 52:19.000
net read something on the previous the Wiki and literally started a holy war for no reason.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Right.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Yeah.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Yeah.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
I know what you're talking about.

52:23.000 --> 52:27.000
But isn't that funny how that happens to and so I don't know what the right answer is.

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
I think I think I honestly I think part of the answer is slower journalism and it's something

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
now and I've talked about it.

52:32.000 --> 52:37.000
I think just more professional journalism like I understand it's it's a Web site but

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
you could try harder.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
Do less stuff.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
I see.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
I think the problem is is that he goes for he did not.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
I'm not trying to go for quality because sometimes you can tell he worked really hard on like

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
he had like this huge massive GPU comparison where he did like 50 GPUs or 60 GPUs that obviously

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
took some work.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
I'm not saying doesn't work hard but he also goes for quantity.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
Then you look at there's other sites out there like the link blogs where it's maybe one or

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
two posts or three posts a day.

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
But those three posts you almost guaranteed want to read them like like it's all good

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
stuff.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
And that also means like you could go once a week and get a whole bunch of stuff.

53:09.000 --> 53:14.000
And I think that slower journalism like one of the mantras what we have with TechSnap

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
is TechSnap is not about breaking news.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
We don't try to break stories in TechSnap ever.

53:19.000 --> 53:24.000
In fact sometimes we like it if maybe a week's gone by because then we do a deep analysis

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
of all because you have things that come in bursts of information and then there's a slow

53:28.000 --> 53:33.000
long tail where things get clarified and corrected and people think about it and write up posts

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
about it and then intelligent thinkers like Bruce Schneier and Brian Krebs write about

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
it and you can take in what they say and then you can really deliver something that's a

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
good concise analysis that's accurate.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
But when you're reporting on the moment it happens fast journalism it's just rife with

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
errors.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
And so I think the as an audience we need to say hey maybe we could slow it down a little

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
bit.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
What do you think of that Matt?

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Well here's the here's the real issue.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
It's not the journalists are definitely the causality but the same time everybody forgives

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
the aggregator.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
Now I've actually worked closely with a couple of websites to help them get listed with Google

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
News.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
It doesn't just happen automatically.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
You know there's special site maps and all sort of stuff.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
The thing is is that the aggregators are never punished for rewarding this crap.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
See that's the thing whether it be Google search or Google News or whatever the search

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
engine or news aggregator maybe we don't penalize these things because they are in fact

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
rewarded for repetition.

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
They are rewarded for quick being being first on the first on the scene.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
And so based on those things then writers are then put in an interesting position.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Sure to game it.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Yeah.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
Do they want to stay employed throw their morals to the wind or would they like to be

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
absolutely wonderful people and sign.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Yeah.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
I mean that's that's really what it is.

54:42.000 --> 54:46.000
I mean I hate to say it but it's the yeah the writers are responsible but at the same

54:46.000 --> 54:50.000
time you know I always tell people never get into writing it sucks.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
It really does.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
So I mean at the end of the day that's the thing people got to remember is also be willing

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
to penalize your aggregator.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Yeah.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
Be your own aggregator.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
That's even better.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
There's no site loyalty.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
There's no page loyalty.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
There's no brand loyalty when it comes to articles.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
No one gives a rip who it's coming from.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
They care about the title and they care about the oh is this interesting to me.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Well it sounds like Wimpy agrees with you.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
So Wimpy let me ask you this.

55:12.000 --> 55:17.000
Isn't that also then sometimes going to run the risk of overreach and censorship and things

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
like that now all of a sudden we're asking maybe somebody like Google to be the arbiter

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
of what's legitimate and what's not.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
And that's maybe a bad position to be in.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
Wimpy.

55:25.000 --> 55:30.000
Well my agreement with Matt is not necessarily about Google as the aggregator but in this

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
case as Foronix as the as the aggregator and publisher.

55:33.000 --> 55:38.000
I think that sometimes the articles that they post they know full well are inaccurate.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.000
But they are sensational and it will drive traffic to the site.

55:42.000 --> 55:48.000
And what is potentially damaging there is that it then tarnishes projects in this case

55:48.000 --> 55:53.000
Manjaro or it causes problems for projects unnecessarily.

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
And all that happens here is Foronix profit.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
And I don't want to dog on Foronix because it's one of those sites that I read every

56:00.000 --> 56:05.000
day because like you say there are little gems in there that I don't have to go off

56:05.000 --> 56:11.000
hunting for in the blend of all of the other technology feeds that I consume.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
It's useful for actually picking up the news.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
That's a good point.

56:14.000 --> 56:20.000
But there does seem to be a trend at Foronix of deliberately posting what are obviously

56:20.000 --> 56:30.000
trolley articles to drive traffic to the site and that you only have to read from what some

56:30.000 --> 56:34.000
people have submitted what they want reporting to see that it's bogus.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.000
Yeah.

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
Well Alan let me ask you this then is what Wimpy is saying is it becomes the responsibility

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
of the consumer to pick the right aggregator.

56:42.000 --> 56:47.000
It can because you know their sites kind of fall into different categories.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Some sites are just aggregated.

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
They just go out and kind of pick and choose a bunch of stories and link to them and maybe

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
they have a summary or whatever.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
And then there's the other sites that actually write original content like on Brian Krebs

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
his site is kind of a combination right.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
A lot of the stuff is his own research and then he also points to other stuff.

57:05.000 --> 57:11.000
But some sites are obviously there just to collect content that other people have written

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
and those can be very good.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
You basically have to choose to trust that site to pick the right articles for you.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
Right right.

57:18.000 --> 57:22.000
You can punish them by not returning if they don't find a different one.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
And that's kind of how TechSnap works right.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
I don't write most of the content that we present in the show.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
I'm just picking through all the news that's out there and deciding which things I think

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
are important to the viewer.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Right very much.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
I think it's a lot of our shows kind of work there.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
Same with Tech Talk today as I try to go through and pick the stories from the day that are

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
worth discussing.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
And sometimes that means the end of the week some of them maybe didn't pan out to be great

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
but most of them do.

57:46.000 --> 57:51.000
And I think that's we have so much to look at so much to consider that that's really

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
what we have to do now is pick and choose that we have to learn sources we can trust.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
And to be honest with you to you know sort of pull back the curtain a little bit that's

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
why we do so much live stuff.

58:00.000 --> 58:05.000
So you guys can show up and hear us when we're just screwing around in our raw natural selves

58:05.000 --> 58:10.000
and you can listen to us as actual human beings and decide if you trust that person if you

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
trust that human it's telling you information and maybe you don't want that maybe you do

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
but the live stream gives you a little bit of that experience.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
And I think that's one of the things that's really great about this form of broadcasting

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
is there is a direct avenue for you to kind of learn a little bit more and kind of decide

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
what you think about that person and I think that's great.

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
Let's go to last comments and we'll wrap up this topic at PC Wiz you say don't blame

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
the ad agencies bro.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Ad agencies have to make money.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
It makes money when they direct you to a person who's paying for ads.

58:41.000 --> 58:48.000
So if you're being served an ad from Google's ad network to buy some rubbish on Amazon and

58:48.000 --> 58:53.000
you buy that rubbish on Amazon then they don't care doesn't care where they got referred

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
to.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
Well yeah I mean you really can.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
I mean at each stage in fact I think that's kind of rotten Corpse's point is we're all

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
a little bit to blame aren't we rotten.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
Yeah I was just about to say like I mean in a way everybody's at fault and if you think

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
about it because like the aggregators the article writers the editors even the people

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
who are reading it if they don't if they don't even research what these people are saying

59:15.000 --> 59:20.000
to fact check it and in a way they're kind of spreading misinformation as well.

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
Yeah and it is I mean I hate to blame readers because you know you don't know what the motivation

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
is of the person who's just sitting there reading the site.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
But I don't know.

59:29.000 --> 59:36.000
I think it's kind of in a way it taints the sites themselves but it also kind of taints

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
the idea of news as a whole.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
Right.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Yeah.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
Oh it's been tainted for a long time.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
Yeah.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
The problem is is that you know we can we can high and mighty ourselves and pout each

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
other in the back all day long at the end of the day the end of the day we're all going

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
to read it.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
Yeah.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
The other factor is is that until there is a reward slash punishment system implemented

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
by somebody I don't care who or whatever it won't change.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
Maybe this is it.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Maybe this is the beginning of that sort of pushback that eventually forces a market correction.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Maybe.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Well I think that the solution is basically look more toward ethical human aggregation

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and less toward automated aggregation.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Sure.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Right.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Yeah.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
That I mean that's what we do here at Jupiter Broadcasting is we are human aggregating

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
the good content from crap.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
You know and one way.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Robots don't do that.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
One way and this is going to sound all hipster which will work great with my new iPhone 5

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I got from Ting.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
The other way is honestly if you curate who you follow on Twitter and I know that those

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
two words I just said curate and Twitter together I apologize.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I will punish myself later.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
But if you do if you're very choosy about who you follow it essentially becomes like

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
an RSS feed so if you say OK this person makes good stuff this person makes good stuff this

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
company makes good stuff and you follow them and maybe it's only like 80 to 100 people

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000
you follow every time you go to that feed it's essentially it's good stuff from people

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
you know and that's one way to kind of stay up to date.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Until we can perfect the BS detector.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Once that happens it's all good.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
What are you going to say Alan?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Well I was going to mention like the same thing because I've noticed that when the odd

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
time I go to Facebook the stories that are presented are always the link bait crap that

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000
I don't want to look at whereas Twitter because on Twitter I'm following not so much people

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I went to school with as all the people in the industry that are going to tweet things

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
that I might actually care about.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I do wish that Twitter had some more tools and settings though because a lot of the people

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
I follow are international and so when they tweet in French and Danish I would like to

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
just filter those ones out.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Yeah.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I only want to see when they're tweeting in English.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Although with you know when people tweet with all the acronyms and stuff I'm pretty sure

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
it's hard to tell when it's English and when it's not.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Oh rotten corpse points out Yahoo pipes.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000
All right Daredevil you'll get the last word you wanted to say Google Plus what the F?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Yes.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Google Plus integration in the search results if you're logged in while you search actually

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
allows you to like a URL.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000
So and you can see like which friends of yours from Google Plus like that URL while you're

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
in your search.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
I've never actually once found that useful though.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Like the theory of it makes sense to me but essentially it's gotten to the point now that

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
when I see a Google Plus result in my Google search results I just ignore it.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I completely don't even see it anymore.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I tune it out like an ad.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I do not even see it because to me it has yet because usually at absolute best it is

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
a Google Plus post where somebody is linking to a post where if Google would have just

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
given me the link one link deeper that would actually be what I want.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
But because they want to drive traffic or something to Google Plus I feel like it's

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
very hit and miss.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
But I'll try it again.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I'll give it another shot if you find it useful because I haven't tried it since they rolled

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
it out.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
No I think you got me wrong.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
What I mean is actually any search result in Google allows you to put any.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
It doesn't require to be a Google Plus post.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
It can be any search result.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I guess the problem is their implementation currently only allows you to put like while

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
you're still on the search page.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000
So people are usually going to still find the content inside that website and then not

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
rate the site because you could rate the site.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
All right.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
We should move on.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I think I'm going to close that topic.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Q5.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Good post.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
It's something we're all thinking about.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
We're taking baby steps here at Jupiter Broadcasting Network to do what we can do.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
So we've got something really I am very excited about next week.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
I am so excited.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I want to tell you about it first though.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
If you would have traveled back in time and told Chris of five years ago that he'd have

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
a sponsor like Linux Academy he would hit you in the face and told you to stop teasing

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
him because that's me.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
This is the perfect sponsor because not only are they Linux enthusiasts themselves.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
It's a group of guys who created the system from scratch because they freaking love Linux

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
and they want to help people learn Linux.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
They want you to be able to do it at your own pace at your own leisure on your own system.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
You can download the study guides and read them offline if you want to.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
They've got audio and video components.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
So if you're a podcast listener trust me that's going to snap right into your existing flow

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
and Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged will get you the summer of learning discount.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
So go over to Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged right now brand new URL to save 33 percent

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
50 bucks per quarter.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged is also a good place just to go check them out.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Give them a hit so that way they know that you heard about it here on the unplugged show

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
and you appreciate them supporting us.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Go check them out you guys.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
They've got seven plus Linux courses you can take or they support seven plus distributions

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
for their courses.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
So you choose your distro.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
So in my case let's just say I wanted to brush up on Fedora because as soon as Arch blows

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
it in my face I'm switching to Fedora.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
So I go up to Linux Academy dot com and seriously you could literally I'm not even joking this

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
is exactly what you could do.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
You choose Fedora from the options.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
They automatically adjust all of your courseware.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So now it's all Fedora specific right.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So now for somebody who's an arch guy but I want to brush up on Fedora and now I'm living

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
in the Fedora land with a guided tour I can do self paced tests to see where I'm at.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I have step by step guides.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
This is OK Chris.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
You're this far into it.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
You're going to be taking this next.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I can generate reports at any time.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I can talk to the community see how they're doing.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I have course notes and study guides for my Fedora setup.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
If I want to deploy a lamp stack a buying server an open stack whatever it is they've

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
got courses for it.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
They've got real world scenarios too which is super handy.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Like if you have an AWS project coming up and you've never worked on AWS or maybe you've

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
worked on AWS but it's been a while and you need to load up a Linux box on there and get

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
a web server going they've got courses on that and you can just go through that.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
They'll see this how long it's going to take you to do this.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Take it at your leisure download to this stuff and listen to it on your commute if you need

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
to.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
It's really awesome.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
How to get a Linux job is also a course and then they have communities discussing that.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It's really awesome stuff and I've been a subscriber now for I think since the beginning

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
of the year actually.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And what's really cool about it Matt is they have a team support.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
So if Rekai ends up getting to a point where he's banging on some stuff for JBot and he

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
needs to get a little under the hood I can just add him to my account as a group account

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
and he can get in here and now we can work with each other.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
So it's really cool if you're in a team you can do that or if you just want to work on

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
your own you have some time it's a really cool system.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
They've added support too for more and more AWS courses and then as you need a server

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
in any of the courses they'll just spin one up on the back end and they're adding new

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
courseware all the time so there's always new stuff to go check out and learn and if

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
you don't have to create a new VM every time you want to go learn something new they manage

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
all that for you as part of the service.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And when you're taking AWS courses that means you don't have to pay for AWS because it's

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
all included with the service.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.000
LinuxAcademy.com slash Dunplug get that 33% discount and take your skills up to the next

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
level.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
There's really never been a better time and this is such an amazing sponsor it's a perfect

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
match with our audience it's working with another independent startup company who's

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
doing exactly something that honestly if I had multiple lives if I had clones of me I

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
would love to run a site like Linux Academy.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It's such a perfect companion to your Jupyter broadcasting experience because we talk about

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
this stuff and then you can go get nitty gritty with that stuff.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged and thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Unplugged show.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
You know what's awesome about it is I'm always hearing from people via email it's like you

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
know I'm looking to advance my career in this field and I really need to gain some skills

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
and I really don't have time to go to a brick and mortar school or hey I'm unemployed and

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I'm looking to get some Linux skills in the first place or whatnot.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
This is a great place to actually get your feet wet and get it done today.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Yeah it's so great and it's such a neat system and they built it just to do this.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
So a couple of things.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Also just a reminder.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Join us on Sunday at the Linux Action Show 10 a.m. Pacific jblive.tv to ask your questions

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
to Rob from Mangero and keep an eye on the Linux Action Show subreddit.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
We might start a thread up there with your questions but keep it civil.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I mean I don't think you wouldn't but I'm just saying and kind of excited.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Noah, Colonel Linux and Eric and I are all heading down to OSCon.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
We'll report back.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Matt will tell you how it went and guess what?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
We decided I went for the train.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Going to ride the train down.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I'm really looking forward to that.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I'm excited.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Yeah we're catching the train in Seattle and it's kind of an evening one so Noah's going

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
to pick us up in Portland like at 930 at night.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But it's a three hour train ride but it's got Wi-Fi pretty much the whole way there.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:12.000
So I figure you know bring the Kindle, bring a few podcasts, work on some show notes during

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
the drive and we'll just kind of hang out.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I don't know if they're going to feed us Eric because of the time or what but we'll figure

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
that out.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Yeah it's a good question.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Well yeah we'll definitely figure that out.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I'm sure they have some sort of food on board.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Yeah probably.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Yeah I imagine it's fire on board.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Most trains will have like kind of a snack cart galley type situation.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Yeah.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Yeah okay.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Bring water because otherwise you'll be paying through the nose for it.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
That's my big tip.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.000
So definitely bring lots of water and bring little snacks like granola bar type things.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Anything like that would do well.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Good idea.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
My tip is don't eat anything on the train and buy me dinner when you get to Portland.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
At 9.30 at night though?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
There you go.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I mean I'm down for that but all right I'll have a snack.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I'll hold me over and maybe a snack and a flask.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I'll bring my flask and a granola bar and I'll be all right.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
I'll make it over the trip.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
So because of our OSCON shenanigans and of course that means we're going to come back

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.000
with a bunch of interviews and stuff like that but because of our OSCON shenanigans

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000
next week we're going to record episode 50 of Linux Unplugged Monday at 1pm Pacific at

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
JBLive right after Coda Radio on Monday.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
So the way it's going to work on Monday, Tech Talk today in the morning, Coda Radio and

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
then Linux Unplugged immediately following Coda Radio.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
So if you normally join us for the mumble, wow look at this we have a huge room today.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000
You guys please show up on Monday and hang out with us because we're going to pre-record

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
for Tuesday so that way when we get down to OSCON we go balls to the wall, we don't have

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
to worry about stopping to do a show because we'll just be getting interviews and clips.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
We're only there for two days so we really got to make the most out of it because Ick

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
and I hop on the train to go back Wednesday afternoon so that way I can make it back here

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
for TechSnap because you can't miss the streak of TechSnap.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
So we're only there for two days but if you're going to be down at OSCON or if you're in

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:56.000
the Portland, Oregon area the 22nd or the 23rd tweet me at ChrisLAS or shout out in

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
the Linux Action Show subreddit we'd love to meet up with you and shake your hand and

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
maybe buy you a burger or a beer or something like that.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So that'll be, it's going to be, you know it's perfect.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
It's perfect because it's a three hour train ride, we go down there, we get some great

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000
interviews for the show, we spend the night, two nights down there, we come back up.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
It's my ideal kind of coverage because you can just do it in a couple of days, you don't

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
have to fly anywhere.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
That's low stress.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Yeah, low stress and Noah, you know, once again is going to be awesome and he's going

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
to bring some cameras and equipment for us and hopefully he'll be wearing Google Glass.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Not for the interview.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Oh come on.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Oh gee, come on.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Everybody loves it.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Everybody loves Google Glass, right?

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I'm told it's not that popular.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Oh, that's weird.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
That's weird.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Yeah, he's got a good watch too.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
People are checking out your wares, Noah.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
You're becoming a bit of a celebrity, I think.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
All right, well I'll wrap us up there.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Who's got an open mic?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Rotten.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Rotten, you got an open mic there, Rotten.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Okay, so I'll leave us there.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Just want to also mention Tech Talk today.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
I do that Monday through Thursday, jblive.tv, 9 a.m. Pacific, noon Eastern.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000
We often talk about Linux related stuff in the general tech news as it applies through

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
the filter of an OS or of an open source advocate in the Linux user.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
So like sometimes I have a poke at Microsoft, I'll admit it, but I can't help it.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
It's in my nature.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
By the way, I think we still have a good time.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
So if you want to catch that, you can also join us live for that.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
We have our virtual lug.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
It's kind of like a technology call-in morning show.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Only instead of call-ins, we have a mumble room and it's way cooler than a call-in show

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
because it's doing it like you would do it if it was the year 2014.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
So Tech Talk today, Monday through Thursday.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And one of these days, Matt, when there's not a Fo show or something like that after

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
the Linux action show, we should have thought of this.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I should do a Tech Talk today with you while you're here as a prerecord.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I should have thought of that.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Oh, that would be awesome.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Well, we'll think about it.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
We'll discuss it off air and figure out a time we can do that because it would be fun

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
to have you on Tech Talk today.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I think that would be a good time, Matt.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
That would be a good time.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
All right.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Well, I'll leave it right there, ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000

Fifty episodes.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Wow.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Holy cow.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
All right, Matt.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Well, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
All right.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
See you then.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Thanks for tuning in.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Thanks for tuning in.
