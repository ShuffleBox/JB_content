1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
So Wes, have you ever owned a Windows phone?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,200
Oh, I was hoping you weren't going to ask me that.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,480
I'm ashamed to say yes.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,700
OK, I mean, it was a significant other at the time.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,580
But there was one in my household.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,280
And I definitely played with it a little.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,960
But you don't have access to it anymore then?

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,480
No, although I am curious.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,440
There was some news out this week.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,200
Microsoft, they've just kind of abandoned that whole platform,

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,700
right?

12
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,960
But they were producing new phones.

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,200
They were still getting sold.

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,120
So there's still relatively recent Windows phones

15
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,920
out there.

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,140
If you had one on the Lumia-branded smartphones,

17
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,460
which I did, there was already a jailbreak.

18
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,160
So you could actually do something useful

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,840
with this unsupported hardware that you've probably

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,520
either subsidized or paid directly for.

21
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,240
But now, thanks to actually a secure boot flaw, which

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,880
I think is hilarious considering how much work Microsoft put

23
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,800
to making that standard, thanks to that,

24
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,280
now on any Qualcomm-based, which is basically every single one,

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,520
any Qualcomm-based Windows phone, there's a jailbreak.

26
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,600
Yeah, I'm sure that devs will be rushing to port ROMs to it.

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,920
Yeah, probably not.

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,680
But if you have something like an HP Elite X3 or HTC One M8,

29
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,760
I did see that one out.

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,360
That was kind of popular, maybe more so on a better operating

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,860
system.

32
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,280
But you get what you pay for.

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,560
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 283, for January 8, 2019.

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:35,120
Hello, and welcome to your weekly Linux talk show.

35
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,680
Let's put Chris out to pasture this week.

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,640
My name is Wes.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
My name is Joe.

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,520
Thanks for joining us, Joe, especially since I

39
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,440
know you have a new toy you would probably

40
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,160
rather be playing with.

41
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,880
Yep.

42
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,560
But you're here.

43
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,400
You're helping out.

44
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,480
Chris is traveling.

45
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,600
He's already told us all about his adventures.

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,280
But meanwhile, well, there's a whole bunch of community news

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,920
to talk about, some big changes planned or not planned

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,440
for the upcoming Fedora releases.

49
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,980
And there's a shiny new kernel coming soon

50
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,960
with a brand new major version number.

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,360
Then those old GNU projects, they've got releases too.

52
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,720
It's just that time of the year.

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,600
And one of them, well, it's that bass shell,

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,300
which we all know and love.

55
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,640
Speaking of shells, we had an opportunity

56
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,340
to sit down and talk with one of the developers of the fish

57
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,580
shelf, one of my personal favorite shells.

58
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,120
We've also got a discussion coming up

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,880
about with the success of Proton,

60
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,000
are there still problems lurking at the heart of gaming on Linux?

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,840
And contributing even more, Joe had a chance

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,280
to sit down and get some information about just what's

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,480
going on with Adobe.

64
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,440
Is there any chance of Creative Cloud coming to Linux?

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,120
But before we get into any of that,

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,920
well, we're going to need a little help

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,840
from our Mumble Room.

68
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,280
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,000
Hello there.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,400
Hello.

71
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,560
Oh, aren't you guys the best?

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,160
All right, let's just get started.

73
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,480
We talked about this back in Linux Unplugged 2.77.

74
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,160
And there was some chatter going on about Fedora 31.

75
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
And was it going to be delayed by a half year?

76
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,600
Were they going to break the six month release cycle?

77
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,280
They've been discussing this since November.

78
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,840
Turns out, no, they're not.

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,720
Yeah, this was a bit of a surprise, wasn't it?

80
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,760
Because Matthew Miller came on and talked

81
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
about all the good reasons they were doing this

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,560
with all the retooling and the fact

83
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,960
that they really needed time to just wait for the release

84
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,320
and concentrate on that retooling.

85
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,520
But it seems that maybe they're just

86
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,200
going to have to get on with it and double up their work.

87
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
Yeah, as Paul Fried explained, after talking

88
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,040
with the council, as well as some

89
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,720
of the folks who are depending on the cadence,

90
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,120
especially they highlight IoT here,

91
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,080
it was clear we need to look at this option.

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,040
But for now, we're not going to have any cadence changes.

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,360
There's no changes for cadence.

94
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,200
There's no objective requirements from them.

95
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,560
Unless more specific reasons are given,

96
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,040
we're not adopting this at this time, which, OK.

97
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,000
It did seem like there was a little discussion

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,560
about, clearly, there's a lot of underpinnings in just how

99
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,520
Fedora gets made, the build processes, the CICD

100
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,200
infrastructure, all the stuff behind the scenes.

101
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,200
I know there were particularly concerns about unblocking

102
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,280
more community management, tying it

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,880
less to maybe some specific resources

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,520
that just Fedora team members have.

105
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,560
That's all important work.

106
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,480
I guess there just wasn't enough of an argument

107
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,320
about really breaking from the release cycle,

108
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,400
because even though it's not always perfect,

109
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,320
it is something a lot of people depend on.

110
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,720
Well, this does go to show that Fedora does everything

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,320
in the open, including making major decisions like this.

112
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,300
It was proposed.

113
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,680
There was a lot of support for it.

114
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,120
We thought it was going to happen.

115
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,640
But ultimately, there was discussion,

116
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,240
and the consensus was against it.

117
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,040
I suppose this kind of thing would probably

118
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,400
happen in quite a lot of projects,

119
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,360
certainly in proprietary software,

120
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,800
and we'd just never hear about it.

121
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,320
Yeah, that's a great point, right?

122
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,480
If it was in a private company, and we

123
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,360
didn't hear about the first part,

124
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,640
well, we would have never heard about it.

125
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,440
It would have just been released and no news story.

126
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,840
It also goes to show that Fedora, well, they

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,240
don't stand still, and that's a good thing, right?

128
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,120
There's a lot of great innovations coming from Fedora.

129
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
This next story is maybe an area where they're playing catch-up.

130
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,580
So we've already talked about all the data collection,

131
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,040
and Linux for a long time has kind of

132
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,360
been an environment where you had a little bit of privacy

133
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
on your desktop.

134
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,640
There was a big hullabaloo about Ubuntu adding more data

135
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,960
collection to the installer, and now Fedora developers

136
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,640
are looking at implementing a per-system UUID identifier

137
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,480
leveraged exclusively by DNF, their package manager,

138
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,100
in order to more accurately count their user base.

139
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,480
So what do you think about this?

140
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,520
Do you think that the controversy is justified,

141
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,360
or do you think that there's nothing to see here,

142
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,240
move along?

143
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,720
My mature opinion after thinking about it for a while

144
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,260
is going to have to be the second one,

145
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,680
but I think it's a question worth asking.

146
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,680
I don't think it's nonsense to bring up the topic.

147
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,920
I think the way that they've implemented it

148
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,640
seems like it's going to be OK, though.

149
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,440
They're not reusing these UUIDs.

150
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,560
Their intention is not to try to identify you as a user.

151
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,860
Mostly, they've seen a lot of problems

152
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,880
of trying to count stuff like, you know,

153
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,960
if you install six-piece copies of Fedora

154
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
behind a gnat at your house, well, that counts as one,

155
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,080
even if it was your roommate installing that.

156
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,280
They've also added a couple controls around,

157
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,000
is this just like a short-lived environment,

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
something like a container, versus an actual,

159
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,600
maybe a server install or a desktop workstation?

160
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,760
That all seems like data that would help them a lot,

161
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,280
and personally, I'm OK giving up.

162
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,320
Yeah, I don't have any problem with this,

163
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,560
and I think they kind of deserve the metrics, don't they?

164
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,600
If you're working hard at making an operating system,

165
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
you kind of want to know how many people are using it.

166
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,240
It's like counting the download numbers for a podcast.

167
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,000
We know roughly how many people download the shows that we do,

168
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
but we have no idea about any of the people

169
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
unless they write in specifically to talk to us.

170
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,880
And I do trust Fedora to do this properly.

171
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,200
They will do it all in the open, and they'll

172
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,240
make sure that this data isn't misused,

173
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,680
but then they can actually use it to do good things,

174
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,960
like concentrate on the areas where the users are,

175
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,280
and potentially even concentrate on areas

176
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,360
where they want to get new users.

177
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,280
Yeah, right, that is sort of the flip side is that you have

178
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,160
good metrics about what people are using

179
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,200
or what user bases are growing that

180
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,320
can help the limited resources that are available

181
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,280
for development.

182
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah, and it's a shame to see so much controversy about it.

183
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,520
People will just get up in arms about anything, won't they?

184
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,120
Yes, they will.

185
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,600
They also get rather excited about just about anything,

186
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,320
and that's probably going to be true about the upcoming Linux

187
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,800
release, Linux 5.0.

188
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,200
Yeah, this was going to be 4.21.

189
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
I thought it was actually going to be the 4.20,

190
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,520
but it seems that they wanted to 4.20 represent.

191
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,160
So yeah, Linus has decided that 4.21 will actually now be 5.0.

192
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,400
And there's quite a lot that's actually gone into this

193
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,120
or that's going to be going into it, quite a lot of graphics

194
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,360
stuff specifically.

195
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,480
Oh, yeah, there is a lot of graphics changes.

196
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,520
I also noticed that the Raspberry Pi touch display is

197
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,720
finally getting mainlined.

198
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,920
Hey, that's nice to see.

199
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,800
Yeah, that's long overdue, but yeah, good to see now.

200
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,120
The other one that stood out to me

201
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,000
is this new large version of the Terminus console font

202
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,080
that you can optionally compile in.

203
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,600
That's going to be useful if you've

204
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,000
got one of those fancy high DPI displays,

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,560
and you'd actually like to be able to use

206
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,120
the regular terminal before you get

207
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,480
to your graphical environment.

208
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,840
No, I wouldn't know about those high DPI displays, Wes.

209
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,880
No, I wouldn't, but that's one of those reasons, right?

210
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,560
It's not quite working well enough,

211
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,800
and since we are something of a terminal forward operating

212
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,200
system, it's nice to see this somewhat first class.

213
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,520
That's true, but I think there are other high DPI

214
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,080
concerns before that.

215
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, that's true, but this one's a low hanging fruit.

216
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,080
The other good part that probably needed

217
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,840
to get some work seen in general is

218
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,520
work to remove some of the performance hits from Spectre

219
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,240
and meltdown bug mitigation.

220
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,680
In particular, some of the network performance problems

221
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,200
that came from Google's retpoline fix.

222
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,400
That's just going to be good.

223
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,560
I mean, as long as security isn't compromised,

224
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,160
we'd like it to be both secure and fast.

225
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,900
Have we had a kernel release since the beginning

226
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,800
of last year that hasn't had some sort of mitigations in it?

227
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,080
If so, it was there were pretty few and far between.

228
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,080
And I imagine 2019 is going to just be more of the same.

229
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,240
Yeah, but it's very arbitrary, isn't it?

230
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,840
As Linus says, it's really just he

231
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,400
ran out of fingers and toes to count the number on,

232
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,720
and that's why he iterated it up to five.

233
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,480
But there is something psychological about that,

234
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,120
isn't there?

235
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,000
When the new distros come out with a 5.0, anything

236
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,680
with 4.0, whatever, it's going to seem old and crusty.

237
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,840
Yes, it will.

238
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,920
And especially, I mean, the kernel

239
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,600
has just had such an interesting history.

240
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,960
There was the two days which lasted just forever,

241
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,240
and now we're burning through version numbers.

242
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,120
I think for us people familiar with it,

243
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,160
it doesn't really matter.

244
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,000
Once you realize it doesn't really matter,

245
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,760
you just pay attention to the release notes

246
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,160
and what's going on with the kernel, you'll be fine.

247
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,380
Outsiders, though, it might be a little bit confusing,

248
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,320
especially things keep changing.

249
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,140
We have the Chrome-style version numbers.

250
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,560
We have more semantic versioning style,

251
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
and then other projects are just all over the place.

252
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,440
You know which project I love for version numbers?

253
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,640
System D. It's just so straightforward.

254
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,240
It's just a whole number, and it just

255
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,800
keeps going up and up and up.

256
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,120
No points, releases, no confusion.

257
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,840
It's just whatever the number is, add one to it.

258
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,680
Yeah, that's a system even I can understand.

259
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,080
Yeah, that's the one good thing about System D.

260
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,640
Ooh, Joe, ouch.

261
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,600
OK, well, speaking of confusion, we've

262
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,920
got a little update from the corrections department today.

263
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,200
Yeah, so on the last episode, which I was nothing

264
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,360
to do with whatsoever.

265
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,640
Didn't touch it one bit.

266
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,320
No, no.

267
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,800
You talked about this blog post on the Clear Linux blog

268
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,280
that was written by Aiki and Aoki,

269
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,720
and talking about how Clear Linux was going

270
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,480
to go and concentrate on the desktop

271
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,440
and have all this remote desktop stuff.

272
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,920
And you guys got pretty excited about that,

273
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,540
specifically because Chris had been tipping Clear

274
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,720
Linux to be the next big thing.

275
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Well, it turns out that blog post was a couple of days old.

276
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,320
Was it maybe a few hundred days old?

277
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,160
Yeah, I mean, published April 22, 2016.

278
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,920
Right, so yeah, almost three years ago.

279
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,320
Yeah, after that in 2017, they switched to Gnome, obviously,

280
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,200
as we know from using it and reviewing it.

281
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,240
Yeah, so that's not very good of us, really.

282
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,000
That was kind of all of our faults.

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,960
Chris said that we can throw him under the bus

284
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,600
because he is ultimately responsible.

285
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,280
But really, I'm going to blame Maurice Quarbek because someone

286
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,040
sent it to him.

287
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,280
He sent it to me.

288
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,000
I posted it in our Slack.

289
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,940
You guys read it and then talked about it.

290
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,200
And along that whole chain, nobody

291
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,400
stopped to look at the date.

292
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,540
So it's quite embarrassing, really.

293
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,240
It very much is, and something we try very hard

294
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,440
not to have happen.

295
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,640
And generally, we have a chain of trust, right?

296
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,200
And we only refer links that you've at least somewhat read

297
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,320
or vetted or thought this might be interested.

298
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,560
And this time, no one did it.

299
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,720
It had been discussed that there was excitement around it,

300
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,000
and that was too much for us.

301
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,120
So we're sorry about that.

302
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,240
And I just appreciate the corrections on it, though.

303
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,360
We want to be accurate, and we want to make mistakes.

304
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,920
Well, we've got to own it.

305
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,840
I will also say, a lot of the stuff

306
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,720
that it talked about in the article, XFCE things,

307
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,560
that's maybe the silver lining here

308
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,840
is XFCE still does make a great remote server desktop.

309
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah, it does.

310
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
I think from now on, you're going

311
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,880
to have to write some sort of script

312
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,480
to check all these links, go through and grab

313
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,440
the date or something.

314
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,600
You know, that was kind of my instinct as well,

315
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,520
just like a link verify or something, a procedure

316
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,920
to go through and make sure we're always up to date.

317
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,760
Well, you've probably noticed, dear audience,

318
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,400
that Joe stepped in today.

319
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,680
And we're very grateful.

320
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,640
That's because Chris, well, he's on the road.

321
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,080
And once again, you can follow right along.

322
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,400
If you go to our show notes, linuxunplugged.com,

323
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,440
slash 283, you'll find a link to the Rover tracker.

324
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,600
That lets you be as creepy as you like.

325
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,840
Surprise Chris while he's out shopping or just trying

326
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,080
to live his life, no, no.

327
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,360
But it will help you find out where he is.

328
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,320
Follow along.

329
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,480
He's tweeting updates, real cute updates

330
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,680
with some Levi pictures.

331
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,400
So go check those out too.

332
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,800
Yeah, he's in California at the moment.

333
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,360
And I'm very jealous because the weather's probably

334
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,000
a lot better than it is here.

335
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,720
You know, I'm sure it is.

336
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,440
I'm trying to get back at him in my own small way,

337
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,800
though, for abandoning us in the rain and the drizzle

338
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,560
and the cold.

339
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,760
And that's because, as you know, Chris is something of a nano

340
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,560
fan.

341
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,880
And I just can't abide that.

342
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,240
I mean, we're all welcome to our editors, of course.

343
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320
But that's just an intrinsic free choice

344
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,800
that we all have inside of us.

345
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,760
But when you have workstations that don't have Vim on them,

346
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,560
kind of upsets me.

347
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,080
So while he's been away, I've been

348
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,400
making sure every darn computer in this place

349
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,600
has Vim installed.

350
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,280
So I was thinking about editors, right?

351
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,080
And I just, I'm faster at it.

352
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,960
How do you get to the bottom of a file in nano?

353
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,920
Am I just like paging down like an animal?

354
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,040
I just don't get it.

355
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,000
You know, I've got a great idea, Wes.

356
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,160
While you're installing it, alias nano to Vim.

357
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,280
Oh, that's evil.

358
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,240
I'm not sure he would forgive me on that one.

359
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,520
Thankfully, he could figure it out and fix it himself.

360
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,320
Yeah, true.

361
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,920
Although, how would he edit the config file?

362
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,480
I think at least he's got a GUI on these machines,

363
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,600
so he could probably pull up everyone's favorite, Kate.

364
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,360
No, gedit.

365
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,440
That's everyone's favorite.

366
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,560
Oh, yeah, gedit.

367
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,160
Timeless classic.

368
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,400
Speaking of timeless classics, another recent release

369
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,800
caught my eye.

370
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,640
And that's GNU-Ed 1.15.

371
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,400
As you probably already know, or probably don't,

372
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,840
Ed is a line-oriented text editor.

373
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,340
It's used to create, display, modify, and otherwise manipulate

374
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,720
text files if you're a sadist.

375
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,240
Now, of course, no one really uses Ed anymore unless you're

376
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,320
in a very particular, maybe an embedded environment.

377
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,680
But I'm sure there are thousands of shell scripts out there

378
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,280
that still make use of it in some way

379
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,920
and have been ported from a legacy Unix environment

380
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,520
and probably still work.

381
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,920
Well, should I be embarrassed that I'd never heard of this

382
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,200
until you put it in the show, doc?

383
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,080
You know, honestly, I don't think you should.

384
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,160
It just won't come up.

385
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,760
It's an interesting piece of Unix history and trivia,

386
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,640
still getting updates to this day.

387
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,800
But you would just never have any occasion

388
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,760
to use it, especially these days with rich text editors.

389
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,040
You probably do a bunch of composition on a website.

390
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,760
So Ed is about the complete opposite.

391
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,480
It's not the only GNU release, though, is it?

392
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,800
No, no, it's not, Joe.

393
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,200
This one, I think you probably have heard of.

394
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,000
It's the Bash shell, the born-again shell,

395
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,920
a complete implementation of the POSIX shell spec.

396
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,440
5.0, they've got a bunch of new, interesting supported

397
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:46,920
variables.

398
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,040
A lot of people had actually been using Bash compiled

399
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,680
before the official release because some distributions

400
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,800
wanted these features, which that's understandable.

401
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
But now they're official.

402
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,300
They're out.

403
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,560
You can go get it.

404
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,480
They've got some nice new substitution variables.

405
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,800
The random variable works pretty nicely these days.

406
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,920
Every time you call it, you get a new random number.

407
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,840
Hey, that's nice.

408
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,120
And I think it's just nice to see

409
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,240
that such a fundamental tool that makes up,

410
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,880
even in the days of containers running

411
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,240
on virtual infrastructure as functions that

412
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,040
live for like 10 seconds, there's

413
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,840
still a whole bunch of Bash in like half of those.

414
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,820
Yeah, but common ways, who is still using Bash at this point?

415
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,760
I think a lot of people.

416
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,080
As a, let's say, prosumer on the desktop, shell switching,

417
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,200
it can be something that's pretty fun and useful.

418
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,720
But when you're in the admin server side,

419
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,960
there's a lot of pressure against that sort of thing,

420
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
mostly because, well, Bash is everywhere.

421
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,800
It's already installed.

422
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,840
I think that's less of a problem now that Linux is kind of one.

423
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,760
There's a homogeneity about the marketplace

424
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,080
that you might not have had in the days of Solaris or HPUX

425
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,440
or any of the other bigger Unix distributions.

426
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,680
But if you're just a user, maybe you're just a developer,

427
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,720
you don't have root on a bunch of these boxes,

428
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,360
Bash is going to be the shell you have,

429
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,080
so you probably have to know it.

430
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,400
Yeah, I mean, I was only joking, really.

431
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,120
The thing is, it's ubiquitous, isn't it?

432
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,360
It's even on Macs and on the Windows subsystem for Linux.

433
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,880
It's just everywhere, Bash.

434
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,240
Yeah, and there are some more minimal shells,

435
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,280
things like Dash, of course, classic SH that you could use.

436
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,640
But I think we're stuck with Bash for the time being.

437
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,320
But you don't have to be on your own.

438
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,520
And I don't frequently change shells on servers,

439
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,760
unless it's a server I either use all the time

440
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,560
or use very infrequently.

441
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,160
But for home machines, if I'm doing some processing,

442
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
if I'm really getting some work done

443
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,160
and I need some specific Bash-isms

444
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,120
or I just know how to do that really well in Bash,

445
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,680
well, it's one command away.

446
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,880
You just type, whatever your shell,

447
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,680
you just type Bash and hit Enter and you've got a Bash shell.

448
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,760
That's why on a lot of my machines,

449
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,160
well, I'm running the Fish shell.

450
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,720
And as rightly pointed out by many people,

451
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,200
Fish, it's not POSIX compliant.

452
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,280
It does things a little bit differently.

453
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,720
And for the old guard, you might not be comfortable with it

454
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,160
because it'll break a lot of assumptions.

455
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,960
But I think for someone new,

456
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,160
someone you're trying to get on Linux,

457
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,600
maybe they're interested in learning a little bit

458
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,440
about the command line,

459
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,880
maybe they're interested in development

460
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
or learning administration, anything like that.

461
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,040
They just wanna play with their computer,

462
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,440
but they haven't had 10 years

463
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,240
of using a command line before.

464
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,880
Fish really is friendly.

465
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,600
It's called the Friendly Interactive Shell.

466
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,440
And I think that really does live up to that.

467
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,720
You've got stuff like easy history searching automatically.

468
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,520
It's also got like smart directory memory.

469
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,760
So it knows if you run a command frequently

470
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,000
inside a certain path,

471
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,640
well, that command will just surface up automatically.

472
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,880
I'm curious, Joe, do you use Fish at all?

473
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,160
I have tried it before and I did find it very useful,

474
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,280
but it's not something that really stuck with me.

475
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,840
I think that it's just a case of Bash is just there.

476
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,920
It's always there no matter what machine you're on

477
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,520
and that extra little step to get Fish installed

478
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,840
is just a bit of a blocker.

479
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,920
I just forget to do it.

480
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,160
And then I just haven't got into the rhythm of using it.

481
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,600
But you've kind of pushed over that hump, haven't you?

482
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,400
And it's kind of your daily driver shell.

483
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Once you get used to it,

484
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,440
it's not on all of my machines, as I said,

485
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,960
but for just like simple common command line tasks,

486
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,240
it's really hard to beat because it is friendly.

487
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,080
It'll remember commands.

488
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,200
So if you haven't taken the time

489
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,960
to make a whole bunch of complicated aliases

490
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,320
on that machine, it's got your back on those.

491
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,280
And well, it just had a release.

492
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,040
This was just at the end of December,

493
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,960
right before the new year, Fish 300 was released.

494
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,680
Now there's some backwards incompatibility.

495
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,520
So you're gonna wanna go read the release notes

496
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,600
if you're a big Fish shell user.

497
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,280
That said, they obviously have their eye on stability.

498
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,200
So those are just kind of only the things

499
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,360
they had to change.

500
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,680
There's also some good news.

501
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,280
A lot of people as someone in the IRC

502
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,480
just pointed out, previously Fish wouldn't let you use

503
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,000
double ampersand for like an and command

504
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,760
as you would traditionally do with the bash shell.

505
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,640
They wanted you to use the literal word and,

506
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,600
they've added that syntax.

507
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,500
So there's actually a lot of new changes

508
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,420
that are really friendly for people coming from POSIX.

509
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,720
So I think now is probably a better time than ever

510
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,080
to talk about Fish shell and to give it a try.

511
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,580
Because of that, we were lucky enough to be joined

512
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,480
by Peter, one of the developers of the Fish shell.

513
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,040
He came on and chatted with Chris and I before Chris left.

514
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Let's hear a little bit more from that.

515
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,360
Anybody who's listened to Linux Unplugged for a long time

516
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,360
knows that Wes and I are both daily drivers

517
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,200
of the Fish shell.

518
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,460
We love Fish.

519
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,700
And we wanted to bring on one of the core members

520
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,480
of the project to just talk about a little bit

521
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,720
after their new release.

522
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,640
Peter, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

523
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,960
Thanks Chris, it's great to be here.

524
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Oh no, no, thank you for making it.

525
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,800
Especially sort of last minute when this just crossed

526
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,360
your mind after the new release.

527
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,820
But I thought, Peter, instead of me

528
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,520
saying it in any kind of ham-fisted way

529
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,560
that I might explain it, from your own words,

530
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,280
how do you describe Fish shell?

531
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
What is the Fish shell?

532
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,960
Sure.

533
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,320
So Fish is a command line shell like Bash.

534
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,880
If you are a Mac user and you launch the Terminal app or iTerm

535
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,440
or you're a Linux user, you launch Xterm or Kitty

536
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,480
or whatever, you have a program which draws the window frame

537
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,360
and it has some text in it, renders the text.

538
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,320
And that's called the Terminal emulator.

539
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
And the shell is the program running

540
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,160
inside the Terminal emulator that will receive the text

541
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,760
that you input and then, based on that,

542
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,160
decide what commands to run.

543
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,960
So a lot of users are initially confused

544
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,120
about the distinction between the Terminal emulator

545
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,320
and the shell.

546
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,000
And Fish occupies the same space as Bash, as Zshell,

547
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,480
as some other ones like TCH.

548
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,440
I like that explanation.

549
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,920
That's probably much better than the one I would have given.

550
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,040
No kidding.

551
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,160
So I guess I have to ask you the biggest question on my mind.

552
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,440
And that is, how do you get people to use Fish shell?

553
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,640
Because everybody's just got Bash by default now.

554
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,880
Bash is sort of the default, and default is sort of supreme.

555
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,640
And Fish shell is an alternative to that.

556
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,960
And in most cases, or maybe in a lot of cases at least,

557
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,640
people might not even be aware that they can switch a shell.

558
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,760
So how does Fish shell fit in with that?

559
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,560
How does that work?

560
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,400
How does that?

561
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,440
I guess the better way to put that is,

562
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,560
how do you feel about the fact that Bash may always

563
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,080
remain dominant and supreme?

564
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,160
And some people may not even know they can switch.

565
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,520
Does that affect the way you work on the project?

566
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,680
Does that affect you in any way?

567
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,520
That seems like a major elephant in the room

568
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,640
with a project like this.

569
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,080
Yeah, that's a great question.

570
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,200
Driving adoption is certainly a challenge for our project.

571
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,640
For the reason you said, Bash is very entrenched.

572
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,360
And shells are like text editors.

573
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,720
They're very personal.

574
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,880
When you develop a lot of techniques and muscle memory

575
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,000
to use these tools day to day, that

576
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,880
makes it a challenge to switch, because when

577
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,360
you try a new project, it feels unfamiliar, right?

578
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,200
The things you're used to don't work.

579
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,960
None of your muscle memory applies or less of it

580
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,120
applies, and there are surprises.

581
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,640
And so one of the ways that we try

582
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,200
to address that in the Fish shell

583
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,840
is we try to identify the features that users miss

584
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,280
from Bash the most, and then we add them in.

585
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,200
And we're conservative about that.

586
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,760
We do that slowly, but that's one of the ways

587
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,080
that we can help make users feel more comfortable initially.

588
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,240
It also helps that Bash is missing out

589
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,320
on a lot of user-friendly features, features

590
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,920
that are part of the Fish shell.

591
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,000
We say that the Fish shell is a command line

592
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,080
shell for the 90s.

593
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,440
That illustrates that in a lot of ways,

594
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,280
command line shells are stuck in the past,

595
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,640
but we think that Bash is a command line

596
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,480
shell from the 80s.

597
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,760
It doesn't have features like syntax highlighting.

598
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,840
It doesn't have features like autocompletion and so forth.

599
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,240
So one of the ways that users learn about the Fish shell

600
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,480
is they just see it on other people's screens,

601
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,320
on other users' screens.

602
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,120
They're like, wow, that looks really cool.

603
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,880
How can I get that?

604
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,160
And it spreads by word of mouth.

605
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,640
Yeah, that has definitely been my experience,

606
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,680
not only how I found it, but how others have found it

607
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,320
after they saw it on my screen.

608
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,240
And you described it as it's a personal thing.

609
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,120
I used the word when I was chatting with Wes

610
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,080
before we sat down.

611
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,280
It's also maybe the most intimate software

612
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,920
I use on my computer, because I'm not just interacting with it

613
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,040
and clicking it.

614
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,320
I'm communicating with it.

615
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,800
Yeah, it sees everything that you run,

616
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,520
and it enables you to use your machine.

617
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,760
And there's not much software these days

618
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,640
that I have a very strong emotional opinion about,

619
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,720
where you could use language like love,

620
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,360
as for how strongly I love Fish shell.

621
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,960
I really feel strongly about it.

622
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't feel that way about a lot of software anymore,

623
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,320
but Fish shell is still one of them.

624
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,040
And so there's something special about building a shell.

625
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,720
So the project's been around now, what, since 2005?

626
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,540
The project is around since 2005.

627
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,880
That was the first release.

628
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,160
I was not on one of the original authors of the Fish shell.

629
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,440
That would be Axel.

630
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,840
I wanted to attempt his last name,

631
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,920
but you can put it in show notes.

632
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,600
And Axel started the project in 2005 as the first release.

633
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,600
And I think development started to slow down around 2010.

634
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,720
And that's when I picked it up.

635
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,920
And I was a user of the Fish shell,

636
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,000
and I was very happy with it.

637
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,360
But there were some bugs I found or things

638
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,680
that I thought could work a little differently.

639
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,640
And I just decided to scratch my own itch

640
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,160
and set out to fix them.

641
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,680
And I figured it would take me a week.

642
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,360
And then a year later, I was pretty embedded in it

643
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,000
at that point.

644
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,760
So that's how I got my start, just scratching my own itch.

645
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,480
Well, isn't that interesting.

646
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
How many stories have we heard like that, where somebody

647
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,960
starts scratching their own itch?

648
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,200
You guys just recently had a big release, too.

649
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,080
Was it version 3?

650
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,400
Is that the new version that just came out?

651
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,920
3.0, or is it 0.3?

652
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,880
It is 3.0.

653
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,680
So this is the third major release.

654
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,000
The first major release where I was on the project

655
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,200
was 2.0 and 3.0 signals that we've

656
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,960
made some fairly radical changes in this release.

657
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,080
And that's why we think it deserves a new major version

658
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,600
number.

659
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,560
Would you chat a little bit more about those?

660
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,120
One thing I've always liked about Phish

661
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,120
is I have it on some systems, not all, unfortunately.

662
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,440
But whenever I use it, I'm not concerned, usually,

663
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,740
that things are going to break.

664
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,840
It's mostly just work.

665
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,440
So are there some things people really

666
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,560
need to look out for when they upgrade here?

667
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,280
There's a few things that are different,

668
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,080
but we don't want anyone to have an experience where they

669
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,440
install it and their software breaks.

670
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,400
So a lot of the changes are backwards compatible.

671
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,720
So for example, we support now in 3.0 the double ampersand

672
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,960
for AND or double pipe for OR, a very long requested feature.

673
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,280
But the old syntax, the explicit AND and OR commands

674
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,080
are still supported.

675
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,440
So none of that breaks.

676
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,240
Very good.

677
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,840
Yeah.

678
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,720
We also have a way of staging breaking changes

679
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,000
called feature flags, which allow users to opt into it.

680
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,720
So these are changes that we plan

681
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,160
to make in the future when the current syntax is deprecated.

682
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,520
So this includes, for example, question mark as a glob.

683
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,400
This often breaks users who paste in the URL,

684
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,040
and this will be interpreted as a wildcard.

685
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,680
So with 3.0, we plan to eventually remove

686
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,720
the question mark wildcard.

687
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,200
But in 3.0, you can opt into that removal

688
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,240
by just setting a feature flag in one of your variables.

689
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,920
So there's a lot of forward-looking features

690
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,880
in the 3.0 release like that.

691
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,320
Is the feature flag new to 3.0, or has that

692
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,520
been around for a while?

693
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,480
The whole mechanism of staging these deprecations

694
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,640
and breaking changes is part of 3.0.

695
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,140
Wow.

696
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,640
Interesting.

697
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,680
It signals a bit of a philosophical shift

698
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,280
where we're trying to be a little less dogmatic

699
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,200
and a little more practical and move a little faster, right?

700
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,680
It is very rare to have any program,

701
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,920
but especially a shell, remove features.

702
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,400
Normally, they just secrete features over time.

703
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,800
So we want to have the capability

704
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,440
to have the right feature set, not just the sum of all past

705
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,040
feature sets.

706
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,540
Right.

707
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,480
But how you actually pull that off

708
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,680
is a little new in the world of shells.

709
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,560
And getting it right is important.

710
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,480
That's right.

711
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,760
It is a little risky, so we'll see how it works out.

712
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,280
Yeah.

713
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,480
Oh, I'm excited to hear that.

714
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,240
Let's keep talking about the practical stuff for a moment.

715
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,000
One of the things I love about Fish Shell, to be honest

716
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,720
with you, is I can load it everywhere, Fedora, Arch,

717
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,680
Ubuntu, and even Mac OS, and probably the subsystem

718
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,760
for Linux if I was on a Windows box.

719
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,520
And I really appreciate that fact.

720
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,720
It's one of the, I mean, obviously,

721
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,800
Bash is everywhere, but I don't want to use Bash, right?

722
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,760
I want to use Fish.

723
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:38,200
So I'm curious, roughly, is Linux your largest

724
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,960
install base?

725
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,320
Do you have, are there a bunch of Windows users?

726
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,040
What's the user base look like for Fish?

727
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,240
Yeah, honestly, I don't know that.

728
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:51,680
I mean, Linux and Mac are both huge, the largest users,

729
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,200
of course.

730
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,160
But we don't track how many users there

731
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,520
are from any particular platform.

732
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,920
There's no telemetry in the Fish Shell, so we don't know.

733
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,480
But we do have a lot of actually surprising use cases

734
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,960
that we discover.

735
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:12,760
The team that is on Haiku, which is the BOS recreation,

736
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,360
they have a lot of Fish Shell fans there.

737
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,120
And they have Fish Shell running on Haiku.

738
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
That's awesome.

739
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,600
Makes me really happy.

740
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,320
WSL, a Windows subsystem for Linux,

741
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,840
there's also a number of users there.

742
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,320
I actually feel like WSL is a big opportunity for the Fish

743
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,000
Shell because users who have WSL are less likely to be,

744
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,800
you know, have a long history with Bash.

745
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,760
So they're coming at it with fresh eyes.

746
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,040
Yes.

747
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,640
I run it on my Raspberry Pi.

748
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,120
I run it on AWS.

749
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,480
We even have a user running Fish on the TH2,

750
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,360
which is a 33 petaflop supercomputer in Guangzhou,

751
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,320
China.

752
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,200
Right on.

753
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,760
I bet Fish runs just great on there.

754
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,000
I bet it does.

755
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,080
I bet it does.

756
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,600
Fish has always been one of those projects where

757
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,760
you install it, and the defaults have just felt right.

758
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,560
I've been able to install Fish and then run it for six months

759
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,880
before I even changed a single thing.

760
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,800
I really love it.

761
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,800
And I think it's one of the projects

762
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,000
that you can install on a new Linux user's computer

763
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,640
and make the command line a little less intimidating.

764
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,720
And that has massive potential.

765
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,160
I agree completely.

766
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,440
One of the design goals of Fish is that it be very user

767
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,080
friendly.

768
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,960
And the way we design features is we start by thinking about,

769
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,320
what do we want the user to see, to encounter?

770
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,280
And then we work backwards to the implementation

771
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,680
of the feature from there.

772
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,040
So for example, setting your prompt

773
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,440
can be done either via the command line

774
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
or via a graphical UI.

775
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,640
There's a command Fish config, which spins up a little web

776
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,000
server and opens a web page that connects to that, all local.

777
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,640
And there's nothing on the network here.

778
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,360
It allows you to set your colors and your prompt and so forth

779
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,560
just with a graphical UI.

780
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,000
So that's much more convenient for new users

781
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,920
compared to, for example, setting the PS1 variable

782
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,680
for controlling your prompt like you would do in Bash.

783
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,200
Which is how I had been doing it.

784
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,860
What's funny is I've been using Fish for years and years

785
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,400
and years.

786
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,080
And it was only until last week that I

787
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,620
ran Fish config for the first time

788
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,960
and did it through the web page.

789
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,320
I've always just done it the old way, the old school way,

790
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
because I'm used to the way Bash does it.

791
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,920
That's how you assumed you would do it.

792
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,620
But that web page was great because there

793
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,440
was pre-suggested themes and looks and styles

794
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,420
for my command line that I love.

795
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:35,920
I love.

796
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,600
And it's an example of making, again, the command line

797
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,860
accessible to people that are maybe transitioning

798
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,360
from another platform where you don't use the command line as

799
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,800
much.

800
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,660
And I think one of the things that

801
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,400
makes Linux more usable as a platform

802
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,200
is if we just acknowledge sometimes it's OK

803
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,280
to use the command line.

804
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,480
And people don't like that, but we

805
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,980
can make the command line a better experience.

806
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,480
Yeah, right.

807
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,840
If we just embrace that and say, we have a great command line.

808
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,680
Well, Peter, what else should people know about?

809
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,920
Is there anything you want them to check out

810
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,000
for the project or things you guys are working on

811
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,360
or any destinations you want to send them?

812
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,960
Well, the project is hosted on GitHub.

813
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,340
We have five contributors on the project other than me

814
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,800
who are very regular and very passionate.

815
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,680
I'd like to give them some credit here

816
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,680
because many of them are even more active than I am.

817
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,280
In particular, I want to give credit

818
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,700
to David Adam and Fabian, who are both very long time

819
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,560
contributors.

820
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,200
And we have Aaron Guise, who's done a ton of great work

821
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,560
across all parts of the shell.

822
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,360
And we have Saeed Shuar, who was with me from the beginning.

823
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,800
And Mahmoud is our newest contributor,

824
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,600
who's very active in porting fish and getting it running

825
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,480
well on WSL.

826
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,060
So I'm really grateful for all their contributions.

827
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,040
It's actually pretty easy to get started contributing

828
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,840
to the fish shell.

829
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,160
A lot of contributors just have a command they want to run,

830
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,760
and tab completions aren't working for it properly.

831
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,840
So they can just add a tab completion.

832
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,560
And that's a very easy way to get started

833
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,920
or improving the documentation.

834
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,360
So if you'd like to contribute, if you're a fish shell user,

835
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,760
it's very easy to get started contributing to the shell.

836
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,800
Yeah, I think especially in this case.

837
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,120
That's more so than what is even, I think, common with

838
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,460
an open source project like this.

839
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,080
There's some stuff in there that is really

840
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,960
user-facing, like documentation that anybody

841
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,480
can participate in.

842
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,720
Well, Peter, thanks so much for coming on the show.

843
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,400
Thanks to you and the entire team

844
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,960
for working on one of my absolute favorite pieces

845
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,000
of open source software.

846
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,080
All right, thanks, Chris.

847
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,720
Thanks, Wes.

848
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,440
And thank you to Peter for coming and chatting with us

849
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:32,960
about that.

850
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,240
Peter was great, real friendly.

851
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,420
And it's an interesting tale, because as we

852
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,040
talked about in that interview, at around 2012,

853
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,120
Phish development had stagnated.

854
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,880
It's very obvious if you go look at the commit analysis

855
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,320
over on GitHub.

856
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,760
And Peter stepped in and sort of reinvigorated the project.

857
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,240
And they've just had a recent release.

858
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,440
He wasn't the one who released it, right?

859
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,640
There's enough other people in the project

860
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,680
that there are several main contributing developers.

861
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,200
So it seems healthy.

862
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,400
It's probably not for some expert users.

863
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,000
It might not even be a forever shell

864
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,500
if you're going to go off and become like a terminal expert.

865
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,000
But I think it's a shell that thinks

866
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,040
about what the interaction between a user and a computer

867
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,120
should be in a terminal environment.

868
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,360
They're exploring interesting grounds.

869
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,720
He almost made me switch to it.

870
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,720
He almost convinced me, but almost.

871
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,760
Well, you do need to be the curmudgeon, Joe.

872
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,240
What would we do without you?

873
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,720
OK, so let's move on to another area

874
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,160
I've been excited about recently.

875
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,920
That's gaming on Linux, and it's just some of my friends

876
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,880
who are not Linux desktop enthusiasts.

877
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,720
They might not even listen to the show.

878
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,560
But they make a lot of comments about how great Proton is,

879
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,360
how they can use their Linux desktops to game.

880
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,720
And I've certainly experienced that.

881
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,160
I've been advocating for it more.

882
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,960
But while we were getting excited about that,

883
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,200
we talked a lot about it here on Jupiter Broadcasting

884
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,320
over our various holiday and year-end review episodes.

885
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,360
There was a discussion right around the new year

886
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,040
over on Twitter that I missed until now.

887
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,360
It started with a tweet from Ben Golos, who

888
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,240
works over at Uber Entertainment,

889
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,920
actually local here over in Kirkland, Washington.

890
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,960
They make Planetary Annihilation.

891
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,200
And while the discussion is basically

892
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,800
they shipped Planetary Annihilation on Windows, Mac,

893
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,600
and Linux, Linux users were actually

894
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,480
a big vocal part of the Kickstarter for the project.

895
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,040
But in the end, they accounted for less than 0.1%

896
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,200
of the sales and greater than 20%

897
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,440
of auto-reported crashes and support tickets.

898
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,040
Most of that graphics driver-related, I guess.

899
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,880
His opinion would totally skip Linux.

900
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,180
So does this mean, is this a fundamental problem?

901
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,760
Is there something we're missing here?

902
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,040
Or does it just mean that much like Electron apps,

903
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,960
we're going to get games, we just won't get them natively?

904
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,560
I think that that is the reality of the situation.

905
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,280
Because if you look at this Twitter thread,

906
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,920
it's easy to kind of come down on the side of, well,

907
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,240
it's just not worth supporting Linux.

908
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,760
But then people have chipped in on the Hacker News

909
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,840
thread about this that surfaced this week,

910
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,600
saying that, well, they did it wrong.

911
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,320
They didn't go into it with their eyes fully open.

912
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,600
They kind of thought it would be easy to port it to Linux.

913
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,400
And the reality dawned on them that it was actually

914
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,160
quite hard.

915
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,600
And I think in that Twitter thread,

916
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,600
there's a very, very depressing and telling phrase

917
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,680
that he says, adding Linux support

918
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,880
ended up likely costing Uber hundreds of thousands

919
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,360
of dollars for a few hundred dollars in sales.

920
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,120
And that just doesn't look good for anyone

921
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,680
trying to port any software to Linux, never mind just games.

922
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,800
Yeah, that is true.

923
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,600
And that's part of the problem is,

924
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,440
even if we have a more successful game development

925
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,160
story in 2019, you might not know about it.

926
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,680
You might not know the right choices.

927
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,840
You might not.

928
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,040
That's hard to find.

929
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,000
There is no universal development kit to target.

930
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,600
You can be an expert at game development

931
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,680
and still not be able to develop for our platform

932
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,840
and have it be a success.

933
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,480
And that's concerning.

934
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,160
When the whole Proton thing broke as a story,

935
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,400
there was kind of two ways to look at it.

936
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,880
One is that, OK, well, this means

937
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,920
that no one will bother developing natively for Linux

938
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,720
anymore.

939
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,680
But the other way to look at it was, well,

940
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,920
it will enable a lot of Linux users to use these games,

941
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,200
play these games that they otherwise couldn't before.

942
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,760
And it will potentially make people

943
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,160
on the fence about switching to Linux make that switch.

944
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,280
And then where the users are, the development goes.

945
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,880
I think that realistically, it's probably the former rather

946
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,280
than the latter, though, isn't it?

947
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,320
That you're much more likely to get just Windows games working

948
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,440
and tested with Proton, and that's good enough.

949
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,800
Why bother doing a whole native port

950
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,960
when you can just use this off-the-shelf solution

951
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,760
from Valve?

952
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,040
Yep, that is true.

953
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,600
And then even more so, we're still,

954
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,460
even with it working really well just out of Valve,

955
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,160
you're still going to buy a computer that

956
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,360
probably has Windows on it.

957
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,800
And if you're a gamer but not a Linux fan,

958
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,300
there's not going to be a big reason that you should ever

959
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,000
switch to Linux.

960
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,840
Now, you might have a better switching story

961
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,960
if you eventually happen to listen to this program, say.

962
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,000
But we're just still same old, same old, I guess.

963
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,200
I don't know, though, Wes.

964
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,560
My Evo 970 didn't come with Windows on it.

965
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,400
It came completely blank, and I had to install whatever

966
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,240
I wanted onto it.

967
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,880
And that's the reality for most gamers who build their PC.

968
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,600
I mean, most enthusiasts who want to go full RGB and all

969
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,920
of that, they build their machines.

970
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,080
So this argument of that they come with Windows,

971
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,400
I don't think is necessarily true.

972
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,960
Obviously, laptops come with Windows.

973
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,240
But if you're doing a self-build,

974
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,760
and no self-respecting gamer would use a pre-built desktop,

975
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
surely.

976
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,600
Yeah, sure, sure.

977
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,180
Yeah, of course.

978
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,760
But they just consider Windows to be part of that build.

979
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,400
No, that's a very interesting point.

980
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,920
Like, there's this cultural element.

981
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,160
So if we can maybe change some of that,

982
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,980
then if you're already an enthusiast,

983
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,560
you're willing to do research, you're

984
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,840
willing to maybe tweak or tune, Linux does

985
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,280
have a better story there now.

986
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,400
Yeah, but you only have to look at big gaming and PC YouTube

987
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,200
channels, like Linus Tech Tips.

988
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,120
And he had this video, Linux gaming

989
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,160
doesn't suck, because the assumption was

990
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,280
that it would just suck.

991
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,120
And then he actually tried some Linux games

992
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,280
and said, actually, they're all right.

993
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,320
And that was a surprise.

994
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,740
And that's that culture, isn't it,

995
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,480
that gaming really is all about Windows.

996
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,480
That's just been the assumption for 20-plus years,

997
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,240
that if you want to play games on a PC,

998
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,360
you're using Windows to do that.

999
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

1000
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,400
And unfortunately, there are still many workflows

1001
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,640
that you might need a Windows or another proprietary operating

1002
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,080
system to get your work done.

1003
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,520
And one of those, for a long time and still remains one,

1004
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,680
is the Adobe platform, their whole creative suite

1005
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,440
of applications.

1006
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,880
I know, I mean, I've used them over the years.

1007
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,920
I don't have them now.

1008
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,720
But they're obviously the standard.

1009
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,480
And Linux users, for a long time,

1010
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,800
have been wondering, do we have even a shot of ever getting

1011
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,120
these applications?

1012
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,480
You've done some hard work and found out a little bit more

1013
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,760
information, though, Joe.

1014
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,400
Yeah, I've been chatting with Jason Evangelo, who

1015
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,920
has become well-known in the last few months,

1016
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,320
I suppose the back half of last year, for writing for Forbes.

1017
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,400
He kind of switched from writing about gaming and hardware

1018
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,940
to writing about Linux as he got into Linux.

1019
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,560
And it's just become really, really popular.

1020
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,800
Everyone seems to be following on Twitter

1021
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,920
and reading his articles.

1022
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,040
And more importantly, it seems that he

1023
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,880
has driven a lot of people into our community, people

1024
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,320
who are into gaming or kind of on the fence or whatever.

1025
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,840
He is really doing good stuff for the whole Linux community,

1026
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,280
as far as I can see.

1027
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,000
And he's very pragmatic.

1028
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,840
I know, OK, some people are going to say,

1029
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,120
oh, we don't want that proprietary software.

1030
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,440
Why don't you just use Kdenlive or whatever or GIMP or Krita?

1031
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,240
But the reality is that if we are

1032
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,040
going to grow the Linux user base,

1033
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,480
we're going to need some of these huge proprietary

1034
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,240
commercial bits of software, like Creative Cloud.

1035
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,400
And he is very much of that belief.

1036
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,040
He's very much a pragmatist.

1037
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,840
We need both, right?

1038
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,640
We should have good open source technology,

1039
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,840
but we also need to use what the market's using.

1040
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,320
Well, in an ideal world, we wouldn't

1041
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,320
need any proprietary software at all.

1042
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,920
But it's a vicious circle of the proprietary software

1043
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,400
isn't there so the users don't come to the platform,

1044
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,320
and then the developers don't develop open source software

1045
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,160
for them to use.

1046
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,680
So I think it's hard for me to say

1047
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,760
that I want this proprietary software to come to Linux,

1048
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,760
because I don't think I would use very much of it if it did.

1049
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,160
But I think that an awful lot of people would,

1050
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,520
and that would be better overall for Linux,

1051
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,960
because this is all additional stuff.

1052
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,680
It's like the Proton stuff.

1053
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,360
It's like Steam.

1054
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,960
It's like the graphics drivers.

1055
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,600
You don't have to use any of that stuff.

1056
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,920
You can run Debian or Triskel or whatever

1057
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,080
and just run completely free software.

1058
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,080
That's a good point.

1059
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,760
It's all additions to Linux and free software.

1060
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,360
So I see it as a good thing.

1061
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,800
But yeah, he had a chance to talk

1062
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,080
to some people from Adobe, some quite important people

1063
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,960
actually.

1064
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,840
And so I thought that I would catch up with him

1065
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,600
and get him on the show and speak

1066
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,120
to him about how that went.

1067
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,160
And so should we have a listen to that?

1068
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,000
Let's do it.

1069
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,800
Thanks a lot for coming on the show, Jason.

1070
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,960
Yeah, you bet.

1071
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,840
Happy to be here.

1072
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,120
Yeah, we've been wanting to get you on Linux

1073
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,200
unplugged for a long time.

1074
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,560
And finally, the timings have worked out.

1075
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,460
Yeah, and before, when you asked me the first time around,

1076
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,160
I was really shy.

1077
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,000
And now I'm not.

1078
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,920
So just a little bit of background.

1079
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,760
You've been writing for Forbes for quite a while now.

1080
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,520
And in the relatively recent past,

1081
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,920
you started writing about Linux.

1082
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,200
And those articles have really taken off.

1083
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,760
And you've used your Twitter following as well

1084
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,800
to kind of help that.

1085
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,560
And it's just gone a bit crazy, hasn't it?

1086
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,480
It has, in a very unexpected way.

1087
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,720
When you spend like six years on a major platform talking

1088
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:24,560
about AMD and NVIDIA and Intel and reviewing big products

1089
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,560
and things like that or just breaking news,

1090
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,400
and then six years later, you kind of

1091
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,420
stumble into Linux for the first time in like 13 years

1092
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,000
and fall in love with it.

1093
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,720
And at that point, I gradually decided, you know,

1094
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,800
I'm loving this.

1095
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,040
I'm loving the discovery and really loving

1096
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,600
just writing about it and being so engaged on Twitter

1097
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,000
and Facebook with people who are enjoying the content.

1098
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,160
It's been a repeatable thing where I will take,

1099
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,920
say I'm writing two articles in one day.

1100
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,500
And I'll say, OK, hey, Introware is launching their Aries

1101
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,720
all in one desktop PC with Ubuntu and Ubuntu Mate, right?

1102
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,160
And then the same day, I'll write something about NVIDIA.

1103
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,360
And the Introware article will get more traffic.

1104
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,080
And it blows me away every single time.

1105
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,720
But it is becoming a consistent thing.

1106
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,820
And I think that there's a really, at least to me,

1107
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,040
a surprisingly large audience who

1108
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,000
is hungry for that content in kind

1109
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,800
of a, I guess, non-technical, more conversational manner,

1110
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,840
if that makes sense.

1111
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,600
Yeah, well, it seems to be working for you.

1112
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,000
I've seen you post stats about the Linux articles being

1113
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,320
the most popular of all time, almost.

1114
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:49,400
Yeah, towards the end of the year, I wrote about Deepin.

1115
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,840
And it was just kind of an opinion piece,

1116
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,280
talking about why I think that it's

1117
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,560
a more beautiful desktop experience than Windows

1118
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,160
and Mac OS.

1119
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,600
And within a few weeks, that climbed to the number three

1120
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,320
most viewed article since 2012.

1121
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,320
We're talking about beating stuff like Pokemon Go

1122
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,080
when it launched and things like that.

1123
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,000
I mean, yeah, incredible, just incredible.

1124
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,040
Months later, I'm just still blown away.

1125
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,880
And it's been a blast.

1126
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,960
But just before Christmas, there was a bit of a blow up

1127
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,760
on Twitter about Adobe and Premiere.

1128
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,080
And people requesting that for Linux.

1129
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,520
And you managed to send so much traffic their way

1130
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,600
that they shut down the topic.

1131
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,720
So what was all that about?

1132
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,440
They did.

1133
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,720
I think that I actually heard about it

1134
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,960
through a couple of my Twitter followers

1135
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,760
and also Michael at Foronix.

1136
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,640
And I want to make sure people understand he's

1137
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,480
the one who wrote it first, right?

1138
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,560
I just kind of elevated it and gave it a bit more exposure.

1139
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,200
But I do want to make sure that people realize

1140
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,840
he kind of broke that news.

1141
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,800
But anyway, I wrote an article saying, hey,

1142
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,380
Adobe wants your feedback on bringing Premiere Pro to Linux.

1143
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,360
And the tweet blew up.

1144
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,440
The article blew up.

1145
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,260
And I think within three or four days,

1146
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:21,000
they had somewhere north of 6,000 upvotes for that.

1147
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,520
And a lot of really healthy discussion

1148
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,360
in there between both the Linux community and a lot

1149
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:32,320
of the Adobe staff, like I think it was Patrick Palmer, who

1150
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,480
does, he's their senior product manager

1151
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,840
for professional video editing for Creative Cloud.

1152
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:42,040
And at some point, someone alerted me to the fact

1153
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,240
that it was just gone.

1154
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,080
They're like, I'm trying to click the link in your article.

1155
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:45,880
It's just not there.

1156
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,440
It's nowhere.

1157
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,800
It's gone.

1158
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:53,840
And Adobe Help, actually, got in touch with me.

1159
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,360
And they said that it had received so much,

1160
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,320
like a surge in upvotes, that it had triggered their spam

1161
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,240
filters, and they had taken it down.

1162
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,640
They just had no idea that it would be so popular.

1163
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,320
So that got resolved.

1164
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,280
And yeah, that got resolved soon.

1165
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,280
And that was good.

1166
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,480
And then people kept on voting.

1167
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,240
So after that, sometime after that,

1168
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,480
Adobe's Help account on Twitter actually reached out to me.

1169
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,000
And they were like, hey, Bill Roberts and Patrick Palmer

1170
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,160
would love to just chat with you about your point of view

1171
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,040
as someone in the Linux community

1172
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,000
looking at the possibility of Adobe products being

1173
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,840
ported over to Linux.

1174
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,360
And I said, great, let's do it.

1175
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,200
And so yeah, we got on the phone like four or five days later,

1176
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,600
and we had a really great chat.

1177
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,400
But before you had this chat with them,

1178
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,400
they did officially respond and say something along the lines

1179
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,960
of, we take this interest very seriously,

1180
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,640
but don't get your hopes up.

1181
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,480
There's a lot of fragmentation with Linux,

1182
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,480
and it's not just supporting one platform.

1183
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,200
It means supporting loads of different ones

1184
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,320
and basically saying, thanks for the interest,

1185
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,920
but don't hold your breath.

1186
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,200
Yeah, and I think that that discouraged a lot of people.

1187
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,920
But in a way, Joe, I kind of appreciate them

1188
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,840
for not getting people's hopes up.

1189
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,280
Although through the course of the chat we had,

1190
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,920
it became apparent to me that what matters right now

1191
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,400
is that this is a possibility.

1192
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,700
And this is what they told them.

1193
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,160
This is what Bill and Patrick said.

1194
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,960
They're like, this is a possibility now.

1195
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,000
They weren't entertaining this idea before.

1196
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,160
Oh, wow, so it really has made a difference then.

1197
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,520
It really has.

1198
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,860
And I don't know if it was, let's be honest,

1199
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,440
it probably wasn't the user voice post and feedback

1200
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,160
that prompted that, but it may have helped, right?

1201
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,640
It may have definitely changed or influenced maybe

1202
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,400
their timeline or brought a few other important members

1203
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,120
of the team over to the Linux side of the fence.

1204
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,320
I don't know, but what matters is

1205
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,320
that they are looking at this as something that's possible now.

1206
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,160
And when they said that there was this fragmentation problem,

1207
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,720
everyone replied to them saying, snaps, flat packs,

1208
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,200
snaps, flat packs.

1209
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,040
Is that something that they weren't aware of or what?

1210
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,040
They're very aware of it.

1211
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,840
And I kind of brought that up.

1212
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,320
I said, hey, you can use stuff like Vulkan.

1213
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,600
You can focus maybe on just one distro

1214
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,680
and don't spread yourself too thin.

1215
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,520
But they're completely aware of all

1216
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,800
of the technical environments surrounding

1217
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,120
what it would take to port Premiere Pro over to Linux.

1218
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,920
But Patrick's problem is that there's

1219
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,040
a major difference between developing and testing, right?

1220
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,520
Because sure, they could develop it for Ubuntu.

1221
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,080
But it will get used on other distributions, right?

1222
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,640
And there's all these combinations

1223
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,280
of distro and CPU and GPU and everything else.

1224
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,960
And the cost of testing those and scaling that up

1225
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,960
is what concerns them.

1226
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,880
But beyond that, they want the product

1227
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,560
on everything it could possibly be used on, right?

1228
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,200
And they want to come out of the gate flawlessly.

1229
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,560
Even though they're very aware, and they told me this,

1230
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,960
they're very aware that they could have hazardly released

1231
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,740
something on one distribution, and maybe everything

1232
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,240
doesn't work.

1233
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,820
And they know the community will make it work, right?

1234
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,400
But that's not how they want to do it.

1235
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,680
They want to come out of the gate flawlessly.

1236
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,200
And one other aspect of this is that the conversation isn't

1237
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,200
just about developing Premiere Pro.

1238
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,160
And I think that a lot of people in the Linux community

1239
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,000
think, why not just do that, right?

1240
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,520
That can't take a lot of resources.

1241
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,360
It can't take a lot of time.

1242
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,880
But Adobe's issue is that their users

1243
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,480
are tapping into their entire ecosystem, right?

1244
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,640
They have a workflow that normally extends

1245
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,580
beyond just a single Adobe app.

1246
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,200
Well, yeah, people want the whole Creative Cloud, don't they?

1247
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,700
Exactly.

1248
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,120
And so that is bringing the entire Creative Cloud

1249
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,640
is what seemed to me to be a monumental effort.

1250
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,880
And they just don't want their products

1251
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,160
coming onto Linux handicapped and kind of robbing users

1252
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,320
of what they've come to expect from their products, right?

1253
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:24,640
And another wrinkle to this is that, obviously, they

1254
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,240
want to achieve some levels of parity

1255
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,400
when we're talking about performance, right?

1256
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,360
They want to have parity between Mac OS and Windows

1257
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,440
and Linux.

1258
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,040
But that's only half the story.

1259
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,280
If all the third-party libraries don't support the format,

1260
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,960
having that great performance is kind of useless.

1261
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,280
So it really is that entire ecosystem

1262
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,600
that has to start coming together.

1263
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,280
Yeah, suddenly this becomes quite a large endeavor,

1264
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,480
sort of almost too much to take on.

1265
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,920
Yeah, but yes.

1266
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,920
I mean, yes.

1267
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,600
And they did have a lot of interesting things

1268
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,080
to say about enterprise.

1269
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,800
I mean, not in a lot of detail, but that's

1270
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,960
where they would focus first.

1271
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,240
I will tell you that.

1272
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,520
That's where Adobe would focus first is the enterprise.

1273
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,640
But here's what's really interesting.

1274
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,600
The path to having these Adobe products on Linux,

1275
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,800
where do you think that would happen?

1276
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,400
Would it be just a straight port,

1277
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,040
or is there something actually coming that would kind of get

1278
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,120
their foot in the door?

1279
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,240
What do you mean by something coming?

1280
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,080
I mean, I would assume that the path to getting it on Linux

1281
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,640
would be snaps, essentially, or possibly Flatpak.

1282
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,600
Yeah, and I don't have an argument for or against that.

1283
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,360
But I think when we're talking about the architecture

1284
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,160
and the development and just the knowledge

1285
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,320
that their engineers and developers need,

1286
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,760
it's actually Premiere Rush.

1287
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,400
All right.

1288
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,280
So Premiere Rush, as probably you guys know,

1289
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,280
is kind of a mobile lite version of Premiere Pro.

1290
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,840
And it's already on desktop.

1291
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,800
It's already on iOS.

1292
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,560
But it was strongly hinted to me that once it

1293
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,840
comes to Android this year, that is their kind of first step.

1294
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,040
Oh, right.

1295
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,800
Interesting.

1296
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,160
And I wish I could tell you more,

1297
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,560
but that's really all that I know.

1298
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,320
I can just tell you that the way that they were explaining it

1299
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,200
to me and the kind of the attitude

1300
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,800
that they were portraying and the enthusiasm,

1301
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,880
don't take this as the gospel truth or anything.

1302
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,520
But I really feel like once this hits Android,

1303
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,360
it's something that they can legitimately start to explore.

1304
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,600
Did the market share issue come up at all?

1305
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,800
That must be in their mind.

1306
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,800
It really didn't.

1307
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,880
And I don't know if that's just because they

1308
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,880
were trying to be polite.

1309
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,080
And I also didn't bring it up.

1310
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,640
I was really encouraged walking away from that conversation

1311
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,480
because they don't view bringing their products to Linux,

1312
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,240
they don't see it as a technical barrier.

1313
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,600
They know how to get there.

1314
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,360
And I think the larger issue for them

1315
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:10,400
is having some reassurance that all of the effort

1316
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,800
that they invest into it, into not just Premier Pro,

1317
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,880
but the entire Creative Cloud suite,

1318
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:20,480
into the testing and scaling for every distribution

1319
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,960
and making sure that the entire ecosystem is working as it

1320
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,960
should on other major operating systems,

1321
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,680
it's encouraging to me that they know all that

1322
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,480
and that they are, in the process of developing

1323
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,520
Premier Rush for Android, kind of hinting at the fact

1324
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,320
that it helps them with potential Linux development.

1325
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,080
I was really happy walking away from that

1326
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,480
because it wasn't a lot of the Linux community, at least

1327
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,960
who's that has interacted with me about this whole Adobe

1328
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,920
thing, they feel like Adobe is just giving them lip service.

1329
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,440
Like, we're going to get your hopes up

1330
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,040
and we'll do this poll and we'll make you think it's possible

1331
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,160
and then we're just going to slam the door shut in your face.

1332
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,960
And that may have been true in the past,

1333
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,680
but I genuinely don't believe that's true now.

1334
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,400
And I think it's something they're at least open to

1335
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:16,200
and it's just a matter of resources and time.

1336
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,680
And market share probably, let's be honest.

1337
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,920
Yeah, yeah.

1338
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,700
Well, it'll be very interesting to see what happens with it,

1339
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,960
whether or not it is just lip service,

1340
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,080
but hopefully you'll be clued into what's happening

1341
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,080
and you can maybe come back and let us know.

1342
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,480
But it's been great to have you on

1343
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,400
and very much look forward to speaking to you again sometime.

1344
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,280
Yeah, absolutely.

1345
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,120
Thanks, Joe.

1346
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,600
Yes, thank you, Mr. Joe.

1347
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,760
That was a great contribution and a great interview

1348
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,520
with Jason.

1349
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,920
You know, he's been doing a lot of great writing these days

1350
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,320
and he's definitely a friend of the network.

1351
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,680
Yeah, could you tell that I'd only just woken up

1352
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,040
and it was still daylight?

1353
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,120
You know, I wasn't going to bring that up and no,

1354
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,200
actually, I don't think I could tell, so good job.

1355
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,200
It was a good chat and yeah, he's a very interesting guy.

1356
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,480
And yeah, I definitely recommend checking out his articles

1357
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,320
on Forbes.

1358
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,200
He's always got a positive spin on everything.

1359
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,040
That is actually what I was,

1360
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,000
I have a question for you about it,

1361
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,400
but that was going to be my takeaway from that interview

1362
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,200
is all right, well, there's nothing concrete there.

1363
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,520
Nothing's changed really,

1364
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,920
but it's also not a bad thing, you know?

1365
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,280
I mean, obviously Adobe runs a massive cloud platform.

1366
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,160
They clearly deploy a lot of Linux servers

1367
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,840
and have a wide array of technical experts at their employees.

1368
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,360
So of course they know about Linux,

1369
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,640
but it's nice to hear that there's not this like horrible bias

1370
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,400
or rejection or just, you know,

1371
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,880
like developers being tired of hearing this like

1372
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,080
very vocal minority of people clamor for support.

1373
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,520
So it seems like there's a positive relationship

1374
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,560
we can actually build on here

1375
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,920
and it might not be anything soon,

1376
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,040
but there are professionals who use Linux.

1377
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,560
Yeah, it does feel like it's going to be medium term

1378
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,520
rather than short term,

1379
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,120
but they are clued into the fact

1380
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,360
that Linux users do want to use their software,

1381
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,040
do want to pay them money.

1382
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,960
And as Windows and Mac OS seems to get worse and worse,

1383
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,040
and Linux seems to get better and better,

1384
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,960
then you never know,

1385
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,200
maybe we'll get that critical mass of users

1386
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,880
and maybe they will pull the trigger on it.

1387
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,720
Right, and I mean,

1388
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,440
they already have to adapt to a changing marketplace.

1389
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,360
Well, you know, Windows and Mac might still dominate

1390
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,120
the creative design markets.

1391
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,560
And mobile is huge, right?

1392
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,840
It's eating the desktop market share all the time.

1393
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,240
So they've already worked on some stuff for that platform.

1394
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,080
So I've talked to a couple of people inside Adobe as well.

1395
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:37,160
And they're actually, that platform is surprisingly modular.

1396
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,080
They have a lot of high level code and infrastructure

1397
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,320
to sort of orchestrate on top.

1398
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,080
So it was interesting to hear Jason talk about

1399
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,320
that the technicals aren't the problem

1400
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,960
and that it comes down to something like, you know,

1401
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,320
not wanting to cripple the product,

1402
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,000
wanting to have a good reputation.

1403
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,240
That's a very business sort of concern

1404
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,640
that I think sometimes we in the open source world

1405
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,480
forget about.

1406
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,960
Yeah, it is all about dollars and cents

1407
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,880
at the end of the day, isn't it?

1408
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,720
Right, I mean, I guess it has to be

1409
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,040
because that's what keeps the whole thing going.

1410
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,360
And clearly there's a lot of people

1411
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,480
who use and rely on their products.

1412
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,400
So I can't blame them.

1413
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,640
Time will tell.

1414
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,840
Maybe go try some free and open source software

1415
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,000
and submit bug reports

1416
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,880
and see if you can make them a little bit better.

1417
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,720
Yep.

1418
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,400
All right, do you want to hear about my toy then?

1419
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,400
Yes, I do.

1420
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,400
We teased it a little bit at the top of the show.

1421
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,920
You were very gracious despite being woken up early

1422
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,360
by this delivery of something you've been expecting

1423
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,840
for quite some time, I believe.

1424
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,680
What did you get?

1425
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,520
Yeah, I've been wanting this for quite some time

1426
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,480
and finally sorted it out.

1427
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,040
This is an Entraware Apollo laptop.

1428
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,720
Now I have to say quickly, full disclosure,

1429
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,000
Entraware do sponsor my other show,

1430
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,600
my independent show, Late Night Linux,

1431
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,800
but this will be completely unbiased.

1432
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,920
I can't do a full review

1433
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,280
because I've only had it for a matter of hours

1434
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,440
and I did go back to sleep briefly today as well.

1435
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,840
So.

1436
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,120
You deserve to, you deserve to.

1437
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,880
Yeah, I haven't had much time with it.

1438
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,000
So it's really just first impressions.

1439
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,400
But I'm pretty pleased with it so far.

1440
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,840
Turning it on straight away,

1441
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,040
the screen was just super bright, super sharp.

1442
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,840
And yeah, really, really impressed.

1443
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,440
This is their 14 inch Ultrabook

1444
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,320
that I'm talking about here called Apollo.

1445
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,600
Right, okay, so Chris had an Apollo as well

1446
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,040
and I've used that somewhat extensively,

1447
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:28,760
but is this right, that was a 13 inch screen size,

1448
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,760
but the form factor hasn't actually changed?

1449
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,240
Yeah, it's the same chassis, but smaller bezels.

1450
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,480
Oh, I like it.

1451
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,120
Yeah, so they've squeezed that 14 inch screen into it

1452
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,280
and that gives you that extra little bit of real estate.

1453
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,960
It's 1080p, we're not talking about crazy 4K or anything.

1454
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,680
And on a 14 inch screen,

1455
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,960
do you really need any more than 1080p? I certainly don't.

1456
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,760
No, no, I mean, I think you probably need a bigger screen

1457
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,600
if you're gonna really leverage those resolutions,

1458
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,480
but some people like it.

1459
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,560
And you've seen, even on some of the low end Mac products,

1460
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,160
some pretty high resolutions.

1461
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,720
Yeah, well, there are some bad sides to this.

1462
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,480
It's got USB-C, but that is not Thunderbolt.

1463
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,960
So there's no external graphics to be had.

1464
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,240
But then again, I'm not gonna go buy

1465
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,160
an external enclosure and a graphics card.

1466
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,840
If I want a serious graphics card,

1467
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,040
I'll put it in my desktop machine.

1468
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,880
Thank you very much.

1469
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,520
This is supposed to be light and portable.

1470
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,880
Was that a dig at Mr. Martin Wimpress

1471
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,320
on a day that he's not here?

1472
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,960
Well, I just don't really understand

1473
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,840
why you would use that.

1474
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,480
If you're tethered to a desk and an external screen anyway,

1475
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,080
why not just use a proper desktop machine?

1476
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,320
I don't understand all this Thunderbolt business,

1477
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,000
but I know some people are into it.

1478
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,880
And storage as well, obviously,

1479
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,800
is gonna be faster over Thunderbolt.

1480
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,120
But it has got some full size old school USB,

1481
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,200
although they are 3.1, so that's nice.

1482
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,800
And it's got DisplayPort and full size HDMI

1483
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,040
and an SD card slot and gigabit ethernet.

1484
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,320
You don't often get that these days on an ultrabook.

1485
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,640
And that's important when you have

1486
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,760
a lot of WAV files to upload.

1487
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,920
Yeah, exactly.

1488
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,240
And it's also got a headphone jack,

1489
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,600
which you can't really take for granted these days,

1490
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,440
can you?

1491
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,280
No, you have to check.

1492
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,120
It's a little awkward.

1493
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,000
It's sort of like trying to be like, what's going on here?

1494
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,040
You're holding it up to the light.

1495
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,400
Oh yeah, there it is.

1496
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,000
Okay, so there's some questions in the IRC

1497
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,840
I just have to ask.

1498
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,680
As someone who has used one but never bought one,

1499
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,520
is this just a rebadged Clevo?

1500
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,040
What's going on with Entryware?

1501
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,120
Well, Clevo is the ODM,

1502
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:33,280
but there are some less scrupulous vendors,

1503
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,320
resellers, you might say, who just buy Clevo stuff

1504
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,960
and then just sell it.

1505
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,920
Whereas what Entryware does is they very carefully

1506
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,400
select the parts.

1507
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,600
It's a Clevo chassis,

1508
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,400
but they make sure that the parts

1509
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,920
that they're putting inside this thing

1510
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,680
actually are going to work with Linux properly.

1511
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,000
And they also make sure that the firmware

1512
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,360
and everything's working.

1513
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,360
And that's why there are some vendors

1514
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,320
who punt out the new Clevo machines quite quickly

1515
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,960
without fully testing this firmware stuff.

1516
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,400
Whereas Entryware sometimes wait a little bit

1517
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,960
and make sure that everything is going to work.

1518
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,040
And that was my first impression of it with Ubuntu.

1519
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,120
Okay, I don't really like GNOME.

1520
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:21,480
I think it's fair to say, but it worked perfectly.

1521
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,160
Everything worked as you should.

1522
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,440
It was a very good experience.

1523
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,720
It was very much a stock Ubuntu installation.

1524
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:31,960
It wasn't long before I put Xubuntu on it, obviously.

1525
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,040
But from what I saw of the Ubuntu installation,

1526
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,520
it was very stock and everything just worked perfectly.

1527
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,920
And with Xubuntu as well, so far, so good.

1528
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,160
I've not come into any problems at all.

1529
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,440
See, that's a really good point

1530
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,160
because there aren't that many ODMs in the world.

1531
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,680
And so really whatever you buy,

1532
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,800
you're just hoping that the person who assembled it

1533
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,120
did a good job of choosing equivalent parts.

1534
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:55,760
So if you've got a little bit of a guarantee

1535
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,600
that, oh, well, the people who sold me this

1536
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,320
are at least aware that Linux is a thing.

1537
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,640
And in this case, actually optimize for it.

1538
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,600
Well, it might not be the fanciest.

1539
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,800
It might not have the smallest bezels,

1540
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,760
but it'll run Ubuntu.

1541
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,800
Yeah, someone's asking about a suspend in the IRC.

1542
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,720
I've never suspended a laptop.

1543
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,080
Once you've got an NVMe drive in there,

1544
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,240
it boots so quickly that there's just no need to suspend it.

1545
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,400
Oh, really?

1546
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,520
See, that's funny.

1547
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,720
I feel like I used to have that.

1548
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,280
That was my workflow for a long time,

1549
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,920
but now I just close my laptop lid and forget about it.

1550
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,760
I don't know.

1551
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,440
I just like to have it either on or off.

1552
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,960
I mean, it's not secure.

1553
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,120
It's not, you know, that's totally reasonable.

1554
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,000
And it's nice to actually reboot your machine,

1555
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,800
that your update didn't work anything, all of those things.

1556
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,720
I'm just surprised.

1557
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,960
I'm so used to, I just don't even,

1558
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,160
it goes probably weeks without rebooting.

1559
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1560
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,160
I reboot my machines all the time

1561
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,640
because now that storage is so fast,

1562
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,040
this thing, you turn it on,

1563
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,040
and before you've even taken a sip of your drink,

1564
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,160
it's booted.

1565
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,000
So, you know, that's the same with all modern machines

1566
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,640
with decent storage in them.

1567
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,840
So for me, suspend's just not really a thing anymore.

1568
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,800
The nice part too is if you don't reboot

1569
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,120
all the time, then you forget what you have to do

1570
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,320
when you reboot, maybe adding SSH keys

1571
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:12,080
or entering permissions or re-logging into something.

1572
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,200
And of course, the moment that you have rebooted

1573
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,720
is probably the time that you really didn't want to.

1574
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,200
Yeah, exactly.

1575
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,840
One nice thing about this is it's got a 2.5 bay as well.

1576
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,800
So if you want to put spinning rust in it

1577
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:26,640
or a larger SATA SSD, you can do that.

1578
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,440
I'm not going to do that, I don't think.

1579
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,800
I've got a 500 gig Samsung SSD NVME in there,

1580
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,520
which I think will do me for now.

1581
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,720
But it's good to know that I've got that option

1582
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,680
if I want to.

1583
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,520
Yeah, right.

1584
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,760
That's something that you always want to look for is,

1585
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:41,880
is this serviceable?

1586
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,800
Will it have a lifetime?

1587
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,360
Can I upgrade it when I want and need to?

1588
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:49,400
Now, most users might not, but in our audience, well,

1589
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,920
that's a great way to get more life out of your machine.

1590
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,040
Yeah, well, as for upgrading it, it's really, really easy.

1591
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,120
It's like 10 screws or something.

1592
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,520
And then the bottom just comes off

1593
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,440
and it supports up to 32 gigs of RAM, which is really nice.

1594
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,240
So you can get all the VMs essentially running on it.

1595
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,480
It's easy to take that for granted.

1596
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,080
I mean, I've owned several laptops

1597
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,640
where you have to take the whole main board out before you can

1598
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,840
even get to the hard drive.

1599
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,040
So the fact that it's 10 screws and, you know,

1600
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,880
Bob's Joggle, great.

1601
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,480
Yeah, you can upgrade both storage and the RAM.

1602
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,680
It's very user serviceable.

1603
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,600
And you could even swap out the fan and stuff

1604
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,760
if you wanted to, you know, down the line

1605
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,880
if anything goes wrong with that.

1606
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,320
So yeah, pretty impressed with it so far.

1607
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,800
But yeah, I can't really say that I've

1608
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,000
lived with it long enough, so maybe I'll

1609
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,800
have to give you an update at some point.

1610
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:41,080
Is this going to become a distro review machine or just

1611
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,440
a mobile workstation for you?

1612
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,560
No, very much not.

1613
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,840
It means that my old, old laptop is

1614
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,000
going to become the full-time distro review machine.

1615
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,880
This is very much production.

1616
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,360
I've got my main desktop for main production,

1617
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:58,000
but this is my take to Linux Fest Northwest machine.

1618
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,800
And so it'll be probably Zubon 2, you said?

1619
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,040
Yeah, yeah, Zubon 2.

1620
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,680
No, no deviance there.

1621
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,560
All right, that makes perfect sense.

1622
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,240
Thank you for that mini preview of the intro.

1623
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,640
I'm sure we're going to find out a lot more as you actually

1624
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,440
use this machine.

1625
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,840
I'll be curious to give it a hands-on look when

1626
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,840
I get to see you at Linux Fest Northwest.

1627
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,800
That's a great chance.

1628
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,000
We should just talk about Linux Fest Northwest.

1629
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,680
It's their 20th anniversary this year.

1630
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,840
And if you've never gone before, it's a great time to go.

1631
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,680
We've got links to all of that and everything

1632
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:31,800
we talked about today, linuxunplugged.com

1633
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,360
slash 283.

1634
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,800
Now, Joe, I'm just ever so grateful that you came and hung

1635
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,360
out here with us today.

1636
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,080
Where can the audience go to find more of you?

1637
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:44,600
Well, Linux Action News is a good one,

1638
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,320
linuxactionnews.com and error.show.

1639
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,840
If you want to listen to User Error,

1640
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,640
that's me and Popey and Dan from elementary talking

1641
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,400
about life, the universe, and everything,

1642
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,320
and a bit of Linux chucked in there.

1643
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,520
So yeah, check those two out.

1644
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,440
And also, lateknightlinux.com.

1645
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,040
If you want to hear me effing and blinding,

1646
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,200
effing and a jeffing.

1647
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,160
And you almost always do.

1648
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,720
Thank you to our wonderful Mumble Room, as always.

1649
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,920
And of course, the IRC and everyone else

1650
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,560
in the Jupyter Broadcasting community,

1651
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,440
linuxunplugged.com slash contact if you

1652
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,520
want to send us some of your favorite things,

1653
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,600
either interesting finds, questions, or just

1654
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,800
your comments and feedback.

1655
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,400
We love it all.

1656
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,240
For all the other Jupyter Broadcasting shows,

1657
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,800
go to JupyterBroadcasting.com.

1658
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,800
Thank you so much for joining us.

1659
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,840
We're going to get out of here, but don't worry.

1660
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,920
There's lots of good stuff to look forward to.

1661
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,440
I'm always excited about the next User Error release.

1662
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:37,360
Just let me say, Joe.

1663
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,320
So good job.

1664
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,800
Thank you for joining us.

1665
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,720
And I think we're going to see you next Tuesday.

1666
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,200
Come on, Wes.

1667
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,000
You can do better than that.

1668
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:46,880
Next Tuesday.

1669
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,080
Yeah, you're right.

1670
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:48,640
Tuesday!

1671
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:55,160
Hey!

1672
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:32,740
So, I just got my father an iPad, mostly so he could read some, like, journalism, you

1673
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:39,700
know, various apps from bigger newspapers than his tiny, dying hometown newspaper.

1674
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:43,780
And he used, like, a Windows, oh, I don't know, was it an XP machine?

1675
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:46,420
I don't know, whatever his, before he retired, right?

1676
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:50,080
And so he has this very particular interface with computers, and I've got, I've got my

1677
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:54,800
mom on Linux now, and part of me wonders, he might just actually take to the command

1678
01:08:54,800 --> 01:09:01,440
line, because it's sort of a conversation, and less of an exploration visually.

1679
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,400
And so, like, but Bash is kind of arcane, and if you know what you're doing with Bash

1680
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:11,040
or CSH or really any shell, you can obviously configure most of the stuff that you find.

1681
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,560
But with Phish, it just, like, it really is friendly, and that friendly only goes so far,

1682
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:20,760
and once you're an expert, you probably don't care about friendly, but for new users, like,

1683
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:24,400
if you first got a Phish shell and then you learned Bash, there's probably a lot of Bash

1684
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,080
things that you would think were so silly.

1685
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:31,920
Don't you find that Phish kind of does things by itself too much, though?

1686
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,520
At least with Bash, you type stuff in, you press enter, okay, you've got tab completion,

1687
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,480
but if you don't know about that, you're not going to get it, whereas you start typing

1688
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,880
and then just things happen, and you're like, it's a bit scary for people who don't know

1689
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,880
what they're doing.

1690
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,680
Okay, I can see that.

1691
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,040
You probably do need, in, like, a basic introduction, you probably do need a little bit about that.

1692
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,440
Like, you probably have to touch on that feature.

1693
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:57,060
It feels like, to me, you have to have used Bash and have some vague understanding of

1694
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,760
how it works before you could use Phish.

1695
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,880
I guess I could see that with the very, very present autocomplete, I could see that being

1696
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,880
confusing.

1697
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:06,880
Yeah.

1698
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:12,760
But I wonder if you started off from a blank shell, like, with no autocomplete history,

1699
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,320
and if it would make more sense that it would, like, if it was only commands that they had

1700
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,640
typed that got suggested to them again, if that would be better.

1701
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,640
I don't know.

1702
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,160
It'd be an interesting experience in user experience research.

1703
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,160
Yeah.

1704
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,760
I can't see many companies putting money into that, though, unfortunately.

1705
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,640
No, no, that's exactly what I was thinking.

1706
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:43,480
No one's, no one's wondering that.
